6975,opencast mining operations frequently lead to the creation of large voids that become anthropogenic lakes when the water table recovers in the case of sulfide mining the stored water is of an acidic nature with significant concentrations of toxic metals and therefore a high pollutant potential the main goal of the present work is to characterize the hydrological functioning and evolution of four acidic mine pit lakes in the abandoned mines of tharsis which is the second most important mine district in the iberian pyrite belt ipb we present a simple methodology based on the use of the available orthophotographs and a digital terrain model dtm together with the water balance of the pit lakes which could be applied to other abandoned mining sites where there is often a lack of hydrogeological information that prevents the application of more complex models the accumulation of large volumes 5 2 106 m3 of acidic and metal rich waters in these pit lakes poses a serious environmental concern with dissolved concentrations up to 2000 mg l of fe 223 mg l of al etc sierra bullones and filón norte are connected underground and present the same evolution with water transfers from sierra bullones to filón norte the water level in both pit lakes is increasing with an average rise of 2 8 m yr since the beginning of flooding however the increase in the evaporation rate as a result of the larger flooded area as the water level rise would induce a hydrological equilibrium before reaching the overflow level leading to the formation of a terminal lake on the other hand the water level in filón centro and filón sur pit lakes remain approximately stable the first behaves as a flow through or terminal lake depending on the annual rainfall while the second acts permanently as a flow through lake keywords water level evolution acid mine drainage metal pollution water management water balance 1 introduction mine closure constitutes one of the biggest environmental problems worldwide younger et al 2002 sarmiento et al 2009 robles arenas and candela 2010 in surface mining large open pits are created the cease of pumping once mining activities end generally leads to the progressive flooding of the open pits generating pit lakes the hydrological equilibrium of the pit lake is achieved when water inputs are equal to losses by evaporation or when overflows are produced on the surface and in subterranean areas generating a discharge of polluted water to rivers or aquifers the release of these waters can pose substantial environmental concerns davis and ashenberg 1989 savage et al 2000 castendyk 2011 castendyk et al 2015a b boehrer et al 2016 in the case of sulfide mining the problem is worse because pit lakes usually store acidic waters with extreme concentrations of toxic metals sánchez españa et al 2008 cánovas et al 2015 that are of a high pollutant potential nordstrom et al 2015 the iberian pyrite belt ipb is one of the biggest polymetallic sulfide deposits in the world the intense mining activity mainly developed during the second half of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries has left an impressive environmental legacy with large amounts of widespread mine wastes which have an important impact on the tinto and odiel rivers due to acid mine drainage amd processes see for example sánchez españa et al 2005 cánovas et al 2016 olías et al 2016 as a consequence of the ceased mining at the end of the twentieth century there are 22 flooded open pits in the spanish part of the ipb sánchez españa et al 2008 most of these pit lakes contain acidic water and lack management or control plans although the hydrogeochemical and limnological properties of some of these pit lakes have been previously studied sánchez españa et al 2008 santofimia and lópez pamo 2013 cánovas et al 2015 some of them have not achieved equilibrium and their hydrological connections are not well understood sánchez españa et al 2014 this information is of paramount importance to foresee their evolution to plan potential remediation measures and to avoid potential environmental risks this issue is especially relevant for the tharsis mine complex which constitutes one of the most important exploitations of the ipb this derelict district hosts five open pits four of which are partially flooded by acidic waters sánchez españa et al 2008 in addition there is a surface of around 3 6 km2 covered by mine wastes that generate acidic leachates as a consequence main water bodies in the drainage basin are deeply polluted cánovas et al 2017 some of the acidic leachates generated in the tharsis mine complex join the meca river which feeds the sancho reservoir 58 106 m3 the sancho reservoir has suffered a progressive acidification in recent years and it is considered to be one of the more extreme cases of surface water pollution worldwide cánovas et al 2016 a large reservoir 246 106 m3 is currently under construction to receive the acidic leachates from the tharsis mine complex olías et al 2011 if additional leachates were generated from existing pit lakes the water quality of local streams and reservoirs would worsen the water quality of the pit lake depends on the balance between the acidity and alkalinity inputs into the lake together with the neutralization processes in the water column blodau 2006 castendyk et al 2015b there are currently several models that use information from these processes to predict the final water quality after mining cessation oldham et al 2009 vandenberg et al 2011 geller et al 2013 castendyk et al 2015b however to implement these models a detailed knowledge of the hydrogeological characteristics of pit lakes and their surroundings is needed while active mines can be well characterized there is a lack of information on abandoned mine sites as tharsis that prevents the application of such models based on the concerns described above the main goals of the present work are 1 to analyze the flooding evolution of the pit lakes of the tharsis mine complex from the available orthophotographs and a digital terrain model dtm 2 to preliminarily assess the hydrogeochemical characteristics of the pit lakes and the amount of stored pollutants 3 to obtain a conceptual model of the hydrological behavior of the pit lakes and perform a water balance of each system and 4 to predict the evolution of these pit lakes in the long term this information is critical to identifying and adopting cost effective measures to mitigate the impact of acidic waters in local receiving water bodies 2 site description the tharsis mining complex has a mediterranean climate with an average yearly precipitation close to 600 mm but it exhibits high intra and inter annual variability galván et al 2009 average temperatures in the area are close to 16 5 c summers are hot and dry with maximum temperatures close to 40 c while winters are humid and cold minimum temperatures lower than 0 c the most important water courses are the aguas agrias creek which joins the oraque river feeding the alcolea projected reservoir to the east and the meca river which is located in the south and is regulated by the sancho reservoir fig 1 the ipb is a part of the south portuguese zone of the hercynian iberian massif which extends from the western part of spain to the portuguese atlantic coast approximately 200 km long and 40 km wide and consists of three lithologic units the phyllite quartzite group pq the volcano sedimentary complex vsc and the culm group cg the pq group consists of a thick sequence of slates and sandstones of upper devonian age the materials of the vsc upper devonian lower carboniferous age are composed of a volcanic sequence with a variable thickness up to 1300 m tornos 2006 and alternating episodes of felsic rocks dacites and in lower proportion rhyolites and mafic rocks occurring as basaltic sills or small stocks intercalated in a sedimentary sequence mainly phyllites this sequence presents abrupt changes due to the intrusive character of some igneous rocks the abundance of thrust defining the major contacts and the existence of several palaeogeographic domains tornos 2006 the vsc hosts numerous sulphides deposits finally the cg is a detrital unit of synorogenic turbidites of up to 3000 m thick which basically consists of shales and conglomerates of carboniferous age the materials of the ipb has been considered of low permeability and do not constitute aquifer units of importance nevertheless the thrust limits and fractured zones must be locally more permeable in the tharsis area the structure is defined by four major south dipping tectonic units limited by thrusts with different lithological and hydrothermal features tornos et al 2009 1 slates and sandstones of the pq group interpreted as a para autochthonous group overlied by the other units 2 the lower unit including the massive sulphides and slates 3 the intermediate unit made by slates intruded by basalts with bodies of hydrothermal breccias and 4 the upper unit composed of rhyodacite sills intruding slates there is no available data about the hydrogeological characteristics hydraulic conductivity storage coefficient etc of these materials paleozoic rocks from the ipb are characterized by a low permeability the hydraulic conductivities are around 10 9 m s gómez de las heras et al 2001 nevertheless these values can increase due to the existence of faults diaclases etc thus at the aznalcóllar mine zone values between 9 10 9 and 10 5 m s are found gómez de las heras et al 2001 also mining labors in the vicinity of pits promote an increase the permeability of such materials by fracturing cánovas et al 2018 original sulfide reserves in the tharsis mine complex are estimated to be around 133 mt tornos et al 2009 mining in the ipb started around 5 000 years ago during the chalcolithic nocete et al 2005 after a period of inactivity mining restarted during the tartessian and roman periods gonzalo y tarín 1888 afterwards a long period of low mining activity continued until 1856 when the mine was rediscovered deligny 1863 and underground mining was performed mainly by room and pillars in filón norte sierra bullones filón centro and filón sur fig 1 opencast mining started in 1866 in filón norte and some years later in sierra bullones and filón centro gonzalo y tarín 1888 mining in filón centro and filón norte ceased in 1884 and 1890 respectively and focused on mineral exploitation in sierra bullones by both opencast and underground mining since the beginning of the twentieth century sulfur from pyrite was obtained to produce sulfuric acid however a new processing method was developed in filón sur from 1937 to 1964 to extract au and ag from the gossan checkland 1967 in the mid twentieth century mining was restarted in filón centro leading to an increase in the open pit around 1960 a new period of exploitation in the filón norte open pit also began mining ceased in sierra bullones in 1966 after 100 years of intense exploitation while filón norte mining finished at the end of the 90s the last mining activities developed in the tharsis mine complex were performed in filón sur from 1990 to 2001 to obtain au and ag by cyanide leaching of the gossan from 1856 to 2001 approximately 40 mt of sulfide were obtained tornos et al 2009 approximately 17 mt were obtained up to 1960 mainly from sierra bullones pinedo vara 1963 while the rest were obtained mainly from filón norte during the last 40 years of exploitation about 5 mt of mineral must be added to these figures from mining developed during the roman and pre roman periods gonzalo y tarín 1888 3 methodology 3 1 water level and total volume stored in the pit lakes due to the absence of water level records in order to estimate the flooding evolution of the pit lakes digital terrain models dtm for 1998 with a horizontal resolution of 20 m 20 m and 2001 2002 with a horizontal resolution of 10 m 10 m from the andalusia regional government were used together with available orthophotographs july 1998 october 2002 august 2004 october 2005 may 2007 may 2009 august 2011 may 2013 and july 2016 aerial photographs prior to these periods were also looked at to check the flooding status of the pit lakes the following methodology was applied with the software arcgis 1 the flooded surface was estimated from orthophotographs for each pit lake 2 the relationship between the altitude and pit surface was estimated by dtms which allowed the water level to be established from the flooded surface and 3 the volume of stored water was calculated from the dtms using the arcgis surface volume tool as the volume below the plane determined by the water level obtained in the previous step filón centro and filón sur open pits were already flooded when the dtms were made thus its topography below the water level is not represented by the dtms to estimate the stored water in both pit lakes water depths of 45 and 5 m were considered for filón centro and filón sur respectively according to data provided by sánchez españa et al 2008 as the same depth was assumed in all the pit lakes these estimations may show some uncertainties 3 2 water balance in the pit lakes daily precipitation was obtained from a rainfall gauge located close to the studied pit lakes fig 1 evaporation was calculated from the equation of penman 1948 1 ev δ r a d n γ e a δ γ where ev is evaporation from a free surface mm day δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve kpa c γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c radn is the net daily radiation at the water surface mm day and ea mm day is the aerodynamic component depending on the average daily wind speed and vapor pressure deficit the detailed estimation procedure is described by allen et al 1998 the information required to apply eq 1 that is the latitude height above sea level and daily data for maximum and minimum temperatures maximum and minimum values of relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation were obtained from a meteorological station located 12 km to the west of the tharsis mine complex the water balance in the pit lakes was estimated from rainfall data runoff data evaporation data and the difference in water volume obtained between orthophotographs water inputs to the pit lakes were estimated by considering the runoff generated in the drainage basin and the direct precipitation on the pit lake surface this latter value was obtained by multiplying the rainfall collected between consecutive orthophotographs by the average flooded surface at the beginning and the end of the period as follows 2 d r n r n a f n a f n 1 2 where drn are the water inputs by direct rainfall during the period n m3 rn is the precipitation during the period n m and afn and afn 1 are the flooded surfaces during the period n and n 1 m2 the runoff generated was obtained by multiplying the precipitation collected between the times of the consecutive orthophotographs by the total surface of the drainage basin 3 qru n n r n a catch a f n a f n 1 2 c where qrunn and rn are the runoff and precipitation amounts during the period n acatch is the drainage basin of each pit lake and afn and afn 1 are the flooded surfaces during periods n and n 1 respectively and c is the runoff coefficient this coefficient was obtained from a hydrological model with the swat code which calculated the daily water balance based on soil type slope land use and weather data galván et al 2009 the model was calibrated and validated against registered daily inflows of the sancho reservoir from 1982 to 2002 the evaluation coefficients for monthly calibration were 0 85 for the pearson s correlation coefficient 0 83 for the nash sutcliffe coefficient and 1 08 for the runoff volume deviation galván et al 2009 values considered very good according to moriasi et al 2007 the sum of eqs 2 and 3 correspond to the surface water input to each pit lake in eq 4 4 i n q r u n n d r n in order to estimate the water losses the amount of evaporation estimated in eq 1 was multiplied by the average flooded surface of each pit lake at the beginning afn 1 and the end of the period afn 5 i n q r u n n d r n where on is the volume of water lost by evaporation during the period n m3 and evn is the evaporation during the period n m in addition groundwater inputs were estimated for each period as the difference between inputs in losses on and the variation of water stored in the pit lake 6 qsu b n i n o n v n v n 1 where qsubn are groundwater inputs during the period n and vn and vn 1 are the volumes of water stored during the periods n and n 1 respectively 3 3 hidrogeochemical data samples of surface water from the pit lakes were taken in 2016 with the exception of sierra bullones which was not accessible samples were collected in high density polyethylene hdpe bottles that were previously washed with a solution of 10 hno3 filtered through 0 45 μm and acidified to ph 2 temperature ph electrical conductivity ec and oxidation reduction potential orp were measured in situ using a crison mm40 multimeter previously calibrated net acidity was also calculated according to kirby and cravotta 2005 considering both the free acidity and that generated by hydrolysable metals fe al mn cu or zn samples were analyzed at the r d laboratories of at the university of huelva by 1 inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy for al cu fe mn s and zn determination and by 2 inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms for as cd co cr ni and pb detection limits were 200 µg l for al fe mn and s 50 µg l for zn 5 µg l for cu and 0 1 µg l for as cd co cr ni and pb the estimations of the acidity sulfates and metal and metaloids stored in the pit lakes were performed by multiplying the volume of water of each pit lake section 3 1 by the corresponding concentration these estimations should be considered only as an approach due to concentration variations in the water column due to vertical stratification were not considered previous works e g sánchez españa et al 2008 reported sharp metal concentration increases in depth due to stratification thus the results obtained must be considered as a minimum value for the pollutant load stored in the pit lakes 4 results and discussion 4 1 current status of the pit lakes and analysis of the flooding evolution the first goal of this work is to analyze the flooding evolution of the pit lakes of the tharsis mine complex since the cease of mining activities this evolution is strongly influenced by rainfalls fig 2 shows the annual evolution of precipitation and evaporation from 1998 to 2016 rainfall distribution exhibited was highly variable with values ranging from 261 to 1 009 mm yr and a mean of 662 mm yr the driest years were 1998 99 2004 05 and 2011 12 while the rainiest were 2000 01 2009 10 and 2010 11 notably values of evaporation exceed those of precipitation average value of 1 699 mm yr in turn showing a lower variability with values ranging from 1530 2013 14 to 1 938 mm 2002 03 except esperanza pit which is partially filled with mine wastes and open to the east the other four open pits are currently flooded the deepest and largest pit is by far filón norte with a total surface area of 0 52 km2 table 1 and the pit with the largest drainage basin is sierra bullones 1 04 km2 filón centro and filón sur have achieved a hydrological equilibrium in the case of filón centro the pit has been flooded since at least 1977 which is the first aerial photograph where the occurrence of water is appreciated while filón sur was dry in 1998 and the flooding turned to be evident from 2002 nevertheless small fluctuations are observed depending on the date when the orthophotograph was acquired with higher values during the rainy season and lower values during the dry season the water level in filón sur ranges from 255 7 to 257 0 m and in filón centro from 258 2 to 258 7 m on the contrary the flooding of filón norte and sierra bullones remains active and the water level altitude was much lower around 185 m in 2016 it can be noted that flooding had not started in both pits in 1998 fig 3 however water in filón norte was evident in 2002 while in sierra bullones was in 2004 since then the water level has risen in both pit lakes increasing the flooded surface and therefore the volume of amd stored the level and volume of water in both pit lakes have been estimated from the dtm and the orthophotographs the evolution of the water level is quite similar in both pit lakes although slightly higher values are observed in sierra bullones this fact must be due to the existence of hydraulic connection between both pit lakes the water level in filón norte has risen around 40 m from 2002 to 2016 which accounts for an average rise of 2 8 m yr it can be also noted that the water level rise was sharper during the first few years and have diminished the last years fig 4 a however the change in water level is influenced by rainfall distribution with higher values of water level rise in rainy periods for example between november 2002 to august 2004 and lower than expected according to the general tendency for dry periods for example june 2007 to may 2009 the volume of stored water shows a tendency that is approximately lineal over the time fig 4b although with some deviations due to the rainfall distribution as previously discussed despite a decrease in the water volume inputs to the pit lake would be expected due to the increase of the water surface exposed to evaporation and the lower groundwater inputs as the hydraulic gradient diminishes the volume of stored water followed a lineal tendency 4 2 preliminary geochemical characterization of waters stored in the pit lakes as commented previously there were 5 2 106 m3 of waters in the different pit lakes in june 2016 most of which 3 59 106 m3 were in filón norte table 1 during flooding waters come into contact with sulfides contained in galleries and pit walls leading to oxidation processes the absence of alkaline materials in the host rocks and the strong water rock interactions with sulfide rich materials forming the galleries and pit walls cause that the stored waters have a high acidity ph of 2 2 2 3 and a net acidity of 3 6 7 1 g caco3 l and concentration of metals and metalloids for example up to 2 053 mg l of fe 228 mg l of zn and 11 mg l of as the most polluted water was that of filón norte table 2 comparing the samplings carried out by sánchez españa et al 2008 the concentrations obtained from filón centro in this study were similar but the concentrations obtained from filón sur and filón norte have diminished substantially for example fe has decreased from 1 922 to 774 mg l in filón sur and from 4 620 to 2 053 mg l in filón norte this is likely related to the fact that filón centro is a stable pit lake at least since 1977 while the other two have not yet reached hydrochemical equilibrium conditions the arrival of less concentrated waters to the pit once the underlying galleries were flooded may have cause such lower concentrations in both pit lakes if compared with other pit lakes found worldwide the concentration of metals e g cu and zn observed in tharsis pit lakes 12 150 mg l of cu and 10 567 mg l of zn are similar to those found in the berkeley pit lake in usa table 3 and higher than those reported in pit lakes from poland sweden or australia in the case of the pit lakes from the ipb metal concentrations found in tharsis are in the same order of magnitude than most pit lakes only in corta atalaya pit lake metal concentrations notably exceed those observed in tharsis the stored mass of pollutants has been calculated from the water volumes in 2016 table 1 and the analyzed concentrations since sierra bullones and filón norte are connected by underground it has been considered that concentrations in both pit lakes are similar the total acidity metal and metalloid load stored in the pit lakes are remarkable e g approximately 32 000 tonnes of caco3 9000 tonnes of fe 1000 tonnes of al and zn and 47 tonnes of as etc table 2 nevertheless in the ipb most of the pit lakes are meromictic with a denser monimolimnion with higher concentrations of pollutants and a mixolimnion with less concentrated waters sánchez españa et al 2008 2014 santofimia et al 2013 cánovas et al 2015 boehrer et al 2016 as these figures have been obtained only from surface waters and vertical stratification processes have not been taken into account the results obtained must be considered as a minimum value for the pollutant load stored in the pit lakes the impact of a potential release of these waters to receiving water bodies can be appreciated comparing these results with the annual load carried by the meca river galván et al 2009 the amount of dissolved fe stored in the pit lakes is around 35 times higher than that annually carried by this river 4 3 water balance and hydrological dynamic of the pit lakes the accumulation of large volumes of highly contaminated waters constitutes a serious risk which could lead to critical environmental impacts for this reason it is of paramount importance to develop a conceptual model of the hydrological behavior of these pit lakes and predict the evolution of each pit lake in the long term this issue will be approached in this section by a detailed case by case analysis 4 3 1 filón centro table 4 shows the water inputs and losses in filón centro the flooded surface area remained approximately constant during the study period approximately 0 036 km2 with the exception of hydrological year of 2004 05 which showed a clearly lower surface area due to the orthophotograph coinciding with the lowest value of precipitation fig 2 the volume of amd stored in the pit lake was around 1 1 106 m3 runoff accounted for more than half of the water inputs into the pit lake whereas the rest corresponded to direct precipitation generally the water losses were slightly higher than inputs which means filón centro may receive hidden inputs from the waste dumps located to the west and from groundwater fig 5 a permanent acidic outflow was identified that arose from the bottom of this waste dump with a flow generally between 0 1 and 0 5 l s the small discharge together the hydrochemical characteristics of the acidic spring sánchez garcía et al 2018 different from the lake indicates that filón centro pit lakes does not discharge regularly through this point and the hidden inputs towards the pit lake must be low however water inputs were higher than losses during the rainy periods from november 2005 to may 2007 and from june 2009 to august 2011 table 4 and water losses may occur through the acidic spring during these periods fig 5a when its discharge can increase up to 12 l s sánchez garcía et al 2018 therefore filón centro would behave as a terminal lake during dry and normal periods and the water rise as a consequence of rainfalls would cause the pit lake to behave as a flow through pit lake fig 5b releasing water through the waste dump to the west 4 3 2 filón sur the drainage basin of filón sur is relatively large 0 29 km2 table 1 while the flooded surface area 0 006 km2 and the volume of stored amd 20 000 m3 were small thus the surface water inputs to the lake were mainly due to runoff table 4 fig 6 water losses by evaporation were noticeably lower than surface inputs as the water level was approximately constant see section 4 1 this pit lake must have hidden water losses these losses were thought to occur through la sabina underground gallery located to the south fig 1 however the water level in the pit lake 257 m is clearly higher than the altitude of la sabina adit fig 6 in addition monitoring in la sabina from the end of 2015 showed evidence of a low average discharge 0 6 l s olías et al 2017 without significant changes in response to rainfalls which is inconsistent with a possible overflow from filón sur fig 6 water exits from filón sur probably occur through an unnoticed derelict gallery constructed to the east at the end of the nineteenth century gonzalo y tarín 1888 this adit can be seen at the surface of the pit lake although the exit toward corta esperanza is likely buried by mine wastes fig 6 during rainy periods water emergences in corta esperanza can be seen which at least partially comes from filón sur these emergences stop flowing a few days after the cessation of the rains suggesting that the contribution of groundwater towards filón sur must be negligible on the other hand cánovas et al 2017 reported that the acidic outflows from the corta esperanza area to be the main amd contributor to the meca river and the sancho reservoir fig 1 with a quick response to rainfalls which could be related to water exits from filón sur 4 3 3 sierra bullones and filón norte the drainage basin of sierra bullones is the largest of the whole pit lakes 1 04 km2 table 1 the runoff generated after rainfalls accounts for around 95 of water inputs to the pit lake table 4 surface water inputs are considerably higher than losses by evaporation due to the small flooded surface area although the latter increases progressively table 4 the difference between water inputs and losses estimated for each period assessed was much higher than the increase of water stored in the pit lake therefore undetected water losses may occur from this pit lake to filón norte through underground galleries fig 7 thus sierra bullones behaves as a flow through pit lake runoff constitutes the main contributor to filón norte pit lake with a drainage basin of 0 60 km2 however as long as the flooded surface increases the percentage of direct precipitation rises table 4 losses by evaporation step up progressively and are linked to the increase in the flooded surface area although some decreases in evaporation can be seen on table 4 because the periods are shorter september 2004 to october 2005 or have a higher proportion of winter days september 2011 to may 2013 thus losses by evaporation are generally lower than surface water inputs during the first flooding stage while the situation reverses in the last periods nevertheless as commented before filón norte must receive unnoticed outflows from sierra bullones groundwater inputs to sierra bullones and filón norte have been estimated from eq 6 these inputs have negative values in sierra bullones which is evidence of the existence of groundwater outputs fig 8 during the first stages of flooding until may 2009 water inputs to filón norte coincide approximately with losses from sierra bullones groundwater inputs to both pit lakes that is the difference between inputs to filón norte and losses to sierra bullones are low however water inputs to filón norte were higher than losses from sierra bullones since 2011 which is evidence of an increase in groundwater flows to the pit lakes the water level rise in the pit lakes should cause a decrease in the hydraulic gradient and thus a corresponding reduction in the groundwater inputs to the lakes marinelli and niccoli 2000 this could be explained by the fill of unknown mining voids groundwater inputs during the first stages of flooding may cause an inundation of these voids resulting in less water entering into the pit lakes as can be seen in fig 4 the water level in filón norte and sierra bullones has been rising progressively the outflow level in filón norte is found to the east of the pit lake at 235 m where a derelict mine tunnel to transport minerals is located fig 7 the maximum water level in sierra bullones is expected to be the same as in filón norte due to both pit lakes being connected underground a hydrogeological model would be needed to reliably predict the flooding evolution of the pit lake which requires detailed information such as piezometric levels radius of influence and horizontal hydraulic conductivity marinelli and niccoli 2000 in addition high resolution measures of these parameters should be obtained due to the high heterogeneity and geological complexity of the area as commented in section 2 as this information is not available a simple approach for estimating the evolution of the water level has been followed for the open pits of both filón norte and sierra bullones it has been assumed that the groundwater inputs are similar to those previously obtained for the most recent period 2013 2016 thus considering average values of annual precipitation and evaporation mm yr it can be estimated that the evaporation of the water surface is necessary to balance the inputs the equilibrium water surface for both open pits turns to be 0 35 km2 corresponding to a water level of 228 5 m which is below the water outflow level 235 m thus both open pits would behave as terminal lakes this calculation must be considered as an approach a monitoring of water levels should be carried out in the future 5 conclusions the mining activities in tharsis from the second part of the nineteenth century to the end of the twentieth century have left as a legacy a great environmental burden including four acidic pit lakes from the dtm and the available orthophotographs the flooding history of the pit lakes has been obtained in 2016 there was stored a volume of 5 2 106 m3 of acidic water containing at least 9000 tonnes of dissolved fe 1000 tonnes of dissolved al and zn etc these pits are hydraulically connected with underground galleries the lack of maintenance labors in these abandoned mine sites could lead to dramatic episodes of contamination in the surrounding water bodies significant differences in the hydrological behavior of the flooded open pits have been established the water level in filón centro and filón sur has reached a stationary state showing slight annual variations the water balance in filón centro provides evidence that this pit lake behaves as a terminal lake during dry and normal periods while during rainy periods it works as a flow through pit lake releasing water through waste dumps located to the west of the lake filón sur receives surface water inputs that are much higher than losses by evaporation thus hidden losses may occur in this pit lake through a derelict gallery to the east significant releases of acidic waters must take place from this pit lake to the receiving water bodies therefore measurements to avoid impacts into the surrounding water bodies should be taken on the other hand the water level in filón norte and sierra bullones is rising an average of 2 8 m yr after the cease of mining at the end of the last century the flooding of both pit lakes follows a similar evolution because underground galleries connect them sierra bullones receives high inputs by runoff much higher than losses by evaporation plus the increments of water stored in the pit lake the water balance provides evidence that losses from sierra bullones are quite similar to water inputs to filón norte up to 2009 however water inputs to filón norte exceed the exits from sierra bullones in recent years which indicate the existence of underground inputs from the surrounding area a simple approach based on the assumption that groundwater inputs remain constant would indicate that losses by evaporation would offset inputs that is runoff direct precipitation and groundwater inputs before reaching the water outflow level nevertheless a mathematical model based on high resolution hydrogeological parameters of the area and a monitoring plan should be implemented in the future the information obtained in this study will allow for more cost effective measures to be adopted mitigating the severe pollution by amd which affects the watercourses of this area in addition the methodology applied in this work could be of great interest for decision makers in other areas affected by abandoned opencast mining acknowledgements this work was supported by the spanish ministry of

6975,opencast mining operations frequently lead to the creation of large voids that become anthropogenic lakes when the water table recovers in the case of sulfide mining the stored water is of an acidic nature with significant concentrations of toxic metals and therefore a high pollutant potential the main goal of the present work is to characterize the hydrological functioning and evolution of four acidic mine pit lakes in the abandoned mines of tharsis which is the second most important mine district in the iberian pyrite belt ipb we present a simple methodology based on the use of the available orthophotographs and a digital terrain model dtm together with the water balance of the pit lakes which could be applied to other abandoned mining sites where there is often a lack of hydrogeological information that prevents the application of more complex models the accumulation of large volumes 5 2 106 m3 of acidic and metal rich waters in these pit lakes poses a serious environmental concern with dissolved concentrations up to 2000 mg l of fe 223 mg l of al etc sierra bullones and filón norte are connected underground and present the same evolution with water transfers from sierra bullones to filón norte the water level in both pit lakes is increasing with an average rise of 2 8 m yr since the beginning of flooding however the increase in the evaporation rate as a result of the larger flooded area as the water level rise would induce a hydrological equilibrium before reaching the overflow level leading to the formation of a terminal lake on the other hand the water level in filón centro and filón sur pit lakes remain approximately stable the first behaves as a flow through or terminal lake depending on the annual rainfall while the second acts permanently as a flow through lake keywords water level evolution acid mine drainage metal pollution water management water balance 1 introduction mine closure constitutes one of the biggest environmental problems worldwide younger et al 2002 sarmiento et al 2009 robles arenas and candela 2010 in surface mining large open pits are created the cease of pumping once mining activities end generally leads to the progressive flooding of the open pits generating pit lakes the hydrological equilibrium of the pit lake is achieved when water inputs are equal to losses by evaporation or when overflows are produced on the surface and in subterranean areas generating a discharge of polluted water to rivers or aquifers the release of these waters can pose substantial environmental concerns davis and ashenberg 1989 savage et al 2000 castendyk 2011 castendyk et al 2015a b boehrer et al 2016 in the case of sulfide mining the problem is worse because pit lakes usually store acidic waters with extreme concentrations of toxic metals sánchez españa et al 2008 cánovas et al 2015 that are of a high pollutant potential nordstrom et al 2015 the iberian pyrite belt ipb is one of the biggest polymetallic sulfide deposits in the world the intense mining activity mainly developed during the second half of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries has left an impressive environmental legacy with large amounts of widespread mine wastes which have an important impact on the tinto and odiel rivers due to acid mine drainage amd processes see for example sánchez españa et al 2005 cánovas et al 2016 olías et al 2016 as a consequence of the ceased mining at the end of the twentieth century there are 22 flooded open pits in the spanish part of the ipb sánchez españa et al 2008 most of these pit lakes contain acidic water and lack management or control plans although the hydrogeochemical and limnological properties of some of these pit lakes have been previously studied sánchez españa et al 2008 santofimia and lópez pamo 2013 cánovas et al 2015 some of them have not achieved equilibrium and their hydrological connections are not well understood sánchez españa et al 2014 this information is of paramount importance to foresee their evolution to plan potential remediation measures and to avoid potential environmental risks this issue is especially relevant for the tharsis mine complex which constitutes one of the most important exploitations of the ipb this derelict district hosts five open pits four of which are partially flooded by acidic waters sánchez españa et al 2008 in addition there is a surface of around 3 6 km2 covered by mine wastes that generate acidic leachates as a consequence main water bodies in the drainage basin are deeply polluted cánovas et al 2017 some of the acidic leachates generated in the tharsis mine complex join the meca river which feeds the sancho reservoir 58 106 m3 the sancho reservoir has suffered a progressive acidification in recent years and it is considered to be one of the more extreme cases of surface water pollution worldwide cánovas et al 2016 a large reservoir 246 106 m3 is currently under construction to receive the acidic leachates from the tharsis mine complex olías et al 2011 if additional leachates were generated from existing pit lakes the water quality of local streams and reservoirs would worsen the water quality of the pit lake depends on the balance between the acidity and alkalinity inputs into the lake together with the neutralization processes in the water column blodau 2006 castendyk et al 2015b there are currently several models that use information from these processes to predict the final water quality after mining cessation oldham et al 2009 vandenberg et al 2011 geller et al 2013 castendyk et al 2015b however to implement these models a detailed knowledge of the hydrogeological characteristics of pit lakes and their surroundings is needed while active mines can be well characterized there is a lack of information on abandoned mine sites as tharsis that prevents the application of such models based on the concerns described above the main goals of the present work are 1 to analyze the flooding evolution of the pit lakes of the tharsis mine complex from the available orthophotographs and a digital terrain model dtm 2 to preliminarily assess the hydrogeochemical characteristics of the pit lakes and the amount of stored pollutants 3 to obtain a conceptual model of the hydrological behavior of the pit lakes and perform a water balance of each system and 4 to predict the evolution of these pit lakes in the long term this information is critical to identifying and adopting cost effective measures to mitigate the impact of acidic waters in local receiving water bodies 2 site description the tharsis mining complex has a mediterranean climate with an average yearly precipitation close to 600 mm but it exhibits high intra and inter annual variability galván et al 2009 average temperatures in the area are close to 16 5 c summers are hot and dry with maximum temperatures close to 40 c while winters are humid and cold minimum temperatures lower than 0 c the most important water courses are the aguas agrias creek which joins the oraque river feeding the alcolea projected reservoir to the east and the meca river which is located in the south and is regulated by the sancho reservoir fig 1 the ipb is a part of the south portuguese zone of the hercynian iberian massif which extends from the western part of spain to the portuguese atlantic coast approximately 200 km long and 40 km wide and consists of three lithologic units the phyllite quartzite group pq the volcano sedimentary complex vsc and the culm group cg the pq group consists of a thick sequence of slates and sandstones of upper devonian age the materials of the vsc upper devonian lower carboniferous age are composed of a volcanic sequence with a variable thickness up to 1300 m tornos 2006 and alternating episodes of felsic rocks dacites and in lower proportion rhyolites and mafic rocks occurring as basaltic sills or small stocks intercalated in a sedimentary sequence mainly phyllites this sequence presents abrupt changes due to the intrusive character of some igneous rocks the abundance of thrust defining the major contacts and the existence of several palaeogeographic domains tornos 2006 the vsc hosts numerous sulphides deposits finally the cg is a detrital unit of synorogenic turbidites of up to 3000 m thick which basically consists of shales and conglomerates of carboniferous age the materials of the ipb has been considered of low permeability and do not constitute aquifer units of importance nevertheless the thrust limits and fractured zones must be locally more permeable in the tharsis area the structure is defined by four major south dipping tectonic units limited by thrusts with different lithological and hydrothermal features tornos et al 2009 1 slates and sandstones of the pq group interpreted as a para autochthonous group overlied by the other units 2 the lower unit including the massive sulphides and slates 3 the intermediate unit made by slates intruded by basalts with bodies of hydrothermal breccias and 4 the upper unit composed of rhyodacite sills intruding slates there is no available data about the hydrogeological characteristics hydraulic conductivity storage coefficient etc of these materials paleozoic rocks from the ipb are characterized by a low permeability the hydraulic conductivities are around 10 9 m s gómez de las heras et al 2001 nevertheless these values can increase due to the existence of faults diaclases etc thus at the aznalcóllar mine zone values between 9 10 9 and 10 5 m s are found gómez de las heras et al 2001 also mining labors in the vicinity of pits promote an increase the permeability of such materials by fracturing cánovas et al 2018 original sulfide reserves in the tharsis mine complex are estimated to be around 133 mt tornos et al 2009 mining in the ipb started around 5 000 years ago during the chalcolithic nocete et al 2005 after a period of inactivity mining restarted during the tartessian and roman periods gonzalo y tarín 1888 afterwards a long period of low mining activity continued until 1856 when the mine was rediscovered deligny 1863 and underground mining was performed mainly by room and pillars in filón norte sierra bullones filón centro and filón sur fig 1 opencast mining started in 1866 in filón norte and some years later in sierra bullones and filón centro gonzalo y tarín 1888 mining in filón centro and filón norte ceased in 1884 and 1890 respectively and focused on mineral exploitation in sierra bullones by both opencast and underground mining since the beginning of the twentieth century sulfur from pyrite was obtained to produce sulfuric acid however a new processing method was developed in filón sur from 1937 to 1964 to extract au and ag from the gossan checkland 1967 in the mid twentieth century mining was restarted in filón centro leading to an increase in the open pit around 1960 a new period of exploitation in the filón norte open pit also began mining ceased in sierra bullones in 1966 after 100 years of intense exploitation while filón norte mining finished at the end of the 90s the last mining activities developed in the tharsis mine complex were performed in filón sur from 1990 to 2001 to obtain au and ag by cyanide leaching of the gossan from 1856 to 2001 approximately 40 mt of sulfide were obtained tornos et al 2009 approximately 17 mt were obtained up to 1960 mainly from sierra bullones pinedo vara 1963 while the rest were obtained mainly from filón norte during the last 40 years of exploitation about 5 mt of mineral must be added to these figures from mining developed during the roman and pre roman periods gonzalo y tarín 1888 3 methodology 3 1 water level and total volume stored in the pit lakes due to the absence of water level records in order to estimate the flooding evolution of the pit lakes digital terrain models dtm for 1998 with a horizontal resolution of 20 m 20 m and 2001 2002 with a horizontal resolution of 10 m 10 m from the andalusia regional government were used together with available orthophotographs july 1998 october 2002 august 2004 october 2005 may 2007 may 2009 august 2011 may 2013 and july 2016 aerial photographs prior to these periods were also looked at to check the flooding status of the pit lakes the following methodology was applied with the software arcgis 1 the flooded surface was estimated from orthophotographs for each pit lake 2 the relationship between the altitude and pit surface was estimated by dtms which allowed the water level to be established from the flooded surface and 3 the volume of stored water was calculated from the dtms using the arcgis surface volume tool as the volume below the plane determined by the water level obtained in the previous step filón centro and filón sur open pits were already flooded when the dtms were made thus its topography below the water level is not represented by the dtms to estimate the stored water in both pit lakes water depths of 45 and 5 m were considered for filón centro and filón sur respectively according to data provided by sánchez españa et al 2008 as the same depth was assumed in all the pit lakes these estimations may show some uncertainties 3 2 water balance in the pit lakes daily precipitation was obtained from a rainfall gauge located close to the studied pit lakes fig 1 evaporation was calculated from the equation of penman 1948 1 ev δ r a d n γ e a δ γ where ev is evaporation from a free surface mm day δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve kpa c γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c radn is the net daily radiation at the water surface mm day and ea mm day is the aerodynamic component depending on the average daily wind speed and vapor pressure deficit the detailed estimation procedure is described by allen et al 1998 the information required to apply eq 1 that is the latitude height above sea level and daily data for maximum and minimum temperatures maximum and minimum values of relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation were obtained from a meteorological station located 12 km to the west of the tharsis mine complex the water balance in the pit lakes was estimated from rainfall data runoff data evaporation data and the difference in water volume obtained between orthophotographs water inputs to the pit lakes were estimated by considering the runoff generated in the drainage basin and the direct precipitation on the pit lake surface this latter value was obtained by multiplying the rainfall collected between consecutive orthophotographs by the average flooded surface at the beginning and the end of the period as follows 2 d r n r n a f n a f n 1 2 where drn are the water inputs by direct rainfall during the period n m3 rn is the precipitation during the period n m and afn and afn 1 are the flooded surfaces during the period n and n 1 m2 the runoff generated was obtained by multiplying the precipitation collected between the times of the consecutive orthophotographs by the total surface of the drainage basin 3 qru n n r n a catch a f n a f n 1 2 c where qrunn and rn are the runoff and precipitation amounts during the period n acatch is the drainage basin of each pit lake and afn and afn 1 are the flooded surfaces during periods n and n 1 respectively and c is the runoff coefficient this coefficient was obtained from a hydrological model with the swat code which calculated the daily water balance based on soil type slope land use and weather data galván et al 2009 the model was calibrated and validated against registered daily inflows of the sancho reservoir from 1982 to 2002 the evaluation coefficients for monthly calibration were 0 85 for the pearson s correlation coefficient 0 83 for the nash sutcliffe coefficient and 1 08 for the runoff volume deviation galván et al 2009 values considered very good according to moriasi et al 2007 the sum of eqs 2 and 3 correspond to the surface water input to each pit lake in eq 4 4 i n q r u n n d r n in order to estimate the water losses the amount of evaporation estimated in eq 1 was multiplied by the average flooded surface of each pit lake at the beginning afn 1 and the end of the period afn 5 i n q r u n n d r n where on is the volume of water lost by evaporation during the period n m3 and evn is the evaporation during the period n m in addition groundwater inputs were estimated for each period as the difference between inputs in losses on and the variation of water stored in the pit lake 6 qsu b n i n o n v n v n 1 where qsubn are groundwater inputs during the period n and vn and vn 1 are the volumes of water stored during the periods n and n 1 respectively 3 3 hidrogeochemical data samples of surface water from the pit lakes were taken in 2016 with the exception of sierra bullones which was not accessible samples were collected in high density polyethylene hdpe bottles that were previously washed with a solution of 10 hno3 filtered through 0 45 μm and acidified to ph 2 temperature ph electrical conductivity ec and oxidation reduction potential orp were measured in situ using a crison mm40 multimeter previously calibrated net acidity was also calculated according to kirby and cravotta 2005 considering both the free acidity and that generated by hydrolysable metals fe al mn cu or zn samples were analyzed at the r d laboratories of at the university of huelva by 1 inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy for al cu fe mn s and zn determination and by 2 inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms for as cd co cr ni and pb detection limits were 200 µg l for al fe mn and s 50 µg l for zn 5 µg l for cu and 0 1 µg l for as cd co cr ni and pb the estimations of the acidity sulfates and metal and metaloids stored in the pit lakes were performed by multiplying the volume of water of each pit lake section 3 1 by the corresponding concentration these estimations should be considered only as an approach due to concentration variations in the water column due to vertical stratification were not considered previous works e g sánchez españa et al 2008 reported sharp metal concentration increases in depth due to stratification thus the results obtained must be considered as a minimum value for the pollutant load stored in the pit lakes 4 results and discussion 4 1 current status of the pit lakes and analysis of the flooding evolution the first goal of this work is to analyze the flooding evolution of the pit lakes of the tharsis mine complex since the cease of mining activities this evolution is strongly influenced by rainfalls fig 2 shows the annual evolution of precipitation and evaporation from 1998 to 2016 rainfall distribution exhibited was highly variable with values ranging from 261 to 1 009 mm yr and a mean of 662 mm yr the driest years were 1998 99 2004 05 and 2011 12 while the rainiest were 2000 01 2009 10 and 2010 11 notably values of evaporation exceed those of precipitation average value of 1 699 mm yr in turn showing a lower variability with values ranging from 1530 2013 14 to 1 938 mm 2002 03 except esperanza pit which is partially filled with mine wastes and open to the east the other four open pits are currently flooded the deepest and largest pit is by far filón norte with a total surface area of 0 52 km2 table 1 and the pit with the largest drainage basin is sierra bullones 1 04 km2 filón centro and filón sur have achieved a hydrological equilibrium in the case of filón centro the pit has been flooded since at least 1977 which is the first aerial photograph where the occurrence of water is appreciated while filón sur was dry in 1998 and the flooding turned to be evident from 2002 nevertheless small fluctuations are observed depending on the date when the orthophotograph was acquired with higher values during the rainy season and lower values during the dry season the water level in filón sur ranges from 255 7 to 257 0 m and in filón centro from 258 2 to 258 7 m on the contrary the flooding of filón norte and sierra bullones remains active and the water level altitude was much lower around 185 m in 2016 it can be noted that flooding had not started in both pits in 1998 fig 3 however water in filón norte was evident in 2002 while in sierra bullones was in 2004 since then the water level has risen in both pit lakes increasing the flooded surface and therefore the volume of amd stored the level and volume of water in both pit lakes have been estimated from the dtm and the orthophotographs the evolution of the water level is quite similar in both pit lakes although slightly higher values are observed in sierra bullones this fact must be due to the existence of hydraulic connection between both pit lakes the water level in filón norte has risen around 40 m from 2002 to 2016 which accounts for an average rise of 2 8 m yr it can be also noted that the water level rise was sharper during the first few years and have diminished the last years fig 4 a however the change in water level is influenced by rainfall distribution with higher values of water level rise in rainy periods for example between november 2002 to august 2004 and lower than expected according to the general tendency for dry periods for example june 2007 to may 2009 the volume of stored water shows a tendency that is approximately lineal over the time fig 4b although with some deviations due to the rainfall distribution as previously discussed despite a decrease in the water volume inputs to the pit lake would be expected due to the increase of the water surface exposed to evaporation and the lower groundwater inputs as the hydraulic gradient diminishes the volume of stored water followed a lineal tendency 4 2 preliminary geochemical characterization of waters stored in the pit lakes as commented previously there were 5 2 106 m3 of waters in the different pit lakes in june 2016 most of which 3 59 106 m3 were in filón norte table 1 during flooding waters come into contact with sulfides contained in galleries and pit walls leading to oxidation processes the absence of alkaline materials in the host rocks and the strong water rock interactions with sulfide rich materials forming the galleries and pit walls cause that the stored waters have a high acidity ph of 2 2 2 3 and a net acidity of 3 6 7 1 g caco3 l and concentration of metals and metalloids for example up to 2 053 mg l of fe 228 mg l of zn and 11 mg l of as the most polluted water was that of filón norte table 2 comparing the samplings carried out by sánchez españa et al 2008 the concentrations obtained from filón centro in this study were similar but the concentrations obtained from filón sur and filón norte have diminished substantially for example fe has decreased from 1 922 to 774 mg l in filón sur and from 4 620 to 2 053 mg l in filón norte this is likely related to the fact that filón centro is a stable pit lake at least since 1977 while the other two have not yet reached hydrochemical equilibrium conditions the arrival of less concentrated waters to the pit once the underlying galleries were flooded may have cause such lower concentrations in both pit lakes if compared with other pit lakes found worldwide the concentration of metals e g cu and zn observed in tharsis pit lakes 12 150 mg l of cu and 10 567 mg l of zn are similar to those found in the berkeley pit lake in usa table 3 and higher than those reported in pit lakes from poland sweden or australia in the case of the pit lakes from the ipb metal concentrations found in tharsis are in the same order of magnitude than most pit lakes only in corta atalaya pit lake metal concentrations notably exceed those observed in tharsis the stored mass of pollutants has been calculated from the water volumes in 2016 table 1 and the analyzed concentrations since sierra bullones and filón norte are connected by underground it has been considered that concentrations in both pit lakes are similar the total acidity metal and metalloid load stored in the pit lakes are remarkable e g approximately 32 000 tonnes of caco3 9000 tonnes of fe 1000 tonnes of al and zn and 47 tonnes of as etc table 2 nevertheless in the ipb most of the pit lakes are meromictic with a denser monimolimnion with higher concentrations of pollutants and a mixolimnion with less concentrated waters sánchez españa et al 2008 2014 santofimia et al 2013 cánovas et al 2015 boehrer et al 2016 as these figures have been obtained only from surface waters and vertical stratification processes have not been taken into account the results obtained must be considered as a minimum value for the pollutant load stored in the pit lakes the impact of a potential release of these waters to receiving water bodies can be appreciated comparing these results with the annual load carried by the meca river galván et al 2009 the amount of dissolved fe stored in the pit lakes is around 35 times higher than that annually carried by this river 4 3 water balance and hydrological dynamic of the pit lakes the accumulation of large volumes of highly contaminated waters constitutes a serious risk which could lead to critical environmental impacts for this reason it is of paramount importance to develop a conceptual model of the hydrological behavior of these pit lakes and predict the evolution of each pit lake in the long term this issue will be approached in this section by a detailed case by case analysis 4 3 1 filón centro table 4 shows the water inputs and losses in filón centro the flooded surface area remained approximately constant during the study period approximately 0 036 km2 with the exception of hydrological year of 2004 05 which showed a clearly lower surface area due to the orthophotograph coinciding with the lowest value of precipitation fig 2 the volume of amd stored in the pit lake was around 1 1 106 m3 runoff accounted for more than half of the water inputs into the pit lake whereas the rest corresponded to direct precipitation generally the water losses were slightly higher than inputs which means filón centro may receive hidden inputs from the waste dumps located to the west and from groundwater fig 5 a permanent acidic outflow was identified that arose from the bottom of this waste dump with a flow generally between 0 1 and 0 5 l s the small discharge together the hydrochemical characteristics of the acidic spring sánchez garcía et al 2018 different from the lake indicates that filón centro pit lakes does not discharge regularly through this point and the hidden inputs towards the pit lake must be low however water inputs were higher than losses during the rainy periods from november 2005 to may 2007 and from june 2009 to august 2011 table 4 and water losses may occur through the acidic spring during these periods fig 5a when its discharge can increase up to 12 l s sánchez garcía et al 2018 therefore filón centro would behave as a terminal lake during dry and normal periods and the water rise as a consequence of rainfalls would cause the pit lake to behave as a flow through pit lake fig 5b releasing water through the waste dump to the west 4 3 2 filón sur the drainage basin of filón sur is relatively large 0 29 km2 table 1 while the flooded surface area 0 006 km2 and the volume of stored amd 20 000 m3 were small thus the surface water inputs to the lake were mainly due to runoff table 4 fig 6 water losses by evaporation were noticeably lower than surface inputs as the water level was approximately constant see section 4 1 this pit lake must have hidden water losses these losses were thought to occur through la sabina underground gallery located to the south fig 1 however the water level in the pit lake 257 m is clearly higher than the altitude of la sabina adit fig 6 in addition monitoring in la sabina from the end of 2015 showed evidence of a low average discharge 0 6 l s olías et al 2017 without significant changes in response to rainfalls which is inconsistent with a possible overflow from filón sur fig 6 water exits from filón sur probably occur through an unnoticed derelict gallery constructed to the east at the end of the nineteenth century gonzalo y tarín 1888 this adit can be seen at the surface of the pit lake although the exit toward corta esperanza is likely buried by mine wastes fig 6 during rainy periods water emergences in corta esperanza can be seen which at least partially comes from filón sur these emergences stop flowing a few days after the cessation of the rains suggesting that the contribution of groundwater towards filón sur must be negligible on the other hand cánovas et al 2017 reported that the acidic outflows from the corta esperanza area to be the main amd contributor to the meca river and the sancho reservoir fig 1 with a quick response to rainfalls which could be related to water exits from filón sur 4 3 3 sierra bullones and filón norte the drainage basin of sierra bullones is the largest of the whole pit lakes 1 04 km2 table 1 the runoff generated after rainfalls accounts for around 95 of water inputs to the pit lake table 4 surface water inputs are considerably higher than losses by evaporation due to the small flooded surface area although the latter increases progressively table 4 the difference between water inputs and losses estimated for each period assessed was much higher than the increase of water stored in the pit lake therefore undetected water losses may occur from this pit lake to filón norte through underground galleries fig 7 thus sierra bullones behaves as a flow through pit lake runoff constitutes the main contributor to filón norte pit lake with a drainage basin of 0 60 km2 however as long as the flooded surface increases the percentage of direct precipitation rises table 4 losses by evaporation step up progressively and are linked to the increase in the flooded surface area although some decreases in evaporation can be seen on table 4 because the periods are shorter september 2004 to october 2005 or have a higher proportion of winter days september 2011 to may 2013 thus losses by evaporation are generally lower than surface water inputs during the first flooding stage while the situation reverses in the last periods nevertheless as commented before filón norte must receive unnoticed outflows from sierra bullones groundwater inputs to sierra bullones and filón norte have been estimated from eq 6 these inputs have negative values in sierra bullones which is evidence of the existence of groundwater outputs fig 8 during the first stages of flooding until may 2009 water inputs to filón norte coincide approximately with losses from sierra bullones groundwater inputs to both pit lakes that is the difference between inputs to filón norte and losses to sierra bullones are low however water inputs to filón norte were higher than losses from sierra bullones since 2011 which is evidence of an increase in groundwater flows to the pit lakes the water level rise in the pit lakes should cause a decrease in the hydraulic gradient and thus a corresponding reduction in the groundwater inputs to the lakes marinelli and niccoli 2000 this could be explained by the fill of unknown mining voids groundwater inputs during the first stages of flooding may cause an inundation of these voids resulting in less water entering into the pit lakes as can be seen in fig 4 the water level in filón norte and sierra bullones has been rising progressively the outflow level in filón norte is found to the east of the pit lake at 235 m where a derelict mine tunnel to transport minerals is located fig 7 the maximum water level in sierra bullones is expected to be the same as in filón norte due to both pit lakes being connected underground a hydrogeological model would be needed to reliably predict the flooding evolution of the pit lake which requires detailed information such as piezometric levels radius of influence and horizontal hydraulic conductivity marinelli and niccoli 2000 in addition high resolution measures of these parameters should be obtained due to the high heterogeneity and geological complexity of the area as commented in section 2 as this information is not available a simple approach for estimating the evolution of the water level has been followed for the open pits of both filón norte and sierra bullones it has been assumed that the groundwater inputs are similar to those previously obtained for the most recent period 2013 2016 thus considering average values of annual precipitation and evaporation mm yr it can be estimated that the evaporation of the water surface is necessary to balance the inputs the equilibrium water surface for both open pits turns to be 0 35 km2 corresponding to a water level of 228 5 m which is below the water outflow level 235 m thus both open pits would behave as terminal lakes this calculation must be considered as an approach a monitoring of water levels should be carried out in the future 5 conclusions the mining activities in tharsis from the second part of the nineteenth century to the end of the twentieth century have left as a legacy a great environmental burden including four acidic pit lakes from the dtm and the available orthophotographs the flooding history of the pit lakes has been obtained in 2016 there was stored a volume of 5 2 106 m3 of acidic water containing at least 9000 tonnes of dissolved fe 1000 tonnes of dissolved al and zn etc these pits are hydraulically connected with underground galleries the lack of maintenance labors in these abandoned mine sites could lead to dramatic episodes of contamination in the surrounding water bodies significant differences in the hydrological behavior of the flooded open pits have been established the water level in filón centro and filón sur has reached a stationary state showing slight annual variations the water balance in filón centro provides evidence that this pit lake behaves as a terminal lake during dry and normal periods while during rainy periods it works as a flow through pit lake releasing water through waste dumps located to the west of the lake filón sur receives surface water inputs that are much higher than losses by evaporation thus hidden losses may occur in this pit lake through a derelict gallery to the east significant releases of acidic waters must take place from this pit lake to the receiving water bodies therefore measurements to avoid impacts into the surrounding water bodies should be taken on the other hand the water level in filón norte and sierra bullones is rising an average of 2 8 m yr after the cease of mining at the end of the last century the flooding of both pit lakes follows a similar evolution because underground galleries connect them sierra bullones receives high inputs by runoff much higher than losses by evaporation plus the increments of water stored in the pit lake the water balance provides evidence that losses from sierra bullones are quite similar to water inputs to filón norte up to 2009 however water inputs to filón norte exceed the exits from sierra bullones in recent years which indicate the existence of underground inputs from the surrounding area a simple approach based on the assumption that groundwater inputs remain constant would indicate that losses by evaporation would offset inputs that is runoff direct precipitation and groundwater inputs before reaching the water outflow level nevertheless a mathematical model based on high resolution hydrogeological parameters of the area and a monitoring plan should be implemented in the future the information obtained in this study will allow for more cost effective measures to be adopted mitigating the severe pollution by amd which affects the watercourses of this area in addition the

6976,we assess the impacts of a range of short term climate change scenarios 2020 2050 on the hydrology of the mara river basin in east africa using a new high resolution 0 25 daily climate dataset the scenarios combine natural climate variability as captured by a vector autoregressive var model with a range of climate trends calculated from 31 models in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 the methodology translates these climate scenarios into plausible daily sequences of climate variables utilizing the agricultural modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications agmerra dataset the new dataset varag has several advantages over traditional general circulation model outputs such as the statistical representation of short term natural climate variability availability at a daily time scale and high spatial resolution not requiring additional downscaling and the use of the agmerra data which is bias corrected extensively to assess the associated impacts on basin hydrology the semi distributed variable infiltration capacity vic land surface model is forced with the climate scenarios after being calibrated for the study area using the fine resolution 0 05 merged satellite and in situ observation based dataset climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps the climate data are further bias corrected by applying a non parametric quantile mapping scheme where the cumulative distribution functions are approximated using kernel densities three different wetness scenarios dry average and wet are analyzed to see the potential short term changes in the basin we find that the precipitation bias correction is more in effect in the mountainous sub basins one of which also shows the maximum difference between the wet and dry scenario streamflows precipitation evapotranspiration and soil moisture show increasing trends mostly during the primary rainy season while no trend is found in the corresponding streamflows the annual values of these variables also do not change much in the coming three decades the methodology implemented in this study provides a reliable range of possibilities which can greatly benefit risk analysis and infrastructure designing and shows potential to be applied to other basins keywords short term climate change impacts varag data natural climate variability bias correction vic model mara river basin 1 introduction although challenging the assessment of the hydrological impacts of climate change is necessary for medium to long term water resources planning and management design of future adaptation strategies and resilience building such assessments typically use downscaled global circulation model gcm outputs to drive hydrologic models under plausible assumptions regarding different greenhouse gas ghg emission scenarios in doing so it is important to consider the potential sources of uncertainties associated with various components within the modeling framework for example uncertainties in gcm outputs due to inadequate representation of climate system physics observational uncertainties in the evaluation data process parameterizations land use change greenhouse gases aerosol emissions etc flato et al 2013 or uncertainties in the representation of structural and functional aspects of the hydrologic system allen et al 2006 gupta et al 2012 and so on further because the spatial resolution of gcm outputs is typically too coarse for hydrologic applications such outputs are often mapped to higher resolution using statistical or dynamical downscaling see recent review by teutschbein et al 2011 however because these outputs tend to exhibit bias when compared against some ground truth correction strategies must be applied see recent review by teutschbein and seibert 2012 established methods for bias correction include quantile mapping or distribution mapping panofsky and brier 1968 wood et al 2002 snover et al 2003 yuan and wood 2012 where the probability distribution of the raw data is mapped to the reference data in addition to the uncertainties associated with gcm outputs the time horizons also play a key role in determining the reliability of the climate model outputs at shorter time horizons e g decades the predictability of atmosphere ocean system is greatly reduced boer and lambert 2008 teng and branstator 2011 greene et al 2012 furthermore the natural variability of climate contributes substantially to interannual climate fluctuations particularly for shorter time horizons greene et al 2011 interestingly from the perspective of water allocation planning and resources management the shorter time horizons are of more immediate relevance greene et al 2012 the mara river basin in east africa has been experiencing high water demand in recent times because of which the available water resources are often being over exploited dessu et al 2014 consequently effective water resources planning and management especially at shorter time horizons is an indispensable need in the basin decadal forecasts of different hydroclimatic variables are crucial for addressing the substantial water problems in the basin to date only a very few studies have attempted climate impact assessments for the basin mati et al 2008 studied the impacts of agricultural expansion on mara river streamflow during the 1973 2000 period and reported that reduced forest cover has caused flood peak magnitudes to increase these changes were accompanied by enhanced upstream soil erosion and increased downstream build up of silt mango et al 2011 evaluated the potential combined impacts of climate change and land use change in the upper mara river basin and concluded that conversion of forests to agriculture and grassland is likely to cause peak flows to increase and dry season june to september january to february flows to decrease eventually leading to greater water scarcity and hillslope erosion defersha et al 2012 studied watershed scale sediment yield and runoff response and found as expected that cultivated lands have much higher erosion rates than bush land or grassland dessu and melesse 2012 used climate projections from five gcms for three different ghg emission scenarios to assess and characterize the uncertainty in climate change impacts and reported that a statistically significant increase in flow volume can be expected at mara mine discharge station from 2046 to 2065 to 2081 2100 overall these studies suggest the following 1 significant land use change from forest to agriculture in the upstream portion of the basin 2 increased magnitude of flood peaks 3 decreased dry season flow 4 greater water scarcity 5 increased upstream soil erosion and 6 increased downstream sedimentation in this study we prepare a new climate dataset which combines natural climate variability with temporal trends resulting from increasing greenhouse gases natural variability on the seasonal time scale is estimated using the vector autoregressive var modeling based approach of greene et al 2012 where historical climate observations are used to fit the parameters of the model which is subsequently used to generate hundreds of plausible synthetic time series of natural climate variations in the basin seasonal climate trends precipitation maximum and minimum temperature are calculated from an ensemble of 31 models from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 these trends are then imposed on the synthetic time series of natural variability to generate a full range of plausible seasonal climate change projections for the study area of course an additional source of uncertainty comes from the ability of the cmip5 models to properly capture the response to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations given known model deficiencies in simulating the current climate of east africa yang et al 2014 2015 lyon and vigaud 2017 which is an important caveat to keep in mind once obtained the seasonal projections are temporally disaggregated to the daily time step making use of the high resolution 0 25 lat lon agricultural modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications agmerra climate data ruane et al 2015 hereafter the derived daily time sequences of climate variables will be termed as varag var approach with agmerra three different precipitation scenarios mean average 5th percentile dry and 95th percentile wet are then bias corrected using a nonparametric quantile mapping scheme with a fine resolution satellite and in situ observation based merged dataset climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps funk et al 2014 funk et al 2015 as the reference the bias corrected daily climate projections are then used as forcings to the land surface model variable infiltration capacity vic liang et al 1994 which is calibrated using the sce ua algorithm duan et al 1992 duan et al 1993 to generate plausible hydrological projections for the basin the main objective of this study is to address two main research questions 1 how do the varag precipitation scenarios dry average and wet compare with the climatology of basin precipitation 2 what are the impacts of different short term near term varag precipitation scenarios on basin hydrology 2 study area the 13 504 km2 transboundary mara river basin location 33 88 e to 35 90 e 0 28 s to 1 97 s has about 65 of its area in kenya and 35 in tanzania africa the nyangores and amala rivers originate at the mau forest escarpment 3000 m asl and merge at the napuiyapi swamp 2932 m asl to create the mara river which flows 395 km to its mouth at the musoma bay lake victoria tanzania 1130 m above msl being the only perennial river in the region the mara river plays an important role in the ecohydrology of the basin mcclain et al 2014 the climatology of the basin precipitation is bimodal due to sub annual translation of the intertropical convergence zone itcz with the main rainy season from march to may and the secondary season from october to november long term mean annual precipitation varies from 600 mm to 1500 mm mcclain et al 2014 about one million people live in the mara basin where the main socioeconomic activity is crop farming followed by livestock rearing tourism and wildlife sanctuary mati et al 2005 due to population growth and agricultural expansion the basin has experienced a very high rate of deforestation with almost 4500 km2 approximately one third of the basin having been transformed into farmland and tea plantations by 2000 mati et al 2005 mcclain et al 2014 the basin encompasses the masai mara national reserve kenya and the serengeti national park along with game reserves in tanzania that attract thousands of tourists due to the rich biodiversity and the annual mass migration of millions of animals in this study we focus on the mara river basin and its five sub basins fig 1 supporting information table s1 two sub basins in the northeast encompass the nyangores and amala tributaries three sub basins in the east encompass the lemek talek and sand tributaries all the five sub basins drain into the mid region of the basin referred to as mid mara discharge data are only available at three discharge stations bomet bridge nyangores river kapkimolwa bridge amala river and mara mine mara river although no ground based streamflow records are available for the other three sub basins they play crucial roles in the water management of the region 3 methodology 3 1 datasets this study involves multiple datasets at different stages climate change projections for the basin were derived using the university of east anglia climate research unit cru harris et al 2014 monthly precipitation and temperature version ts3 2 data precipitation projections from 31 climate models contained in the cmip5 archive using the rcp8 5 radiative forcing scenario and agmerra data the bias correction of the climate data as well as the calibration of the hydrologic mode vic were carried out using the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station chirps dataset which combines both satellite estimates and in situ measurements temperature and wind speed data for the vic model calibration were derived from the national centers for environmental information ncei meteorological station data archive formerly known as ncdc national climatic data center the observed streamflow data were collected from the local water management authority 3 1 1 agmerra climate forcings the agmerra dataset combines nasa s merra reanalyses data rienecker et al 2011 with in situ and remotely sensed observations of precipitation temperature and solar radiation to produce daily high resolution 0 25 fields of climate forcing data with significantly reduced bias ruane et al 2015 relative to observations from 2324 stations in the hadley integrated surface dataset hadisd dunn et al 2012 the product has been shown to compare well with several contemporary forcing datasets including the princeton climate forcing dataset sheffield et al 2006 the water and global change watch forcing dataset wfd weedon et al 2011 wfd with era interim wfd ei weedon et al 2011 and the meteorological forcing dataset the global risk assessment for the stable production of food grasp iizumi et al 2014 additionally agmerra incorporates the merra land dataset reichle 2012 which includes climate prediction center s unified precipitation product chen et al 2008 resulting in significantly improved representation of daily precipitation and extreme events the dataset also incorporates three high resolution satellite based precipitation estimates namely tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm 3b42 huffman et al 2007 precipitation estimation using remote sensing and artificial neural networks persiann hsu et al 1997 and climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 3 1 2 varag future climate forcings in the coming decades interannual climate fluctuations associated with natural variability could be a major contributor to hydrologic variations in many regions around the globe greene et al 2011 such natural variations can also affect short term e g 30 year climate trends and thus projections of near term climate change to address this issue we follow the methodology of greene et al 2012 where we combine information regarding natural climate variations based on observational data with climate model projections used to quantify trends under increased greenhouse gas forcing fig 2 shows the main steps involved in the data preparation technique the first step was to extract seasonal average cru precipitation data along with maximum and minimum temperature data 1901 2013 for a rectangular region 2 5 s 0 n 33 5 e 36 5 e that includes the mara basin only the wet seasons of march may and october december were used in the var model the three variables were then regressed onto the global average surface temperature time series obtained from the average of 31 cmip5 climate model simulations that include increasing greenhouse gases and therefore constitute the anthropogenic signal the regressed relationships were used to de trend the original cru time series data they are subtracted from the original data generating residual values for each variable that constitute natural climate variability the detrended time series seasonal precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature were then used to fit the parameters of the var model that captures both the autocorrelation of each of the three variables as well as the covariance among them once the model parameters were determined the var model was used to generate 200 synthetic climate scenario time series consisting of seasonal average values 31 years in length representing 2020 2050 linear trends from 2020 to 2050 in the three variables were then computed for the region based on 31 cmip5 model projections run under the rcp8 5 scenario representing extreme greenhouse gas emissions riahi et al 2011 from the 31 computed trends the four representing the mean 5th 50th and 95th percentile values were selected these four trend scenarios were then superimposed on each of the 200 synthetic climate simulations to generate what is considered the full range of plausible climate change projections for the basin trend from cmip5 and natural variability from the var for each of these four sets of 200 scenarios the seasonal precipitation averaged over the period 2020 2050 was determined for each set and the mean 5th 50th and 95th percentile values were identified for example in the case of the 5th percentile trend imposed from cmip5 the 5th percentile of seasonal mean rainfall for 2020 2050 was selected from the 200 superimposed time series the purpose of this was to capture how natural variability can either enhance or reduce the imposed trend just by chance as the historical march may and october december rainfall seasons in the mara basin do not show a statistically significant relationship to one another climate scenarios for the march may and october december seasons were computed separately in our approach these seasons were subsequently concatenated with the intervening dry seasons january february june september where the dry seasons for an individual year was chosen randomly from the agmerra data the seasonal temperature trends from the cmip5 model projections were added to the temperature time series from var for all seasons i e including the dry seasons thus we derived 31 year climate projections for the mara basin covering the period 2020 2050 based on the seasonal data to disaggregate the synthetic seasonal climate scenarios down to plausible daily weather sequences a k nearest neighbor approach was employed using all three scenario variables precipitation maximum and minimum temperature for a given season and year the three nearest neighbors in seasonal averages of the agmerra data were identified to add a stochastic element a single nearest neighbor was chosen from the three using a random process with unequal weighting with the largest weighting applied to the first nearest neighbor the difference in seasonal temperature between the scenario value and agmerra nearest neighbor was then computed for each season of each year for precipitation the ratio of the two precipitation values was computed the daily agmerra values for each identified season and year and for each grid point within the mara basin then served as a plausible daily sequence within the season to have the agmerra data exactly match that of the seasonal value of the climate scenario the difference between seasonal scenario and agmerra in seasonal maximum and minimum temperature was added to each daily agmerra value while for precipitation multiplicative adjustment was used the end result was a sequence of daily forcing values covering the period 1 january 2020 to 31 december 2050 for four different wetness scenarios mean and the 5th 50th 95th percentiles 3 1 3 chirps precipitation the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps funk et al 2014 funk et al 2015 is a satellite based quasi global 50 n s 180 w e merged precipitation dataset available from 1981 to near present 1 month latency chirps incorporates information from five different sources 1 pentadally 5 day disaggregated monthly precipitation climatology chpclim 2 quasi global geostationary thermal ir satellite observations from two noaa sources cpc ir ncdc b1 ir 3 trmm 3b42 precipitation estimates 4 precipitation fields from noaa climate forecast system version 2 cfsv2 and 5 in situ precipitation observations both from national and regional sources chg station climatology database ucsb the latest version of chirps version 2 with 0 05 0 05 spatial and daily temporal resolutions is used in this study as per the chirps algorithm cold cloud top 235 k duration is calculated first as the percent of pentad i e the percent of time during the pentad that corresponds to the cold could top then predetermined local regression equations based on trmm 3b42 pentad rainfall estimates are used to convert this duration into mm of precipitation the percent of normal pentad precipitation is calculated by dividing the pentad values by their long term means which is then multiplied by the climate hazards group s precipitation climatology chpclim pentad to produce unbiased gridded precipitation estimates finally for each grid location five nearest station observations are assimilated using weights that are proportional to the square of the correlation coefficients thereby producing the chirps estimates 3 1 4 station data temperature wind speed and discharge the global surface summary of the day gsod products produced by the national climatic data center ncdc in asheville nc currently a part of ncei are used in this study as the in situ observations of precipitation temperature maximum minimum and average and wind speed six of the total available stations had relatively good coverage and so they were used for this study discharge data were available for three sub basins out of six nyangores at bomet bridge amala at kapkimolwa and mara at mara mine with different temporal coverages see supporting information table s2 streamflow values are based on calibrated stage discharge relationships fed with stage measurements the uncertainty in the stage to discharge transformation was not accounted for in this study 3 2 hydrologic model vic the vic model liang et al 1994 is a physically based semi distributed hydrologic model that can solve both water and energy budget equations simultaneously for this study the model was run in water budget mode at a daily time step and a 0 05 spatial resolution independent calculations are carried out at each grid cell and the model accounts for sub grid heterogeneity in a statistical manner vic requires that at least four inputs be provided precipitation maximum air temperature minimum air temperature and wind speed and unless provided explicitly all other required variables are derived within the model from these four inputs see supporting information table s3 the model consists of three soil layers and a thin canopy layer on the top horizontal routing within the model is a two step process first the runoff from each grid cell is routed from that cell to the channel using a triangular unit hydrograph second the water in the channel is routed to the outlet using the linearized st venant s equations lohmann et al 1996 lohmann et al 1998 six parameters of the model were calibrated in this study see supporting information table s4 these are the ones suggested by the developers as being the most sensitive information retrieved from www hydro washington edu lettenmaier models vic documentation calibration shtml general last accessed sept 18 2018 3 3 model calibration discharge data from the three gauge stations bomet kapkimolwa and mara mine did not share a common time frame supporting information table s2 therefore to make the best use of the available data step wise calibration was performed using different calibration and evaluation periods for each sub basin calibration was carried out individually using distributed forcing and the same calibrated parameters were applied in all grid cells the nyangores and amala sub basins were calibrated first individually for their respective outlet points at bomet and kapkimolwa next the mara basin was calibrated using the discharge data from the outlet point at mara mine the final parameter file was prepared by combining the three different sets of parameters corresponding to nyangores amala and mara the shuffled complex evolution university of arizona sce ua duan et al 1992 duan et al 1993 optimization algorithm was used for calibrating the model parameters at a daily time step using chirps as the precipitation forcing the mean squared error of the transformed box and cox 1964 flows was used as the objective function to be minimized the λ parameter of the transformation equation was calculated from the observed streamflow values such that it minimizes the skewness roy et al 2017a 2017b for the ungauged sub basins lemek talek and sand calibrated parameters of the mara basin were implemented note that the quality of streamflow observations was not up to the mark for kapkimolwa bridge and mara mine stations however we still wanted to utilize all the resources we had at our disposal calibration in the λ transformed space is particularly useful in this case in order to capture the mean behavior of the observed streamflow time series this does however deteriorate the error statistics for bomet bridge although the observed hydrograph was captured well by the vic model there were few instances of high peaks in the simulated flows which again deteriorated the error statistics calibration results are presented in supporting information table s5 3 4 precipitation bias correction bias correction of varag raw precipitation data was carried at a monthly time scale on a cell to cell basis using adjusted chirps as the reference data the correction scheme followed two steps first raw chirps data were slightly adjusted in a lumped manner to match the long term means of the local national climatic data center ncdc rain gauges see methodology in roy et al 2017b second cell to cell distributed correction was carried out using a nonparametric quantile mapping approach where the cumulative distribution functions cdfs were approximated by kernel densities although the applications of kernel densities are widespread rosenblatt 1956 silverman 1981 sheather and jones 1991 kim et al 2003 they have not been used widely within the context of quantile mapping based bias correction in this method the probability distributions of the raw and the reference data are approximated by kernel densities which helps overcome several weaknesses associated with the use of purely empirical distributions e g lack of smoothness or theoretical distributions e g frequent over smoothing quantile mapping is used to match the distribution quantiles of the raw data rw to that of the reference data rf thereby producing the bias corrected data bc with statistical properties similar to the reference data mathematically this can be shown as 1 bc f rf 1 f rw r w where f rw is the cdf of the raw data and f rf 1 is the inverse cdf of the reference data the cdfs of raw and reference data are approximated using kernel density functions which can be expressed as 2 f x 1 nb i 1 n k x i x b where f x is the estimated density at point x x i is the sample point at i th location n is the total number of sample points k is the kernel and b is the bandwidth the kernel function represents the influence of adjacent points based on their distance from the evaluation point as this distance increases the associated weight decreases thus any sample point probability is characterized by not only the probability at that point but also by the probability associated with the neighboring points in a continuously decreasing manner with distance away from the evaluation point using some kernel function e g triangular gaussian etc the bandwidth in kernel density estimation controls the bias variance trade off if the bandwidth is too small the kernel densities overfit the data i e the variance increases on the contrary if the bandwidth is too large the kernel densities underfit the data which means that the bias is increased here the bandwidth was adjusted manually to implement the nonparametric quantile mapping scheme we used 1d interpolation with nearest neighborhood smoothing on the precipitation values and the cumulative probabilities bias correction of varag raw precipitation was carried out on a monthly time scale following which the bias corrected monthly values were temporally disaggregated to daily level based on precipitation intensities with the implicit assumption that higher rainfall intensities are associated with larger bias and vice versa the correction was not implemented on a daily level because the reference chirps data are produced from pentad climatologies which do not accurately represent the daily variability of precipitation 4 results and discussion 4 1 precipitation characteristics the comparison between the basin averaged mean monthly precipitation from agmerra and chirps for the time period 1981 2010 common time frame for all six sub basins is shown in fig 3 for each case it also reports the bias factor i e the ratio between the long term means of chirps reference and agmerra raw bias factors greater than one imply underestimation in long term of agmerra and vice versa as can be seen the type of bias varies with the case agmerra significantly underestimates precipitation in the mountainous nyangores and amala sub basins shows slight underestimation for the mid mara region and sand sub basin and slight overestimation for the talek and lemek this is also evident in the empirical cdf plots where the upper two sub basins show significant differences underestimation of agmerra whereas the remaining four sub basins have very similar probability distribution characteristics next we compared future precipitation from raw varag against historical chirps supporting information fig s1 to see whether or not varag precipitation is significantly different from agmerra precipitation and if chirps could at all be used as the reference data we found that the agmerra and varag precipitation have very similar mean bias and distribution characteristics which is also the reason why chirps was finalized for bias correcting the future data fig 4 shows monthly precipitation distributions and means for 1 basin averaged rain gauge measurements 2 chirps precipitation 3 agmerra precipitation and 4 average wetness varag precipitation as can be seen the bimodality of mara rainfall is well represented in all four datasets the primary rainy season is during march may and the secondary during october december varag precipitation has less spread overall the plot in the last row shows monthly bias factors corresponding to chirps agmerra and varag calculated using the rain gauge measurements as the reference bias factor reference raw all three products have similar temporal patterns for the bias factor with agmerra and varag having the closest match overall the bias factor values are closer to 1 during the rainy seasons and higher during the dry periods which means on an average the dry period precipitation is underestimated by agmerra assuming that the rain gauge measurements during those periods are reasonably accurate similar behavior is expected in the future as demonstrated in varag if we assume stationarity since the statistical properties are not expected to change significantly within the short time period it is important to note that the assumption of stationarity is only meaningful when short term analysis is concerned for analysis in longer time scales treatment of nonstationarity becomes crucial 4 2 precipitation bias correction since the probability distributions of monthly agmerra and varag precipitation were quite similar see fig 3 and supporting information fig s1 the bias correction method was first tested with the agmerra data for historical time period 1981 2010 to see how closely the bias corrected values match the reference data i e gauge adjusted chirps bias correction results for four different grid cells from different parts of the mara river basin are shown in supporting information fig s2 where the type of bias whether underestimation or overestimation is not consistent across the grid cells the sorted values closely follow the 45 line indicating that the bias correction has been successful fig 5 presents the bias correction results for the historical time period for the entire study area clearly bias correction scheme has successfully matched all the four moments mean standard deviation skewness and kurtosis of the raw monthly agmerra data to that of the gauge adjusted chirps note that the use of kernel density functions and the careful selection of the bandwidth value are the key reasons why bias correction has been so efficient in this case bias correction results similar to fig 5 of varag precipitation are shown in supporting information fig s3 4 3 precipitation projections three different future precipitation scenarios dry average and wet are studied with and without the bias correction fig 6 assuming that the reference chirps corresponds to average wetness condition we only bias correct the average scenario of varag the anomalies of dry and wet scenarios are calculated by subtracting them from the raw means which are then added back to the corrected means to get the corrected dry and wet scenarios the negative values produced thereby are all set to zero thus we can have three different scenarios both before and after the bias correction which would not be possible had we been bias correcting all three scenarios directly because in that case the bias correction algorithm would consider dryness and wetness as biases and tend to correct them such that they match the mean scenario this method implicitly assumes that the magnitude of the bias during average wetness conditions is equal during wet and dry conditions the accumulated precipitation plots shown in fig 6 are useful to detect 1 differences in total precipitation at the end of the analysis period and 2 any drastic change in precipitation over time as reflected by the slope of the curves as can be seen none of the six sub basins showed a noticeable change in the slopes for the different scenarios therefore no drastic change in precipitation is expected in the next three decades differences between the dry and wet scenario precipitation at the end of the time period are similar for all six sub basins whereas in case of streamflow these differences are maximum for the mountainous sub basins difference between the dry and wet precipitation scenarios was maximum in the overall basin 199 mm followed by the lemek sub basin 164 mm and minimum for the amala sub basin 130 mm the effect of bias correction is marginal for lemek and talek where the bias factors are lower than but very close to 1 0 93 and 0 94 respectively the slope of the bias corrected precipitation is always higher for all sub basins for lemek and talek again the increase in slope after bias correction is marginal 4 4 hydrologic projections hydrologic simulations are carried out for three consecutive decades 2021 2030 2031 2040 and 2041 2050 using the calibrated vic model with both raw and bias corrected future climate precipitation projections to also study the effects of bias correction other variables maximum temperature minimum temperature and wind speed are used directly from varag without any adjustment with this hydrologic modeling exercise we want to assess the impacts of short term near term climate change on the hydrology of the mara river basin note that the agmerra data used for other variables within the varag dataset are already bias corrected extensively see ruane et al 2015 and therefore their use in the hydrologic model is justified future work will focus on bias correcting those variables as well to see if performance could be improved in this study we had a reliable reference dataset for precipitation chirps which we used to bias correct the main driver of the hydrologic model i e precipitation the average yearly difference between the wet and the dry scenario streamflows was maximum 141 mm for the nyangores sub basin whereas the minimum difference was found in case of the sand sub basin 92 mm in terms of et the maximum difference was found in the overall basin 101 mm followed by the talek sub basin 89 mm and the minimum in the amala sub basins 61 mm the effects of bias correction are more prominent for nyangores and amala figs 6 and 7 for all three scenarios vic simulates streamflows of higher magnitude after the bias correction for these two sub basins this behavior is expected since the corresponding bias factors are also higher see supporting information fig s1 meaning that the bias corrected precipitation would be higher in terms of magnitude as compared to the raw precipitation the next noticeable change in streamflow is found in case of the sand sub basin which lies in the southern part of the mara river basin in this case the streamflow magnitude increases slightly when the bias corrected precipitation is used streamflow changes are not significant in lemek and talek sub basins for the two mountainous sub basins nyangores and amala vic simulation results show that the streamflows for both average and wet scenarios will be very similar fig 6 in other words streamflow magnitude will be higher which happens in the expense of et since the simulated et in the average scenario is close to the simulated et from the dry scenario lower magnitude the cumulative distributions of streamflows corresponding to the historical chirps and three varag wetness scenarios are shown in supporting information fig s4 the distributions of daily precipitation et and streamflow appear to be quite similar in the three successive decades considered in this study supporting information fig s5 although the outliers show some differences the median and the interquartile range do not change significantly this is indicative of the fact that at shorter time scales natural variability of climate can obscure climate change signals being a scenario based dataset varag shows how different wetness conditions might look like in the future thus fig 6 gives us a sense of uncertainty in different hydrologic variables based on the wetness scenarios note that since the wetness scenarios are based on seasonal values after disaggregation using agmerra it is possible to have situations where a daily value from the dry scenario is actually higher than the wet scenario therefore the varag scenarios cannot be used directly in the hydrologic model to calculate the corresponding daily streamflow percentiles 4 5 trend analysis mann kendall test at 5 significance level was performed on precipitation et and streamflow during the wet seasons march may and october december for all three bias corrected wetness scenarios in the basin for precipitation the complete time period 2020 2050 was considered whereas for et and streamflows 2020 was excluded in order to remove the effects of model spin up except for sand the total primary rainy season precipitation march may total showed statistically significant increasing trends for the average wetness scenario in all cases whereas the same scenario did not show any significant trend for the secondary rainy season october december total the dry and wet scenarios did not show significant trends in any of the sub basins for either of the rainy seasons streamflow did not show any statistically significant trend for any of the rainy seasons and wetness scenarios in any of the sub basins for the average wetness scenario increasing trends in et were found in all cases expect for sand during the primary rainy season and in mara and lemek during the secondary rainy season the wet scenario did not show any statistically significant trend in et whereas the dry scenario showed positive trend during the primary rainy season in nyangores and amala soil moisture showed statistically significant increasing trends during the primary rainy season in both the average and wet scenarios for mara nyangores and amala additionally for lemek in the average scenario however no statistically significant trend was found in any of the wetness scenarios for annual precipitation et streamflow and soil moisture in any of the sub basins while temperature both minimum and maximum showed statistically significant positive annual trends for all the sub basins thus even with projected increases in seasonal rainfall in some sub basins and wetness scenarios they are found to have little influence on the overall hydrology of the basin relative to the current climate when viewed on an annual basis increasing et on an annual time scale even though the trends are not statistically significant they are still positive acts to reduce the runoff which might not show decreasing trends since the precipitation is also increasing on subseasonal time scales increasing temperatures will serve to exacerbate dry conditions when they do occur even if only driven by natural variability we also carried out a comparison between the raw and the bias corrected varag precipitation for all three scenarios to see if bias correction is affecting the trend signals in the raw data it was found that overall bias correction did not alter much the temporal trends of the raw data 4 6 streamflow uncertainty information about streamflow uncertainty is crucial for hydrologic designs and applications however it is almost impossible to get a true estimate of uncertainty for the future simply because we are not certain about how the future would look like in reality the estimated uncertainties are rather subjective oftentimes very sensitive to the approach implemented for their estimation if sufficient computational resources are available one could calculate an ensemble of streamflow projections however the uncertainty thereof given by the ensemble spread will be solely based on how good the ensemble members are clearly this approach does not account for the actual errors moreover the uncertainty estimates will change further depending on how the ensemble is generated an alternative approach to ensemble based uncertainty is to use the historical errors and superimpose them on the future values the error superimposition can be done for different time scales in case of daily streamflows the errors from the entire historical time period could be superimposed on the daily values of the future streamflows alternatively historical errors can be separated into months or even days and the superimposition can be carried out for the corresponding months or days an important aspect of error calculation is the effect of skewness in highly skewed variables such as precipitation or streamflow the skewness would impact the errors therefore it is important to remove the skewness from the variables before calculating the errors the error superimposition can be carried out in the transformed space skewness is reduced and the resulting streamflow values can then be transferred back to the original space for long term assessment nonstationarity could be an unavoidable issue in which case the errors calculated in the past will be irrelevant for the future in this study we first checked if the standard deviations of the daily streamflow errors changed much in the past for each month although there were changes evident it was difficult to find common patterns furthermore it is also problematic to extrapolate the trend line of the historical standard deviations to derive standard deviations for the future simply because we do not know how that change whether linear exponential etc would be in reality therefore in this study we assumed the streamflow error distributions to be stationary which is a reasonable assumption given that our focus is on short term impacts assessment next we removed the skewness using the box cox transformation where the lambda parameter was calculated such that the skewness was minimized roy et al 2017a 2017b we then applied three variations of the error superimposition approach in method 1 we superimposed monthly errors in method 2 daily error values were used and finally in method 3 we applied bootstrapping on the daily errors fig 8 note that in method 2 and method 3 daily error distributions were sparse for example in nyangores river basin we had 14 years of historical records resulting in only 14 error values for each day of the year in most cases the errors did not have zero mean therefore we forced the mean to be zero for daily errors to ensure that we capture only the error variance and no artificial bias is introduced in the process additionally in method 3 instead of regular bootstrapping we implemented balanced bootstrapping where the difference between the observation mean and the mean of the bootstrapped sample means are added to the latter to remove the bias note that out of the six sub basins within the main mara basin only three had streamflow observations with the nyangores river basin station bomet bridge having the best quality data therefore we demonstrate the streamflow uncertainty analysis for this sub basin only for the ungauged basins an ad hoc approach of uncertainty characterization would be to use bootstrapped confidence intervals calculated from the daily values in each season out of the three methods presented we recommend the use of method 1 since it yields to more robust estimates of the uncertainty as the distributions are not sparse in this case and also there is no need for forcing the error means to be zero method 3 produces the narrowest bounds however these are not necessarily more realistic as compared to the more conservative bounds from method 1 it is important to note that the three wetness scenarios themselves provide a sense of the extreme and mean hydrologic behavior of the basins the error superimposition adds an additional layer of uncertainty on the scenarios 5 summary and concluding remarks in this study we evaluate the potential impacts of short term 3 decades climate change on the hydrology of the mara river basin and its sub basins in east africa predictability of climate is reduced significantly at such short time span due to the inherent natural variability on the other hand it is oftentimes more relevant to assess the impacts of short term climate change for water resources management and infrastructure designing in this study we capture the natural variability of climate using a statistical model var and derive daily scenario values based on the agmerra data we bias correct the new data varag using the satellite and observation based merged dataset chirps and use it as input to the land surface model vic to investigate the hydrological impacts we particularly focus on three different scenarios representing the mean avergae dry 5th percentile and wet 95th percentile conditions varag and agmerra have very similar mean bias and distribution characteristics and they also along with chirps well capture the climatology of the bimodal precipitation in the mara river basin the bias factors ratio between reference and raw data calculated in this study are higher 1 indicates underestimation over the mountainous sub basins of the north nyangores and amala agreeing with similar findings about the underestimation of satellite based precipitation estimates over the mountainous regions gebremichael et al 2014 therefore bias correction was more in effect in these two sub basins the bias correction method implemented in this study using kernel densities successfully matched all four distributional moments of the raw data to that of the reference data moreover it did not alter much the temporal trends of the raw data seasonal trend analysis revealed that the increasing trends in precipitation during the primary rainy season will lead to more water availability which will not only increase soil moisture but also et with the latter also be driven by increasing temperatures annually there is no substantial increase in precipitation in the next three decades as shown by the varag data cmip5 model outputs combined with natural variability which relates to the frequent drought events in the region another implication of these results could be that the primary rainy season in the sub basins for most of them will have more rain however since the overall annual precipitation is not changing much this could lead to higher peak flows during the rainy seasons not necessarily increased total flow and more dryness during the non rainy seasons which have been suggested in some recent studies e g mati et al 2008 mango et al 2011 it should be noted that in our study approach projected rainfall trends from the cmip5 models are for seasonal totals that are superimposed on natural variability on this time scale and subsequently disaggregated to daily sequences using the agmerra dataset as such we do not explicitly examine changes in daily extreme events within the cmip5 models although seasonal rainfall trends will influence the magnitude of daily totals including extremes in our approach our methodology assumes that in the near term 10 30 years climate variability will be very similar to that of the present climate which may not be a suitable assumption on longer timescales under increasing greenhouse gas forcing given this our methodology is not ideal for the analysis of daily rainfall trends the strength of the var approach is to allow for the generation of thousands of plausible future climate scenarios enabling us to build probability distributions of projected climate change that include the important role of unforced climate variability on near term trends acknowledgement this work was supported by the nasa usaid servir program through award 11 servir11 58 thanks to ashutosh

6976,we assess the impacts of a range of short term climate change scenarios 2020 2050 on the hydrology of the mara river basin in east africa using a new high resolution 0 25 daily climate dataset the scenarios combine natural climate variability as captured by a vector autoregressive var model with a range of climate trends calculated from 31 models in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 the methodology translates these climate scenarios into plausible daily sequences of climate variables utilizing the agricultural modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications agmerra dataset the new dataset varag has several advantages over traditional general circulation model outputs such as the statistical representation of short term natural climate variability availability at a daily time scale and high spatial resolution not requiring additional downscaling and the use of the agmerra data which is bias corrected extensively to assess the associated impacts on basin hydrology the semi distributed variable infiltration capacity vic land surface model is forced with the climate scenarios after being calibrated for the study area using the fine resolution 0 05 merged satellite and in situ observation based dataset climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps the climate data are further bias corrected by applying a non parametric quantile mapping scheme where the cumulative distribution functions are approximated using kernel densities three different wetness scenarios dry average and wet are analyzed to see the potential short term changes in the basin we find that the precipitation bias correction is more in effect in the mountainous sub basins one of which also shows the maximum difference between the wet and dry scenario streamflows precipitation evapotranspiration and soil moisture show increasing trends mostly during the primary rainy season while no trend is found in the corresponding streamflows the annual values of these variables also do not change much in the coming three decades the methodology implemented in this study provides a reliable range of possibilities which can greatly benefit risk analysis and infrastructure designing and shows potential to be applied to other basins keywords short term climate change impacts varag data natural climate variability bias correction vic model mara river basin 1 introduction although challenging the assessment of the hydrological impacts of climate change is necessary for medium to long term water resources planning and management design of future adaptation strategies and resilience building such assessments typically use downscaled global circulation model gcm outputs to drive hydrologic models under plausible assumptions regarding different greenhouse gas ghg emission scenarios in doing so it is important to consider the potential sources of uncertainties associated with various components within the modeling framework for example uncertainties in gcm outputs due to inadequate representation of climate system physics observational uncertainties in the evaluation data process parameterizations land use change greenhouse gases aerosol emissions etc flato et al 2013 or uncertainties in the representation of structural and functional aspects of the hydrologic system allen et al 2006 gupta et al 2012 and so on further because the spatial resolution of gcm outputs is typically too coarse for hydrologic applications such outputs are often mapped to higher resolution using statistical or dynamical downscaling see recent review by teutschbein et al 2011 however because these outputs tend to exhibit bias when compared against some ground truth correction strategies must be applied see recent review by teutschbein and seibert 2012 established methods for bias correction include quantile mapping or distribution mapping panofsky and brier 1968 wood et al 2002 snover et al 2003 yuan and wood 2012 where the probability distribution of the raw data is mapped to the reference data in addition to the uncertainties associated with gcm outputs the time horizons also play a key role in determining the reliability of the climate model outputs at shorter time horizons e g decades the predictability of atmosphere ocean system is greatly reduced boer and lambert 2008 teng and branstator 2011 greene et al 2012 furthermore the natural variability of climate contributes substantially to interannual climate fluctuations particularly for shorter time horizons greene et al 2011 interestingly from the perspective of water allocation planning and resources management the shorter time horizons are of more immediate relevance greene et al 2012 the mara river basin in east africa has been experiencing high water demand in recent times because of which the available water resources are often being over exploited dessu et al 2014 consequently effective water resources planning and management especially at shorter time horizons is an indispensable need in the basin decadal forecasts of different hydroclimatic variables are crucial for addressing the substantial water problems in the basin to date only a very few studies have attempted climate impact assessments for the basin mati et al 2008 studied the impacts of agricultural expansion on mara river streamflow during the 1973 2000 period and reported that reduced forest cover has caused flood peak magnitudes to increase these changes were accompanied by enhanced upstream soil erosion and increased downstream build up of silt mango et al 2011 evaluated the potential combined impacts of climate change and land use change in the upper mara river basin and concluded that conversion of forests to agriculture and grassland is likely to cause peak flows to increase and dry season june to september january to february flows to decrease eventually leading to greater water scarcity and hillslope erosion defersha et al 2012 studied watershed scale sediment yield and runoff response and found as expected that cultivated lands have much higher erosion rates than bush land or grassland dessu and melesse 2012 used climate projections from five gcms for three different ghg emission scenarios to assess and characterize the uncertainty in climate change impacts and reported that a statistically significant increase in flow volume can be expected at mara mine discharge station from 2046 to 2065 to 2081 2100 overall these studies suggest the following 1 significant land use change from forest to agriculture in the upstream portion of the basin 2 increased magnitude of flood peaks 3 decreased dry season flow 4 greater water scarcity 5 increased upstream soil erosion and 6 increased downstream sedimentation in this study we prepare a new climate dataset which combines natural climate variability with temporal trends resulting from increasing greenhouse gases natural variability on the seasonal time scale is estimated using the vector autoregressive var modeling based approach of greene et al 2012 where historical climate observations are used to fit the parameters of the model which is subsequently used to generate hundreds of plausible synthetic time series of natural climate variations in the basin seasonal climate trends precipitation maximum and minimum temperature are calculated from an ensemble of 31 models from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 these trends are then imposed on the synthetic time series of natural variability to generate a full range of plausible seasonal climate change projections for the study area of course an additional source of uncertainty comes from the ability of the cmip5 models to properly capture the response to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations given known model deficiencies in simulating the current climate of east africa yang et al 2014 2015 lyon and vigaud 2017 which is an important caveat to keep in mind once obtained the seasonal projections are temporally disaggregated to the daily time step making use of the high resolution 0 25 lat lon agricultural modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications agmerra climate data ruane et al 2015 hereafter the derived daily time sequences of climate variables will be termed as varag var approach with agmerra three different precipitation scenarios mean average 5th percentile dry and 95th percentile wet are then bias corrected using a nonparametric quantile mapping scheme with a fine resolution satellite and in situ observation based merged dataset climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps funk et al 2014 funk et al 2015 as the reference the bias corrected daily climate projections are then used as forcings to the land surface model variable infiltration capacity vic liang et al 1994 which is calibrated using the sce ua algorithm duan et al 1992 duan et al 1993 to generate plausible hydrological projections for the basin the main objective of this study is to address two main research questions 1 how do the varag precipitation scenarios dry average and wet compare with the climatology of basin precipitation 2 what are the impacts of different short term near term varag precipitation scenarios on basin hydrology 2 study area the 13 504 km2 transboundary mara river basin location 33 88 e to 35 90 e 0 28 s to 1 97 s has about 65 of its area in kenya and 35 in tanzania africa the nyangores and amala rivers originate at the mau forest escarpment 3000 m asl and merge at the napuiyapi swamp 2932 m asl to create the mara river which flows 395 km to its mouth at the musoma bay lake victoria tanzania 1130 m above msl being the only perennial river in the region the mara river plays an important role in the ecohydrology of the basin mcclain et al 2014 the climatology of the basin precipitation is bimodal due to sub annual translation of the intertropical convergence zone itcz with the main rainy season from march to may and the secondary season from october to november long term mean annual precipitation varies from 600 mm to 1500 mm mcclain et al 2014 about one million people live in the mara basin where the main socioeconomic activity is crop farming followed by livestock rearing tourism and wildlife sanctuary mati et al 2005 due to population growth and agricultural expansion the basin has experienced a very high rate of deforestation with almost 4500 km2 approximately one third of the basin having been transformed into farmland and tea plantations by 2000 mati et al 2005 mcclain et al 2014 the basin encompasses the masai mara national reserve kenya and the serengeti national park along with game reserves in tanzania that attract thousands of tourists due to the rich biodiversity and the annual mass migration of millions of animals in this study we focus on the mara river basin and its five sub basins fig 1 supporting information table s1 two sub basins in the northeast encompass the nyangores and amala tributaries three sub basins in the east encompass the lemek talek and sand tributaries all the five sub basins drain into the mid region of the basin referred to as mid mara discharge data are only available at three discharge stations bomet bridge nyangores river kapkimolwa bridge amala river and mara mine mara river although no ground based streamflow records are available for the other three sub basins they play crucial roles in the water management of the region 3 methodology 3 1 datasets this study involves multiple datasets at different stages climate change projections for the basin were derived using the university of east anglia climate research unit cru harris et al 2014 monthly precipitation and temperature version ts3 2 data precipitation projections from 31 climate models contained in the cmip5 archive using the rcp8 5 radiative forcing scenario and agmerra data the bias correction of the climate data as well as the calibration of the hydrologic mode vic were carried out using the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station chirps dataset which combines both satellite estimates and in situ measurements temperature and wind speed data for the vic model calibration were derived from the national centers for environmental information ncei meteorological station data archive formerly known as ncdc national climatic data center the observed streamflow data were collected from the local water management authority 3 1 1 agmerra climate forcings the agmerra dataset combines nasa s merra reanalyses data rienecker et al 2011 with in situ and remotely sensed observations of precipitation temperature and solar radiation to produce daily high resolution 0 25 fields of climate forcing data with significantly reduced bias ruane et al 2015 relative to observations from 2324 stations in the hadley integrated surface dataset hadisd dunn et al 2012 the product has been shown to compare well with several contemporary forcing datasets including the princeton climate forcing dataset sheffield et al 2006 the water and global change watch forcing dataset wfd weedon et al 2011 wfd with era interim wfd ei weedon et al 2011 and the meteorological forcing dataset the global risk assessment for the stable production of food grasp iizumi et al 2014 additionally agmerra incorporates the merra land dataset reichle 2012 which includes climate prediction center s unified precipitation product chen et al 2008 resulting in significantly improved representation of daily precipitation and extreme events the dataset also incorporates three high resolution satellite based precipitation estimates namely tropical rainfall

cmorph joyce et al 2004 3 1 2 varag future climate forcings in the coming decades interannual climate fluctuations associated with natural variability could be a major contributor to hydrologic variations in many regions around the globe greene et al 2011 such natural variations can also affect short term e g 30 year climate trends and thus projections of near term climate change to address this issue we follow the methodology of greene et al 2012 where we combine information regarding natural climate variations based on observational data with climate model projections used to quantify trends under increased greenhouse gas forcing fig 2 shows the main steps involved in the data preparation technique the first step was to extract seasonal average cru precipitation data along with maximum and minimum temperature data 1901 2013 for a rectangular region 2 5 s 0 n 33 5 e 36 5 e that includes the mara basin only the wet seasons of march may and october december were used in the var model the three variables were then regressed onto the global average surface temperature time series obtained from the average of 31 cmip5 climate model simulations that include increasing greenhouse gases and therefore constitute the anthropogenic signal the regressed relationships were used to de trend the original cru time series data they are subtracted from the original data generating residual values for each variable that constitute natural climate variability the detrended time series seasonal precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature were then used to fit the parameters of the var model that captures both the autocorrelation of each of the three variables as well as the covariance among them once the model parameters were determined the var model was used to generate 200 synthetic climate scenario time series consisting of seasonal average values 31 years in length representing 2020 2050 linear trends from 2020 to 2050 in the three variables were then computed for the region based on 31 cmip5 model projections run under the rcp8 5 scenario representing extreme greenhouse gas emissions riahi et al 2011 from the 31 computed trends the four representing the mean 5th 50th and 95th percentile values were selected these four trend scenarios were then superimposed on each of the 200 synthetic climate simulations to generate what is considered the full range of plausible climate change projections for the basin trend from cmip5 and natural variability from the var for each of these four sets of 200 scenarios the seasonal precipitation averaged over the period 2020 2050 was determined for each set and the mean 5th 50th and 95th percentile values were identified for example in the case of the 5th percentile trend imposed from cmip5 the 5th percentile of seasonal mean rainfall for 2020 2050 was selected from the 200 superimposed time series the purpose of this was to capture how natural variability can either enhance or reduce the imposed trend just by chance as the historical march may and october december rainfall seasons in the mara basin do not show a statistically significant relationship to one another climate scenarios for the march may and october december seasons were computed separately in our approach these seasons were subsequently concatenated with the intervening dry seasons january february june september where the dry seasons for an individual year was chosen randomly from the agmerra data the seasonal temperature trends from the cmip5 model projections were added to the temperature time series from var for all seasons i e including the dry seasons thus we derived 31 year climate projections for the mara basin covering the period 2020 2050 based on the seasonal data to disaggregate the synthetic seasonal climate scenarios down to plausible daily weather sequences a k nearest neighbor approach was employed using all three scenario variables precipitation maximum and minimum temperature for a given season and year the three nearest neighbors in seasonal averages of the agmerra data were identified to add a stochastic element a single nearest neighbor was chosen from the three using a random process with unequal weighting with the largest weighting applied to the first nearest neighbor the difference in seasonal temperature between the scenario value and agmerra nearest neighbor was then computed for each season of each year for precipitation the ratio of the two precipitation values was computed the daily agmerra values for each identified season and year and for each grid point within the mara basin then served as a plausible daily sequence within the season to have the agmerra data exactly match that of the seasonal value of the climate scenario the difference between seasonal scenario and agmerra in seasonal maximum and minimum temperature was added to each daily agmerra value while for precipitation multiplicative adjustment was used the end result was a sequence of daily forcing values covering the period 1 january 2020 to 31 december 2050 for four different wetness scenarios mean and the 5th 50th 95th percentiles 3 1 3 chirps precipitation the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps funk et al 2014 funk et al 2015 is a satellite based quasi global 50 n s 180 w e merged precipitation dataset available from 1981 to near present 1 month latency chirps incorporates information from five different sources 1 pentadally 5 day disaggregated monthly precipitation climatology chpclim 2 quasi global geostationary thermal ir satellite observations from two noaa sources cpc ir ncdc b1 ir 3 trmm 3b42 precipitation estimates 4 precipitation fields from noaa climate forecast system version 2 cfsv2 and 5 in situ precipitation observations both from national and regional sources chg station climatology database ucsb the latest version of chirps version 2 with 0 05 0 05 spatial and daily temporal resolutions is used in this study as per the chirps algorithm cold cloud top 235 k duration is calculated first as the percent of pentad i e the percent of time during the pentad that corresponds to the cold could top then predetermined local regression equations based on trmm 3b42 pentad rainfall estimates are used to convert this duration into mm of precipitation the percent of normal pentad precipitation is calculated by dividing the pentad values by their long term means which is then multiplied by the climate hazards group s precipitation climatology chpclim pentad to produce unbiased gridded precipitation estimates finally for each grid location five nearest station observations are assimilated using weights that are proportional to the square of the correlation coefficients thereby producing the chirps estimates 3 1 4 station data temperature wind speed and discharge the global surface summary of the day gsod products produced by the national climatic data center ncdc in asheville nc currently a part of ncei are used in this study as the in situ observations of precipitation temperature maximum minimum and average and wind speed six of the total available stations had relatively good coverage and so they were used for this study discharge data were available for three sub basins out of six nyangores at bomet bridge amala at kapkimolwa and mara at mara mine with different temporal coverages see supporting information table s2 streamflow values are based on calibrated stage discharge relationships fed with stage measurements the uncertainty in the stage to discharge transformation was not accounted for in this study 3 2 hydrologic model vic the vic model liang et al 1994 is a physically based semi distributed hydrologic model that can solve both water and energy budget equations simultaneously for this study the model was run in water budget mode at a daily time step and a 0 05 spatial resolution independent calculations are carried out at each grid cell and the model accounts for sub grid heterogeneity in a statistical manner vic requires that at least four inputs be provided precipitation maximum air temperature minimum air temperature and wind speed and unless provided explicitly all other required variables are derived within the model from these four inputs see supporting information table s3 the model consists of three soil layers and a thin canopy layer on the top horizontal routing within the model is a two step process first the runoff from each grid cell is routed from that cell to the channel using a triangular unit hydrograph second the water in the channel is routed to the outlet using the linearized st venant s equations lohmann et al 1996 lohmann et al 1998 six parameters of the model were calibrated in this study see supporting information table s4 these are the ones suggested by the developers as being the most sensitive information retrieved from www hydro washington edu lettenmaier models vic documentation calibration shtml general last accessed sept 18 2018 3 3 model calibration discharge data from the three gauge stations bomet kapkimolwa and mara mine did not share a common time frame supporting information table s2 therefore to make the best use of the available data step wise calibration was performed using different calibration and evaluation periods for each sub basin calibration was carried out individually using distributed forcing and the same calibrated parameters were applied in all grid cells the nyangores and amala sub basins were calibrated first individually for their respective outlet points at bomet and kapkimolwa next the mara basin was calibrated using the discharge data from the outlet point at mara mine the final parameter file was prepared by combining the three different sets of parameters corresponding to nyangores amala and mara the shuffled complex evolution university of arizona sce ua duan et al 1992 duan et al 1993 optimization algorithm was used for calibrating the model parameters at a daily time step using chirps as the precipitation forcing the mean squared error of the transformed box and cox 1964 flows was used as the objective function to be minimized the λ parameter of the transformation equation was calculated from the observed streamflow values such that it minimizes the skewness roy et al 2017a 2017b for the ungauged sub basins lemek talek and sand calibrated parameters of the mara basin were implemented note that the quality of streamflow observations was not up to the mark for kapkimolwa bridge and mara mine stations however we still wanted to utilize all the resources we had at our disposal calibration in the λ transformed space is particularly useful in this case in order to capture the mean behavior of the observed streamflow time series this does however deteriorate the error statistics for bomet bridge although the observed hydrograph was captured well by the vic model there were few instances of high peaks in the simulated flows which again deteriorated the error statistics calibration results are presented in supporting information table s5 3 4 precipitation bias correction bias correction of varag raw precipitation data was carried at a monthly time scale on a cell to cell basis using adjusted chirps as the reference data the correction scheme followed two steps first raw chirps data were slightly adjusted in a lumped manner to match the long term means of the local national climatic data center ncdc rain gauges see methodology in roy et al 2017b second cell to cell distributed correction was carried out using a nonparametric quantile mapping approach where the cumulative distribution functions cdfs were approximated by kernel densities although the applications of kernel densities are widespread rosenblatt 1956 silverman 1981 sheather and jones 1991 kim et al 2003 they have not been used widely within the context of quantile mapping based bias correction in this method the probability distributions of the raw and the reference data are approximated by kernel densities which helps overcome several weaknesses associated with the use of purely empirical distributions e g lack of smoothness or theoretical distributions e g frequent over smoothing quantile mapping is used to match the distribution quantiles of the raw data rw to that of the reference data rf thereby producing the bias corrected data bc with statistical properties similar to the reference data mathematically this can be shown as 1 bc f rf 1 f rw r w where f rw is the cdf of the raw data and f rf 1 is the inverse cdf of the reference data the cdfs of raw and reference data are approximated using kernel density functions which can be expressed as 2 f x 1 nb i 1 n k x i x b where f x is the estimated density at point x x i is the sample point at i th location n is the total number of sample points k is the kernel and b is the bandwidth the kernel function represents the influence of adjacent points based on their distance from the evaluation point as this distance increases the associated weight decreases thus any sample point probability is characterized by not only the probability at that point but also by the probability associated with the neighboring points in a continuously decreasing manner with distance away from the evaluation point using some kernel function e g triangular gaussian etc the bandwidth in kernel density estimation controls the bias variance trade off if the bandwidth is too small the kernel densities overfit the data i e the variance increases on the contrary if the bandwidth is too large the kernel densities underfit the data which means that the bias is increased here the bandwidth was adjusted manually to implement the nonparametric quantile mapping scheme we used 1d interpolation with nearest neighborhood smoothing on the precipitation values and the cumulative probabilities bias correction of varag raw precipitation was carried out on a monthly time scale following which the bias corrected monthly values were temporally disaggregated to daily level based on precipitation intensities with the implicit assumption that higher rainfall intensities are associated with larger bias and vice versa the correction was not implemented on a daily level because the reference chirps data are produced from pentad climatologies which do not accurately represent the daily variability of precipitation 4 results and discussion 4 1 precipitation characteristics the comparison between the basin averaged mean monthly precipitation from agmerra and chirps for the time period 1981 2010 common time frame for all six sub basins is shown in fig 3 for each case it also reports the bias factor i e the ratio between the long term means of chirps reference and agmerra raw bias factors greater than one imply underestimation in long term of agmerra and vice versa as can be seen the type of bias varies with the case agmerra significantly underestimates precipitation in the mountainous nyangores and amala sub basins shows slight underestimation for the mid mara region and sand sub basin and slight overestimation for the talek and lemek this is also evident in the empirical cdf plots where the upper two sub basins show significant differences underestimation of agmerra whereas the remaining four sub basins have very similar probability distribution characteristics next we compared future precipitation from raw varag against historical chirps supporting information fig s1 to see whether or not varag precipitation is significantly different from agmerra precipitation and if chirps could at all be used as the reference data we found that the agmerra and varag precipitation have very similar mean bias and distribution characteristics which is also the reason why chirps was finalized for bias correcting the future data fig 4 shows monthly precipitation distributions and means for 1 basin averaged rain gauge measurements 2 chirps precipitation 3 agmerra precipitation and 4 average wetness varag precipitation as can be seen the bimodality of mara rainfall is well represented in all four datasets the primary rainy season is during march may and the secondary during october december varag precipitation has less spread overall the plot in the last row shows monthly bias factors corresponding to chirps agmerra and varag calculated using the rain gauge measurements as the reference bias factor reference raw all three products have similar temporal patterns for the bias factor with agmerra and varag having the closest match overall the bias factor values are closer to 1 during the rainy seasons and higher during the dry periods which means on an average the dry period precipitation is underestimated by agmerra assuming that the rain gauge measurements during those periods are reasonably accurate similar behavior is expected in the future as demonstrated in varag if we assume stationarity since the statistical properties are not expected to change significantly within the short time period it is important to note that the assumption of stationarity is only meaningful when short term analysis is concerned for analysis in longer time scales treatment of nonstationarity becomes crucial 4 2 precipitation bias correction since the probability distributions of monthly agmerra and varag precipitation were quite similar see fig 3 and supporting information fig s1 the bias correction method was first tested with the agmerra data for historical time period 1981 2010 to see how closely the bias corrected values match the reference data i e gauge adjusted chirps bias correction results for four different grid cells from different parts of the mara river basin are shown in supporting information fig s2 where the type of bias whether underestimation or overestimation is not consistent across the grid cells the sorted values closely follow the 45 line indicating that the bias correction has been successful fig 5 presents the bias correction results for the historical time period for the entire study area clearly bias correction scheme has successfully matched all the four moments mean standard deviation skewness and kurtosis of the raw monthly agmerra data to that of the gauge adjusted chirps note that the use of kernel density functions and the careful selection of the bandwidth value are the key reasons why bias correction has been so efficient in this case bias correction results similar to fig 5 of varag precipitation are shown in supporting information fig s3 4 3 precipitation projections three different future precipitation scenarios dry average and wet are studied with and without the bias correction fig 6 assuming that the reference chirps corresponds to average wetness condition we only bias correct the average scenario of varag the anomalies of dry and wet scenarios are calculated by subtracting them from the raw means which are then added back to the corrected means to get the corrected dry and wet scenarios the negative values produced thereby are all set to zero thus we can have three different scenarios both before and after the bias correction which would not be possible had we been bias correcting all three scenarios directly because in that case the bias correction algorithm would consider dryness and wetness as biases and tend to correct them such that they match the mean scenario this method implicitly assumes that the magnitude of the bias during average wetness conditions is equal during wet and dry conditions the accumulated precipitation plots shown in fig 6 are useful to detect 1 differences in total precipitation at the end of the analysis period and 2 any drastic change in precipitation over time as reflected by the slope of the curves as can be seen none of the six sub basins showed a noticeable change in the slopes for the different scenarios therefore no drastic change in precipitation is expected in the next three decades differences between the dry and wet scenario precipitation at the end of the time period are similar for all six sub basins whereas in case of streamflow these differences are maximum for the mountainous sub basins difference between the dry and wet precipitation scenarios was maximum in the overall basin 199 mm followed by the lemek sub basin 164 mm and minimum for the amala sub basin 130 mm the effect of bias correction is marginal for lemek and talek where the bias factors are lower than but very close to 1 0 93 and 0 94 respectively the slope of the bias corrected precipitation is always higher for all sub basins for lemek and talek again the increase in slope after bias correction is marginal 4 4 hydrologic projections hydrologic simulations are carried out for three consecutive decades 2021 2030 2031 2040 and 2041 2050 using the calibrated vic model with both raw and bias corrected future climate precipitation projections to also study the effects of bias correction other variables maximum temperature minimum temperature and wind speed are used directly from varag without any adjustment with this hydrologic modeling exercise we want to assess the impacts of short term near term climate change on the hydrology of the mara river basin note that the agmerra data used for other variables within the varag dataset are already bias corrected extensively see ruane et al 2015 and therefore their use in the hydrologic model is justified future work will focus on bias correcting those variables as well to see if performance could be improved in this study we had a reliable reference dataset for precipitation chirps which we used to bias correct the main driver of the hydrologic model i e precipitation the average yearly difference between the wet and the dry scenario streamflows was maximum 141 mm for the nyangores sub basin whereas the minimum difference was found in case of the sand sub basin 92 mm in terms of et the maximum difference was found in the overall basin 101 mm followed by the talek sub basin 89 mm and the minimum in the amala sub basins 61 mm the effects of bias correction are more prominent for nyangores and amala figs 6 and 7 for all three scenarios vic simulates streamflows of higher magnitude after the bias correction for these two sub basins this behavior is expected since the corresponding bias factors are also higher see supporting information fig s1 meaning that the bias corrected precipitation would be higher in terms of magnitude as compared to the raw precipitation the next noticeable change in streamflow is found in case of the sand sub basin which lies in the southern part of the mara river basin in this case the streamflow magnitude increases slightly when the bias corrected precipitation is used streamflow changes are not significant in lemek and talek sub basins for the two mountainous sub basins nyangores and amala vic simulation results show that the streamflows for both average and wet scenarios will be very similar fig 6 in other words streamflow magnitude will be higher which happens in the expense of et since the simulated et in the average scenario is close to the simulated et from the dry scenario lower magnitude the cumulative distributions of streamflows corresponding to the historical chirps and three varag wetness scenarios are shown in supporting information fig s4 the distributions of daily precipitation et and streamflow appear to be quite similar in the three successive decades considered in this study supporting information fig s5 although the outliers show some differences the median and the interquartile range do not change significantly this is indicative of the fact that at shorter time scales natural variability of climate can obscure climate change signals being a scenario based dataset varag shows how different wetness conditions might look like in the future thus fig 6 gives us a sense of uncertainty in different hydrologic variables based on the wetness scenarios note that since the wetness scenarios are based on seasonal values after disaggregation using agmerra it is possible to have situations where a daily value from the dry scenario is actually higher than the wet scenario therefore the varag scenarios cannot be used directly in the hydrologic model to calculate the corresponding daily streamflow percentiles 4 5 trend analysis mann kendall test at 5 significance level was performed on precipitation et and streamflow during the wet seasons march may and october december for all three bias corrected wetness scenarios in the basin for precipitation the complete time period 2020 2050 was considered whereas for et and streamflows 2020 was excluded in order to remove the effects of model spin up except for sand the total primary rainy season precipitation march may total showed statistically significant increasing trends for the average wetness scenario in all cases whereas the same scenario did not show any significant trend for the secondary rainy season october december total the dry and wet scenarios did not show significant trends in any of the sub basins for either of the rainy seasons streamflow did not show any statistically significant trend for any of the rainy seasons and wetness scenarios in any of the sub basins for the average wetness scenario increasing trends in et were found in all cases expect for sand during the primary rainy season and in mara and lemek during the secondary rainy season the wet scenario did not show any statistically significant trend in et whereas the dry scenario showed positive trend during the primary rainy season in nyangores and amala soil moisture showed statistically significant increasing trends during the primary rainy season in both the average and wet scenarios for mara nyangores and amala additionally for lemek in the average scenario however no statistically significant trend was found in any of the wetness scenarios for annual precipitation et streamflow and soil moisture in any of the sub basins while temperature both minimum and maximum showed statistically significant positive annual trends for all the sub basins thus even with projected increases in seasonal rainfall in some sub basins and wetness scenarios they are found to have little influence on the overall hydrology of the basin relative to the current climate when viewed on an annual basis increasing et on an annual time scale even though the trends are not statistically significant they are still positive acts to reduce the runoff which might not show decreasing trends since the precipitation is also increasing on subseasonal time scales increasing temperatures will serve to exacerbate dry conditions when they do occur even if only driven by natural variability we also carried out a comparison between the raw and the bias corrected varag precipitation for all three scenarios to see if bias correction is affecting the trend signals in the raw data it was found that overall bias correction did not alter much the temporal trends of the raw data 4 6 streamflow uncertainty information about streamflow uncertainty is crucial for hydrologic designs and applications however it is almost impossible to get a true estimate of uncertainty for the future simply because we are not certain about how the future would look like in reality the estimated uncertainties are rather subjective oftentimes very sensitive to the approach implemented for their estimation if sufficient computational resources are available one could calculate an ensemble of streamflow projections however the uncertainty thereof given by the ensemble spread will be solely based on how good the ensemble members are clearly this approach does not account for the actual errors moreover the uncertainty estimates will change further depending on how the ensemble is generated an alternative approach to ensemble based uncertainty is to use the historical errors and superimpose them on the future values the error superimposition can be done for different time scales in case of daily streamflows the errors from the entire historical time period could be superimposed on the daily values of the future streamflows alternatively historical errors can be separated into months or even days and the superimposition can be carried out for the corresponding months or days an important aspect of error calculation is the effect of skewness in highly skewed variables such as precipitation or streamflow the skewness would impact the errors therefore it is important to remove the skewness from the variables before calculating the errors the error superimposition can be carried out in the transformed space skewness is reduced and the resulting streamflow values can then be transferred back to the original space for long term assessment nonstationarity could be an unavoidable issue in which case the errors calculated in the past will be irrelevant for the future in this study we first checked if the standard deviations of the daily streamflow errors changed much in the past for each month although there were changes evident it was difficult to find common patterns furthermore it is also problematic to extrapolate the trend line of the historical standard deviations to derive standard deviations for the future simply because we do not know how that change whether linear exponential etc would be in reality therefore in this study we assumed the streamflow error distributions to be stationary which is a reasonable assumption given that our focus is on short term impacts assessment next we removed the skewness using the box cox transformation where the lambda parameter was calculated such that the skewness was minimized roy et al 2017a 2017b we then applied three variations of the error superimposition approach in method 1 we superimposed monthly errors in method 2 daily error values were used and finally in method 3 we applied bootstrapping on the daily errors fig 8 note that in method 2 and method 3 daily error distributions were sparse for example in nyangores river basin we had 14 years of historical records resulting in only 14 error values for each day of the year in most cases the errors did not have zero mean therefore we forced the mean to be zero for daily errors to ensure that we capture only the error variance and no artificial bias is introduced in the process additionally in method 3 instead of regular bootstrapping we implemented balanced bootstrapping where the difference between the observation mean and the mean of the bootstrapped sample means are added to the latter to remove the bias note that out of the six sub basins within the main mara basin only three had streamflow observations with the nyangores river basin station bomet bridge having the best quality data therefore we demonstrate the streamflow uncertainty analysis for this sub basin only for the ungauged basins an ad hoc approach of uncertainty characterization would be to use bootstrapped confidence intervals calculated from the daily values in each season out of the three methods presented we recommend the use of method 1 since it yields to more robust estimates of the uncertainty as the distributions are not sparse in this case and also there is no need for forcing the error means to be zero method 3 produces the narrowest bounds however these are not necessarily more realistic as compared to the more conservative bounds from method 1 it is important to note that the three wetness scenarios themselves provide a sense of the extreme and mean hydrologic behavior of the basins the error superimposition adds an additional layer of uncertainty on the scenarios 5 summary and concluding remarks in this study we evaluate the potential impacts of short term 3 decades climate change on the hydrology of the mara river basin and its sub basins in east africa predictability of climate is reduced significantly at such short time span due to the inherent natural variability on the other hand it is oftentimes more relevant to assess the impacts of short term climate change for water resources management and infrastructure designing in this study we capture the natural variability of climate using a statistical model var and derive daily scenario values based on the agmerra data we bias correct the new data varag using the satellite and observation based merged dataset chirps and use it as input to the land surface model vic to investigate the hydrological impacts we particularly focus on three different scenarios representing the mean avergae dry 5th percentile and wet 95th percentile conditions varag and agmerra have very similar mean bias and distribution characteristics and they also along with chirps well capture the climatology of the bimodal precipitation in the mara river basin the bias factors ratio between reference and raw data calculated in this study are higher 1 indicates underestimation over the mountainous sub basins of the north nyangores and amala agreeing with similar findings about the underestimation of satellite based precipitation estimates over the mountainous regions gebremichael et al 2014 therefore bias correction was more in effect in these two sub basins the bias correction method implemented in this study using kernel densities successfully matched all four distributional moments of the raw data to that of the reference data moreover it did not alter much the temporal trends of the raw data seasonal trend analysis revealed that the increasing trends in precipitation during the primary rainy season will lead to more water availability which will not only increase soil moisture but also et with the latter also be driven by increasing temperatures annually there is no substantial increase in precipitation in the next three decades as shown by the varag data cmip5 model outputs combined with natural variability which relates to the frequent drought events in the region another implication of these results could be that the primary rainy season in the sub basins for most of them will have more rain however since the overall annual precipitation is not changing much this could lead to higher peak flows during the rainy seasons not necessarily increased total flow and more dryness during the non rainy seasons which have been suggested in some recent studies e g mati et al 2008 mango et al 2011 it should be noted that in our study approach projected rainfall trends from the cmip5 models are for seasonal totals that are superimposed on natural variability on this time scale and subsequently disaggregated to daily sequences using the agmerra dataset as such we do not explicitly examine changes in daily extreme events within the cmip5 models although seasonal rainfall trends will influence the magnitude of daily totals including extremes in our approach our methodology assumes that in the near term 10 30 years climate variability will be very similar to that of the present climate which may not be a suitable assumption on longer timescales under increasing greenhouse gas forcing given this our methodology is not ideal for the analysis of daily rainfall trends the strength of the var approach is to allow for the generation of thousands of plausible future climate scenarios enabling us to build probability distributions of projected climate change that include the important role of unforced climate variability on near term trends acknowledgement this work was supported by the nasa usaid servir program through award 11 servir11 58 thanks to ashutosh

6977,urbanization modifies the hydrologic cycle resulting in increased runoff rates volumes and peak flows in the drainage network in this paper the implementation of green roofs as source control solutions for mitigating the impacts of urbanization is analysed at the urban catchment scale the hydrologic hydraulic response of a 2 km2 urban basin is investigated under various implementation scenarios and rainfall characteristics in particular a distributed hydrologic model is employed to assess the impact of 4 spatially homogeneous installations of green roofs 25 50 75 100 of roofs area converted when forced by 6 storms differing in both duration and return period in addition a spatially heterogeneous configuration is tested with green roofs concentrated where the drainage network is more prone to high degrees of filling results show that implementing green roofs at the urban watershed scale can be considered a valuable strategy to reduce both flow peak and volume in urban drainage networks although the approach is more effective for frequent storms of smaller magnitude in addition it is found that the urban system may respond non linearly to the extent of green roofs implementation in terms of peak flow reduction at the network outlet and that non linearity is mainly related to the network being close to its flow convey capability finally planning redevelopment efforts on the basis of local insufficiencies in network convey capacity has the potential of increasing the effectiveness of low impact development solutions keywords distributed hydrologic modelling low impact development urban stormwater runoff management flood risk mitigation green roofs lids planning 1 introduction urbanization is typically accompanied by expansion of impervious surfaces such as roofs and roads compaction of soils and modification of vegetation these alterations may reduce rainfall infiltration and hence increase stormwater runoff in terms of both rate and volume as a consequence evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge decrease whereas erosion in streams and pollutants load to downstream ecosystems increase bean et al 2007 fassman and blackbourn 2010 grebel et al 2013 causing the well documented decline of habitats and water quality in urban channels elliott and trowsdale 2007 to cope with the modified regime of stormwater runoff hydraulically efficient drainage systems are usually built in the urban environment however traditional management approaches focusing on conveyance and detention have little to no effect on channel erosion localized flooding and water quality fry and maxwell 2017 such limitations have raised the interest in nature based solutions or green infrastructure for achieving a more comprehensive mitigation of the impacts that urbanization has on the hydrologic cycle barbosa et al 2012 burian et al 2000 burns et al 2012 chocat et al 2001 delleur 2003 gleick 2003 these natural systems use low impact development controls lids that can mimic pre development hydrology and manage and treat urban stormwater in a distributed manner dietz 2007 newcomer et al 2014 roy et al 2008 in particular lid approaches implement small scale hydrologic controls for infiltrating filtering storing evaporating and detaining runoff close to the source point ahiablame et al 2012 2013 palla and gnecco 2015 thereby watersheds partially recover pre urbanization conditions these sustainable runoff management measures have a prominent role in regional directives for flood protection and hydrogeological hazard prevention especially where a high density of impervious surfaces occurs wilkinson et al 2014 indeed currently the urgent need to introduce soft mitigation measures for managing rainwater and reducing storm runoff has led many regional water agencies in italy and elsewhere to increasingly promote directives addressed to the concept of hydrologic hydraulic invariance among which the lombardy region law n 4 of 8 april 2016 and the emilia romagna region law 1860 2015 stating that the peak flow generated by any newly urbanized area has to remain unvaried after land transformation the adoption of this concept requires the design of specific mitigation compensatory measures as well as the definition of their appropriate allocation at the urban catchment scale in order to decrease runoff where most needed therefore although urban lids such as bioretention systems porous pavements permeable patios rain barrels cisterns green roofs wet ponds and dry ponds appear to be suitable practices to meet hydrologic hydraulic invariance anticipating their overall impact on the urban drainage system is not straightforward many model based results confirm the role of lid solutions in restoring natural flow regime at the urban catchment scale lee et al 2012a b fry and maxwell 2017 but their effectiveness could depend on i the spatial location of these devices that is often in conflict with the location of areas where redevelopment would be possible ii the complexity of the urban drainage network and iii the magnitude of storm events in this work the smart green software chiaradia et al 2018 designed to simulate runoff formation and propagation in the urban environment and integrating lid control facilities is used to explore the impacts of green roofs on stormwater runoff and the draining sewer system at the urban catchment scale performances are evaluated across a range of storm intensity and duration for multiple degrees of implementation and various spatial configurations the investigation aims at offering a thorough assessment of green roofs potentialities at the urban basin scale including the impact on both runoff generation and sewer system draining capabilities understanding whether and to what extent the structure of the sewer system already present in the urban catchment affects the effectiveness of redevelopment scenario is of primary importance for watershed scale lids planning the work discusses strengths and weaknesses of implementing green roofs at the urban basin scale on a real case study attempting to evaluate the obtainable advantages for the actual drainage network without any simplification or modification of its layout this will enrich awareness and knowledge on the actual effectiveness of lid approaches at the urban watershed scale and help identifying where structural measures on the sewer system appear essential to prevent excessive filling of conduits or overflow from network nodes furthermore we explore the possibility of defining a rationale that could guide green roofs spatial planning at the urban watershed scale in order to enhance their effectiveness 2 materials and methods 2 1 smart green software the software is composed of two main blocks i the actual modelling system named mobidic u and ii the surrounding graphic user interface gui developed as a qgis plugin and mainly dedicated to the preparation of the input data and the analysis of the results a full integration of a hydrological model into a qgis plugin provides the advantage of employing a comprehensive and detailed modelling approach while maintaining an easy and efficient setup of simulations thanks to the functionalities typical of a gis collection and analysis of spatial data in particular the software allows a straightforward implementation of lid solutions in the area of study representing a valuable tool for planners who evaluate the impact of lids on stormwater management at the catchment scale more information about the smart green framework can be found in chiaradia et al 2018 2 1 1 modelling component mobidic u modello di bilancio idrologico distribuito e continuo aree urbane is a hydrologic model designed to simulate runoff formation and propagation in the urban environment capable of including the effect of lid systems it is a specialisation of the model mobidic modello di bilancio idrologico distribuito e continuo ercolani and castelli 2017 yang et al 2014a b castelli et al 2009 campo et al 2006 which can deal with terrains draining towards a natural channel network in accordance with the topographic slope mobidic u shares with mobidic the basic modelling features but various algorithms have been developed to describe the peculiarities of the urban environment specifically the following characteristics are in common with mobidic i fully distributed approach for both parameters and results raster based discretization of the area of study ii computationally efficient and parsimonious representation of soil moisture dynamics and surface runoff formation castillo et al 2015 soil is vertically discretized into one single layer conceptually subdivided into two non linear interconnected reservoirs corresponding to larger pores draining water under gravity gravitational reservoir and smaller pores holding water through capillary forces capillary reservoir accordingly the maximum storage capacity of the two reservoirs may be parametrized as respectively the maximum water content above field capacity wgmax and the difference between field capacity and residual water content wcmax in addition each computational cell includes three other conceptual non linear reservoirs i e the interception reservoir characterized by a finite volumetric capability wpmax the surface ponding reservoir and the phreatic aquifer reservoir fig 1 illustrates the hydrologic fluxes pertaining to the 5 compartments and their mutual connections a detailed description of governing equations may be found in ercolani and castelli 2017 mobidic u combines the previous characteristics with the following ones i the drainage network is described through a couple of interdependent vector layers one polyline type representing conduits and one point type representing network nodes the layers should include topological geometrical and hydraulic attributes ii the flow routing through the drainage network employs the de saint venant equations in the conduits and mass conservation in the nodes the algorithm is capable of dealing with a complex network topology e g closed circuits james et al 2010 iii the routing of surface runoff and hypodermic flow from the production cell to the receiving node of the drainage network takes into account that the flow path in the urban environment is rarely determined by terrain slope e g presence of elevated surfaces such as roofs furthermore information about topography at the level of detail required to route the flow properly throughout a urban watershed is rarely available accordingly the flow generated in any cell of the domain is routed to the drainage network through a linear delay reservoir one for surface runoff and one for hypodermic flow the delay parameter is modulated on the basis of the geometric distance between the production cell and the nearest network node and local hydraulic properties i e soil hydraulic conductivity for hypodermic flow and surface roughness characteristics for runoff iv the water balance approach previously described for a generic computational cell is adapted to capture the essence of the hydrologic behaviour of lid solutions for instance percolation and capillary rise will be null for any cell belonging to a green roof and no aquifer volume will be included drainage flow from the gravitational reservoir corresponding to the hypodermic flow in the generic description of the balance and surface runoff will be the only outflows during a storm event the advantage of such approach is twofold first it is completely coherent with the rest of the model adding robustness to comparisons between no lids and lids scenarios secondly adopting a physically based description of lids functioning makes the recovering of lids hydrologic parameters extremely straightforward since they are derivable directly from constructional characteristics of any single implementation e g for green roofs layers number and thickness and media hydraulic conductivity porosity field capacity and residual volumetric water content the increasing number of studies aiming at identifying values of conceptual parameters that describe properly lids hydrologic functioning e g cn in the usda cn method testifies the added value of a physically based approach e g carter and rasmussen 2006 getter et al 2007 alfredo et al 2010 damodaram et al 2010 fassman beck et al 2016 although potentially able to run continuous simulations over long periods mobidic u is specifically designed for event based runs 2 1 2 gis interface structure mobidic u may be fully integrated in the gis environment thanks to a freely downloadable qgis www qgis org plugin developed specifically to support model users the general aim of the plugin is to exploit typical gis functionalities spatial data collection and analysis to manage easily and efficiently both inputs and outputs of mobidic u in particular the plugin includes i a friendly gui to facilitate using the model ii tools to import information easily from external databases iii tools to check automatically the consistency of the sewer network and to fix missing or uncoherent data e g elevation of nodes bottom unknown or higher than the invert of a connected pipe iv tools to view and analyse results quickly and easily additional details about specific functionalities and data organization are available in chiaradia et al 2018 2 2 study context the area of study is the sedriano municipality which is located in the north west portion of the metropolitan city of milan in northern italy fig 2 the challenge that the metropolitan city of milan is facing is that the current stormwater infrastructure is undersized or non existent and will not be able to sustain the anticipated population growth and watershed modifications many municipalities need to address similar issues and are looking for resilient options to mitigate the impacts on water quantity and quality barbosa et al 2012 burns et al 2012 sedriano municipality represents an adequate case study for multiple reasons first the territory consists of a mix of residential industrial and commercial areas in line with many municipalities of the metropolitan city of milan and emblematic of urban territories in general secondly the outlet of the drainage network was monitored during late months of 2016 allowing for a basic model calibration third during rainfall events inflows to the urban drainage network coincide essentially with stormwater and possible additional inputs are neglected the municipality of sedriano is 7 7 km2 large the boundary of the municipality is marked in red in fig 2 with a total population of about 12 000 inhabitants and a density of 1500 inhabitants per km2 the topography is flat on average 140 m a s l the portion of the municipality surface considered in the study is about 1 9 km2 colored portion of the map in fig 2 with a total impervious area of about 0 69 km2 which includes residential commercial and industrial buildings roads and parking lots buildings roofs are around 56 of this total impervious area i e 0 39 km2 the study context is characterized by a humid subtropical climate according to the kӧppen classification system peel et al 2007 during the year the average temperature is about 10 c while total rainfall is around 800 mm the sedriano urban drainage network managed by cap holding spa is about 23 5 km long and constituted by 686 conduits and 651 nodes mainly representing manholes the sewerage is a combined system designed to collect both sewage and urban stormwater during rainfall events the flow in the sewerage systems is gravity driven overall conduits are designed considering rainfall whose return period ranges from 2 to 10 years resulting in diameters between 0 1 m and 1 5 m fig 3 a in this range diameters between 0 3 and 0 5 m prevail covering more than 50 of conduits on the basis of diameters spatial distribution the sewer system appears to converge the flow into a central main conduit with a diameter enlarging from 0 8 to 1 6 m which develops along the north south direction of the municipality however the chaotic slope layout fig 3b with a considerable number of flat or almost flat conduits does not always allow a regular delivery of water from the outermost conduits to the innermost ones moreover the urban expansion in the last fifty years has increased the entanglement of conduits and the lack of regulations requiring to map and georeference the sewer infrastructure up to 2014 made a systematic planning of conduits distribution impossible furthermore the sewer system includes numerous closed circuits which combined with low slopes make it impossible to know a priori the flow direction during a rainfall event the significant presence of flat or almost flat conduits about 14 of conduits with slope lower than 0 1 and 28 lower than 0 2 and even a few improper counter slopes facilitates undesired backflows and overflows from nodes as the water manager has observed in the field the described complexity and peculiarity of the drainage network make sedriano an interesting case study for the assessment of green roofs potential in stormwater management indeed predicting the impact of a number of systems distributed over the catchment is not straightforward when a complex drainage network is involved e g reducing runoff production in a certain area of the catchment may modify flow direction in some conduits finally leading to an unexpected increment of discharge in other portions of the network 2 3 model setup as described in section 2 1 1 mobidic u requires a couple of interdependent shapefiles to represent the sewer system one corresponding to conduits and one to network nodes for sedriano network both layers are available from the local water manager cap holding spa complete with attributes needed by the model i e for conduits diameter elevation of the initial and final invert constituent material or manning s coefficient and for nodes surface extension bottom and top elevation as well as topological information about mutual connections inconsistencies or missing data are detected and fixed through semi automatic tools offered by smart green qgis plugin see section 2 1 2 the network is composed of 686 conduits and 651 nodes note that 17 of conduits and 39 of nodes have been treated to fix inconsistencies or missing information the minimum and average conduit length is 0 5 m and 34 m respectively for a total of about 23 5 km in terms of urban watershed description mobidic u requires 4 spatially distributed physically based parameters i e wcmax wgmax wpmax as described in section 2 1 1 and surface layer saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and 4 lumped conceptual parameters in particular these latter are rate coefficients dimensionally inverse of a time regulating i absorption of gravitational water by smaller pores k ii percolation of gravitational water γ iii maximum local production of hypodermic flow from gravitational water β iv maximum local production of surface runoff from surface water α details about equations involving these parameters may be found in ercolani and castelli 2017 the maps of the physically based parameters are derived on the basis of soil properties and land use characteristics and refined through calibration if possible for sedriano municipality the employed sources of information are lombardy region pedological map and topographic database both freely available from the institutional website www geoportale regione lombardia it the first one offers quite a rough description of soil types spatial patterns in respect to the extension of the analysis since our watershed is about 1 9 km2 and the nominal scale of the pedological map is 1 250 000 however it offers a support in determining model parameters directly related to soil properties such as wgmax and wcmax which depend on porosity field capacity and residual water content in particular the pedological map shows that sedriano municipality is completely included in an area occupied by coarse textured soils more than 94 of sandy loam texture and less than 6 of loamy sand texture the regional topographic database contains a series of layers representing elements constituting the territory such as buildings roads agricultural fields woods etc on the basis of such information and in order to maintain a parsimonious and exportable approach only two hydrological classes are identified in the basin representing respectively impervious and pervious areas imperviousness is associated to buildings roads and parking lots as identifiable from the regional topographic database and shown in black roads and parking lots and red buildings in fig 2 the remaining areas are included in a unique class intended to represent a generic slightly vegetated coarse textured urban soil no information is available to further differentiate properties of pervious patches with a reasonable level of confidence table 1 lists the values of physically based parameters for the 2 hydrologic classes and those of lumped conceptual parameters the rationale employed to select the values is as follows physically based parameters corresponding to pervious areas are derived considering the characteristics of the predominant soil type in sedriano municipality and a non negligible rainfall initial abstraction due for instance to interception by vegetation the same parameters for the impervious class and the conceptual parameters α and β are calibrated against one rainfall event recorded during the monitoring period typical average values are assumed for the remaining lumped conceptual parameters k and γ mainly on the basis of previous modelling experiences e g ercolani and castelli 2017 finally conduits manning s coefficient is selected on the basis of constituent material in particular 0 013 m s 1 3 is assumed for all the conduits since they are plastic pipes the whole setup is validated against the 2 remaining rainfall events that occurred during the monitoring period details about calibration and validation are in the following section the watershed is discretized with a spatial resolution of 5 m such that singles buildings and roads are fully represented the hydrological time step is 1 min while flow routing through conduits in the network employs substeps of 3 s 2 3 1 calibration and validation sedriano sewer system was monitored from august to november 2016 by a specialized company bm tecnologie padue italy flow was measured at network outlet through a kaptor multi doppler device and precipitation through a delta ohm hd 2013 tipping bucket rain gauge this latter was installed in a service area in the adjacent municipality vittuone about 1 9 km far from the barycentre of sedriano urban catchment during the monitoring period 3 noteworthy rainfall events occurred the first one on august 5th the second one on september 21st and the third on october 14th all the events were moderate with respectively a total rainfall depth of 19 55 8 and 32 6 mm a duration of about 1 25 17 33 7 5 h and a maximum instantaneous intensity equal to 55 2 36 and 31 2 mm hour we assume that rainfall measured by vittuone rain gauge is representative for sedriano urban basin and feed the model with spatially homogeneous precipitation since no additional information is available the event of august 5th is employed for a trial and error calibration aimed at refining the description of impervious patches and the 2 most relevant lumped conceptual parameters accordingly the calibrated parameters are wcmax wgmax wpmax and ks for roads parking slots and impervious roofs and α the other 2 events are used to validate the whole model setup hydrographs of observed and modelled outflow are compared in terms of both volume and discharges in particular the percentage error on the peak flow peqmax and total volume pevol are computed as well as the nash sutchliffe efficiency nse index nash and sutcliffe 1970 to assess the instantaneous match between model and observations fig 4 shows the hydrograph at sedriano network outlet for the 3 rainfall events with the black continuous line corresponding to modelled flows and red dots to observations in addition total precipitation over the urban basin is plotted in grey table 2 summarizes model performances for the 3 events overall the model can simulate properly runoff formation and propagation in the urban basin and sewer network of sedriano the match is excellent for the calibration event fig 4a with the nse greater than 0 9 and only a slight underestimation of peak flow peqmax equal to 4 88 and overestimation of volume pevol equal to 12 92 the validation event of october 14th fig 4c shows that the model is capable of describing hydrologic and hydraulic responses of sedriano urban basin and drainage network even when triggered by more complex rainfall events multi peak longer duration with nse equal to 0 63 and peqmax to 0 69 for the sake of completeness results corresponding to the last available rainfall event september 21st in fig 4b are included however it is clearly visible that measured rainfall and flow are not coherent neither in terms of quantity nor of timing two inconsistencies are particularly evident i the first flow event starting around 08 30 is anticipated in respect to rainfall i e flow begins to rise before rainfall occurs ii the system does not respond at all to the third rainfall sub event the one after 12 00 although intensity and total depth are comparable to those of the main sub event of october 14th fig 4c to which the system responds clearly moreover this sub event occurs after previous significant precipitation i e the system is not dry and a negligible flow at the outlet is unrealistic the discrepancy between precipitation and flow observations may be due to the fact that the rain gauge is placed about 1 9 km far from sedriano urban basin and hence not fully representative of local precipitation instead a very accurate assessment of rainfall spatio temporal variability is required in urban hydrology where the spatial and temporal scales are relatively small niemczynowicz 1999 fletcher et al 2013 accordingly also measured and modelled flows cannot match since they are triggered by different rainfall 2 3 2 green roofs parametrization green roofs are the lid devices whose implementation at the catchment scale is investigated in the present study as described in section 2 1 1 the parsimonious 5 compartments scheme employed by mobidic and mobidic u for water balance in soil castillo et al 2015 ercolani and castelli 2017 can be easily specialized to represent green roof cells with ad hoc modifications i e turning off improper hydrologic fluxes such as percolation or capillary rise accordingly the hydrologic behaviour of green roof cells depends on the same 4 physically based parameters previously discussed i e wcmax wgmax wpmax ks which can be derived from constructional characteristics of the specific implementation to represent in the present study all the green roofs follow the design presented by palla et al 2009 with a total thickness of 35 cm without vegetative cover in detail the stratigraphy is primarily constituted by a first drainage layer of vulcaflor 20 cm thick and a second structural layer of lapillus 15 cm thick the first layer is characterized by a porosity of 0 650 m3 m 3 a saturated hydraulic conductivity of 0 08 cm s 1 a field capacity of 0 400 m3 m 3 and a residual soil moisture of 0 165 m3 m 3 conversely the second layer has a porosity of 0 600 m3 m 3 a saturated hydraulic conductivity of 0 33 cm s 1 a field capacity of 0 560 m3 m 3 and a residual soil moisture of 0 155 m3 m 3 these constructional characteristics correspond to the value of parameters reported in table 1 2 4 modelling experiments in order to assess the impact of green roofs implementation at the urban catchment scale a series of redevelopment scenarios are simulated and compared with the current configuration the no conversion scenario this reference configuration corresponds to that employed for calibration and validation experiments where all the roofs are impervious see fig 2 a first set of simulations converts impervious roofs to green roofs homogeneously over the basin without any preferential spatial pattern for their implementation the impact of such spatially homogeneous conversions are assessed under different rainfall conditions in particular 4 percentages of rooftops conversions 25 50 75 and 100 are combined with 6 different hyetographs for a total of 30 simulations for each hyetograph the reference no conversion scenario is also modelled partial conversions 25 50 and 75 are randomly distributed with the constraint of spatial homogeneity at the catchment scale namely in any subcatchment contributing to a specific node of the network the same percentage of roofs area is converted through a random selection hyetographs are synthetic obtained from the intensity duration frequency relationship derived by arpa for sedriano area and adopting a uniform shape in particular 2 return periods 2 and 10 years and 3 rainfall durations 35 60 and 120 min are considered the selected return periods are in the range of those employed to design urban drainage systems and in addition the local water management company detected small flooding in some areas of the municipality also for precipitation events corresponding to a 2 years return period or less table 3 shows rainfall depth and intensity for the 6 synthetic hyetographs in addition to the just described modelling experiments two other simulations are included in the study the aim is to provide a very first exploratory test that could assess the possible advantages of a heterogeneous implementation of lids at the urban catchment scale the two simulations share the same total percentage of green roofs over the basin 54 of the total surface occupied by impervious rooftops but differ in terms of their spatial distribution in one case the conversion from impervious to pervious roofs is spatially homogeneous and follows exactly the rationale employed in all the other scenarios in the other case green roofs are heterogeneously distributed throughout the basin studies have shown that spatial arrangement of lid controls on an urban watershed can influence the flow at the drainage system outlet bhaduri et al 2000 lee and heaney 2003 khader and montalto 2008 yao et al 2016 bell et al 2016 nevertheless no guidance for their optimal distribution at the urban catchment scale is suggested in the literature in our test the heterogeneous scenario has local concentration of lids increasing where conduits are more prone to filling in the current condition in particular this targeted conversion of impervious roofs is guided by the results from the no conversion scenario when forced by 35 min of constant rainfall with a return period of 2 years in any subcatchment contributing to a specific node of the drainage network the area of buildings top converted to green roofs is assumed proportional to the maximum degree of filling reached by the connected conduits during the event the targeted conversion is organized on the basis of a moderately frequent rainfall return time of 2 years coherent with the design return period of the conduits being in the range 2 10 years namely 2 years events should point out which portions of the network reach their convey capability first while more intense events e g 10 years would cause a diffused overwhelming throughout the network preventing an appropriate discrimination between conduits behaviour fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of green roofs over the basin in these two modelling experiments both the 54 homogeneous and targeted heterogeneous scenario are run with the 2 years 35 minutes constant rainfall and the impact of the targeted implementation of green roofs is assessed by comparing the results from the two simulations all the simulations are initialized with a moderate dry level of soil wetness i e no gravitational water and 50 of retainable capillary water in both standard soils and green roofs when present 2 5 evaluation criteria the overall aim of the modelling experiments is to assess the impact that a diffused implementation of green roofs over a urban catchment may have on the functioning of an articulate drainage network the focus is on aspects related to urban runoff management in presence of moderately intense rainfall in detail the impact of the various conversion scenarios is assessed primarily through the following hydrologic performance indexes peak flow and volume reduction at the drainage network outlet and in each conduit peak flow reduction is calculated as the relative percentage difference between the flow peak in the reference run and in the conversion scenarios volume reduction is calculated analogously in addition for any scenario including the no conversion one network level of stress is quantified through the percentage of conduits whose maximum degree of filling exceeds 80 which is usually assumed as the maximum allowable filling by safety standards and the percentage of nodes experimenting overflows although very limited in both quantity and temporal duration maps showing the maximum degree of filling reached by any conduit during all the modelled events are included in the analysis as well the aim is revealing possible portions of the network more prone to excessive filling and overflow and investigating if green roofs implementation may reduce the tendency finally when comparing results from the 54 homogeneous and targeted conversion we examine also the full frequency distribution of the maximum degree of filling reached by the conduits during the event in order to investigate more in detail the impact of a spatially heterogeneous implementation of green roofs throughout the urban basin 3 results and discussion 3 1 current condition in order to assess green roofs potentialities for stormwater management at the watershed scale the response of sedriano urban system to the various rainfall events under the no conversion scenario must be evaluated as well as described in section 2 5 the level of stress of the network during a specific event is quantified basically through the percentage of conduits exceeding the 80 of filling and of nodes experimenting overflow table 4 summarizes such indices for all the modelling experiments in the no conversion scenario on average more than 25 of conduits exceed 80 of filling during storms whose return time is 2 years and this percentage rises to 62 when the return period is 10 years in addition a few nodes around 6 may experiment overflow during these more intense storms considering that the design return period for these pipes ranges between 2 and 10 years the overall response of the sedriano drainage network to the examined events is adequate however the spatial distribution of the maximum degree of filling during the 2 years events see the first line of figs a1 and a2 in the appendix reveals that conduits in the south eastern part of the network are the most prone to reaching their maximum convey capacity pointing out that some local deficiencies are present in the network this fact may be explained by the presence of numerous nearly flat conduits slope lower than 0 1 and the proximity to the outlet i e relevant flow from upstream reaching most of these conduits 3 2 impact of spatially homogeneous conversions the impact of spatially homogeneous installations of green roofs over the urban basin is first of all assessed integrally in terms of flow at the network outlet through fig 6 however in interpreting the results it must be considered that dashed lines are added only to facilitate the visualization of the general trend of the various relationships without any purpose of fitting the values fig 6a and b show flow peak and volume reduction for all the conversion scenarios and rainfall events in respect to the corresponding no conversion scenario overall the impact of green roofs decreases with precipitation magnitude with the largest reduction rates corresponding to the 2 years 35 minutes event this result is consistent with previous studies evaluating single or site specific lids which has shown that they are more effective for smaller storm events chapman and horner 2010 mentens et al 2006 qin et al 2013 palla and gnecco 2015 furthermore for the 2 years events reduction rates of peak flow range from about 10 to 80 and volume rates from 15 to 70 depending on the magnitude of the conversion hence in our experiments distributed implementation of green roofs is more efficient at decreasing peak flow than total volume regarding peak flow fig 6a shows that the reduction rate is related almost linearly to roofs conversion percentage for the 2 years 35 minutes rainfall while for the other events the trend seems to include some non linearity non linear responses to lids implementation has been observed also by fry and maxwell 2017 who tested various conversion configurations from 15 to 50 and return period from 2 to 100 years over an area of 26 14 ha included in berkeley lake watershed our study suggests that the non linearity appears when convey capability of the network is the limiting factor for flow routing i e when the event causes overload in a relevant number of conduits this can be deducted by interpreting the results of fig 6a at the light of data in table 4 indeed in cases where the baseline run no conversion scenario and some of the redevelopment configurations have more than around a quarter of conduits exceeding the 80 of filling the relationship between peak flow reduction rate and roofs conversion percentage is not merely linear the extreme case is that of the 10 years 60 minutes event white triangles for which green roofs cannot reduce the outlet peak flow up to the full conversion scenario data in table 4 and maps in fig a3 show that this event overwhelm the system causing nearly 75 of conduits exceeding the 80 of filling in the baseline run no conversion scenario the number of conduits above 80 of filling decreases if green roofs are implemented but it remains still relevant about 35 of conduits also in the 75 scenario similarly both the 10 years 35 and 120 minutes events causing 61 and 50 of highly filled conduits in the no conversion scenario experience peak flow reduction rate only in the 75 and 100 conversion scenario namely during these two events the peak flow remains almost unvaried if green roofs cover only 25 or 50 of rooftops extent for the sake of precision note that the negative reduction of the peak in the 25 scenario with the 10 years 120 minutes rainfall is actually a null reduction since it is due only to the fact that the solution may oscillate slightly around the trend when the system is overwhelmed in this specific case a little higher oscillation occurred in the run of the 25 scenario than in the no conversion one but both simulations share the same peak value if oscillations are not considered regarding flow volume fig 6b the non linearity is probably related almost completely to the corresponding reduction of overflows from nodes fig 6c the previous observations lead to speculate that when observing green roofs impact at the outlet of a sufficiently complex urban drainage network the possible observed non linearity is mainly related to network characteristics and to a lesser extent to the hydrologic functioning of the single green roof however in our test this behaviour is probably accentuated by the fact that the network is particularly articulated e g it includes closed circuits and green roofs do not reach full saturation figs 7 and 8 summarize the impact on any conduit of the network through box plots of local reductions of flow peak and volume respectively overall reduction rates are positive i e flow peak or volume is actually decreased in the conduit and median values increases with the conversion percentage for all the rainfall events and for both flow peak and volume nevertheless this general positive impact coexists with local adverse effects indeed some negative outliers occur in both flow peak and volume reduction rates meaning increasing flow peak or volume in the conduit and are mainly related to the complexity of the drainage system discussed in section 2 2 indeed in some conduits green roofs implementation may cause a change of flow direction for the same rainfall event altering flow paths through the network accordingly the effect of a conversion scenario is not straightforward to predict in terms of network stress table 4 shows that the average percentage of conduits whose maximum filling exceeds 80 reduces from more than 25 to 4 for 2 years events and from 62 to 15 for 10 years events furthermore in both cases overflows almost nullify however if for the 2 years events a satisfactory stress reduction is obtained also with partial conversions starting from 50 of buildings 10 years events correspond on average to more than 25 of conduits exceeding 80 of filling even with the 75 scenario maps of the maximum degree of filling for any conduit in any experiment appendix a suggest that the south eastern portion of the network reaches excessive filling greater than 90 in the majority of scenarios and reveal structural inefficiencies in the drainage network that cannot be balanced only through green roofs 3 3 impact of targeted conversion in the following we present results from the second set of modelling experiments described in section 2 4 the aim is investigating possible advantages of a targeted implementation of green roofs which concentrates the efforts where conduits are more prone to filling in particular fig 5 shows that in our case study the degree of conversion is greater in the south eastern portion of the urban basin and this is coherent with the discussion of section 3 1 about drainage network behaviour in the current condition the comparison between the 54 homogeneous and targeted scenario shows that the latter provides better results in terms of both number of conduits exceeding the 80 of filling and reduction rates of peak flow and volume at the network outlet as reported in table 4 results for the 54 homogeneous scenario are in line with expectations with 7 14 of conduits exceeding 80 of filling a percentage very close to the 7 43 obtained in the 50 scenario apparently similar the 5 98 of the targeted conversion should be interpreted considering that this value lies in the middle between the percentages corresponding to the 50 and 75 scenario although still corresponding to a total conversion of 54 furthermore in fig 6a and b it is visible that reduction rates for the 54 homogenous scenario are completely coherent with the trend of the other homogeneous runs while the rates of the targeted conversion marked by a star in the plots are clearly shifted all of the above suggests that for the tested event concentrating implementation efforts in specific locations leads to an improvement of performances note that results regarding overflow in terms of both total volume and number of nodes experimenting it are not significant for any of the simulations forced by the 35 minutes 2 years rainfall including the 54 homogeneous and targeted scenario indeed overflow barely occurs in the no conversion run and affects only one single node in only some of the others in order to evaluate more in detail the effects of a spatially heterogeneous implementation of green roofs over the basin we compare also the frequency distribution of conduits maximum degree of filling for the 54 homogeneous and targeted scenario fig 9b in interpreting the results we consider the distribution for the current condition and the total conversion fig 9a which represent the extreme responses of sedriano system to the rainfall event under examination both 54 homogeneous and targeted scenario are able to reduce the highest fillings significantly with less than 5 of conduits over 90 of filling starting from the 20 of the current condition and with the lower bound of 2 in the total conversion however the implementation effort seems to be spent better with the targeted conversion namely the results show a more balanced network with less underexploited conduits maximum filling below 30 and less exceeding 80 of filling in addition fig 9c reports the frequency distribution of only those conduits whose filling is over 80 in the no conversion scenario for the homogeneous and targeted conversion and shows that the targeted approach leads to more effective reductions finally the impact of the two 54 conversions may be appreciated in fig a3 in the appendix in terms of spatial distribution of the maximum filling 4 concluding remarks this work explores the effects of green roofs implementation at the urban watershed scale using a high resolution distributed hydrologic model mobidic u equipped with a qgis plugin interface smart green we find that a diffused installation of green roofs over the basin results in a reduction of both flow peak and volume at the outlet of the drainage network variable with storm intensity and duration peak flows are reduced more effectively for frequent storms of smaller magnitude than for infrequent storms of larger magnitude a finding consistent with previously published studies chapman and horner 2010 mentens et al 2006 qin et al 2013 in addition we detect that peak flow reduction at network outlet may be both almost linearly and non linearly related to green roofs implementation extent and non linearity is related to convey capability of the network being the limiting factor for flow routing namely in our experience the majority of non linearity is due to network characteristics rather than to the hydrologic functioning of the single green roof in the context of exploring possible criteria to maximize lids effectiveness at the watershed scale our results indicate that i green roofs spatial distribution has a non negligible impact on system response ii mitigation effects may be improved by concentrating implementation sites in proximity of network portions more prone to high degree of filling lastly despite the results in general confirm green roofs capability of restoring a natural flow regime at urban catchment scale their effectiveness is strongly related to sewer infrastructure characteristics indeed in some cases green roofs alone are not able to reduce significantly the discharge or the degree of filling in the conduits therefore for these situations it will be necessary to include structural measures such as sewer relining enlargement of the diameters or simplifying network layout future work should evaluate the performances of multiple lid systems e g permeable pavements rainfall barrels etc as well as performing continuous simulations of multiple storms under varying soil moisture conditions acknowledgements this work was developed in the context of smart green project funded by fondazione cariplo italy grant number 2016 2070 the project progress can be

conduit for the various scenarios of homogeneous conversions when responding to events with return period of 2 and 10 respectively in particular in both figs a1 and a2 each line corresponds to a specific scenario and each column to a rainfall duration hence the percentage of standard roofs transformed into green roofs increases when moving from top to bottom along a column and rainfall

6977,urbanization modifies the hydrologic cycle resulting in increased runoff rates volumes and peak flows in the drainage network in this paper the implementation of green roofs as source control solutions for mitigating the impacts of urbanization is analysed at the urban catchment scale the hydrologic hydraulic response of a 2 km2 urban basin is investigated under various implementation scenarios and rainfall characteristics in particular a distributed hydrologic model is employed to assess the impact of 4 spatially homogeneous installations of green roofs 25 50 75 100 of roofs area converted when forced by 6 storms differing in both duration and return period in addition a spatially heterogeneous configuration is tested with green roofs concentrated where the drainage network is more prone to high degrees of filling results show that implementing green roofs at the urban watershed scale can be considered a valuable strategy to reduce both flow peak and volume in urban drainage networks although the approach is more effective for frequent storms of smaller magnitude in addition it is found that the urban system may respond non linearly to the extent of green roofs implementation in terms of peak flow reduction at the network outlet and that non linearity is mainly related to the network being close to its flow convey capability finally planning redevelopment efforts on the basis of local insufficiencies in network convey capacity has the potential of increasing the effectiveness of low impact development solutions keywords distributed hydrologic modelling low impact development urban stormwater runoff management flood risk mitigation green roofs lids planning 1 introduction urbanization is typically accompanied by expansion of impervious surfaces such as roofs and roads compaction of soils and modification of vegetation these alterations may reduce rainfall infiltration and hence increase stormwater runoff in terms of both rate and volume as a consequence evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge decrease whereas erosion in streams and pollutants load to downstream ecosystems increase bean et al 2007 fassman and blackbourn 2010 grebel et al 2013 causing the well documented decline of habitats and water quality in urban channels elliott and trowsdale 2007 to cope with the modified regime of stormwater runoff hydraulically efficient drainage systems are usually built in the urban environment however traditional management approaches focusing on conveyance and detention have little to no effect on channel erosion localized flooding and water quality fry and maxwell 2017 such limitations have raised the interest in nature based solutions or green infrastructure for achieving a more comprehensive mitigation of the impacts that urbanization has on the hydrologic cycle barbosa et al 2012 burian et al 2000 burns et al 2012 chocat et al 2001 delleur 2003 gleick 2003 these natural systems use low impact development controls lids that can mimic pre development hydrology and manage and treat urban stormwater in a distributed manner dietz 2007 newcomer et al 2014 roy et al 2008 in particular lid approaches implement small scale hydrologic controls for infiltrating filtering storing evaporating and detaining runoff close to the source point ahiablame et al 2012 2013 palla and gnecco 2015 thereby watersheds partially recover pre urbanization conditions these sustainable runoff management measures have a prominent role in regional directives for flood protection and hydrogeological hazard prevention especially where a high density of impervious surfaces occurs wilkinson et al 2014 indeed currently the urgent need to introduce soft mitigation measures for managing rainwater and reducing storm runoff has led many regional water agencies in italy and elsewhere to increasingly promote directives addressed to the concept of hydrologic hydraulic invariance among which the lombardy region law n 4 of 8 april 2016 and the emilia romagna region law 1860 2015 stating that the peak flow generated by any newly urbanized area has to remain unvaried after land transformation the adoption of this concept requires the design of specific mitigation compensatory measures as well as the definition of their appropriate allocation at the urban catchment scale in order to decrease runoff where most needed therefore although urban lids such as bioretention systems porous pavements permeable patios rain barrels cisterns green roofs wet ponds and dry ponds appear to be suitable practices to meet hydrologic hydraulic invariance anticipating their overall impact on the urban drainage system is not straightforward many model based results confirm the role of lid solutions in restoring natural flow regime at the urban catchment scale lee et al 2012a b fry and maxwell 2017 but their effectiveness could depend on i the spatial location of these devices that is often in conflict with the location of areas where redevelopment would be possible ii the complexity of the urban drainage network and iii the magnitude of storm events in this work the smart green software chiaradia et al 2018 designed to simulate runoff formation and propagation in the urban environment and integrating lid control facilities is used to explore the impacts of green roofs on stormwater runoff and the draining sewer system at the urban catchment scale performances are evaluated across a range of storm intensity and duration for multiple degrees of implementation and various spatial configurations the investigation aims at offering a thorough assessment of green roofs potentialities at the urban basin scale including the impact on both runoff generation and sewer system draining capabilities understanding whether and to what extent the structure of the sewer system already present in the urban catchment affects the effectiveness of redevelopment scenario is of primary importance for watershed scale lids planning the work discusses strengths and weaknesses of implementing green roofs at the urban basin scale on a real case study attempting to evaluate the obtainable advantages for the actual drainage network without any simplification or modification of its layout this will enrich awareness and knowledge on the actual effectiveness of lid approaches at the urban watershed scale and help identifying where structural measures on the sewer system appear essential to prevent excessive filling of conduits or overflow from network nodes furthermore we explore the possibility of defining a rationale that could guide green roofs spatial planning at the urban watershed scale in order to enhance their effectiveness 2 materials and methods 2 1 smart green software the software is composed of two main blocks i the actual modelling system named mobidic u and ii the surrounding graphic user interface gui developed as a qgis plugin and mainly dedicated to the preparation of the input data and the analysis of the results a full integration of a hydrological model into a qgis plugin provides the advantage of employing a comprehensive and detailed modelling approach while maintaining an easy and efficient setup of simulations thanks to the functionalities typical of a gis collection and analysis of spatial data in particular the software allows a straightforward implementation of lid solutions in the area of study representing a valuable tool for planners who evaluate the impact of lids on stormwater management at the catchment scale more information about the smart green framework can be found in chiaradia et al 2018 2 1 1 modelling component mobidic u modello di bilancio idrologico distribuito e continuo aree urbane is a hydrologic model designed to simulate runoff formation and propagation in the urban environment capable of including the effect of lid systems it is a specialisation of the model mobidic modello di bilancio idrologico distribuito e continuo ercolani and castelli 2017 yang et al 2014a b castelli et al 2009 campo et al 2006 which can deal with terrains draining towards a natural channel network in accordance with the topographic slope mobidic u shares with mobidic the basic modelling features but various algorithms have been developed to describe the peculiarities of the urban environment specifically the following characteristics are in common with mobidic i fully distributed approach for both parameters and results raster based discretization of the area of study ii computationally efficient and parsimonious representation of soil moisture dynamics and surface runoff formation castillo et al 2015 soil is vertically discretized into one single layer conceptually subdivided into two non linear interconnected reservoirs corresponding to larger pores draining water under gravity gravitational reservoir and smaller pores holding water through capillary forces capillary reservoir accordingly the maximum storage capacity of the two reservoirs may be parametrized as respectively the maximum water content above field capacity wgmax and the difference between field capacity and residual water content wcmax in addition each computational cell includes three other conceptual non linear reservoirs i e the interception reservoir characterized by a finite volumetric capability wpmax the surface ponding reservoir and the phreatic aquifer reservoir fig 1 illustrates the hydrologic fluxes pertaining to the 5 compartments and their mutual connections a detailed description of governing equations may be found in ercolani and castelli 2017 mobidic u combines the previous characteristics with the following ones i the drainage network is described through a couple of interdependent vector layers one polyline type representing conduits and one point type representing network nodes the layers should include topological geometrical and hydraulic attributes ii the flow routing through the drainage network employs the de saint venant equations in the conduits and mass conservation in the nodes the algorithm is capable of dealing with a complex network topology e g closed circuits james et al 2010 iii the routing of surface runoff and hypodermic flow from the production cell to the receiving node of the drainage network takes into account that the flow path in the urban environment is rarely determined by terrain slope e g presence of elevated surfaces such as roofs furthermore information about topography at the level of detail required to route the flow properly throughout a urban watershed is rarely available accordingly the flow generated in any cell of the domain is routed to the drainage network through a linear delay reservoir one for surface runoff and one for hypodermic flow the delay parameter is modulated on the basis of the geometric distance between the production cell and the nearest network node and local hydraulic properties i e soil hydraulic conductivity for hypodermic flow and surface roughness characteristics for runoff iv the water balance approach previously described for a generic computational cell is adapted to capture the essence of the hydrologic behaviour of lid solutions for instance percolation and capillary rise will be null for any cell belonging to a green roof and no aquifer volume will be included drainage flow from the gravitational reservoir corresponding to the hypodermic flow in the generic description of the balance and surface runoff will be the only outflows during a storm event the advantage of such approach is twofold first it is completely coherent with the rest of the model adding robustness to comparisons between no lids and lids scenarios secondly adopting a physically based description of lids functioning makes the recovering of lids hydrologic parameters extremely straightforward since they are derivable directly from constructional characteristics of any single implementation e g for green roofs layers number and thickness and media hydraulic conductivity porosity field capacity and residual volumetric water content the increasing number of studies aiming at identifying values of conceptual parameters that describe properly lids hydrologic functioning e g cn in the usda cn method testifies the added value of a physically based approach e g carter and rasmussen 2006 getter et

functionalities and data organization are available in chiaradia et al 2018 2 2 study context the area of study is the sedriano municipality which is located in the north west portion of the metropolitan city of milan in northern italy fig 2 the challenge that the metropolitan city of milan is facing is that the current stormwater infrastructure is undersized or non existent and will not be able to sustain the anticipated population growth and watershed modifications many municipalities need to address similar issues and are looking for resilient options to mitigate the impacts on water quantity and quality barbosa et al 2012 burns et al 2012 sedriano municipality represents an adequate case study for multiple reasons first the territory consists of a mix of residential industrial and commercial areas in line with many municipalities of the metropolitan city of milan and emblematic of urban territories in general secondly the outlet of the drainage network was monitored during late months of 2016 allowing for a basic model calibration third during rainfall events inflows to the urban drainage network coincide essentially with stormwater and possible additional inputs are neglected the municipality of sedriano is 7 7 km2 large the boundary of the municipality is marked in red in fig 2 with a total population of about 12 000 inhabitants and a density of 1500 inhabitants per km2 the topography is flat on average 140 m a s l the portion of the municipality surface considered in the study is about 1 9 km2 colored portion of the map in fig 2 with a total impervious area of about 0 69 km2 which includes residential commercial and industrial buildings roads and parking lots buildings roofs are around 56 of this total impervious area i e 0 39 km2 the study context is characterized by a humid subtropical climate according to the kӧppen classification system peel et al 2007 during the year the average temperature is about 10 c while total rainfall is around 800 mm the sedriano urban drainage network managed by cap holding spa is about 23 5 km long and constituted by 686 conduits and 651 nodes mainly representing manholes the sewerage is a combined system designed to collect both sewage and urban stormwater during rainfall events the flow in the sewerage systems is gravity driven overall conduits are designed considering rainfall whose return period ranges from 2 to 10 years resulting in diameters between 0 1 m and 1 5 m fig 3 a in this range diameters between 0 3 and 0 5 m prevail covering more than 50 of conduits on the basis of diameters spatial distribution the sewer system appears to converge the flow into a central main conduit with a diameter enlarging from 0 8 to 1 6 m which develops along the north south direction of the municipality however the chaotic slope layout fig 3b with a considerable number of flat or almost flat conduits does not always allow a regular delivery of water from the outermost conduits to the innermost ones moreover the urban expansion in the last fifty years has increased the entanglement of conduits and the lack of regulations requiring to map and georeference the sewer infrastructure up to 2014 made a systematic planning of conduits distribution impossible furthermore the sewer system includes numerous closed circuits which combined with low slopes make it impossible to know a priori the flow direction during a rainfall event the significant presence of flat or almost flat conduits about 14 of conduits with slope lower than 0 1 and 28 lower than 0 2 and even a few improper counter slopes facilitates undesired backflows and overflows from nodes as the water manager has observed in the field the described complexity and peculiarity of the drainage network make sedriano an interesting case study for the assessment of green roofs potential in stormwater management indeed predicting the impact of a number of systems distributed over the catchment is not straightforward when a complex drainage network is involved e g reducing runoff production in a certain area of the catchment may modify flow direction in some conduits finally leading to an unexpected increment of discharge in other portions of the network 2 3 model setup as described in section 2 1 1 mobidic u requires a couple of interdependent shapefiles to represent the sewer system one corresponding to conduits and one to network nodes for sedriano network both layers are available from the local water manager cap holding spa complete with attributes needed by the model i e for conduits diameter elevation of the initial and final invert constituent material or manning s coefficient and for nodes surface extension bottom and top elevation as well as topological information about mutual connections inconsistencies or missing data are detected and fixed through semi automatic tools offered by smart green qgis plugin see section 2 1 2 the network is composed of 686 conduits and 651 nodes note that 17 of conduits and 39 of nodes have been treated to fix inconsistencies or missing information the minimum and average conduit length is 0 5 m and 34 m respectively for a total of about 23 5 km in terms of urban watershed description mobidic u requires 4 spatially distributed physically based parameters i e wcmax wgmax wpmax as described in section 2 1 1 and surface layer saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and 4 lumped conceptual parameters in particular these latter are rate coefficients dimensionally inverse of a time regulating i absorption of gravitational water by smaller pores k ii percolation of gravitational water γ iii maximum local production of hypodermic flow from gravitational water β iv maximum local production of surface runoff from surface water α details about equations involving these parameters may be found in ercolani and castelli 2017 the maps of the physically based parameters are derived on the basis of soil properties and land use characteristics and refined through calibration if possible for sedriano municipality the employed sources of information are lombardy region pedological map and topographic database both freely available from the institutional website www geoportale regione lombardia it the first one offers quite a rough description of soil types spatial patterns in respect to the extension of the analysis since our watershed is about 1 9 km2 and the nominal scale of the pedological map is 1 250 000 however it offers a support in determining model parameters directly related to soil properties such as wgmax and wcmax which depend on porosity field capacity and residual water content in particular the pedological map shows that sedriano municipality is completely included in an area occupied by coarse textured soils more than 94 of sandy loam texture and less than 6 of loamy sand texture the regional topographic database contains a series of layers representing elements constituting the territory such as buildings roads agricultural fields woods etc on the basis of such information and in order to maintain a parsimonious and exportable approach only two hydrological classes are identified in the basin representing respectively impervious and pervious areas imperviousness is associated to buildings roads and parking lots as identifiable from the regional topographic database and shown in black roads and parking lots and red buildings in fig 2 the remaining areas are included in a unique class intended to represent a generic slightly vegetated coarse textured urban soil no information is available to further differentiate properties of pervious patches with a reasonable level of confidence table 1 lists the values of physically based parameters for the 2 hydrologic classes and those of lumped conceptual parameters the rationale employed to select the values is as follows physically based parameters corresponding to pervious areas are derived considering the characteristics of the predominant soil type in sedriano municipality and a non negligible rainfall initial abstraction due for instance to interception by vegetation the same parameters for the impervious class and the conceptual parameters α and β are calibrated against one rainfall event recorded during the monitoring period typical average values are assumed for the remaining lumped conceptual parameters k and γ mainly on the basis of previous modelling experiences e g ercolani and castelli 2017 finally conduits manning s coefficient is selected on the basis of constituent material in particular 0 013 m s 1 3 is assumed for all the conduits since they are plastic pipes the whole setup is validated against the 2 remaining rainfall events that occurred during the monitoring period details about calibration and validation are in the following section the watershed is discretized with a spatial resolution of 5 m such that singles buildings and roads are fully represented the hydrological time step is 1 min while flow routing through conduits in the network employs substeps of 3 s 2 3 1 calibration and validation sedriano sewer system was monitored from august to november 2016 by a specialized company bm tecnologie padue italy flow was measured at network outlet through a kaptor multi doppler device and precipitation through a delta ohm hd 2013 tipping bucket rain gauge this latter was installed in a service area in the adjacent municipality vittuone about 1 9 km far from the barycentre of sedriano urban catchment during the monitoring period 3 noteworthy rainfall events occurred the first one on august 5th the second one on september 21st and the third on october 14th all the events were moderate with respectively a total rainfall depth of 19 55 8 and 32 6 mm a duration of about 1 25 17 33 7 5 h and a maximum instantaneous intensity equal to 55 2 36 and 31 2 mm hour we assume that rainfall measured by vittuone rain gauge is representative for sedriano urban basin and feed the model with spatially homogeneous precipitation since no additional information is available the event of august 5th is employed for a trial and error calibration aimed at refining the description of impervious patches and the 2 most relevant lumped conceptual parameters accordingly the calibrated parameters are wcmax wgmax wpmax and ks for roads parking slots and impervious roofs and α the other 2 events are used to validate the whole model setup hydrographs of observed and modelled outflow are compared in terms of both volume and discharges in particular the percentage error on the peak flow peqmax and total volume pevol are computed as well as the nash sutchliffe efficiency nse index nash and sutcliffe 1970 to assess the instantaneous match between model and observations fig 4 shows the hydrograph at sedriano network outlet for the 3 rainfall events with the black continuous line corresponding to modelled flows and red dots to observations in addition total precipitation over the urban basin is plotted in grey table 2 summarizes model performances for the 3 events overall the model can simulate properly runoff formation and propagation in the urban basin and sewer network of sedriano the match is excellent for the calibration event fig 4a with the nse greater than 0 9 and only a slight underestimation of peak flow peqmax equal to 4 88 and overestimation of volume pevol equal to 12 92 the validation event of october 14th fig 4c shows that the model is capable of describing hydrologic and hydraulic responses of sedriano urban basin and drainage network even when triggered by more complex rainfall events multi peak longer duration with nse equal to 0 63 and peqmax to 0 69 for the sake of completeness results corresponding to the last available rainfall event september 21st in fig 4b are included however it is clearly visible that measured rainfall and flow are not coherent neither in terms of quantity nor of timing two inconsistencies are particularly evident i the first flow event starting around 08 30 is anticipated in respect to rainfall i e flow begins to rise before rainfall occurs ii the system does not respond at all to the third rainfall sub event the one after 12 00 although intensity and total depth are comparable to those of the main sub event of october 14th fig 4c to which the system responds clearly moreover this sub event occurs after previous significant precipitation i e the system is not dry and a negligible flow at the outlet is unrealistic the discrepancy between precipitation and flow observations may be due to the fact that the rain gauge is placed about 1 9 km far from sedriano urban basin and hence not fully representative of local precipitation instead a very accurate assessment of rainfall spatio temporal variability is required in urban hydrology where the spatial and temporal scales are relatively small niemczynowicz 1999 fletcher et al 2013 accordingly also measured and modelled flows cannot match since they are triggered by different rainfall 2 3 2 green roofs parametrization green roofs are the lid devices whose implementation at the catchment scale is investigated in the present study as described in section 2 1 1 the parsimonious 5 compartments scheme employed by mobidic and mobidic u for water balance in soil castillo et al 2015 ercolani and castelli 2017 can be easily specialized to represent green roof cells with ad hoc modifications i e turning off improper hydrologic fluxes such as percolation or capillary rise accordingly the hydrologic behaviour of green roof cells depends on the same 4 physically based parameters previously discussed i e wcmax wgmax wpmax ks which can be derived from constructional characteristics of the specific implementation to represent in the present study all the green roofs follow the design presented by palla et al 2009 with a total thickness of 35 cm without vegetative cover in detail the stratigraphy is primarily constituted by a first drainage layer of vulcaflor 20 cm thick and a second structural layer of lapillus 15 cm thick the first layer is characterized by a porosity of 0 650 m3 m 3 a saturated hydraulic conductivity of 0 08 cm s 1 a field capacity of 0 400 m3 m 3 and a residual soil moisture of 0 165 m3 m 3 conversely the second layer has a porosity of 0 600 m3 m 3 a saturated hydraulic conductivity of 0 33 cm s 1 a field capacity of 0 560 m3 m 3 and a residual soil moisture of 0 155 m3 m 3 these constructional characteristics correspond to the value of parameters reported in table 1 2 4 modelling experiments in order to assess the impact of green roofs implementation at the urban catchment scale a series of redevelopment scenarios are simulated and compared with the current configuration the no conversion scenario this reference configuration corresponds to that employed for calibration and validation experiments where all the roofs are impervious see fig 2 a first set of simulations converts impervious roofs to green roofs homogeneously over the basin without any preferential spatial pattern for their implementation the impact of such spatially homogeneous conversions are assessed under different rainfall conditions in particular 4 percentages of rooftops conversions 25 50 75 and 100 are combined with 6 different hyetographs for a total of 30 simulations for each hyetograph the reference no conversion scenario is also modelled partial conversions 25 50 and 75 are randomly distributed with the constraint of spatial homogeneity at the catchment scale namely in any subcatchment contributing to a specific node of the network the same percentage of roofs area is converted through a random selection hyetographs are synthetic obtained from the intensity duration frequency relationship derived by arpa for sedriano area and adopting a uniform shape in particular 2 return periods 2 and 10 years and 3 rainfall durations 35 60 and 120 min are considered the selected return periods are in the range of those employed to design urban drainage systems and in addition the local water management company detected small flooding in some areas of the municipality also for precipitation events corresponding to a 2 years return period or less table 3 shows rainfall depth and intensity for the 6 synthetic hyetographs in addition to the just described modelling experiments two other simulations are included in the study the aim is to provide a very first exploratory test that could assess the possible advantages of a heterogeneous implementation of lids at the urban catchment scale the two simulations share the same total percentage of green roofs over the basin 54 of the total surface occupied by impervious rooftops but differ in terms of their spatial distribution in one case the conversion from impervious to pervious roofs is spatially homogeneous and follows exactly the rationale employed in all the other scenarios in the other case green roofs are heterogeneously distributed throughout the basin studies have shown that spatial arrangement of lid controls on an urban watershed can influence the flow at the drainage system outlet bhaduri et al 2000 lee and heaney 2003 khader and montalto 2008 yao et al 2016 bell et al 2016 nevertheless no guidance for their optimal distribution at the urban catchment scale is suggested in the literature in our test the heterogeneous scenario has local concentration of lids increasing where conduits are more prone to filling in the current condition in particular this targeted conversion of impervious roofs is guided by the results from the no conversion scenario when forced by 35 min of constant rainfall with a return period of 2 years in any subcatchment contributing to a specific node of the drainage network the area of buildings top converted to green roofs is assumed proportional to the maximum degree of filling reached by the connected conduits during the event the targeted conversion is organized on the basis of a moderately frequent rainfall return time of 2 years coherent with the design return period of the conduits being in the range 2 10 years namely 2 years events should point out which portions of the network reach their convey capability first while more intense events e g 10 years would cause a diffused overwhelming throughout the network preventing an appropriate discrimination between conduits behaviour fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of green roofs over the basin in these two modelling experiments both the 54 homogeneous and targeted heterogeneous scenario are run with the 2 years 35 minutes constant rainfall and the impact of the targeted implementation of green roofs is assessed by comparing the results from the two simulations all the simulations are initialized with a moderate dry level of soil wetness i e no gravitational water and 50 of retainable capillary water in both standard soils and green roofs when present 2 5 evaluation criteria the overall aim of the modelling experiments is to assess the impact that a diffused implementation of green roofs over a urban catchment may have on the functioning of an articulate drainage network the focus is on aspects related to urban runoff management in presence of moderately intense rainfall in detail the impact of the various conversion scenarios is assessed primarily through the following hydrologic performance indexes peak flow and volume reduction at the drainage network outlet and in each conduit peak flow reduction is calculated as the relative percentage difference between the flow peak in the reference run and in the conversion scenarios volume reduction is calculated analogously in addition for any scenario including the no conversion one network level of stress is quantified through the percentage of conduits whose maximum degree of filling exceeds 80 which is usually assumed as the maximum allowable filling by safety standards and the percentage of nodes experimenting overflows although very limited in both quantity and temporal duration maps showing the maximum degree of filling reached by any conduit during all the modelled events are included in the analysis as well the aim is revealing possible portions of the network more prone to excessive filling and overflow and investigating if green roofs implementation may reduce the tendency finally when comparing results from the 54 homogeneous and targeted conversion we examine also the full frequency distribution of the maximum degree of filling reached by the conduits during the event in order to investigate more in detail the impact of a spatially heterogeneous implementation of green roofs throughout the urban basin 3 results and discussion 3 1 current condition in order to assess green roofs potentialities for stormwater management at the watershed scale the response of sedriano urban system to the various rainfall events under the no conversion scenario must be evaluated as well as described in section 2 5 the level of stress of the network during a specific event is quantified basically through the percentage of conduits exceeding the 80 of filling and of nodes experimenting overflow table 4 summarizes such indices for all the modelling experiments in the no conversion scenario on average more than 25 of conduits exceed 80 of filling during storms whose return time is 2 years and this percentage rises to 62 when the return period is 10 years in addition a few nodes around 6 may experiment overflow during these more intense storms considering that the design return period for these pipes ranges between 2 and 10 years the overall response of the sedriano drainage network to the examined events is adequate however the spatial distribution of the maximum degree of filling during the 2 years events see the first line of figs a1 and a2 in the appendix reveals that conduits in the south eastern part of the network are the most prone to reaching their maximum convey capacity pointing out that some local deficiencies are present in the network this fact may be explained by the presence of numerous nearly flat conduits slope lower than 0 1 and the proximity to the outlet i e relevant flow from upstream reaching most of these conduits 3 2 impact of spatially homogeneous conversions the impact of spatially homogeneous installations of green roofs over the urban basin is first of all assessed integrally in terms of flow at the network outlet through fig 6 however in interpreting the results it must be considered that dashed lines are added only to facilitate the visualization of the general trend of the various relationships without any purpose of fitting the values fig 6a and b show flow peak and volume reduction for all the conversion scenarios and rainfall events in respect to the corresponding no conversion scenario overall the impact of green roofs decreases with precipitation magnitude with the largest reduction rates corresponding to the 2 years 35 minutes event this result is consistent with previous studies evaluating single or site specific lids which has shown that they are more effective for smaller storm events chapman and horner 2010 mentens et al 2006 qin et al 2013 palla and gnecco 2015 furthermore for the 2 years events reduction rates of peak flow range from about 10 to 80 and volume rates from 15 to 70 depending on the magnitude of the conversion hence in our experiments distributed implementation of green roofs is more efficient at decreasing peak flow than total volume regarding peak flow fig 6a shows that the reduction rate is related almost linearly to roofs conversion percentage for the 2 years 35 minutes rainfall while for the other events the trend seems to include some non linearity non linear responses to lids implementation has been observed also by fry and maxwell 2017 who tested various conversion configurations from 15 to 50 and return period from 2 to 100 years over an area of 26 14 ha included in berkeley lake watershed our study suggests that the non linearity appears when convey capability of the network is the limiting factor for flow routing i e when the event causes overload in a relevant number of conduits this can be deducted by interpreting the results of fig 6a at the light of data in table 4 indeed in cases where the baseline run no conversion scenario and some of the redevelopment configurations have more than around a quarter of conduits exceeding the 80 of filling the relationship between peak flow reduction rate and roofs conversion percentage is not merely linear the extreme case is that of the 10 years 60 minutes event white triangles for which green roofs cannot reduce the outlet peak flow up to the full conversion scenario data in table 4 and maps in fig a3 show that this event overwhelm the system causing nearly 75 of conduits exceeding the 80 of filling in the baseline run no conversion scenario the number of conduits above 80 of filling decreases if green roofs are implemented but it remains still relevant about 35 of conduits also in the 75 scenario similarly both the 10 years 35 and 120 minutes events causing 61 and 50 of highly filled conduits in the no conversion scenario experience peak flow reduction rate only in the 75 and 100 conversion scenario namely during these two events the peak flow remains almost unvaried if green roofs cover only 25 or 50 of rooftops extent for the sake of precision note that the negative reduction of the peak in the 25 scenario with the 10 years 120 minutes rainfall is actually a null reduction since it is due only to the fact that the solution may oscillate slightly around the trend when the system is overwhelmed in this specific case a little higher oscillation occurred in the run of the 25 scenario than in the no conversion one but both simulations share the same peak value if oscillations are not considered regarding flow volume fig 6b the non linearity is probably related almost completely to the corresponding reduction of overflows from nodes fig 6c the previous observations lead to speculate that when observing green roofs impact at the outlet of a sufficiently complex urban drainage network the possible observed non linearity is mainly related to network characteristics and to a lesser extent to the hydrologic functioning of the single green roof however in our test this behaviour is probably accentuated by the fact that the network is particularly articulated e g it includes closed circuits and green roofs do not reach full saturation figs 7 and 8 summarize the impact on any conduit of the network through box plots of local reductions of flow peak and volume respectively overall reduction rates are positive i e flow peak or volume is actually decreased in the conduit and median values increases with the conversion percentage for all the rainfall events and for both flow peak and volume nevertheless this general positive impact coexists with local adverse effects indeed some negative outliers occur in both flow peak and volume reduction rates meaning increasing flow peak or volume in the conduit and are mainly related to the complexity of the drainage system discussed in section 2 2 indeed in some conduits green roofs implementation may cause a change of flow direction for the same rainfall event altering flow paths through the network accordingly the effect of a conversion scenario is not straightforward to predict in terms of network stress table 4 shows that the average percentage of conduits whose maximum filling exceeds 80 reduces from more than 25 to 4 for 2 years events and from 62 to 15 for 10 years events furthermore in both cases overflows almost nullify however if for the 2 years events a satisfactory stress reduction is obtained also with partial conversions starting from 50 of buildings 10 years events correspond on average to more than 25 of conduits exceeding 80 of filling even with the 75 scenario maps of the maximum degree of filling for any conduit in any experiment appendix a suggest that the south eastern portion of the network reaches excessive filling greater than 90 in the majority of scenarios and reveal structural inefficiencies in the drainage network that cannot be balanced only through green roofs 3 3 impact of targeted conversion in the following we present results from the second set of modelling experiments described in section 2 4 the aim is investigating possible advantages of a targeted implementation of green roofs which concentrates the efforts where conduits are more prone to filling in particular fig 5 shows that in our case study the degree of conversion is greater in the south eastern portion of the urban basin and this is coherent with the discussion of section 3 1 about drainage network behaviour in the current condition the comparison between the 54 homogeneous and targeted scenario shows that the latter provides better results in terms of both number of conduits exceeding the 80 of filling and reduction rates of peak flow and volume at the network outlet as reported in table 4 results for the 54 homogeneous scenario are in line with expectations with 7 14 of conduits exceeding 80 of filling a percentage very close to the 7 43 obtained in the 50 scenario apparently similar the 5 98 of the targeted conversion should be interpreted considering that this value lies in the middle between the percentages corresponding to the 50 and 75 scenario although still corresponding to a total conversion of 54 furthermore in fig 6a and b it is visible that reduction rates for the 54 homogenous scenario are completely coherent with the trend of the other homogeneous runs while the rates of the targeted conversion marked by a star in the plots are clearly shifted all of the above suggests that for the tested event concentrating implementation efforts in specific locations leads to an improvement of performances note that results regarding overflow in terms of both total volume and number of nodes experimenting it are not significant for any of the simulations forced by the 35 minutes 2 years rainfall including the 54 homogeneous and targeted scenario indeed overflow barely occurs in the no conversion run and affects only one single node in only some of the others in order to evaluate more in detail the effects of a spatially heterogeneous implementation of green roofs over the basin we compare also the frequency distribution of conduits maximum degree of filling for the 54 homogeneous and targeted scenario fig 9b in interpreting the results we consider the distribution for the current condition and the total conversion fig 9a which represent the extreme responses of sedriano system to the rainfall event under examination both 54 homogeneous and targeted scenario are able to reduce the highest fillings significantly with less than 5 of conduits over 90 of filling starting from the 20 of the current condition and with the lower bound of 2 in the total conversion however the implementation effort seems to be spent better with the targeted conversion namely the results show a more balanced network with less underexploited conduits maximum filling below 30 and less exceeding 80 of filling in addition fig 9c reports the frequency distribution of only those conduits whose filling is over 80 in the no conversion scenario for the homogeneous and targeted conversion and shows that the targeted approach leads to more effective reductions finally the impact of the two 54 conversions may be appreciated in fig a3 in the appendix in terms of spatial distribution of the maximum filling 4 concluding remarks this work explores the effects of green roofs implementation at the urban watershed scale using a high resolution distributed hydrologic model mobidic u equipped with a qgis plugin interface smart green we find that a diffused installation of green roofs over the basin results in a reduction of both flow peak and volume at the outlet of the drainage network variable with storm intensity and duration peak flows are reduced more effectively for frequent storms of smaller magnitude than for infrequent storms of larger magnitude a finding consistent with previously published studies chapman and horner 2010 mentens et al 2006 qin et al 2013 in addition we detect that peak flow reduction at network outlet may be both almost linearly and non linearly related to green roofs implementation extent and non linearity is related to convey capability of the network being the limiting factor for flow routing namely in our experience the majority of non linearity is due to network characteristics rather than to the hydrologic functioning of the single green roof in the context of exploring possible criteria to maximize lids effectiveness at the watershed scale our results indicate that i green roofs spatial distribution has a non negligible impact on system response ii mitigation effects may be improved by concentrating implementation sites in proximity of network portions more prone to high degree of filling lastly despite the results in general confirm green roofs capability of restoring a natural flow regime at urban catchment scale their effectiveness is strongly related to sewer infrastructure characteristics indeed in some cases green roofs alone are not able to reduce significantly the discharge or the degree of filling in the conduits therefore for these situations it will be necessary to include structural measures such as sewer relining enlargement of the diameters or simplifying network layout future work should evaluate the performances of multiple lid systems e g permeable pavements rainfall barrels etc as well as performing continuous simulations of multiple storms under varying soil moisture conditions acknowledgements this work was developed in the context of smart green project funded by fondazione cariplo italy grant number 2016 2070 the project progress can be

conduit for the various scenarios of homogeneous conversions when responding to events with return period of 2 and 10 respectively in particular in both figs a1 and a2 each line corresponds to a specific scenario and each column to a rainfall duration hence the percentage of standard roofs transformed into green roofs increases when moving from top to bottom along a column and rainfall

6978,the longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems refers to the process based connections between upstream and downstream areas and is fundamental to understanding the dynamic and nonlinear hydrological behaviour of river basins however the quantification of such connectivity remains a challenge due to the absence of a consensus on the appropriate data and methods especially in delta plains in this study based on the difference between water level fluctuations at adjacent stations a new and quantitative longitudinal functional connectivity index lfci was developed for delta plains focusing on the taihu plain we then analysed the spatial temporal changes in the lfci during 1960 2012 and investigated the correlations between the lfci and climate change and human activities we found that the decadal annual and seasonal changes in the average lfci all presented slightly increasing trends in the recent 50 period but the annual average lfci increased significantly after 1978 the average lfcis in june july and august of the flood season were less than those in other months in the taihu plain we also found that the spatial temporal changes in the average lfci exhibited larger differences at the subregional and station scales those in the wu cheng xi yu subregion were least and the average lfcis at stations near the borders of adjacent subregions were less than those at other stations moreover we found that the average lfci had significant correlations with precipitation river density and water surface ratio our results were consistent with common sense facts which demonstrated that the indicator developed in this study can quite effectively quantify the longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems in delta plains keywords longitudinal functional connectivity spatial temporal changes river systems water level taihu plain 1 introduction connectivity as a key term in hydrology geomorphology and ecology generally refers to the connections between different parts of a catchment and their influences on water and sediment transfers and biological processes michaelides and chappell 2009 although connectivity is regarded as an essential factor for ensuring species persistence ecosystem integrity and human well being jaeger et al 2014 it had not been introduced and studied as a broad and specific scientific question until the late 20th century bracken et al 2013 good et al 2015 connectivity has also been broadly classified as hydrological connectivity ecological connectivity and geomorphological connectivity okin et al 2015 wohl et al 2017 lu et al 2018 of these types hydrological connectivity is closely related to the transfer of matter energy and organisms and to the physical chemical and biological processes of river systems the anthropogenic reduction in this property may result in major negative environmental effects pringle 2003 therefore hydrological connectivity transcending different disciplines has received increasing interest and how to quantify hydrological connectivity has become a research focus in the past decades michaelides and chappell 2009 rinderer et al 2018 hydrological connectivity is commonly grouped into two categories 1 structural or static connectivity which refers to spatial patterns of river systems and the extent of physical connections between rivers and lakes smith et al 2010 and 2 functional dynamic connectivity which refers to the interconnection of different areas in the same catchment by a process turnbull et al 2008 the interaction of structural and functional connectivity is conducive to determining the dynamic and nonlinear hydrological behaviour michaelides and chappell 2009 although there are successful measures to quantify structural connectivity e g topographic indices standardized quantitative methods for functional connectivity are more rare due to the absence of a consensus on the appropriate data and methods bracken et al 2013 okin et al 2015 rinderer et al 2018 meanwhile hydrological connectivity can also be developed along the longitudinal dimension e g from upstream to downstream areas lateral dimension e g from riparian flood zones to river channel and vertical dimension e g from surface to subsurface in addition to the temporal dimension amoros and bornette 2010 covino 2017 among these dimensions the longitudinal connectivity of river systems is extensively altered by anthropogenic impoundments and diversions throughout the world nilsson et al 2005 however the natural transfers of water and sediments and the regular migration of organisms are prevented by these transverse obstacles resulting in important ecological consequences due to variations in the hydromorphological and biological conditions of the ecosystem solà et al 2011 for the aforementioned reasons longitudinal functional connectivity is more difficult to quantify than longitudinal structural connectivity chi et al 2018 ramulifho et al 2018 unlike mountainous areas in sparsely populated upper basins caruso 2015 delta plains are generally located in populous downstream zones river systems in these regions are more vulnerable to interference by various human activities and longitudinal functional connectivity is also easily altered by urbanization wohl et al 2017 even so simulating longitudinal functional connectivity in these regions is still difficult because of the absence of sufficient data furthermore research concerning a quantitative indicator of longitudinal functional connectivity in these regions is extremely rare therefore developing a new indicator with currently available data is imperative to quantify longitudinal functional connectivity in delta plains the taihu plain is one of the most famous and rapidly urbanizing delta plain in china however a multitude of tributaries have been buried or diverted through pipes to increase the amount of land available for urbanization deng et al 2015b meanwhile innumerable floodgates have been constructed to protect against flooding and the longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems has thus been partly weakened and even cut off by these human activities deng et al 2018 the decrease in longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems along with the increase of extreme rainfall han et al 2015 and pollutant discharge stone 2011 complicates the hydrological cycle and nutrient exchange processes finally resulting in more frequent flood disasters and serious water environmental pollution in the taihu plain duan et al 2009 wang et al 2011 in recent years these issues have gained increasing attention from the central and local governments a growing number of water conservancy projects including river channel dredging and returning farmland to lakes have been executed to ease these crises these protective projects not only partly restored the original connections between rivers and lakes but also established new links between originally unconnected rivers and lakes eventually improving longitudinal functional connectivity therefore investigating the spatial temporal changes in longitudinal functional connectivity will assist in developing a further understanding of the correlations between hydrological connectivity and flood disasters and water pollution such investigations will provide support for making policies regarding flood disaster mitigation and water environmental protection in the taihu plain the goal of this study is to develop a new and quantitative indicator of longitudinal functional connectivity in delta plains and to analyse its spatial temporal changes in the taihu plain we first developed a longitudinal functional connectivity index lfci based on major hydromorphological characteristics of delta plains and then employed several time series analysis methods including the moving average linear trend mann kendall test m k moving t test mtt and yamamoto method to analyse the spatial temporal changes in the lfci finally we also investigated the correlations between the lfci climate change and human activities the conclusions can improve the understanding of longitudinal functional connectivity in delta plains

jiangnan water country due to the crisscrossing rivers and numerous lakes the water surface area of 1590 km2 occupies 9 72 of the total area the total river length is 50 245 km and the river density is 3 07 km km2 deng et al 2015b according to the landform conditions and river system distribution this region can be divided into three subregions fig 1 wu cheng xi yu wcxy yang cheng dian mao ycdm and hang jia hu hjh meanwhile the taihu plain has always been a region with one of the most advanced economies and densest populations in china currently the urbanization rate the urban population as a percentage of the total population has exceeded 50 and the percentage of non agricultural gdp is close to 100 in this region however rapid urbanization has given rise to serious pollution and flood disasters and flood disaster mitigation tracking and water environmental protection have then become the key challenges for the future of the taihu plain liu et al 2013 2 2 data sources to analyse the changes in longitudinal functional connectivity through space and time we collected the daily mean water level data at 30 hydrological stations in the taihu plain from 1960 to 2012 all hydrological stations are located on the main nodes of river systems and have long term continuous data meanwhile the observations at these stations can characterize the changes in water levels of main rivers or lakes which are closely related to the water levels at the surrounding stations the spatial distribution and time series lengths of the stations are displayed in fig 1 and table 1 to analyse the natural and human factors related to longitudinal functional connectivity changes we also collected the daily precipitation at the aforementioned 30 hydrological stations in the taihu plain from 1960 to 2012 in addition we extracted river system data for the study area from 1 50 000 topographic maps published in the 1960s 1980s and 2010s and obtained floodgate data for the taihu plain from the first national water resources census in china in 2012 2 3 longitudinal functional connectivity index lfci as mentioned previously the longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems refers to the process based connection between upstream and downstream areas in river basins and includes the water mediated linkages between different rivers or lakes different parts of the same river or lake and rivers and lakes in other words the longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems can be regarded as the capability for internal and external water exchange between rivers and lakes however the water level is more suitable than the stream flow as a hydrological parameter to measure the capability for water exchange in delta plains because the latter in these regions are slower and more variable than those in other catchments meanwhile the distinctive hydromorphological characteristics of these regions e g flat terrain and crisscrossing rivers are also conducive to establishing a response relationship between adjacent stations by water level the response relationship of water levels between adjacent stations bracken and croke 2007 cabezas et al 2011 can characterize the longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems in delta plains in this study we attempt to develop a longitudinal functional connectivity index lfci according to the water level fluctuation differences between adjacent stations the fundamental principle of this indicator is described as follows a smaller difference between water level fluctuations at adjacent stations at the same time daily scale is indicative of a more positive longitudinal functional connectivity otherwise a smaller longitudinal functional connectivity is indicated these relations can be expressed as follows 1 lfci 1 δ l ab 1 l ai l aj l bi l bj where δl ab is the difference between water level fluctuations at adjacent stations a and b and lai laj lbi and lbj are the water levels of adjacent stations a and b at times i and j respectively however the formula has no mathematical meaning when δlab 0 and the water level fluctuations at most stations are in the second decimal place or smaller therefore in this paper the aforementioned formula is improved as follows 2 lfci 0 1 δ l ab 0 1 0 1 l ai l aj l bi l bj 0 1 it is clear that lfci is negative when δlab 0 1 to achieve horizontal and vertical comparisons in space and time and to constrain lfci within 0 1 the formula is rewritten as shown below 3 lfci 1 10 δ l ab 1 1 10 l ai l aj l bi l bj 1 where 0 lfci 1 the longitudinal functional connectivity is the strongest when lfci 1 and is more weaker when lfci is close to 0 to analyse the temporal and spatial changes in longitudinal functional connectivity in the taihu plain we first calculated all daily average lfcis between any two adjacent stations and then calculated the regional subregional and station lfcis at monthly seasonal annual and decadal scales specifically a regional lfci is the average of lfcis of any two adjacent stations in the taihu plain a subregional lfci is the average of lfcis of any two adjacent stations in the subregion and the lfci at a single station is the average of lfcis between this station and all of its adjacent stations moreover monthly seasonal annual and decadal lfcis at certain spatial scales are the averages of regional subregional or station daily lfcis at these temporal scales as mentioned water levels are the only available hydrological data in delta plains and their changes can reliably reflect the hydrological process hence the developed functional connectivity indicator based on the response of water levels between adjacent stations has the advantages of available data simple computation favourable maneuverability and easy understanding and is particularly suitable for the hydrological characteristics of delta plains 2 4 time series analysis methods as mentioned the development of the lfci is based on water levels at the hydrological stations consequently the lfci can be regarded as a random variable in time as with the water level of a river network similarly the lfci can be investigated by using general analysis methods for hydrological time series generally hydrological time series are influenced by climate change and human activities to distinguish and quantify the effect of human activities trend test methods are frequently used to identify abrupt change points that cause inconsistent changes in hydrological time series ma et al 2008 xie et al 2018 for this reason we employed a moving average and a linear trend to analyse the variation trend of the lfci and used the m k test mtt and yamamoto method to identify abrupt changes in the lfci 2 4 1 moving average a moving average is approximately equivalent to a low pass filter and can significantly weaken cycles shorter than the moving length in a time series wu et al 2009 the moving average series of a time series x 1 x 2 x 3 xn can be expressed as 4 x j â 1 k i 1 k x i j 1 j 1 2 n k 1 where k is the moving length and k is generally an odd bumber in this study k 5 was adopted 2 4 2 linear trend generally the linear trend of a time series can be estimated by the least square method and expressed by a linear regression equation as tang et al 2011 5 x i a b t i i 1 2 n where xi is the response variable t is the time variable a is a constant b is the estimated coefficient and the trend is negative when b 0 but positive when b 0 2 4 3 mann kendall test m k the m k test is a non parametric statistical test method widely used to identify variation trends in hydrologic and meteorological series yaghmaei et al 2018 for time series x 1 x 2 x 3 xn the m k rank statistic sk can be expressed as follows 6 s k i 1 k r i k 1 2 n where ri 1 when xi xj and ri 0 when xi xj under the null hypothesis where no trend is assumed the statistic ufk is defined as follows 7 uf k s k e s k v a r s k k 1 2 n where uf 1 0 and e sk and var sk are the expected value and variance respectively and are written as follows 8 e s k n n 1 4 v a r s k n n 1 2 n 5 72 based on the inverse series xn xn 1 xn 2 x 1 the aforementioned process can be repeated and ubk ufk k n n 1 n 2 1 and ub 1 0 are also defined if the intersection point of the ubk curve and the ufk curve is located between the confidence lines 95 is widely accepted this point can be regarded as a time point of abrupt change 2 4 4 moving t test mtt the mtt is widely used to detect the difference between the averages of two groups of samples liang et al 2011 for a time series x with n samples the statistic t can be expressed as follows 9 t x 1 x 2 n 1 s 1 2 n 2 s 2 2 n 1 n 2 2 1 n 1 1 n 2 where n 1 and n 2 are the sizes of x 1 and x 2 subsamples respectively and n 1 n 2 is widely accepted x 1 x 2 and s 1 2 s 2 2 are the averages and variances of the subsamples if the absolute value of t is less than the critical value for the confidence level a ta there is no significant difference between the averages of the two subsamples in contrast an abrupt change is believed to exist in the total sample when t ta 2 4 5 yamamoto method similar to the goal of the mtt method that of the yamamoto method is also to identify an abrupt change based on the difference between the averages of two subsamples zhao et al 2008 according to the averages x 1 and x 2 and variances s 1 2 and s 2 2 of two subsamples the signal to noise ratio snr can be defined as follows 10 snr x 1 x 2 s 1 s 2 if n 1 n 2 10 a snr 1 0 means that the absolute value of the statistic t is larger than the critical value for the confidence level a 0 05 i e there is significant abrupt change in the sample 3 results 3 1 regional change in longitudinal functional connectivity as shown in fig 2 the average lfci is 0 84 in the taihu plain in the recent 50 period and the annual and decadal changes in lfci are insignificant in spite of this result the ideal value of the lfci should be 1 because a flat topography and crisscrossing rivers provide favourable conditions for better connectivity in this region the annual average lfci has a slightly increasing trend 0 0004 a but shows a more significant decreasing tendency since 2006 0 0033 a similarly the difference between decadal lfcis is small and these values also show a trend of first increasing and then decreasing therefore longitudinal functional connectivity must be improved because its status is not the best in the taihu plain especially given its degradation trend in recent years according to the hydrological regime in the taihu plain the five months from may to september in each year are regarded as the flood season and the other months are regarded as the non flood season on this basis the average lfcis in the flood and non flood seasons can be obtained as shown in fig 3 the average lfcis in the flood and non flood seasons all present slightly increasing trends in the recent 50 period and the increment rate in the flood season 0 0006 a is twice that in the non flood season 0 0003 a meanwhile the average lfci is 0 82 in the flood season but it is 0 86 in the non flood season in other words the longitudinal functional connectivity in the non flood season is better than that in the flood season although the improvement in the latter is greater than that in the former hence longitudinal functional connectivity must be further improved in the flood season by comparison the average lfcis in the first two months and last three months of the year are all greater than 0 85 but those in june july and august are less than 0 81 fig 4 meanwhile there are also increasing trends in the average lfcis in each month but their increment rates present larger differences the largest increment rate is 0 001 a in september but the lowest increment rate is only 0 00002 a in january meanwhile the increment rates are less than 0 0004 a in june july and august in summary the average values and increment rates of lfcis in june july and august are all smaller than those in other months and so longitudinal functional connectivity must be improved preferentially in june july and august 3 2 subregional changes in longitudinal functional connectivity to analyse the spatial temporal changes in longitudinal functional connectivity in the taihu plain the average lfci during 1960 2012 in each subregion is calculated the results indicate that the average lfci in wcxy is 0 80 and those in ycdm and hjh are 0 87 and 0 84 respectively therefore the longitudinal functional connectivity in ycdm is the most positive but that in wcxy is the least in the taihu plain this result implies that wcxy is the key subregion for improving longitudinal functional connectivity in the taihu plain similarly the annual average lfcis in each subregion presents slightly increasing trends but the increment rates present larger differences fig 5 specifically the increment rate of the annual average lfci in ycdm is 0 0001 a which is only one third that of hjh 0 0003 a and one ninth that of wcxy 0 0009 a meanwhile the five year moving average curve for the annual average lfci indicates that longitudinal functional connectivity decreases first and then increases in wcxy but the changes are alternate increases and decreases in ycdm and hjh in addition the decadal average lfci in wcxy decreases first and then increases but those in ycdm and hjh manifest inverse change trends these results indicate that longitudinal functional connectivity in ycdm and hjh presents decreasing trends in recent decades emphasizing that longitudinal functional connectivity must also be improved in these subregions there are also large differences in the changes in lfcis between the flood season and non flood season in each subregion fig 6 the average lfcis in both the flood season and non flood season present a slightly increasing trend in wcxy and the increment rate is 0 001 a meanwhile the five year moving average curves in these two periods also present first a decreasing and then an increasing trend but the fluctuation range in the flood season is less than that in the non flood season in contrast the average lfci in the flood season presents a slightly decreasing trend in ycdm but that in the non flood season presents a slightly increasing trend and the increment rate in the non flood season is twice the decrement rate in the flood season moreover the average lfci in hjh in the flood season presents a slightly increasing trend but that in the non flood season exhibits a slightly decreasing trend and the decrease rate in the non flood season is extremely small thus longitudinal functional connectivity improvement is recommended in the flood season in ycdm but in the non flood season in hjh as shown in fig 7 the three subregions have a common characteristic i e the monthly average lfci in each subregion presents first a decreasing and then an increasing trend the result indicates that the longitudinal functional connectivity in june july and august is worse than that in other months in the three subregions meanwhile the monthly average lfci in ycdm is the largest but that in wcxy is the smallest in addition the changes in the monthly average lfcis in the three subregions show larger differences the average lfci in each month all present different increasing rates in wcxy but those in ycdm and hjh also exhibit various decreasing magnitudes specifically a decreasing trend is observed in june july and august in ycdm but is seen in the first three months and the last two months in hjh in summary longitudinal functional connectivity improvement is strongly needed in june july and august in ycdm and in the first three months and last two months in hjh 3 3 station changes in longitudinal functional connectivity as shown in fig 8 the lfcis of 83 33 of the stations exceed 0 81 and the lfcis of 13 33 of the stations are between 0 71 and 0 80 but lfcis of 3 33 of the stations are less than 0 60 meanwhile the smaller annual average lfcis are mainly present at those stations near the border between the taihu plain and the western mountain subregion or the taihu lake subregion implying that longitudinal functional connectivity of those stations near the border between adjacent subregions must be improved preferentially similarly there are insignificant differences between the linear trend values of the annual average lfci at each station fig 8 table 2 the linear trend value is less than 0 001 at 86 67 of the stations and the maximum is only 0 0032 a while the minimum is less than 0 00001 a meanwhile the annual changes in the average lfci present a slightly increasing trend at 76 67 of the stations only 7 stations have slightly decreasing trends and they are mainly located near the border between the taihu plain and the western mountain subregion moreover stations with slightly decreasing trends are also distributed near the border between ycdm and wcxy or hjh these results indicate that longitudinal functional connectivity of the critical stations near the borders between adjacent subregions should be given more attention and improved as shown in fig 9 most of the decadal average lfcis are between 0 81 and 0 90 meanwhile the lfci at jingshanzha is greater than 0 90 in the 1960s at wangjiangjing in the 1970s and 2000s and at yucheng in the 2000s but the lfci is less than 0 60 at yuhang in addition the decadal average lfcis in those stations near the border between ycdm and wcxy or hjh also indicate a decreasing trend as an example the decadal average lfci at nianyukouzha decreases from 0 82 in the 1960s to 0 78 in the 2010s therefore longitudinal functional connectivity at those stations near the border between adjacent subregions must be improved however there are certain spatial differences in the average lfcis in the flood and non flood seasons fig 10 the average lfcis in the flood season are between 0 71 and 0 80 in wcxy but between 0 81 and 0 90 in ycdm meanwhile the average lfcis at 68 75 of the stations in hjh are between 0 81 and 0 90 and at the rest of the stations are between 0 71 and 0 80 these results indicate that the average lfci in the flood season is the least in wcxy but it is the most positive in ycdm although the average lfci in the non flood season is still between 0 81 and 0 90 at each station in ycdm it is also greater than 0 80 at each station in wcxy except baishaoshan compared with values in the flood season the average lfci in the non flood season also exceeds 0 80 at nianyukouzha and tangxi in hjh and is even greater than 0 90 at wangjiangjing overall the average lfci during the non flood season is more positive than that during the flood season thus the longitudinal functional connectivity at the stations in the flood season in wcxy must be improved first 3 4 abrupt changes in longitudinal functional connectivity according to the basic step of the m k test we can draw the curves of uf and ub for the annual average lfci in the taihu plain and two straight dashed lines representing the 95 confidence interval fig 11 the curves of uf and ub intersect in 1978 which indicates that there is a significant increasing trend in the annual average lfci in the taihu plain after 1978 meanwhile the uf curve continues the increasing trend and substantially exceeds the critical line of the 95 confidence interval after 1982 which indicates that the increasing trend of the annual average lfci in the taihu plain is extremely significant after 1982 moreover the abrupt change type of the annual average lfci observed in the taihu plain is a mean value abrupt change i e the annual average lfci increases to 0 84 during 1978 2012 from 0 83 during 1960 1977 this abrupt change point in longitudinal functional connectivity is consistent with the beginning of the rapid urbanization in the taihu plain which indicates that longitudinal functional connectivity is more sensitive to human activities than to climate change and other factors in this region similarly the abrupt change times for the annual average lfci in wcxy and hjh can be confirmed as 2001 and 1971 respectively fig 12 however there are four intersection points 1963 1971 2010 and 2011 between the 95 confidence level lines in ycdm confirming these four intersection points as abrupt change points is difficult therefore the mtt and yamamoto method are employed to analyse the true abrupt point and a decade is confirmed as the length of each subsample as shown in fig 12 d f 1984 and 1998 are both abrupt change points in ycdm the former is the abrupt change point from decreasing to increasing but the latter is the opposite these results indicate that the time points of connectivity improvement in the three subregions are inconsistent in fact the rehabilitation and reconstruction of river systems were generally carried out step by step and according to plan to discharge floods in the taihu plain and prevent water from entering shanghai these positive projects were widely constructed in hjh before the 1980s with the rapid development of the social economy in suzhou wuxi and changzhou the focus of these constructions migrated gradually to ycdm in the 1980s and to wcxy in the 2000s deng et al 2015b in addition the annual average lfci in ycdm presents significant degradation since 1998 a probable cause is that there were more disruptive human activities than the aforementioned protective human activities during the rapid urbanization such as the burying of tributaries and the embezzlement of lakes according to the three aforementioned methods the abrupt change time points for the annual average lfci in each station can be confirmed as shown in table 3 the abrupt change time points for the annual average lfci at each station are obviously different specially the times and trends of abrupt change at 80 of the stations are almost consistent with those in their subregion and 20 of the stations show earlier change times and opposite change trends in wcxy meanwhile in ycdm only 37 5 of the stations exhibit times and trends of abrupt change that are nearly identical to those of their subregion 50 of the stations show only one change point at different change times but 12 5 of the stations display extremely inconsistent change times and completely opposite change trends in addition in hjh only 18 75 of the stations exhibit times and trends of abrupt change similar to those of their subregion 31 25 of the stations show similar change trends but different change times and 6 25 of the stations display similar change times but opposite change trends 18 75 of the stations manifest different change times and opposite change trends but 25 of the stations present two change points and different change trends in general the abrupt change times and trends of the annual average lfcis at each station in wcxy are nearly consistent with those within the subregion but the times and trends exhibit significant differences in ycdm and the internal differences in hjh are more significant one reason for this pattern might be that the beginnings of extensive positive or negative human activities at each station were asynchronous across the taihu plain but these activities began at relatively consistent times in wcxy due to unified planning and management 3 5 correlations between longitudinal functional connectivity and climate change and human activities as a kind of hydrological connectivity longitudinal functional connectivity is also affected by climate change and human activities pumo et al 2017 ala aho et al 2018 among these changes precipitation is one of the most important indicators used to detect climate change liang et al 2011 and the modification of river systems and construction of dams and floodgates are two important human activities that impact hydrological connectivity deng et al 2018 karim et al 2015 thus we employed the annual precipitation ap and average lfci at each station from 1960 to 2012 to analyse the correlation between climate change and longitudinal functional connectivity limited by the available information we collected only river system data from the 1960s 1980s and 2010s and floodgate data in 2012 to achieve consistency among hydrology river system characteristics and floodgate data we generated a 20 km buffer around each station according the mean distance between every two adjacent stations then we calculated the number of floodgates nf and four common river system characteristic indicators in each buffer including river density dr the ratio of the total length of river to the buffer area water surface ratio wp the ratio of the total area of rivers and lakes at the mean water level to the buffer area river development coefficient kω the ratio of the total length of tributaries to that of the main river in a buffer and main river area length ratio rm the ratio of area and length of the main river in a buffer finally we employed the average lfci at each station and the river system characteristic indicators for each station buffer in the 1960s 1980s and 2010s to detect the correlations between longitudinal functional connectivity and river system characteristics and we used the average lfci and nf for each station buffer in 2012 to analyse the correlation between longitudinal functional connectivity and floodgates as presented in table 4 the pearson correlation coefficient between lfci and ap is negative and significant at the 0 01 level this result indicates that longitudinal functional connectivity significantly increases with decreasing precipitation the correlation is also consistent with an aforementioned result i e that longitudinal functional connectivity of the flood season is less than that of the non flood season meanwhile the pearson correlation coefficients between the lfci and the four river system characteristic indicators are all positive and the correlations are significant at the 0 01 level for dr and wp the results indicate that longitudinal functional connectivity increases with increases in these four indicators this phenomenon is extremely significant for river density and water surface ratios these results also demonstrate that there exists significant spatial heterogeneity in the changes in longitudinal functional connectivity similar to that for the non synchronous changes in river systems in time moreover the pearson correlation coefficient between the lfci and nf is positive but not significant at the 0 01 level which indicates that longitudinal functional connectivity increases with an increasing number of floodgates the insignificant correlation is possibly caused by neglecting the controlling rule of these floodgates due to the limitations of the data used in this study to discharge floods during the flood season or improve the water quality in the non flood season anthropogenic water exchange by water pumps significantly increases the longitudinal functional connectivity between areas inside and outside of floodgates 4 discussions 4 1 indicators of longitudinal functional connectivity the term longitudinal functional connectivity is widely seen as a process based hydrological connectivity from upstream to downstream areas but its applicability is always disputed the main contention is whether longitudinal functional connectivity can be quantitatively described by many indicators antoine et al 2009 troch et al 2009 currently although the concept of longitudinal functional connectivity is resonated with the wider public selecting one or more representative indicators to describe longitudinal functional connectivity variations remains an essential problem bracken et al 2013 in recent decades many indicators concerning catchment topography soil moisture and solute travel times have been developed and applied to longitudinal functional connectivity assessment bracken et al 2013 however some potential problems such as topographic factors and data requirements make these indicators inapplicable in many regions in addition the change in water level is often regarded as a characteristic of the hydrological process in delta plains therefore the response relations of water levels between adjacent stations bracken and croke 2007 cabezas et al 2011 can be employed to characterize longitudinal functional connectivity in delta plains in this study a new and quantitative indicator lfci was developed to describe longitudinal functional connectivity in delta plains based on the differences between water level fluctuations at adjacent stations this indicator can dynamically reflect the hydrological processes between adjacent river channels or different parts of the same river channel another advantage of the developed indicator is its lower data requirement i e only water level data are needed and these data are easy to obtain because of the widespread use of hydrological stations moreover this indicator relies on easily operated and convenient calculations which are two other advantages however the major issue with the developed indicator in this study is that it is only a rough estimate of the longitudinal functional connectivity at a large scale because it cannot reflect the differences in water level fluctuations between areas inside and outside of floodgates or in the different parts of a river channel which means that this indicator cannot estimate longitudinal functional connectivity at the micro scale another limitation of the developed indicator is that it is a measurement of only the longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems but functional connectivity is a four dimensional concept including lateral longitudinal vertical and temporal connectivity amoros and bornette 2010 covino 2017 thus the characteristic indicator of longitudinal functional connectivity should be further improved by combining more experimental observations at the micro scale furthermore the measurement of functional connectivity should be synthetically investigated in the lateral longitudinal vertical and temporal dimensions in the future 4 2 changes in longitudinal functional connectivity in recent years the river network connectivity of the jiaxing plain was also assessed using a comprehensive evaluation model based on hydraulic resistance and graph theory xu et al 2012 xu s result indicated that the river network connectivity was improved slightly after dredging i e the river network connectivity increased from 0 0018 to 0 0028 between the 1960s and 2010s the change trend of connectivity in his study was consistent with that in our study but the change rate in his study was larger than that in ours a primary reason for this difference is that the impacts of floodgates on river network connectivity were neglected in his study however the hydraulic connections between areas inside and outside of floodgates are limited extensively in delta plains as a result longitudinal functional connectivity depends largely on the control of floodgates in these regions therefore the developed indicator in our study can more objectively reveal the actual condition of the longitudinal functional connectivity and thus can provide a reference for longitudinal functional connectivity assessment in other delta plains our results also indicated that the longitudinal functional connectivity in ycdm was more positive than those in hjh and wcxy and that the value in the non flood season was better than that in the flood season but the abrupt changes in longitudinal functional connectivity presented larger difference in different subregions and stations which was consistent with the observed facts longitudinal structural connectivity of river systems is the prerequisite for and foundation of longitudinal functional connectivity because hydrological processes depend on various rivers and lakes in delta plains however a study concerning river health assessments in these regions indicated that the longitudinal structural connectivity in ycdm was more positive than those in hjh and wcxy deng et al 2015a as an example the γ index i e network connectivity of the arterial river systems was 0 54 in ycdm but was only 0 43 in hjh and wcxy therefore compared with hjh and wcxy better longitudinal structural connectivity led to preferable longitudinal functional connectivity in ycdm as mentioned frequent flood disasters are a key environmental problem in the taihu plain wang et al 2011 to mitigate flood disasters thousands of floodgates were constructed across urban and rural areas however closed floodgates often generated independent rivers and lakes and cut off the original longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems this conscious behavior by humans was extremely common during the flood season generally these floodgates in urban areas and polders were closed to protect against the ingress of outer river floods during the flood season in contrast these floodgates were often opened to generate water exchanges between inner and outer river channels and lakes during the non flood season consequently the longitudinal functional connectivity during the non flood season was always more positive than that during the flood season after the establishment of new china in 1949 most of the arterial river channels in the taihu plain were dredged and numerous farmlands were also reverted to lakes these human behaviours impacting increasing longitudinal functional connectivity became more common after the end of the 1970s therefore the annual average value of longitudinal functional connectivity exhibited an abrupt increase in 1978 however the sharp decrease in tributaries and the massive construction of floodgates also led to a decrease in longitudinal functional connectivity during the rapid urbanization thus the changes in longitudinal functional connectivity during a certain period or in a certain region depended on these human behaviours specifically longitudinal functional connectivity would be improved when protective behaviours were more vigorous than disruptive behaviours whereas connectivity might decline otherwise moreover the times and extents of these human behaviours were also characterized by significant differences in different subregions and at stations therefore the times and trends of the abrupt changes in longitudinal functional connectivity were also entirely different in different subregions and stations overall a slight improvement in longitudinal functional connectivity in the taihu plain was observed in our results in spite of this the status of the longitudinal functional connectivity of this region was not ideal especially at those stations near the borders of adjacent subregions the results agreed with the actual situation in the taihu plain to control floods extensive water conservancy projects were constructed in each subregion in recent decades although these protective behaviours improved the longitudinal functional connectivity to some extent they were effective in only some areas because of the lack of unified planning at the watershed scale in recent years the dramatic decrease in river systems under rapid urbanization deng et al 2015b led to the degeneration of longitudinal functional connectivity moreover integrated watershed management in this region is not easy to implement due to the conflicting interests of flood disaster mitigation and water environmental protection of different subregions and cities specifically ycdm belongs to suzhou city of jiangsu province and wcxy belongs to suzhou changzhou and wuxi cities of jiangsu province but hjh belongs to suzhou city of jiangsu province and jiaxing huzhou and hangzhou cities of zhejiang province thus the improvement of the longitudinal functional connectivity at those stations near the borders between adjacent subregions was often intentionally neglected by the local authorities on both sides as a result the longitudinal functional connectivity at these stations was less than those at the stations within each subregion 5 conclusions in this study according the differences between water level fluctuations at adjacent hydrological stations we develop a new quantitative longitudinal functional connectivity index lfci for delta plains focusing on the taihu plain we then analyse the spatial temporal changes in the lfci during 1960 2012 and investigate the correlation between the lfci and climate change and human activities the analyses of these changes on lfci lead to the following conclusions 1 the decadal annual and seasonal changes in the average lfci all presented slightly increasing trends in the taihu plain the average lfci in the flood season was worse than that in the non flood season and those in june july and august were also worse than those in other months 2 the average lfci was the least in wcxy but those in ycdm during the flood season and in hjh during the non flood season showed slightly decreasing trends decreasing trends were also present in june july and august in ycdm and in the first three months and the last two months in hjh 3 the average lfcis at those stations near the borders of adjacent subregions were less than those at other stations and they all presented slightly decreasing trends the average lfci during the flood season was worse than that during the non flood season at each station 4 abrupt change analysis indicated that a significant increasing trend in the annual average lfci in the taihu plain after 1978 but larger differences appeared between the times and trends of abrupt changes in the average lfci at the subregional and station scales 5 pearson correlation analysis showed that the average lfci had a significant and negative correlation with the annual precipitation and significant and positive correlations with river density and water surface ratio but an insignificant and positive correlation with the number of floodgates according the above analysis we believe the indicator developed in this study can be used as a practical tool to quantify the longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems in delta plains meanwhile in order to improve the longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems we also recommend that tributaries and lakes should be protected against reduction that river channels should be dredged constantly and that floodgates and other water conservancy projects should be controlled reasonably during rapid urbanization especially in june july and august in the flood season and at those stations near the borders of adjacent subregions acknowledgements

6978,the longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems refers to the process based connections between upstream and downstream areas and is fundamental to understanding the dynamic and nonlinear hydrological behaviour of river basins however the quantification of such connectivity remains a challenge due to the absence of a consensus on the appropriate data and methods especially in delta plains in this study based on the difference between water level fluctuations at adjacent stations a new and quantitative longitudinal functional connectivity index lfci was developed for delta plains focusing on the taihu plain we then analysed the spatial temporal changes in the lfci during 1960 2012 and investigated the correlations between the lfci and climate change and human activities we found that the decadal annual and seasonal changes in the average lfci all presented slightly increasing trends in the recent 50 period but the annual average lfci increased significantly after 1978 the average lfcis in june july and august of the flood season were less than those in other months in the taihu plain we also found that the spatial temporal changes in the average lfci exhibited larger differences at the subregional and station scales those in the wu cheng xi yu subregion were least and the average lfcis at stations near the borders of adjacent subregions were less than those at other stations moreover we found that the average lfci had significant correlations with precipitation river density and water surface ratio our results were consistent with common sense facts which demonstrated that the indicator developed in this study can quite effectively quantify the longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems in delta plains keywords longitudinal functional connectivity spatial temporal changes river systems water level taihu plain 1 introduction connectivity as a key term in hydrology geomorphology and ecology generally refers to the connections between different parts of a catchment and their influences on water and sediment transfers and biological processes michaelides and chappell 2009 although connectivity is regarded as an essential factor for ensuring species persistence ecosystem integrity and human well being jaeger et al 2014 it had not been introduced and studied as a broad and specific scientific question until the late 20th century bracken et al 2013 good et al 2015 connectivity has also been broadly classified as hydrological connectivity ecological connectivity and geomorphological connectivity okin et al 2015 wohl et al 2017 lu et al 2018 of these types hydrological connectivity is closely related to the transfer of matter energy and organisms and to the physical chemical and biological processes of river systems the anthropogenic reduction in this property may result in major negative environmental effects pringle 2003 therefore hydrological connectivity transcending different disciplines has received increasing interest and how to quantify hydrological connectivity has become a research focus in the past decades michaelides and chappell 2009 rinderer et al 2018 hydrological connectivity is commonly grouped into two categories 1 structural or static connectivity which refers to spatial patterns of river systems and the extent of physical connections between rivers and lakes smith et al 2010 and 2 functional dynamic connectivity which refers to the interconnection of different areas in the same catchment by a process turnbull et al 2008 the interaction of structural and functional connectivity is conducive to determining the dynamic and nonlinear hydrological behaviour michaelides and chappell 2009 although there are successful measures to quantify structural connectivity e g topographic indices standardized quantitative methods for functional connectivity are more rare due to the absence of a consensus on the appropriate data and methods bracken et al 2013 okin et al 2015 rinderer et al 2018 meanwhile hydrological connectivity can also be developed along the longitudinal dimension e g from upstream to downstream areas lateral dimension e g from riparian flood zones to river channel and vertical dimension e g from surface to subsurface in addition to the temporal dimension amoros and bornette 2010 covino 2017 among these dimensions the longitudinal connectivity of river systems is extensively altered by anthropogenic impoundments and diversions throughout the world nilsson et al 2005 however the natural transfers of water and sediments and the regular migration of organisms are prevented by these transverse obstacles resulting in important ecological consequences due to variations in the hydromorphological and biological conditions of the ecosystem solà et al 2011 for the aforementioned reasons longitudinal functional connectivity is more difficult to quantify than longitudinal structural connectivity chi et al 2018 ramulifho et al 2018 unlike mountainous areas in sparsely populated upper basins caruso 2015 delta plains are generally located in populous downstream zones river systems in these regions are more vulnerable to interference by various human activities and longitudinal functional connectivity is also easily altered by urbanization wohl et al 2017 even so simulating longitudinal functional connectivity in these regions is still difficult because of the absence of sufficient data furthermore research concerning a quantitative indicator of longitudinal functional connectivity in these regions is extremely rare therefore developing a new indicator with currently available data is imperative to quantify longitudinal functional connectivity in delta plains the taihu plain is one of the most famous and rapidly urbanizing delta plain in china however a multitude of tributaries have been buried or diverted through pipes to increase the amount of land available for urbanization deng et al 2015b meanwhile innumerable floodgates have been constructed to protect against flooding and the longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems has thus been partly weakened and even cut off by these human activities deng et al 2018 the decrease in longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems along with the increase of extreme rainfall han et al 2015 and pollutant discharge stone 2011 complicates the hydrological cycle and nutrient exchange processes finally resulting in more frequent flood disasters and serious water environmental pollution in the taihu plain duan et al 2009 wang et al 2011 in recent years these issues have gained increasing attention from the central and local governments a growing number of water conservancy projects including river channel dredging and returning farmland to lakes have been executed to ease these crises these protective projects not only partly restored the original connections between rivers and lakes but also established new links between originally unconnected rivers and lakes eventually improving longitudinal functional connectivity therefore investigating the spatial temporal changes in longitudinal functional connectivity will assist in developing a further understanding of the correlations between hydrological connectivity and flood disasters and water pollution such investigations will provide support for making policies regarding flood disaster mitigation and water environmental protection in the taihu plain the goal of this study is to develop a new and quantitative indicator of longitudinal functional connectivity in delta plains and to analyse its spatial temporal changes in the taihu plain we first developed a longitudinal functional connectivity index lfci based on major hydromorphological characteristics of delta plains and then employed several time series analysis methods including the moving average linear trend mann kendall test m k moving t test mtt and yamamoto method to analyse the spatial temporal changes in the lfci finally we also investigated the correlations between the lfci climate change and human activities the conclusions can improve the understanding of longitudinal functional connectivity in delta plains 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the taihu plain is located in the centre of the yangtze river delta in eastern china covers an area of 15 757 km2 and is 2 4 m above sea level this region is known as jiangnan water country due to the crisscrossing rivers and numerous lakes the water surface area of 1590 km2 occupies 9 72 of the total area the total river length is 50 245 km and the river density is 3 07 km km2 deng et al 2015b according to the landform conditions and river system distribution this region can be divided into three subregions fig 1 wu cheng xi yu wcxy yang cheng dian mao ycdm and hang jia hu hjh meanwhile the taihu plain has always been a region with one of the most advanced economies and densest populations in china currently the urbanization rate the urban population as a percentage of the total population has exceeded 50 and the percentage of non agricultural gdp is close to 100 in this region however rapid urbanization has given rise to serious pollution and flood disasters and flood disaster mitigation tracking and water environmental protection have then become the key challenges for the future of the taihu plain liu et al 2013 2 2 data sources to analyse the changes in longitudinal functional connectivity through space and time we collected the daily mean water level data at 30 hydrological stations in the taihu plain from 1960 to 2012 all hydrological stations are located on the main nodes of river systems and have long term continuous data meanwhile the observations at these stations can characterize the changes in water levels of main rivers or lakes which are closely related to the water levels at the surrounding stations the spatial distribution and time series lengths of the stations are displayed in fig 1 and table 1 to analyse the natural and human factors related to longitudinal functional connectivity changes we also collected the daily precipitation at the aforementioned 30 hydrological stations in the taihu plain from 1960 to 2012 in addition we extracted river system data for the study area from 1 50 000 topographic maps published in the 1960s 1980s and 2010s and obtained floodgate data for the taihu plain from the first national water resources census in china in 2012 2 3 longitudinal functional connectivity index lfci as mentioned previously the longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems refers to the process based connection between upstream and downstream areas in river basins and includes the water mediated linkages between different rivers or lakes different parts of the same river or lake and rivers and lakes in other words the longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems can be regarded as the capability for internal and external water exchange between rivers and lakes however the water level is more suitable than the stream flow as a hydrological parameter to measure the capability for water exchange in delta plains because the latter in these regions are slower and more variable than those in other catchments meanwhile the distinctive hydromorphological characteristics of these regions e g flat terrain and crisscrossing rivers are also conducive to establishing a response relationship between adjacent stations by water level the response relationship of water levels between adjacent stations bracken and croke 2007 cabezas et al 2011 can characterize the longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems in delta plains in this study we attempt to develop a longitudinal functional connectivity index lfci according to the water level fluctuation differences between adjacent stations the fundamental principle of this indicator is described as follows a smaller difference between water level fluctuations at adjacent stations at the same time daily scale is indicative of a more positive longitudinal functional connectivity otherwise a smaller longitudinal functional connectivity is indicated these relations can be expressed as follows 1 lfci 1 δ l ab 1 l ai l aj l bi l bj where δl ab is the difference between water level fluctuations at adjacent stations a and b and lai laj lbi and lbj are the water levels of adjacent stations a and b at times i and j respectively however the formula has no mathematical meaning when δlab 0 and the water level fluctuations at most stations are in the second decimal place or smaller therefore in this paper the aforementioned formula is improved as follows 2 lfci 0 1 δ l ab 0 1 0 1 l ai l aj l bi l bj 0 1 it is clear that lfci is negative when δlab 0 1 to achieve horizontal and vertical comparisons in space and time and to constrain lfci within 0 1 the formula is rewritten as shown below 3 lfci 1 10 δ l ab 1 1 10 l ai l aj l bi l bj 1 where 0 lfci 1 the longitudinal functional connectivity is the strongest when lfci 1 and is more weaker when lfci is close to 0 to analyse the temporal and spatial changes in longitudinal functional connectivity in the taihu plain we first calculated all daily average lfcis between any two adjacent stations and then calculated the regional subregional and station lfcis at monthly seasonal annual and decadal scales specifically a regional lfci is the average of lfcis of any two adjacent stations in the taihu plain a subregional lfci is the average of lfcis of any two adjacent stations in the subregion and the lfci at a single station is the average of lfcis between this station and all of its adjacent stations moreover monthly seasonal annual and decadal lfcis at certain spatial scales are the averages of regional subregional or station daily lfcis at these temporal scales as mentioned water levels are the only available hydrological data in delta plains and their changes can reliably reflect the hydrological process hence the developed functional connectivity indicator based on the response of water levels between adjacent stations has the advantages of available data simple computation favourable maneuverability and easy understanding and is particularly suitable for the hydrological characteristics of delta plains 2 4 time series analysis methods as mentioned the development of the lfci is based on water levels at the hydrological stations consequently the lfci can be regarded as a random variable in time as with the water level of a river network similarly the lfci can be investigated by using general analysis methods for hydrological time series generally hydrological time series are influenced by climate change and human activities to distinguish and quantify the effect of human activities trend test methods are frequently used to identify abrupt change points that cause inconsistent changes in hydrological time series ma et al 2008 xie et al 2018 for this reason we employed a moving average and a linear trend to analyse the variation trend of the lfci and used the m k test mtt and yamamoto method to identify abrupt changes in the lfci 2 4 1 moving average a moving average is approximately equivalent to a low pass filter and can significantly weaken cycles shorter than the moving length in a time series wu et al 2009 the moving average series of a time series x 1 x 2 x 3 xn can be expressed as 4 x j â 1 k i 1 k x i j 1 j 1 2 n k 1 where k is the moving length and k is generally an odd bumber in this study k 5 was adopted 2 4 2 linear trend generally the linear trend of a time series can be estimated by the least square method and expressed by a linear regression equation as tang et al 2011 5 x i a b t i i 1 2 n where xi is the response variable t is the time variable a is a constant b is the estimated coefficient and the trend is negative when b 0 but positive when b 0 2 4 3 mann kendall test m k the m k test is a non parametric statistical test method widely used to identify variation trends in hydrologic and meteorological series yaghmaei et al 2018 for time series x 1 x 2 x 3 xn the m k rank statistic sk can be expressed as follows 6 s k i 1 k r i k 1 2 n where ri 1 when xi xj and ri 0 when xi xj under the null hypothesis where no trend is assumed the statistic ufk is defined as follows 7 uf k s k e s k v a r s k k 1 2 n where uf 1 0 and e sk and var sk are the expected value and variance respectively and are written as follows 8 e s k n n 1 4 v a r s k n n 1 2 n 5 72 based on the inverse series xn xn 1 xn 2 x 1 the aforementioned process can be repeated and ubk ufk k n n 1 n 2 1 and ub 1 0 are also defined if the intersection point of the ubk curve and the ufk curve is located between the confidence lines 95 is widely accepted this point can be regarded as a time point of abrupt change 2 4 4 moving t test mtt the mtt is widely used to detect the difference between the averages of two groups of samples liang et al 2011 for a time series x with n samples the statistic t can be expressed as follows 9 t x 1 x 2 n 1 s 1 2 n 2 s 2 2 n 1 n 2 2 1 n 1 1 n 2 where n 1 and n 2 are the sizes of x 1 and x 2 subsamples respectively and n 1 n 2 is widely accepted x 1 x 2 and s 1 2 s 2 2 are the averages and variances of the subsamples if the absolute value of t is less than the critical value for the confidence level a ta there is no significant difference between the averages of the two subsamples in contrast an abrupt change is believed to exist in the total sample when t ta 2 4 5 yamamoto method similar to the goal of the mtt method that of the yamamoto method is also to identify an abrupt change based on the difference between the averages of two subsamples zhao et al 2008 according to the averages x 1 and x 2 and variances s 1 2 and s 2 2 of two subsamples the signal to noise ratio snr can be defined as follows 10 snr x 1 x 2 s 1 s 2 if n 1 n 2 10 a snr 1 0 means that the absolute value of the statistic t is larger than the critical value for the confidence level a 0 05 i e there is significant abrupt change in the sample 3 results 3 1 regional change in longitudinal functional connectivity as shown in fig 2 the average lfci is 0 84 in the taihu plain in the recent 50 period and the annual and decadal changes in lfci are insignificant in spite of this result the ideal value of the lfci should be 1 because a flat topography and crisscrossing rivers provide favourable conditions for better connectivity in this region the annual average lfci has a slightly increasing trend 0 0004 a but shows a more significant decreasing tendency since 2006 0 0033 a similarly the difference between decadal lfcis is small and these values also show a trend of first increasing and then decreasing therefore longitudinal functional connectivity must be improved because its status is not the best in the taihu plain especially given its degradation trend in recent years according to the hydrological regime in the taihu plain the five months from may to september in each year are regarded as the flood season and the other months are regarded as the non flood season on this basis the average lfcis in the flood and non flood seasons can be obtained as shown in fig 3 the average lfcis in the flood and non flood seasons all present slightly increasing trends in the recent 50 period and the increment rate in the flood season 0 0006 a is twice that in the non flood season 0 0003 a meanwhile the average lfci is 0 82 in the flood season but it is 0 86 in the non flood season in other words the longitudinal functional connectivity in the non flood season is better than that in the flood season although the improvement in the latter is greater than that in the former hence longitudinal functional connectivity must be further improved in the flood season by comparison the average lfcis in the first two months and last three months of the year are all greater than 0 85 but those in june july and august are less than 0 81 fig 4 meanwhile there are also increasing trends in the average lfcis in each month but their increment rates present larger differences the largest increment rate is 0 001 a in september but the lowest increment rate is only 0 00002 a in january meanwhile the increment rates are less than 0 0004 a in june july and august in summary the average values and increment rates of lfcis in june july and august are all smaller than those in other months and so longitudinal functional connectivity must be improved preferentially in june july and august 3 2 subregional changes in longitudinal functional connectivity to analyse the spatial temporal changes in longitudinal functional connectivity in the taihu plain the average lfci during 1960 2012 in each subregion is calculated the results indicate that the average lfci in wcxy is 0 80 and those in ycdm and hjh are 0 87 and 0 84 respectively therefore the longitudinal functional connectivity in ycdm is the most positive but that in wcxy is the least in the taihu plain this result implies that wcxy is the key subregion for improving longitudinal functional connectivity in the taihu plain similarly the annual average lfcis in each subregion presents slightly increasing trends but the increment rates present larger differences fig 5 specifically the increment rate of the annual average lfci in ycdm is 0 0001 a which is only one third that of hjh 0 0003 a and one ninth that of wcxy 0 0009 a meanwhile the five year moving average curve for the annual average lfci indicates that longitudinal functional connectivity decreases first and then increases in wcxy but the changes are alternate increases and decreases in ycdm and hjh in addition the decadal average lfci in wcxy decreases first and then increases but those in ycdm and hjh manifest inverse change trends these results indicate that longitudinal functional connectivity in ycdm and hjh presents decreasing trends in recent decades emphasizing that longitudinal functional connectivity must also be improved in these subregions there are also large differences in the changes in lfcis between the flood season and non flood season in each subregion fig 6 the average lfcis in both the flood season and non flood season present a slightly increasing trend in wcxy and the increment rate is 0 001 a meanwhile the five year moving average curves in these two periods also present first a decreasing and then an increasing trend but the fluctuation range in the flood season is less than that in the non flood season in contrast the average lfci in the flood season presents a slightly decreasing trend in ycdm but that in the non flood season presents a slightly increasing trend and the increment rate in the non flood season is twice the decrement rate in the flood season moreover the average lfci in hjh in the flood season presents a slightly increasing trend but that in the non flood season exhibits a slightly decreasing trend and the decrease rate in the non flood season is extremely small thus longitudinal functional connectivity improvement is recommended in the flood season in ycdm but in the non flood season in hjh as shown in fig 7 the three subregions have a common characteristic i e the monthly average lfci in each subregion presents first a decreasing and then an increasing trend the result indicates that the longitudinal functional connectivity in june july and august is worse than that in other months in the three subregions meanwhile the monthly average lfci in ycdm is the largest but that in wcxy is the smallest in addition the changes in the monthly average lfcis in the three subregions show larger differences the average lfci in each month all present different increasing rates in wcxy but those in ycdm and hjh also exhibit various decreasing magnitudes specifically a decreasing trend is observed in june july and august in ycdm but is seen in the first three months and the last two months in hjh in summary longitudinal functional connectivity improvement is strongly needed in june july and august in ycdm and in the first three months and last two months in hjh 3 3 station changes in longitudinal functional connectivity as shown in fig 8 the lfcis of 83 33 of the stations exceed 0 81 and the lfcis of 13 33 of the stations are between 0 71 and 0 80 but lfcis of 3 33 of the stations are less than 0 60 meanwhile the smaller annual average lfcis are mainly present at those stations near the border between the taihu plain and the western mountain subregion or the taihu lake subregion implying that longitudinal functional connectivity of those stations near the border between adjacent subregions must be improved preferentially similarly there are insignificant differences between the linear trend values of the annual average lfci at each station fig 8 table 2 the linear trend value is less than 0 001 at 86 67 of the stations and the maximum is only 0 0032 a while the minimum is less than 0 00001 a meanwhile the annual changes in the average lfci present a slightly increasing trend at 76 67 of the stations only 7 stations have slightly decreasing trends and they are mainly located near the border between the taihu plain and the western mountain subregion moreover stations with slightly decreasing trends are also distributed near the border between ycdm and wcxy or hjh these results indicate that longitudinal functional connectivity of the critical stations near the borders between adjacent subregions should be given more attention and improved as shown in fig 9 most of the decadal average lfcis are between 0 81 and 0 90 meanwhile the lfci at jingshanzha is greater than 0 90 in the 1960s at wangjiangjing in the 1970s and 2000s and at yucheng in the 2000s but the lfci is less than 0 60 at yuhang in addition the decadal average lfcis in those stations near the border between ycdm and wcxy or hjh also indicate a decreasing trend as an example the decadal average lfci at nianyukouzha decreases from 0 82 in the 1960s to 0 78 in the 2010s therefore longitudinal functional connectivity at those stations near the border between adjacent subregions must be improved however there are certain spatial differences in the average lfcis in the flood and non flood seasons fig 10 the average lfcis in the flood season are between 0 71 and 0 80 in wcxy but between 0 81 and 0 90 in ycdm meanwhile the average lfcis at 68 75 of the stations in hjh are between 0 81 and 0 90 and at the rest of the stations are between 0 71 and 0 80 these results indicate that the average lfci in the flood season is the least in wcxy but it is the most positive in ycdm although the average lfci in the non flood season is still between 0 81 and 0 90 at each station in ycdm it is also greater than 0 80 at each station in wcxy except baishaoshan compared with values in the flood season the average lfci in the non flood season also exceeds 0 80 at nianyukouzha and tangxi in hjh and is even greater than 0 90 at wangjiangjing overall the average lfci during the non flood season is more positive than that during the flood season thus the longitudinal functional connectivity at the stations in the flood season in wcxy must be improved first 3 4 abrupt changes in longitudinal functional connectivity according to the basic step of the m k test we can draw the curves of uf and ub for the annual average lfci in the taihu plain and two straight dashed lines representing the 95 confidence interval fig 11 the curves of uf and ub intersect in 1978 which indicates that there is a significant increasing trend in the annual average lfci in the taihu plain after 1978 meanwhile the uf curve continues the increasing trend and substantially exceeds the critical line of the 95 confidence interval after 1982 which indicates that the increasing trend of the annual average lfci in the taihu plain is extremely significant after 1982 moreover the abrupt change type of the annual average lfci observed in the taihu plain is a mean value abrupt change i e the annual average lfci increases to 0 84 during 1978 2012 from 0 83 during 1960 1977 this abrupt change point in longitudinal functional connectivity is consistent with the beginning of the rapid urbanization in the taihu plain which indicates that longitudinal functional connectivity is more sensitive to human activities than to climate change and other factors in this region similarly the abrupt change times for the annual average lfci in wcxy and hjh can be confirmed as 2001 and 1971 respectively fig 12 however there are four intersection points 1963 1971 2010 and 2011 between the 95 confidence level lines in ycdm confirming these four intersection points as abrupt change points is difficult therefore the mtt and yamamoto method are employed to analyse the true abrupt point and a decade is confirmed as the length of each subsample as shown in fig 12 d f 1984 and 1998 are both abrupt change points in ycdm the former is the abrupt change point from decreasing to increasing but the latter is the opposite these results indicate that the time points of connectivity improvement in the three subregions are inconsistent in fact the rehabilitation and reconstruction of river systems were generally carried out step by step and according to plan to discharge floods in the taihu plain and prevent water from entering shanghai these positive projects were widely constructed in hjh before the 1980s with the rapid development of the social economy in suzhou wuxi and changzhou the focus of these constructions migrated gradually to ycdm in the 1980s and to wcxy in the 2000s deng et al 2015b in addition the annual average lfci in ycdm presents significant degradation since 1998 a probable cause is that there were more disruptive human activities than the aforementioned protective human activities during the rapid urbanization such as the burying of tributaries and the embezzlement of lakes according to the three aforementioned methods the abrupt change time points for the annual average lfci in each station can be confirmed as shown in table 3 the abrupt change time points for the annual average lfci at each station are obviously different specially the times and trends of abrupt change at 80 of the stations are almost consistent with those in their subregion and 20 of the stations show earlier change times and opposite change trends in wcxy meanwhile in ycdm only 37 5 of the stations exhibit times and trends of abrupt change that are nearly identical to those of their subregion 50 of the stations show only one change point at different change times but 12 5 of the stations display extremely inconsistent change times and completely opposite change trends in addition in hjh only 18 75 of the stations exhibit times and trends of abrupt change similar to those of their subregion 31 25 of the stations show similar change trends but different change times and 6 25 of the stations display similar change times but opposite change trends 18 75 of the stations manifest different change times and opposite change trends but 25 of the stations present two change points and different change trends in general the abrupt change times and trends of the annual average lfcis at each station in wcxy are nearly consistent with those within the subregion but the times and trends exhibit significant differences in ycdm and the internal differences in hjh are more significant one reason for this pattern might be that the beginnings of extensive positive or negative human activities at each station were asynchronous across the taihu plain but these activities began at relatively consistent times in wcxy due to unified planning and management 3 5 correlations between longitudinal functional connectivity and climate change and human activities as a kind of hydrological connectivity longitudinal functional connectivity is also affected by climate change and human activities pumo et al 2017 ala aho et al 2018 among these changes precipitation is one of the most important indicators used to detect climate change liang et al 2011 and the modification of river systems and construction of dams and floodgates are two important human activities that impact hydrological connectivity deng et al 2018 karim et al 2015 thus we employed the annual precipitation ap and average lfci at each station from 1960 to 2012 to analyse the correlation between climate change and longitudinal functional connectivity limited by the available information we collected only river system data from the 1960s 1980s and 2010s and floodgate data in 2012 to achieve consistency among hydrology river system characteristics and floodgate data we generated a 20 km buffer around each station according the mean distance between every two adjacent stations then we calculated the number of floodgates nf and four common river system characteristic indicators in each buffer including river density dr the ratio of the total length of river to the buffer area water surface ratio wp the ratio of the total area of rivers and lakes at the mean water level to the buffer area river development coefficient kω the ratio of the total length of tributaries to that of the main river in a buffer and main river area length ratio rm the ratio of area and length of the main river in a buffer finally we employed the average lfci at each station and the river system characteristic indicators for each station buffer in the 1960s 1980s and 2010s to detect the correlations between longitudinal functional connectivity and river system characteristics and we used the average lfci and nf for each station buffer in 2012 to analyse the correlation between longitudinal functional connectivity and floodgates as presented in table 4 the pearson correlation coefficient between lfci and ap is negative and significant at the 0 01 level this result indicates that longitudinal functional connectivity significantly increases with decreasing precipitation the correlation is also consistent with an aforementioned result i e that longitudinal functional connectivity of the flood season is less than that of the non flood season meanwhile the pearson correlation coefficients between the lfci and the four river system characteristic indicators are all positive and the correlations are significant at the 0 01 level for dr and wp the results indicate that longitudinal functional connectivity increases with increases in these four indicators this phenomenon is extremely significant for river density and water surface ratios these results also demonstrate that there exists significant spatial heterogeneity in the changes in longitudinal functional connectivity similar to that for the non synchronous changes in river systems in time moreover the pearson correlation coefficient between the lfci and nf is positive but not significant at the 0 01 level which indicates that longitudinal functional connectivity increases with an increasing number of floodgates the insignificant correlation is possibly caused by neglecting the controlling rule of these floodgates due to the limitations of the data used in this study to discharge floods during the flood season or improve the water quality in the non flood season anthropogenic water exchange by water pumps significantly increases the longitudinal functional connectivity between areas inside and outside of floodgates 4 discussions 4 1 indicators of longitudinal functional connectivity the term longitudinal functional connectivity is widely seen as a process based hydrological connectivity from upstream to downstream areas but its applicability is always disputed the main contention is whether longitudinal functional connectivity can be quantitatively described by many indicators antoine et al 2009 troch et al 2009 currently although the concept of longitudinal functional connectivity is resonated with the wider public selecting one or more representative indicators to describe longitudinal functional connectivity variations remains an essential problem bracken et al 2013 in recent decades many indicators concerning catchment topography soil moisture and solute travel times have been developed and applied to longitudinal functional connectivity assessment bracken et al 2013 however some potential problems such as topographic factors and data requirements make these indicators inapplicable in many regions in addition the change in water level is often regarded as a characteristic of the hydrological process in delta plains therefore the response relations of water levels between adjacent stations bracken and croke 2007 cabezas et al 2011 can be employed to characterize longitudinal functional connectivity in delta plains in this study a new and quantitative indicator lfci was developed to describe longitudinal functional connectivity in delta plains based on the differences between water level fluctuations at adjacent stations this indicator can dynamically reflect the hydrological processes between adjacent river channels or different parts of the same river channel another advantage of the developed indicator is its lower data requirement i e only water level data are needed and these data are easy to obtain because of the widespread use of hydrological stations moreover this indicator relies on easily operated and convenient calculations which are two other advantages however the major issue with the developed indicator in this study is that it is only a rough estimate of the longitudinal functional connectivity at a large scale because it cannot reflect the differences in water level fluctuations between areas inside and outside of floodgates or in the different parts of a river channel which means that this indicator cannot estimate longitudinal functional connectivity at the micro scale another limitation of the developed indicator is that it is a measurement of only the longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems but functional connectivity is a four dimensional concept including lateral longitudinal vertical and temporal connectivity amoros and bornette 2010 covino 2017 thus the characteristic indicator of longitudinal functional connectivity should be further improved by combining more experimental observations at the micro scale furthermore the measurement of functional connectivity should be synthetically investigated in the lateral longitudinal vertical and temporal dimensions in the future 4 2 changes in longitudinal functional connectivity in recent years the river network connectivity of the jiaxing plain was also assessed using a comprehensive evaluation model based on hydraulic resistance and graph theory xu et al 2012 xu s result indicated that the river network connectivity was improved slightly after dredging i e the river network connectivity increased from 0 0018 to 0 0028 between the 1960s and 2010s the change trend of connectivity in his study was consistent with that in our study but the change rate in his study was larger than that in ours a primary reason for this difference is that the impacts of floodgates on river network connectivity were neglected in his study however the hydraulic connections between areas inside and outside of floodgates are limited extensively in delta plains as a result longitudinal functional connectivity depends largely on the control of floodgates in these regions therefore the developed indicator in our study can more objectively reveal the actual condition of the longitudinal functional connectivity and thus can provide a reference for longitudinal functional connectivity assessment in other delta plains our results also indicated that the longitudinal functional connectivity in ycdm was more positive than those in hjh and wcxy and that the value in the non flood season was better than that in the flood season but the abrupt changes in longitudinal functional connectivity presented larger difference in different subregions and stations which was consistent with the observed facts longitudinal structural connectivity of river systems is the prerequisite for and foundation of longitudinal functional connectivity because hydrological processes depend on various rivers and lakes in delta plains however a study concerning river health assessments in these regions indicated that the longitudinal structural connectivity in ycdm was more positive than those in hjh and wcxy deng et al 2015a as an example the γ index i e network connectivity of the arterial river systems was 0 54 in ycdm but was only 0 43 in hjh and wcxy therefore compared with hjh and wcxy better longitudinal structural connectivity led to preferable longitudinal functional connectivity in ycdm as mentioned frequent flood disasters are a key environmental problem in the taihu plain wang et al 2011 to mitigate flood disasters thousands of floodgates were constructed across urban and rural areas however closed floodgates often generated independent rivers and lakes and cut off the original longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems this conscious behavior by humans was extremely common during the flood season generally these floodgates in urban areas and polders were closed to protect against the ingress of outer river floods during the flood season in contrast these floodgates were often opened to generate water exchanges between inner and outer river channels and lakes during the non flood season consequently the longitudinal functional connectivity during the non flood season was always more positive than that during the flood season after the establishment of new china in 1949 most of the arterial river channels in the taihu plain were dredged and numerous farmlands were also reverted to lakes these human behaviours impacting increasing longitudinal functional connectivity became more common after the end of the 1970s therefore the annual average value of longitudinal functional connectivity exhibited an abrupt increase in 1978 however the sharp decrease in tributaries and the massive construction of floodgates also led to a decrease in longitudinal functional connectivity during the rapid urbanization thus the changes in longitudinal functional connectivity during a certain period or in a certain region depended on these human behaviours specifically longitudinal functional connectivity would be improved when protective behaviours were more vigorous than disruptive behaviours whereas connectivity might decline otherwise moreover the times and extents of these human behaviours were also characterized by significant differences in different subregions and at stations therefore the times and trends of the abrupt changes in longitudinal functional connectivity were also entirely different in different subregions and stations overall a slight improvement in longitudinal functional connectivity in the taihu plain was observed in our results in spite of this the status of the longitudinal functional connectivity of this region was not ideal especially at those stations near the borders of adjacent subregions the results agreed with the actual situation in the taihu plain to control floods extensive water conservancy projects were constructed in each subregion in recent decades although these protective behaviours improved the longitudinal functional connectivity to some extent they were effective in only some areas because of the lack of unified planning at the watershed scale in recent years the dramatic decrease in river systems under rapid urbanization deng et al 2015b led to the degeneration of longitudinal functional connectivity moreover integrated watershed management in this region is not easy to implement due to the conflicting interests of flood disaster mitigation and water environmental protection of different subregions and cities specifically ycdm belongs to suzhou city of jiangsu province and wcxy belongs to suzhou changzhou and wuxi cities of jiangsu province but hjh belongs to suzhou city of jiangsu province and jiaxing huzhou and hangzhou cities of zhejiang province thus the improvement of the longitudinal functional connectivity at those stations near the borders between adjacent subregions was often intentionally neglected by the local authorities on both sides as a result the longitudinal functional connectivity at these stations was less than those at the stations within each subregion 5 conclusions in this study according the differences between water level fluctuations at adjacent hydrological stations we develop a new quantitative longitudinal functional connectivity index lfci for delta plains focusing on the taihu plain we then analyse the spatial temporal changes in the lfci during 1960 2012 and investigate the correlation between the lfci and climate change and human activities the analyses of these changes on lfci lead to the following conclusions 1 the decadal annual and seasonal changes in the average lfci all presented slightly increasing trends in the taihu plain the average lfci in the flood season was worse than that in the non flood season and those in june july and august were also worse than those in other months 2 the average lfci was the least in wcxy but those in ycdm during the flood season and in hjh during the non flood season showed slightly decreasing trends decreasing trends were also present in june july and august in ycdm and in the first three months and the last two months in hjh 3 the average lfcis at those stations near the borders of adjacent subregions were less than those at other stations and they all presented slightly decreasing trends the average lfci during the flood season was worse than that during the non flood season at each station 4 abrupt change analysis indicated that a significant increasing trend in the annual average lfci in the taihu plain after 1978 but larger differences appeared between the times and trends of abrupt changes in the average lfci at the subregional and station scales 5 pearson correlation analysis showed that the average lfci had a significant and negative correlation with the annual precipitation and significant and positive correlations with river density and water surface ratio but an insignificant and positive correlation with the number of floodgates according the above analysis we believe the indicator developed in this study can be used as a practical tool to quantify the longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems in delta plains meanwhile in order to improve the longitudinal functional connectivity of river systems we also recommend that tributaries and lakes should be protected against reduction that river channels should be dredged constantly and that floodgates and other water conservancy projects should be controlled reasonably during rapid urbanization especially in june july and august in the flood season and at those stations near the borders of adjacent subregions acknowledgements

6979,a major challenge in predicting the response of both social hydrological and social ecological systems to environmental change is the lack of a causal framework for predicting thresholds of change between the linked social and natural components here we propose a social ecohydrological thresholds seht framework that integrates social hydrological trait based ecological and ecosystem services concepts this approach facilitates the identification of thresholds by treating ecosystem services as indicators of the coupling of social and natural components of the system using the san pedro riparian corridor in arizona as a case study we implemented the seht framework using ecological research and stakeholder perspectives to identify key drivers and thresholds in the social ecohydrological system in this way we were able to describe expected outcomes of different hydrological change scenarios on the system stakeholders provided input on the utility of this information to inform management decisions aimed at mitigating the impacts of environmental change the seht framework provides insight on dynamics of ecosystem services this paper demonstrates that application of the framework enables the identification of several critical drivers of potential thresholds in ecosystem services that derive from either natural or social components of the overall system these potential thresholds can guide ecosystem service assessment and monitoring and provide a roadmap for environmental management and the development of management scenarios abbreviations chans coupled human natural systems seht social ecohydrological thresholds ses social ecological systems shs social hydrological systems keywords ecosystem services social ecological systems social hydrological systems trait based ecology resilience san pedro river transboundary 1 introduction the need to understand bidirectional and co evolutionary feedbacks between society and biophysical systems has led to the development of a variety of conceptual and analytical frameworks that include social hydrological systems shs elshafei et al 2014 sivapalan et al 2012 social ecological systems ses berkes et al 2003 folke et al 2005 ostrom 2009 and the coupled human natural systems chans frameworks liu et al 2007 while these frameworks differ in their respective domains application and approaches they all seek to characterize the inter dependence of natural systems and society by treating them as components of an integrated system rather than as disparate systems with a limited set of interactions liu et al 2007 shs frameworks have been applied to risk mitigation related to flooding and droughts policy aspects of water resources and the integration of human action and choices into hydrological modeling frameworks di baldassarre et al 2013 gober and wheater 2015 troy et al 2015 ses has been applied to resource management and common pool resource settings that are broader in scope than a focus on hydrological systems such as fisheries forestry rangeland urban greenspace both frameworks share a consideration of the resilience of systems to disturbance and shocks biggs et al 2012 mao et al 2017 connelly et al 2017 and the sustainable management of resources which are also focal points of chans frameworks all of these frameworks share fundamental challenges when it comes to transferring conceptual understandings of thresholds and resilience into predictions for specific systems in this paper we bring approaches from ses and resilience ecology to bear on shs as we develop a social ecohydrological conceptual framework and then apply it to the case of a riparian watershed ecosystem in the sonoran desert our goal is to build on the ses shs approaches to create a framework that can be implemented in specific contexts for identification of key thresholds related to system resilience and that lead to changes in ecosystem service provision resilience has emerged as a critical concept for both studying the dynamics of complex systems and also the management of systems responses to environmental change and disturbance risks there are many definitions of resilience that vary by discipline and domain connelly et al 2017 but all agree with the national academies of science nas 2012 which defines resilience as the ability to prepare and plan for absorb recover from and more successfully adapt to adverse events resilience has been proposed as an alternative to classic approaches to risk management to better deal with the uncertainty of system response to change and the integrated nature of environmental systems and networks linkov et al 2014 resilience management involves maintaining a diverse set of ecologic hydrologic and social attributes of a system and accounting for the thresholds the systems and its components may reach that would drive their transition into different regimes angeler and allen 2016 allen et al 2016 there are several features of systems that are important in resilience management including critical functions thresholds time memory and adaptive management linkov et al 2016 connelly et al 2017 intrinsic in many of these features and definitions are the role that stakeholders and managers play in defining the scope and dynamics of the system under study for example from the point of view of shs and ses critical functions are ecosystem services that stakeholders recognize as important for society and assessing system performance connelly et al 2017 ecosystem services are often used as indicators of the resilience of a system to local pressures and global change drivers kandziora et al 2013 since they serve as links between social hydrological and ecological components of ses and shs brauman et al 2007 currie 2011 millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 reyers et al 2013 there has been a rapid emergence of frameworks to identify haines young and potschin 2013 map daily et al 2009 communicate haines young and potschin 2013 conceptualize de groot et al 2010 kandziora et al 2013 or interact with stakeholders to establish and prioritize childs et al 2013 martín lópez et al 2012 ecosystem services however it remains challenging to predict how much change in any component of a system will result in a change in service provision this is particularly true for shs in which changes in hydrology may impact ecosystem service provision indirectly by causing ecological change before direct impacts on water provision services are felt egoh et al 2009 we propose that a modified version of the ecosystem service cascade developed by the common international classification for ecosystem services cices can be used to identify hydrological and social thresholds that may lead to changes in es provision haines young and potschin 2013 the ecosystem service cascade provides a useful framework for conceptualizing the linkages between natural systems and human well being by describing how environmental changes can cascade through a series of related system components including es de groot et al 2010 haines young 2011 haines young and potschin 2013 kandziora et al 2013 here linkages between components of the human natural system exist when pressures on one component that may initially be minor eventually build up to cause important alterations influencing connected components chapin et al 2010 groffman et al 2006 scheffer et al 2001 however the cascade does not provide a means of predicting when a threshold in one component will be reached causing changes in the behavior of a connected component it is not clear how much change in an ecosystem property can take place before there is a change in an associated ecosystem process since the processes and mechanisms underlying the dynamics of different systems may not be the same adger and adger 2000 garmestani et al 2009 it is difficult to predict how different management decisions might feed through the system to result in changes in ecosystem services therefore understanding how threshold dynamics play out in shs requires a more explicit consideration of the underlying processes of different shs subsystems that generate ecosystem services we propose a solution to this problem by implementing concepts from ecological resilience theory in conjunction with a modified version of the ecosystem service cascade in a new social ecohydrological thresholds seht framework the difference between the seht and the existing ecosystem service cascade is the focus on a differentiating change within component systems and b identifying when change will cross a threshold the goal of this model is to improve the management of shs by allowing decision makers to anticipate how changes in one component of an shs may impact the rest of the system such system wide impacts are apparent as changes in ecosystem services 2 social ecohydrological thresholds framework the seht framework aims to track how changes in one component of a social ecohydrological system can be expected to feed through to impact the linked components the biophysical components of the seht are hydrological change biophysical change change in processes the social components of the seht are change in benefits change in values and change in use change in service provision is the result of both biophysical and social components of the seht changes in any one component of the system may occur without impacting a connected unit until a threshold is reached fig 1 an essential feature of thresholds in seh systems is that change in one unit of the system is also a component of change in another unit of the system this overlap depends on the degree of linkage between them below we describe how such overlap can be identified for biophysical and social components of the system 2 1 biophysical components in the seht hydrological changes are linked to ecosystem service provision through biological response while hydrological change may also have direct impacts on ecosystem service provision di baldassarre et al 2013 our focus is on identifying indirect effects as these are generally less easily apparent to identify biophysical thresholds we use a mechanistic trait based ecological framework predicting how environmental change will alter biological communities and in turn impact ecosystem processes fig 2 de bello et al 2010 díaz et al 2007 lavorel and garnier 2002 lavorel and grigulis 2012 suding et al 2008 in the trait based approach rather than focusing on the community or species level of organization organisms are grouped into assemblages based on similar sets of traits i e any measurable property of an organism such as size plant rooting depth or leaf mass per area mcgill et al 2006 these groupings may be based on traits that result in a similar response to a particular environmental driver response traits or on traits that cause organisms to have similar impacts on ecosystem processes effect traits lavorel and garnier 2002 suding et al 2008 the degree of overlap between groupings based on response and effect traits can be used to anticipate thresholds in an environmental driver that will result in altered ecosystem processes fig 1 thresholds 1 2 3 if specific response and effect traits are the same or are observed to co occur consistently across species they will reinforce the effects of environmental change likely propagating them through to connected elements of the system fig 2a for example if plants with close associations with nitrogen fixing bacteria an effect trait all have shallow rooting depths a response trait a decline in the water table depth will have a large impact on nitrogen availability in the ecosystem by contrast if response and effect traits change independently or are found across multiple species but in different patterns a greater degree of environmental change and more species losses will be required to alter ecosystem processes meaning that environmental change is less likely to alter other elements of the system fig 2b for instance if nitrogen fixing bacteria are associated with a number of different species of plants with a broad range of rooting depths the loss of shallow rooted plants caused by declining water table depths would have a much smaller impact on nitrogen availability this trait framework has been successful in predicting how specific drivers will alter ecosystem processes lienin and kleyer 2012 and in predicting the impacts of trade offs in plant traits on potential ecosystem service provision de bello et al 2010 díaz et al 2007 lavorel et al 2011 lavorel and grigulis 2012 luck et al 2009 however most ecological studies taking this approach identify potential service provision without linking them the social components of the system in such a way as to determine if they are valued or used by incorporating this approach into the seht framework we can use it to identify biophysical and ecological thresholds in service provision and then link these to service use by society 2 2 social components ecosystem service provision is determined by the combination of ecological properties and the social context in which a particular ecosystem process is deemed to be of benefit burkhard et al 2014 ernstson 2013 identification of when changes in service use values and benefits fig 1 thresholds 4 5 6 will alter each other must be addressed through stakeholder engagement and participatory management muro and jeffrey 2012 two priorities emerge from engaging stakeholders in the identification assessment and management of ecosystem services first reflexive understanding of ecosystem processes and coupled human behavior enhances stakeholders perceptions of changes in services and benefits this is broadly understood as social learning in the adaptive management and environmental governance literature crona and parker 2012 second managing ecosystem processes with the aim of preserving restoring or enhancing services and benefits is often most effectively pursued in broad networks or coalitions of stakeholders a process referred to as collaborative governance childs et al 2013 for both social learning and collaborative governance scientist stakeholder communication is essential while numerous methods have been developed the interactive workshop arguably remains the most effective means of engagement and communication scott et al 2012 such workshops allow identification of key values of the community which in turn determine the ways that ecosystem services are used and the benefits received from services the likelihood that change in each of these components will induce change in another determines the degree of coupling between them and therefore serves to identify thresholds 2 3 component integration in the seht framework fig 1 slight changes in any one component box may have little or no impact on connected pieces of the system in which case it remains contained in that component and does not propagate through the system blue drivers green ecosystem red social system and purple services when change in a given component is large enough or of the right type a threshold is crossed allowing it to alter dynamics of a connected component of the system gold areas a system in which the gold areas are very distant from each other as depicted here is relatively stable since it would need to experience a large degree of change in any one component in order to see changes in others a system in which the gold areas were very close or even overlapping would be unstable since change in any one component would very quickly impact other parts of the system in the seht framework fig 1 the first biophysical threshold can be identified by response traits that determine the ability of different sets of organisms to survive under different degrees of environmental change the second process threshold can be identified by changes in effect traits that determine the impacts of organisms responses on ecosystem processes the stronger the response to a driver and the greater the degree of overlap between response and effect traits the greater the impact of environmental change on ecosystem processes the social thresholds in the model can be identified by changes in values that alter benefit threshold 5 or use threshold 6 ecosystem services are defined by the interaction of the social and ecological components at the point where changes in ecosystem processes alter ecosystem service provision threshold 3 the point at which changes in social benefit due to altered values impact ecosystem service definition threshold 4 and the point at which changes in human use will alter environmental drivers threshold 7 to illustrate how the seht approach could be applied to evaluate the impacts of different environmental changes on an shs we implement it in the san pedro riparian corridor an example of an arid region shs in southeastern arizona we focused on water availability as a key environmental driver and examined the degree of overlap between traits governing response to changes in water availability and traits impacting ecosystem processes we then conducted stakeholder workshops to identify social values that determined how ecosystem processes translated to important ecosystem services 3 methods 3 1 study system and approach we focused on the san pedro river in southeastern arizona one of the last undammed perennial rivers in the sonoran desert stromberg and tellman 2009 the first 40 miles of the san pedro river within the united states north of the border where it flows in from mexico fall within the federally protected san pedro riparian national conservation area fig 3 despite being widely recognized as having high cultural and ecological importance the san pedro river is showing trends of decreasing flow as population growth increases demand for the limited water resources in the area stromberg and tellman 2009 warren et al 1996 the pressing need to make trade off decisions regarding water use made this an ideal system in which to implement our approach to identify thresholds in ecosystem service provision serrat capdevila et al 2009 3 2 identification of key drivers traits and ecosystem processes in order to establish where the biophysical thresholds suggested by the seht fig 1 thresholds 1 2 3 might exist in this system we used existing research on the san pedro river published in peer reviewed journals and the book ecology and conservation of the san pedro river stromberg and tellman 2009 to identify key drivers traits and processes we identified focal papers table 1 as those specifically related to 1 environmental drivers of the system such as hydrological or geomorphological processes 2 thresholds in these processes such as sustained disappearance of surface water flow fig 1 threshold 1 3 information on plant assemblages particularly with reference to their response to environmental drivers or effects on ecosystem processes fig 1 thresholds 1 2 4 biophysical processes influenced by riparian vegetation fig 1 thresholds 2 3 and 5 biodiversity supported by riparian areas fig 1 threshold 3 we followed stromberg and tellman s 2009 identification of five major species assemblages found in the near riparian areas of the san pedro river 1 marsh herbaceous plants dependent on surface water 2 native cottonwood willow riparian gallery forest dominated by populus fremontii and salix gooddingii 3 tamarisk woodland dominated by invasive tamarix sp 4 mesquite bosque dominated by prosopis velutina and 5 sacaton grassland dominated by sporobolus sp for each major plant species assemblage we identified a community composition the species generally found in this particular assemblage b drivers major factors contributing to the existence or maintenance of the assemblage c thresholds tipping points beyond which species assemblages are predicted to disappear based on changes in the drivers d response traits the plant species traits which governed where thresholds fell e effect traits the plant species traits which contribute to the ability of the species assemblage to drive a process f ecosystem processes any processes for which these species assemblages are known to be important drivers g potential services any potential es to which the previously identified processes contribute supplementary tables 1 and 2 we inferred response and effect traits and es where they were not mentioned directly inferences of potential es were guided by the millennium ecosystem assessment s millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 categorization of service types as well as previous research on this specific system by bagstad et al 2012 this information represented the biophysical properties and ecosystem processes parts of the seht fig 1 3 3 stakeholder workshops and surveys in order to identify the social drivers of ecosystem services that could lead to thresholds shown in the seht fig 1 thresholds 4 5 6 we conducted two stakeholder workshops building on methods developed by scott et al 2012 to identify perceptions of key es participants were invited from a list of members of the upper san pedro partnership the upper san pedro partnership was formed in 1998 and is an association of federal state and local agencies and organizations that assist in meeting the long term water needs in the basin partners are key decision makers in the basin because they control land or water in the watershed make policy relevant to the watershed or provide technical expertise the partnership includes a range of stakeholders including representatives from governmental agencies such as the us geological survey the bureau of land management and arizona state land department non governmental organizations such as the nature conservancy and the audubon society fort huachuca a nearby military base and local towns such as sierra vista bisbee and tombstone we focused our workshop on members of the upper san pedro partnership because our objectives were to understand the es perceptions of key decision makers in the san pedro river basin the first workshop included a presentation explaining the ecosystem service concept and categories outlined by the millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 and then exercises to determine stakeholder perceptions of es in the san pedro river basin we asked the 17 participants to write down all the benefits they considered the san pedro river to provide and then grouped similar items into emergent rather than pre determined categories the research team compiled these responses to eliminate repetitions then presented the compiled lists and categories to the assembled participants giving them the opportunity to disagree with and refine eliminations and combinations to ensure the results accurately represented the overall group opinion we linked the services prioritized in the workshop supplementary table 3 to the ecosystem processes identified by the research team by grouping them into categories of services provided by the same ecosystem process the second workshop included 10 respondents comprising rural and urban residents as well as representatives from government business agriculture and ngos in this workshop we presented participants with the es identified in the first workshop combined with response and effect trait groupings we synthesized from the literature and asked participants to rank them in order of importance the linkage between services in the aesthetics category and the plant community types identified from literature review is particularly subjective so we presented participants with images of sections of the river that fit into the different community types and asked them to rate them on a scale of 1 5 from very attractive to very unattractive with reference to aesthetic services these stakeholder workshops provided us with information on the social uses values and benefits that determined which properties and processes of the ecosystem were important es from the point of view of decision makers to further identify thresholds using the seht model fig 1 we looked for overlap and disconnections between the services that were vulnerable to environmental change and that were identified as highly ranked by decision makers together these biophysical and social data can inform if there are expected biophysical changes that would be associated with es that were more or less important to decision makers human subject research was approved by the university of arizona institutional review board fwa00004218 ua irb project 10 0461 00 dated 07 07 2010 participants provided written consent for use of their responses for research 4 results 4 1 biophysical thresholds sources used for the identification of drivers thresholds traits biophysical processes and biodiversity are listed in table 1 the conclusions from the compilation of this research are as follows water availability and flood regime were key hydrological drivers of ecosystem properties in the san pedro riparian corridor that could lead to biological changes the first threshold in the seht supplementary table 1 since most of the riparian plant species require a constant supply of groundwater rooting depth is a major trait governing species turnover in response to altered water availability based on this we were able to identify five thresholds in depth to groundwater that would result in the loss of one of five plant groups fig 4 thresholds in groundwater depth can be expected to result in changes in plant community ecosystem processes and ecosystem services based on plant response and effect traits and stakeholder identification of ecosystem services different shades of blue represent thresholds fig 4 in the driver water availability which influence plant community composition through key response traits orange boxes with shades indicating differences in rooting depth marsh plants with shallow less than 1 m rooting depths are expected to disappear as soon as stream flow ceases to be perennial stromberg and tellman 2009 sacaton grassland is lost with a decline in groundwater below 3 m which is the same point at which young cottonwood and willow trees cease to be able to establish themselves however adult cottonwood and willow riparian gallery forest will be maintained until groundwater drops below 4 6 m stromberg and tellman 2009 because of this difference in the key response trait we created a separate category for adult native riparian forest that includes areas where only established trees primarily cottonwood with deep roots can survive the non native tamarisks have rooting depths of up to 10 m stromberg and tellman 2009 meaning that they can be maintained even after depth to groundwater has far surpassed depths at which the native riparian vegetation could survive mesquite has the deepest rooting depth 53 m and is capable of surviving even greater declines in groundwater depth stromberg and tellman 2009 fig 4 supplementary table 1 in order to identify the points at which biological changes would alter ecosystem processes threshold 2 in the seht we examined the relationship between response and effect traits the major effect traits we identified for this system were groundcover woody stem density root structure and depth leaf area canopy height and structure and seed production supplementary table 2 these effect traits influenced processes of flood attenuation soil stabilization gas exchange water redistribution nutrient cycling and contribution to habitat for birds mammals and insects as well as forage for livestock supplementary table 2 in certain cases the system appeared not to be resilient to changes in water availability since species loss altered the sets of effect traits present for example both marsh plants and tree species in the native riparian assemblage contribute to flood attenuation by slowing waters but marsh plants contribute more to sediment deposition whereas the native riparian trees contribute more to capture of woody debris fig 4 supplementary table 2 these differences influence the type and amount of litter and sediment inputs to riparian soil in other cases the system appeared to be resilient because different species assemblages with different key response trait values contributed in similar ways to the same processes for example native riparian trees and tamarisk all contributed to soil stabilization supplementary table 2 intraspecific differences in response trait values based on age also had the potential to alter the effect traits present in the community without changes in dominant species identity for example loss of the young native riparian assemblage could alter bird habitat availability through a loss of mid canopy nesting areas fig 4 supplementary table 2 thus because multiple response groups sometimes contributed to the same ecosystem processes in slightly different ways thresholds that led to a change in plant species assemblage were not necessarily the same as thresholds predicted to change ecosystem processes fig 2 4 2 thresholds between ecosystem processes and services stakeholders identified the following categories of ecosystem services water culture vegetation wildlife recreation health well being economy ft huachuca avoiding base closure regulation of natural processes and aesthetics supplementary table 3 note that while some of these categories such as regulation of natural processes fit roughly into the millennium ecosystem assessment categories others did not notably while stakeholders defined a culture category it did not exactly correspond to the cultural services category of the millennium ecosystem assessment rather it focused on ways in which the ecosystem contributes to cultural life and place based aesthetics health well being and recreation as their own categories participants also emphasized a number of very system specific services such as the need for water to maintain fort huachuca which is an important contributor to the local economy we used the results of the first workshop to direct activities at the second workshop so as to clarify the perceptions of the services identified previously we calculated mean rankings of services table 2 and ratings of ecosystem conditions table 3 to identify potential priorities in services and ecosystem conditions that the decision makers may have while not statistically significantly different the highest ranked service based on mean and median rankings was carbon sequestration followed by tourism aesthetics recreation and nutrient cycling table 2 wildlife diversity education and flood regulation were ranked as least important based on mean and median rankings however note that bird biodiversity is a major source of tourism for this area so while it was not highly valued intrinsically it should be considered an ecosystem service that supports tourism bagstad et al 2012 during the photographic aesthetics assessment the two highest rated photographs of the san pedro river showed adult cottonwood trees with surface water and adult cottonwood with marsh plants table 3 the two lowest rated photographs based on median scores depicted a mesquite bosque from a distance and cottonwood trees with a dry channel photographs of tamarisk and mesquite stands received lower mean ratings yet their median ratings were the same as photographs of a bank stabilizing cottonwood stand and a channel with unstable banks and grasses all of these photographs received a median ranking of 4 out of 5 indicating that even conditions that would be considered ecologically degraded maintained aesthetic appeal these results were obtained during a workshop that was targeted at understanding how key decision makers in the upper san pedro partnership value these services a broader survey of public perception and ranking of the services could verify these results and further inform decision making rosenberger and loomis 2017 where possible services identified in the workshops were linked to processes identified in the biophysical literature review fig 4 not all of the services mentioned in the workshops could be clearly tied to a particular process in some cases this was due to a lack of information on social values for example it was unclear which specific aspects of the system would be needed to provide many of the health well being services so it was not possible to predict which changes in the system would result in their loss 5 discussion 5 1 analysis of thresholds tracking the response traits related to changes in water table depth and effect traits related to ecosystem processes allowed us to identify key biophysical thresholds in the san pedro river system stakeholder workshops provided us with information on the social uses values and benefits that determined which properties and processes of the ecosystem were services the stronger the response to a driver and the greater the degree of overlap between response and effect traits the greater the impact of environmental change on ecosystem processes suding et al 2008 likewise the more ecosystem properties that contributed to provision of a service the more hydrological change could take place before it was lost the ecosystem services most vulnerable to changes in hydrology were those that depended on the presence of surface water and could not be fully provided without it these were the services of bird plant and wildlife diversity as well as the tourism dependent on them fig 4 while bird and wildlife diversity were not consistently highly ranked by stakeholders tourism did receive a consistently high ranking table 2 this indicates a higher likelihood of crossing the biophysical threshold for this service than the social threshold such vulnerability of a valued service suggests it should be prioritized in management decisions however such management is made challenging by the finding that stakeholders do not consistently value the biodiversity that is a major underlying driver of tourism such challenges have been encountered in other systems due to the complexity of the connections between biodiversity and ecosystem services and are the end result of many varied processes and interactions in socio hydrological systems harrison et al 2014 mace et al 2012 methodological limits to using biodiversity and ecosystem service relationships in management contexts often stem from difficulties in communication regarding uncertainties particularly at local scales that hamper discussions of service values and provision ruckelshaus et al 2015 approaching management and planning with more explicit distinctions between the goods that people use and the ecosystem services that provide them may make management of ecosystem services more fruitful when approached from interdisciplinary and multi stakeholder perspectives bateman et al 2011 de groot et al 2010 mace et al 2012 the impact of changing hydrology on aesthetics appeared to depend on the stakeholder with surface water loss decreasing aesthetic appeal for most individuals but further water losses impacting aesthetics for some individuals more than others our survey results showed that photographs depicting cottonwood trees with surface water were rated more highly than cottonwood trees with a dry river channel table 3 the latter was rated very similarly to areas dominated by invasive tamarisk this suggests that amongst this group of respondents surface water was highly valued for aesthetics but cottonwood trees were not strongly preferred to tamarisk trees in this case there seemed to be a threshold in service provision associated with the loss of surface water but not with a transition from cottonwood to tamarisk however changes in the economy or population and demographics of the community could alter the benefits people derive from the ecosystem and therefore could result in altered service provision without any change to the ecology of the system thus aesthetics seems to be particularly dependent on the combination of social and biophysical thresholds gee and burkhard 2010 schaich et al 2010 tengberg et al 2012 cultural ecosystem services such as this have been shown to be important for connecting senses of place and landscape to decisions that alter the way landscapes may provide other ecosystem services gee and burkhard 2010 despite their importance cultural services have received limited focus in research and management of ecosystem services in part because they are difficult to assess and link to economic models tengberg et al 2012 however a focus on the role of stakeholders in creating and managing cultural landscapes through spatial assessment and planning holds promise for expanding the utility for such services in environmental management services of this type lie at the heart of much of the social ecological and social hydrological systems work and require consistent attention to both social and biophysical components of the system reyers et al 2013 in contrast soil stabilization carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling appeared to be highly resilient to changes in water table depth fig 4 since several response groups on the san pedro i e plants with different rooting depths have similar effects on these services loss of a native riparian community will not eliminate them if it is replaced by tamarisk trees which may have the same effect but respond differently to the same change in water availability because of this overlap in effect traits loss of native riparian gallery forest is not a threshold for soil stabilization of these carbon sequestration was the highest ranked by stakeholders soil stabilization the lowest and nutrient cycling in between table 2 however there was high variability in the ranked importance of carbon sequestration this indicates that its status as a service is vulnerable to changes in the social components of the system that alter the composition of stakeholders to include more or fewer people with a particular stance on the value of carbon sequestration approaches for dealing with variation in the needs of different sets of stakeholders in a social ecological system require delicate collaborative work ernstson 2013 notably co production approaches hold promise for working with multiple stakeholder perspectives to better manage systems for ecosystem service provision through collaborative management and decision making reyers et al 2015 characteristics that indicate the diversity of stakeholders including both identities roles and perspectives and capabilities ability and opportunities to affect change are important for the outcomes of the co production of ecosystem services fischer and eastwood 2016 identification of the contribution of the social components of the system to ecosystem service provision and resilience can be critical for the identification of trade offs between services in the context of environmental management martín lópez et al 2012 yates et al 2005 social ecological and hydrological resilience for ecosystem services are linked and often exhibit reciprocal or iterative causality adger and adger 2000 collins et al 2011 mao et al 2017 scott and buechler 2013 the seht is able to identify which services are highly vulnerable to biophysical change to social change or to both services that are not vulnerable to social change but are vulnerable to biophysical change should receive high priority for management actions services that are particularly vulnerable to social change will require more complex governance arrangements e g reliance on external expertise comparative reference to analogous cases sustained stakeholder engagement including recurring public comment processes and public dissemination of current and future resilience challenges such choices are likely to be best managed through collaborative decision making and adaptive management approaches caves et al 2013 5 2 relevance of scale a key finding of this approach is that the biophysical thresholds identified in the seht will depend on the spatial scale at which the social ecohydrological system is defined and assessed the case assessed here is part of the binational us mexico san pedro watershed which raises the possibility of considering transboundary es biodiversity and social processes as well as binational adaptive management varady et al 2013 while many of the ecological dynamics are similar across the border or occur over a gradient that is determined topographically and ecohydrologically resource use practices social vulnerability and adaptive capacity vary considerably norman et al 2012 in related initiatives members of the present research team have participated in bridging u s and mexican stakeholder groups however for the present study transboundary dynamics are considered to be exogenous drivers of change with primary definition of the u s social ecological system for assessment even within the u s san pedro our choice of scale was important to the outcome of our study because key plant traits varied by age group within certain species grouping plants by response traits resulted in more categories of plant types than if we had focused instead on the major community types identified in previous research stromberg and tellman 2009 this meant that alteration in ecosystem service provision was possible without major change in the overall community type for example a loss of perennial surface water crossed a biological threshold leading to marsh species loss changes in flood attenuation and a loss of habitat for wading birds with no change in the dominant riparian gallery forest community type fig 4 this has important implications for mapping ecosystem services most of this work is currently focused at large scales such that specific land use or land cover categories are assumed to provide certain sets of services egoh et al 2008 raudsepp hearne et al 2010 while this approach makes sense for these large landscape level studies our results suggest that more detailed information is needed for management of local systems the loss of the marsh community is socially significant because it impacts tourism i e it causes threshold 3 in the seht to be crossed and is therefore associated with a loss of service provision however models based on aggregations at the community level such as land cover classifications alone would not predict important changes to occur until the depth to groundwater declines to below six meters and cottonwood riparian community was lost considerations of scale are also important to the reverse case in which a biological change might not alter service provision for example even after land cover type has been changed and the riparian area is dominated by tamarisk these trees still provide bank stabilization habitat for mid canopy nesting birds and some degree of aesthetic appeal if only these services are important to the society management for both native riparian and tamarisk communities would allow for their continued provision since tamarisk communities can persist with much deeper levels of groundwater a focus on the maintenance of mid canopy bird habitat and bank stabilization would require much less water allocation to riparian areas than if only native riparian gallery forest could provide these services thus in order to predict changes in ecosystem service provision it is first necessary to identify the appropriate scale of analysis then by grouping ecosystem services based on common ecological drivers fig 4 rather than types of ecosystem service haines young and potschin 2013 millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 raudsepp hearne et al 2010 our seht framework should facilitate the mapping of ecosystem service supply and demand burkhard et al 2012 once an appropriate scale has been determined the ecological trait based framework identifies service supply and social values identify ecosystem service demand emphasizing ecosystem service supply as separate from demand explicitly includes supporting ecosystem services that may easily be ignored when bundled with other categories redford and adams 2009 because the seht framework also emphasizes the identification of thresholds it can serve as an aid to consider the resilience of the social ecohydrological system based on the degree of overlap between the social perceptions and ecological processes supporting ecosystem services thus the seht framework can provide managers and decision makers with detailed information that can be used to assess trade offs between different desired ecosystem services or between management of areas with different capacities to provide ecosystem services current ecosystem service approaches face criticism of applicability to local management decisions bagstad et al 2012 presnall et al 2014 this is largely because the ecosystem service approach tends to focus on scales that are too broad to be relevant to users who will make decisions based upon ecosystem service information and because information generated about ecosystem services tends to focus too much on the supply of services at the expense of information about the demand for services with a focus on the mechanistic drivers of thresholds of ecosystem services the seht model can help to bridge scales relevant for management for example in the san pedro river basin an adaptive management approach has been adopted that focuses largely on mitigating risk related to meeting water demand for development and environmental goals richter et al 2009 this risk can be linked to local scales where the ecological dynamics are driven by processes that reflect environmental heterogeneity and introduced species stromberg and tellman 2009 management decisions are being supported by the development of models and decision support tools here the seht approach can help parameterize stakeholder defined mechanisms that are represented in such models pope and gimblett 2017 2015 the seht approach also helps to mitigate risk by identifying thresholds that would be recognized by experts and managers working to enhance resilience in the basin neil et al 2005 scott and buechler 2013 these thresholds become a set of indicator variables that can be monitored to help enhance the resilience of the watershed to climate land use and economic drivers critical aspects of resilience management connelly et al 2017 linkov et al 2016 the seht model informs management decisions by representing the mechanisms that underlie the generation of ecosystem service provision and demand as well as critical thresholds in ecosystem service dynamics 6 conclusions we introduced a conceptual social ecohydrologic threshold seht framework that draws on social ecological systems and resilience ecology theory identifying thresholds in the provision of ecosystem services in a socio hydrological system specifically the seht model refines the ecosystem service cascade with concepts from trait based ecology and stakeholder derived information on the social system our approach identified potential thresholds in the ecological and ecosystem service components of the seht and identified likely locations for thresholds within the hydroecological and social components and scales for their interaction because ecosystem services are treated as emergent properties of the seht our approach identifies theoretical and practical approaches for utilizing the ecosystem service concept at both landscape and local scales recognition that local scale ecohydrological and social processes drive the generation of ecosystem services in a social hydrological system allows the seht framework to better inform decision making by predicting how ecosystem services may change under different management scenarios the seht framework identifies several critical drivers of potential thresholds in seht ecosystem services these thresholds can guide future research in ecosystem service assessment of potential provision flow and demand for services at the local level burkhard et al 2014 as these thresholds reflect the drivers of change along with the perceptions and decisions of managers the seht framework can guide resilience management approaches for environmental change linkov et al 2016 connelly et al 2017 the seht framework can provide a roadmap for managers and practitioners to identify scenarios and indicator data sets to identify potential threshold dynamics in social

6979,a major challenge in predicting the response of both social hydrological and social ecological systems to environmental change is the lack of a causal framework for predicting thresholds of change between the linked social and natural components here we propose a social ecohydrological thresholds seht framework that integrates social hydrological trait based ecological and ecosystem services concepts this approach facilitates the identification of thresholds by treating ecosystem services as indicators of the coupling of social and natural components of the system using the san pedro riparian corridor in arizona as a case study we implemented the seht framework using ecological research and stakeholder perspectives to identify key drivers and thresholds in the social ecohydrological system in this way we were able to describe expected outcomes of different hydrological change scenarios on the system stakeholders provided input on the utility of this information to inform management decisions aimed at mitigating the impacts of environmental change the seht framework provides insight on dynamics of ecosystem services this paper demonstrates that application of the framework enables the identification of several critical drivers of potential thresholds in ecosystem services that derive from either natural or social components of the overall system these potential thresholds can guide ecosystem service assessment and monitoring and provide a roadmap for environmental management and the development of management scenarios abbreviations chans coupled human natural systems seht social ecohydrological thresholds ses social ecological systems shs social hydrological systems keywords ecosystem services social ecological systems social hydrological systems trait based ecology resilience san pedro river transboundary 1 introduction the need to understand bidirectional and co evolutionary feedbacks between society and biophysical systems has led to the development of a variety of conceptual and analytical frameworks that include social hydrological systems shs elshafei et al 2014 sivapalan et al 2012 social ecological systems ses berkes et al 2003 folke et al 2005 ostrom 2009 and the coupled human natural systems chans frameworks liu et al 2007 while these frameworks differ in their respective domains application and approaches they all seek to characterize the inter dependence of natural systems and society by treating them as components of an integrated system rather than as disparate systems with a limited set of interactions liu et al 2007 shs frameworks have been applied to risk mitigation related to flooding and droughts policy aspects of water resources and the integration of human action and choices into hydrological modeling frameworks di baldassarre et al 2013 gober and wheater 2015 troy et al 2015 ses has been applied to resource management and common pool resource settings that are broader in scope than a focus on hydrological systems such as fisheries forestry rangeland urban greenspace both frameworks share a consideration of the resilience of systems to disturbance and shocks biggs et al 2012 mao et al 2017 connelly et al 2017 and the sustainable management of resources which are also focal points of chans frameworks all of these frameworks share fundamental challenges when it comes to transferring conceptual understandings of thresholds and resilience into predictions for specific systems in this paper we bring approaches from ses and resilience ecology to bear on shs as we develop a social ecohydrological conceptual framework and then apply it to the case of a riparian watershed ecosystem in the sonoran desert our goal is to build on the ses shs approaches to create a framework that can be implemented in specific contexts for identification of key thresholds related to system resilience and that lead to changes in ecosystem service provision resilience has emerged as a critical concept for both studying the dynamics of complex systems and also the management of systems responses to environmental change and disturbance risks there are many definitions of resilience that vary by discipline and domain connelly et al 2017 but all agree with the national academies of science nas 2012 which defines resilience as the ability to prepare and plan for absorb recover from and more successfully adapt to adverse events resilience has been proposed as an alternative to classic approaches to risk management to better deal with the uncertainty of system response to change and the integrated nature of environmental systems and networks linkov et al 2014 resilience management involves maintaining a diverse set of ecologic hydrologic and social attributes of a system and accounting for the thresholds the systems and its components may reach that would drive their transition into different regimes angeler and allen 2016 allen et al 2016 there are several features of systems that are important in resilience management including critical functions thresholds time memory and adaptive management linkov et al 2016 connelly et al 2017 intrinsic in many of these features and definitions are the role that stakeholders and managers play in defining the scope and dynamics of the system under study for example from the point of view of shs and ses critical functions are ecosystem services that stakeholders recognize as important for society and assessing system performance connelly et al 2017 ecosystem services are often used as indicators of the resilience of a system to local pressures and global change drivers kandziora et al 2013 since they serve as links between social hydrological and ecological components of ses and shs brauman et al 2007 currie 2011 millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 reyers et al 2013 there has been a rapid emergence of frameworks to identify haines young and potschin 2013 map daily et al 2009 communicate haines young and potschin 2013 conceptualize de groot et al 2010 kandziora et al 2013 or interact with stakeholders to establish and prioritize childs et al 2013 martín lópez et al 2012 ecosystem services however it remains challenging to predict how much change in any component of a system will result in a change in service provision this is particularly true for shs in which changes in hydrology may impact ecosystem service provision indirectly by causing ecological change before direct impacts on water provision services are felt egoh et al 2009 we propose that a modified version of the ecosystem service cascade developed by the common international classification for ecosystem services cices can be used to identify hydrological and social thresholds that may lead to changes in es provision haines young and potschin 2013 the ecosystem service cascade provides a useful framework for conceptualizing the linkages between natural systems and human well being by describing how environmental changes can cascade through a series of related system components including es de groot et al 2010 haines young 2011 haines young and potschin 2013 kandziora et al 2013 here linkages between components of the human natural system exist when pressures on one component that may initially be minor eventually build up to cause important alterations influencing connected components chapin et al 2010 groffman et al 2006 scheffer et al 2001 however the cascade does not provide a means of predicting when a threshold in one component will be reached causing changes in the behavior of a connected component it is not clear how much change in an ecosystem property can take place before there is a change in an associated ecosystem process since the processes and mechanisms underlying the dynamics of different systems may not be the same adger and adger 2000 garmestani et al 2009 it is difficult to predict how different management decisions might feed through the system to result in changes in ecosystem services therefore understanding how threshold dynamics play out in shs requires a more explicit consideration of the underlying processes of different shs subsystems that generate ecosystem services we propose a solution to this problem by implementing concepts from ecological resilience theory in conjunction with a modified version of the ecosystem service cascade in a new social ecohydrological thresholds seht framework the difference between the seht and the existing ecosystem service cascade is the focus on a differentiating change within component systems and b identifying when change will cross a threshold the goal of this model is to improve the management of shs by allowing decision makers to anticipate how changes in one component of an shs may impact the rest of the system such system wide impacts are apparent as changes in ecosystem services 2 social ecohydrological thresholds framework the seht framework aims to track how changes in one component of a social ecohydrological system can be expected to feed through to impact the linked components the biophysical components of the seht are hydrological change biophysical change change in processes the social components of the seht are change in benefits change in values and change in use change in service provision is the result of both biophysical and social components of the seht changes in any one component of the system may occur without impacting a connected unit until a threshold is reached fig 1 an essential feature of thresholds in seh systems is that change in one unit of the system is also a component of change in another unit of the system this overlap depends on the degree of linkage between them below we describe how such overlap can be identified for biophysical and social components of the system 2 1 biophysical components in the seht hydrological changes are linked to ecosystem service provision through biological response while hydrological change may also have direct impacts on ecosystem service provision di baldassarre et al 2013 our focus is on identifying indirect effects as these are generally less easily apparent to identify biophysical thresholds we use a mechanistic trait based ecological framework predicting how environmental change will alter biological communities and in turn impact ecosystem processes fig 2 de bello et al 2010 díaz et al 2007 lavorel and garnier 2002 lavorel and grigulis 2012 suding et al 2008 in the trait based approach rather than focusing on the community or species level of organization organisms are grouped into assemblages based on similar sets of traits i e any measurable property of an organism such as size plant rooting depth or leaf mass per area mcgill et al 2006 these groupings may be based on traits that result in a similar response to a particular environmental driver response traits or on traits that cause organisms to have similar impacts on ecosystem processes effect traits lavorel and garnier 2002 suding et al 2008 the degree of overlap between groupings based on response and effect traits can be used to anticipate thresholds in an environmental driver that will result in altered ecosystem processes fig 1 thresholds 1 2 3 if specific response and effect traits are the same or are observed to co occur consistently across species they will reinforce the effects of environmental change likely propagating them through to connected elements of the system fig 2a for example if plants with close associations with nitrogen fixing bacteria an effect trait all have shallow rooting depths a response trait a decline in the water table depth will have a large impact on nitrogen availability in the ecosystem by contrast if response and effect traits change independently or are found across multiple species but in different patterns a greater degree of environmental change and more species losses will be required to alter ecosystem processes meaning that environmental change is less likely to alter other elements of the system fig 2b for instance if nitrogen fixing bacteria are associated with a number of different species of plants with a broad range of rooting depths the loss of shallow rooted plants caused by declining water table depths would have a much smaller impact on nitrogen availability this trait framework has been successful in predicting how specific drivers will alter ecosystem processes lienin and kleyer 2012 and in predicting the impacts of trade offs in plant traits on potential ecosystem service provision de bello et al 2010 díaz et al 2007 lavorel et al 2011 lavorel and grigulis 2012 luck et al 2009 however most ecological studies taking this approach identify potential service provision without linking them the social components of the system in such a way as to determine if they are valued or used by incorporating this approach into the seht framework we can use it to identify biophysical and ecological thresholds in service provision and then link these to service use by society 2 2 social components ecosystem service provision is determined by the combination of ecological properties and the social context in which a particular ecosystem process is deemed to be of benefit burkhard et al 2014 ernstson 2013 identification of when changes in service use values and benefits fig 1 thresholds 4 5 6 will alter each other must be addressed through stakeholder engagement and participatory management muro and jeffrey 2012 two priorities emerge from engaging stakeholders in the identification assessment and management of ecosystem services first reflexive understanding of ecosystem processes and coupled human behavior enhances stakeholders perceptions of changes in services and benefits this is broadly understood as social learning in the adaptive management and environmental governance literature crona and parker 2012 second managing ecosystem processes with the aim of preserving restoring or enhancing services and benefits is often most effectively pursued in broad networks or coalitions of stakeholders a process referred to as collaborative governance childs et al 2013 for both social learning and collaborative governance scientist stakeholder communication is essential while numerous methods have been developed the interactive workshop arguably remains the most effective means of engagement and communication scott et al 2012 such workshops allow identification of key values of the community which in turn determine the ways that ecosystem services are used and the benefits received from services the likelihood that change in each of these components will induce change in another determines the degree of coupling between them and therefore serves to identify thresholds 2 3 component integration in the seht framework fig 1 slight changes in any one component box may have little or no impact on connected pieces of the system in which case it remains contained in that component and does not propagate through the system blue drivers green ecosystem red social system and purple services when change in a given component is large enough or of the right type a threshold is crossed allowing it to alter dynamics of a connected component of the system gold areas a system in which the gold areas are very distant from each other as depicted here is relatively stable since it would need to experience a large degree of change in any one component in order to see changes in others a system in which the gold areas were very close or even overlapping would be unstable since change in any one component would very quickly impact other parts of the system in the seht framework fig 1 the first biophysical threshold can be identified by response traits that determine the ability of different sets of organisms to survive under different degrees of environmental change the second process threshold can be identified by changes in effect traits that determine the impacts of organisms responses on ecosystem processes the stronger the response to a driver and the greater the degree of overlap between response and effect traits the greater the impact of environmental change on ecosystem processes the social thresholds in the model can be identified by changes in values that alter benefit threshold 5 or use threshold 6 ecosystem services are defined by the interaction of the social and ecological components at the point where changes in ecosystem processes alter ecosystem service provision threshold 3 the point at which changes in social benefit due to altered values impact ecosystem service definition threshold 4 and the point at which changes in human use will alter environmental drivers threshold 7 to illustrate how the seht approach could be applied to evaluate the impacts of different environmental changes on an shs we implement it in the san pedro riparian corridor an example of an arid region shs in southeastern arizona we focused on water availability as a key environmental driver and examined the degree of overlap between traits governing response to changes in water availability and traits impacting ecosystem processes we then conducted stakeholder workshops to identify social values that determined how ecosystem processes translated to important ecosystem services 3 methods 3 1 study system and approach we focused on the san pedro river in southeastern arizona one of the last undammed perennial rivers in the sonoran desert stromberg and tellman 2009 the first 40 miles of the san pedro river within the united states north of the border where it flows in from mexico fall within the federally protected san pedro riparian national conservation area fig 3 despite being widely recognized as having high cultural and ecological importance the san pedro river is showing trends of decreasing flow as population growth increases demand for the limited water resources in the area stromberg and tellman 2009 warren et al 1996 the pressing need to make trade off decisions regarding water use made this an ideal system in which to implement our approach to identify thresholds in ecosystem service provision serrat capdevila et al 2009 3 2 identification of key drivers traits and ecosystem processes in order to establish where the biophysical thresholds suggested by the seht fig 1 thresholds 1 2 3 might exist in this system we used existing research on the san pedro river published in peer reviewed journals and the book ecology and conservation of the san pedro river stromberg and tellman 2009 to identify key drivers traits and processes we identified focal papers table 1 as those specifically related to 1 environmental drivers of the system such as hydrological or geomorphological processes 2 thresholds in these processes such as sustained disappearance of surface water flow fig 1 threshold 1 3 information on plant assemblages particularly with reference to their response to environmental drivers or effects on ecosystem processes fig 1 thresholds 1 2 4 biophysical processes influenced by riparian vegetation fig 1 thresholds 2 3 and 5 biodiversity supported by riparian areas fig 1 threshold 3 we followed stromberg and tellman s 2009 identification of five major species assemblages found in the near riparian areas of the san pedro river 1 marsh herbaceous plants dependent on surface water 2 native cottonwood willow riparian gallery forest dominated by populus fremontii and salix gooddingii 3 tamarisk woodland dominated by invasive tamarix sp 4 mesquite bosque dominated by prosopis velutina and 5 sacaton grassland dominated by sporobolus sp for each major plant species assemblage we identified a community composition the species generally found in this particular assemblage b drivers major factors contributing to the existence or maintenance of the assemblage c thresholds tipping points beyond which species assemblages are predicted to disappear based on changes in the drivers d response traits the plant species traits which governed where thresholds fell e effect traits the plant species traits which contribute to the ability of the species assemblage to drive a process f ecosystem processes any processes for which these species assemblages are known to be important drivers g potential services any potential es to which the previously identified processes contribute supplementary tables 1 and 2 we inferred response and effect traits and es where they were not mentioned directly inferences of potential es were guided by the millennium ecosystem assessment s millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 categorization of service types as well as previous research on this specific system by bagstad et al 2012 this information represented the biophysical properties and ecosystem processes parts of the seht fig 1 3 3 stakeholder workshops and surveys in order to identify the social drivers of ecosystem services that could lead to thresholds shown in the seht fig 1 thresholds 4 5 6 we conducted two stakeholder workshops building on methods developed by scott et al 2012 to identify perceptions of key es participants were invited from a list of members of the upper san pedro partnership the upper san pedro partnership was formed in 1998 and is an association of federal state and local agencies and organizations that assist in meeting the long term water needs in the basin partners are key decision makers in the basin because they control land or water in the watershed make policy relevant to the watershed or provide technical expertise the partnership includes a range of stakeholders including representatives from governmental agencies such as the us geological survey the bureau of land management and arizona state land department non governmental organizations such as the nature conservancy and the audubon society fort huachuca a nearby military base and local towns such as sierra vista bisbee and tombstone we focused our workshop on members of the upper san pedro partnership because our objectives were to understand the es perceptions of key decision makers in the san pedro river basin the first workshop included a presentation explaining the ecosystem service concept and categories outlined by the millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 and then exercises to determine stakeholder perceptions of es in the san pedro river basin we asked the 17 participants to write down all the benefits they considered the san pedro river to provide and then grouped similar items into emergent rather than pre determined categories the research team compiled these responses to eliminate repetitions then presented the compiled lists and categories to the assembled participants giving them the opportunity to disagree with and refine eliminations and combinations to ensure the results accurately represented the overall group opinion we linked the services prioritized in the workshop supplementary table 3 to the ecosystem processes identified by the research team by grouping them into categories of services provided by the same ecosystem process the second workshop included 10 respondents comprising rural and urban residents as well as representatives from government business agriculture and ngos in this workshop we presented participants with the es identified in the first workshop combined with response and effect trait groupings we synthesized from the literature and asked participants to rank them in order of importance the linkage between services in the aesthetics category and the plant community types identified from literature review is particularly subjective so we presented participants with images of sections of the river that fit into the different community types and asked them to rate them on a scale of 1 5 from very attractive to very unattractive with reference to aesthetic services these stakeholder workshops provided us with information on the social uses values and benefits that determined which properties and processes of the ecosystem were important es from the point of view of decision makers to further identify thresholds using the seht model fig 1 we looked for overlap and disconnections between the services that were vulnerable to environmental change and that were identified as highly ranked by decision makers together these biophysical and social data can inform if there are expected biophysical changes that would be associated with es that were more or less important to decision makers human subject research was approved by the university of arizona institutional review board fwa00004218 ua irb project 10 0461 00 dated 07 07 2010 participants provided written consent for use of their responses for research 4 results 4 1 biophysical thresholds sources used for the identification of drivers thresholds traits biophysical processes and biodiversity are listed in table 1 the conclusions from the compilation of this research are as follows water availability and flood regime were key hydrological drivers of ecosystem properties in the san pedro riparian corridor that could lead to biological changes the first threshold in the seht supplementary table 1 since most of the riparian plant species require a constant supply of groundwater rooting depth is a major trait governing species turnover in response to altered water availability based on this we were able to identify five thresholds in depth to groundwater that would result in the loss of one of five plant groups fig 4 thresholds in groundwater depth can be expected to result in changes in plant community ecosystem processes and ecosystem services based on plant response and effect traits and stakeholder identification of ecosystem services different shades of blue represent thresholds fig 4 in the driver water availability which influence plant community composition through key response traits orange boxes with shades indicating differences in rooting depth marsh plants with shallow less than 1 m rooting depths are expected to disappear as soon as stream flow ceases to be perennial stromberg and tellman 2009 sacaton grassland is lost with a decline in groundwater below 3 m which is the same point at which young cottonwood and willow trees cease to be able to establish themselves however adult cottonwood and willow riparian gallery forest will be maintained until groundwater drops below 4 6 m stromberg and tellman 2009 because of this difference in the key response trait we created a separate category for adult native riparian forest that includes areas where only established trees primarily cottonwood with deep roots can survive the non native tamarisks have rooting depths of up to 10 m stromberg and tellman 2009 meaning that they can be maintained even after depth to groundwater has far surpassed depths at which the native riparian vegetation could survive mesquite has the deepest rooting depth 53 m and is capable of surviving even greater declines in groundwater depth stromberg and tellman 2009 fig 4 supplementary table 1 in order to identify the points at which biological changes would alter ecosystem processes threshold 2 in the seht we examined the relationship between response and effect traits the major effect traits we identified for this system were groundcover woody stem density root structure and depth leaf area canopy height and structure and seed production supplementary table 2 these effect traits influenced processes of flood attenuation soil stabilization gas exchange water redistribution nutrient cycling and contribution to habitat for birds mammals and insects as well as forage for livestock supplementary table 2 in certain cases the system appeared not to be resilient to changes in water availability since species loss altered the sets of effect traits present for example both marsh plants and tree species in the native riparian assemblage contribute to flood attenuation by slowing waters but marsh plants contribute more to sediment deposition whereas the native riparian trees contribute more to capture of woody debris fig 4 supplementary table 2 these differences influence the type and amount of litter and sediment inputs to riparian soil in other cases the system appeared to be resilient because different species assemblages with different key response trait values contributed in similar ways to the same processes for example native riparian trees and tamarisk all contributed to soil stabilization supplementary table 2 intraspecific differences in response trait values based on age also had the potential to alter the effect traits present in the community without changes in dominant species identity for example loss of the young native riparian assemblage could alter bird habitat availability through a loss of mid canopy nesting areas fig 4 supplementary table 2 thus because multiple response groups sometimes contributed to the same ecosystem processes in slightly different ways thresholds that led to a change in plant species assemblage were not necessarily the same as thresholds predicted to change ecosystem processes fig 2 4 2 thresholds between ecosystem processes and services stakeholders identified the following categories of ecosystem services water culture vegetation wildlife recreation health well being economy ft huachuca avoiding base closure regulation of natural processes and aesthetics supplementary table 3 note that while some of these categories such as regulation of natural processes fit roughly into the millennium ecosystem assessment categories others did not notably while stakeholders defined a culture category it did not exactly correspond to the cultural services category of the millennium ecosystem assessment rather it focused on ways in which the ecosystem contributes to cultural life and place based aesthetics health well being and recreation as their own categories participants also emphasized a number of very system specific services such as the need for water to maintain fort huachuca which is an important contributor to the local economy we used the results of the first workshop to direct activities at the second workshop so as to clarify the perceptions of the services identified previously we calculated mean rankings of services table 2 and ratings of ecosystem conditions table 3 to identify potential priorities in services and ecosystem conditions that the decision makers may have while not statistically significantly different the highest ranked service based on mean and median rankings was carbon sequestration followed by tourism aesthetics recreation and nutrient cycling table 2 wildlife diversity education and flood regulation were ranked as least important based on mean and median rankings however note that bird biodiversity is a major source of tourism for this area so while it was not highly valued intrinsically it should be considered an ecosystem service that supports tourism bagstad et al 2012 during the photographic aesthetics assessment the two highest rated photographs of the san pedro river showed adult cottonwood trees with surface water and adult cottonwood with marsh plants table 3 the two lowest rated photographs based on median scores depicted a mesquite bosque from a distance and cottonwood trees with a dry channel photographs of tamarisk and mesquite stands received lower mean ratings yet their median ratings were the same as photographs of a bank stabilizing cottonwood stand and a channel with unstable banks and grasses all of these photographs received a median ranking of 4 out of 5 indicating that even conditions that would be considered ecologically degraded maintained aesthetic appeal these results were obtained during a workshop that was targeted at understanding how key decision makers in the upper san pedro partnership value these services a broader survey of public perception and ranking of the services could verify these results and further inform decision making rosenberger and loomis 2017 where possible services identified in the workshops were linked to processes identified in the biophysical literature review fig 4 not all of the services mentioned in the workshops could be clearly tied to a particular process in some cases this was due to a lack of information on social values for example it was unclear which specific aspects of the system would be needed to provide many of the health well being services so it was not possible to predict which changes in the system would result in their loss 5 discussion 5 1 analysis of thresholds tracking the response traits related to changes in water table depth and effect traits related to ecosystem processes allowed us to identify key biophysical thresholds in the san pedro river system stakeholder workshops provided us with information on the social uses values and benefits that determined which properties and processes of the ecosystem were services the stronger the response to a driver and the greater the degree of overlap between response and effect traits the greater the impact of environmental change on ecosystem processes suding et al 2008 likewise the more ecosystem properties that contributed to provision of a service the more hydrological change could take place before it was lost the ecosystem services most vulnerable to changes in hydrology were those that depended on the presence of surface water and could not be fully provided without it these were the services of bird plant and wildlife diversity as well as the tourism dependent on them fig 4 while bird and wildlife diversity were not consistently highly ranked by stakeholders tourism did receive a consistently high ranking table 2 this indicates a higher likelihood of crossing the biophysical threshold for this service than the social threshold such vulnerability of a valued service suggests it should be prioritized in management decisions however such management is made challenging by the finding that stakeholders do not consistently value the biodiversity that is a major underlying driver of tourism such challenges have been encountered in other systems due to the complexity of the connections between biodiversity and ecosystem services and are the end result of many varied processes and interactions in socio hydrological systems harrison et al 2014 mace et al 2012 methodological limits to using biodiversity and ecosystem service relationships in management contexts often stem from difficulties in communication regarding uncertainties particularly at local scales that hamper discussions of service values and provision ruckelshaus et al 2015 approaching management and planning with more explicit distinctions between the goods that people use and the ecosystem services that provide them may make management of ecosystem services more fruitful when approached from interdisciplinary and multi stakeholder perspectives bateman et al 2011 de groot et al 2010 mace et al 2012 the impact of changing hydrology on aesthetics appeared to depend on the stakeholder with surface water loss decreasing aesthetic appeal for most individuals but further water losses impacting aesthetics for some individuals more than others our survey results showed that photographs depicting cottonwood trees with surface water were rated more highly than cottonwood trees with a dry river channel table 3 the latter was rated very similarly to areas dominated by invasive tamarisk this suggests that amongst this group of respondents surface water was highly valued for aesthetics but cottonwood trees were not strongly preferred to tamarisk trees in this case there seemed to be a threshold in service provision associated with the loss of surface water but not with a transition from cottonwood to tamarisk however changes in the economy or population and demographics of the community could alter the benefits people derive from the ecosystem and therefore could result in altered service provision without any change to the ecology of the system thus aesthetics seems to be particularly dependent on the combination of social and biophysical thresholds gee and burkhard 2010 schaich et al 2010 tengberg et al 2012 cultural ecosystem services such as this have been shown to be important for connecting senses of place and landscape to decisions that alter the way landscapes may provide other ecosystem services gee and burkhard 2010 despite their importance cultural services have received limited focus in research and management of ecosystem services in part because they are difficult to assess and link to economic models tengberg et al 2012 however a focus on the role of stakeholders in creating and managing cultural landscapes through spatial assessment and planning holds promise for expanding the utility for such services in environmental management services of this type lie at the heart of much of the social ecological and social hydrological systems work and require consistent attention to both social and biophysical components of the system reyers et al 2013 in contrast soil stabilization carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling appeared to be highly resilient to changes in water table depth fig 4 since several response groups on the san pedro i e plants with different rooting depths have similar effects on these services loss of a native riparian community will not eliminate them if it is replaced by tamarisk trees which may have the same effect but respond differently to the same change in water availability because of this overlap in effect traits loss of native riparian gallery forest is not a threshold for soil stabilization of these carbon sequestration was the highest ranked by stakeholders soil stabilization the lowest and nutrient cycling in between table 2 however there was high variability in the ranked importance of carbon sequestration this indicates that its status as a service is vulnerable to changes in the social components of the system that alter the composition of stakeholders to include more or fewer people with a particular stance on the value of carbon sequestration approaches for dealing with variation in the needs of different sets of stakeholders in a social ecological system require delicate collaborative work ernstson 2013 notably co production approaches hold promise for working with multiple stakeholder perspectives to better manage systems for ecosystem service provision through collaborative management and decision making reyers et al 2015 characteristics that indicate the diversity of stakeholders including both identities roles and perspectives and capabilities ability and opportunities to affect change are important for the outcomes of the co production of ecosystem services fischer and eastwood 2016 identification of the contribution of the social components of the system to ecosystem service provision and resilience can be critical for the identification of trade offs between services in the context of environmental management martín lópez et al 2012 yates et al 2005 social ecological and hydrological resilience for ecosystem services are linked and often exhibit reciprocal or iterative causality adger and adger 2000 collins et al 2011 mao et al 2017 scott and buechler 2013 the seht is able to identify which services are highly vulnerable to biophysical change to social change or to both services that are not vulnerable to social change but are vulnerable to biophysical change should receive high priority for management actions services that are particularly vulnerable to social change will require more complex governance arrangements e g reliance on external expertise comparative reference to analogous cases sustained stakeholder engagement including recurring public comment processes and public dissemination of current and future resilience challenges such choices are likely to be best managed through collaborative decision making and adaptive management approaches caves et al 2013 5 2 relevance of scale a key finding of this approach is that the biophysical thresholds identified in the seht will depend on the spatial scale at which the social ecohydrological system is defined and assessed the case assessed here is part of the binational us mexico san pedro watershed which raises the possibility of considering transboundary es biodiversity and social processes as well as binational adaptive management varady et al 2013 while many of the ecological dynamics are similar across the border or occur over a gradient that is determined topographically and ecohydrologically resource use practices social vulnerability and adaptive capacity vary considerably norman et al 2012 in related initiatives members of the present research team have participated in bridging u s and mexican stakeholder groups however for the present study transboundary dynamics are considered to be exogenous drivers of change with primary definition of the u s social ecological system for assessment even within the u s san pedro our choice of scale was important to the outcome of our study because key plant traits varied by age group within certain species grouping plants by response traits resulted in more categories of plant types than if we had focused instead on the major community types identified in previous research stromberg and tellman 2009 this meant that alteration in ecosystem service provision was possible without major change in the overall community type for example a loss of perennial surface water crossed a biological threshold leading to marsh species loss changes in flood attenuation and a loss of habitat for wading birds with no change in the dominant riparian gallery forest community type fig 4 this has important implications for mapping ecosystem services most of this work is currently focused at large scales such that specific land use or land cover categories are assumed to provide certain sets of services egoh et al 2008 raudsepp hearne et al 2010 while this approach makes sense for these large landscape level studies our results suggest that more detailed information is needed for management of local systems the loss of the marsh community is socially significant because it impacts tourism i e it causes threshold 3 in the seht to be crossed and is therefore associated with a loss of service provision however models based on aggregations at the community level such as land cover classifications alone would not predict important changes to occur until the depth to groundwater declines to below six meters and cottonwood riparian community was lost considerations of scale are also important to the reverse case in which a biological change might not alter service provision for example even after land cover type has been changed and the riparian area is dominated by tamarisk these trees still provide bank stabilization habitat for mid canopy nesting birds and some degree of aesthetic appeal if only these services are important to the society management for both native riparian and tamarisk communities would allow for their continued provision since tamarisk communities can persist with much deeper levels of groundwater a focus on the maintenance of mid canopy bird habitat and bank stabilization would require much less water allocation to riparian areas than if only native riparian gallery forest could provide these services thus in order to predict changes in ecosystem service provision it is first necessary to identify the appropriate scale of analysis then by grouping ecosystem services based on common ecological drivers fig 4 rather than types of ecosystem service haines young and potschin 2013 millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 raudsepp hearne et al 2010 our seht framework should facilitate the mapping of ecosystem service supply and demand burkhard et al 2012 once an appropriate scale has been determined the ecological trait based framework identifies service supply and social values identify ecosystem service demand emphasizing ecosystem service supply as separate from demand explicitly includes supporting ecosystem services that may easily be ignored when bundled with other categories redford and adams 2009 because the seht framework also emphasizes the identification of thresholds it can serve as an aid to consider the resilience of the social ecohydrological system based on the degree of overlap between the social perceptions and ecological processes supporting ecosystem services thus the seht framework can provide managers and decision makers with detailed information that can be used to assess trade offs between different desired ecosystem services or between management of areas with different capacities to provide ecosystem services current ecosystem service approaches face criticism of applicability to local management decisions bagstad et al 2012 presnall et al 2014 this is largely because the ecosystem service approach tends to focus on scales that are too broad to be relevant to users who will make decisions based upon ecosystem service information and because information generated about ecosystem services tends to focus too much on the supply of services at the expense of information about the demand for services with a focus on the mechanistic drivers of thresholds of ecosystem services the seht model can help to bridge scales relevant for management for example in the san pedro river basin an adaptive management approach has been adopted that focuses largely on mitigating risk related to meeting water demand for development and environmental goals richter et al 2009 this risk can be linked to local scales where the ecological dynamics are driven by processes that reflect environmental heterogeneity and introduced species stromberg and tellman 2009 management decisions are being supported by the development of models and decision support tools here the seht approach can help parameterize stakeholder defined mechanisms that are represented in such models pope and gimblett 2017 2015 the seht approach also helps to mitigate risk by identifying thresholds that would be recognized by experts and managers working to enhance resilience in the basin neil et al 2005 scott and buechler 2013 these thresholds become a set of indicator variables that can be monitored to help enhance the resilience of the watershed to climate land use and economic drivers critical aspects of resilience management connelly et al 2017 linkov et al 2016 the seht model informs management decisions by representing the mechanisms that underlie the generation of ecosystem service provision and demand as well as critical thresholds in ecosystem service dynamics 6 conclusions we introduced a conceptual social ecohydrologic threshold seht framework that draws on social ecological systems and resilience ecology theory identifying thresholds in the provision of ecosystem services in a socio hydrological system specifically the seht model refines the ecosystem service cascade with concepts from trait based ecology and stakeholder derived information on the social system our approach identified potential thresholds in the ecological and ecosystem service components of the seht and identified likely locations for thresholds within the hydroecological and social components and scales for their interaction because ecosystem services are treated as emergent properties of the seht our approach identifies theoretical and practical approaches for utilizing the ecosystem service concept at both landscape and local scales recognition that local scale ecohydrological and social processes drive the generation of ecosystem services in a social hydrological system allows the seht framework to better inform decision making by predicting how ecosystem services may change under different management scenarios the seht framework identifies several critical drivers of potential thresholds in seht ecosystem services these thresholds can guide future research in ecosystem service assessment of potential provision flow and demand for services at the local level burkhard et al 2014 as these thresholds reflect the drivers of change along with the perceptions and decisions of managers the seht framework can guide resilience management approaches for environmental change linkov et al 2016 connelly et al 2017 the seht framework can provide a roadmap for managers and practitioners to identify scenarios and indicator data sets to identify potential threshold dynamics in social
