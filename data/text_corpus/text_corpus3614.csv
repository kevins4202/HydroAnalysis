18070,microcystin leucine arginine mc lr a cyclic potentially carcinogenic hepatotoxin occurs frequently in aquatic habitats worldwide and seriously threatens ecosystem and public health limited effectiveness of physicochemical treatments to remove mc lr from drinking water has led to a search for alternative cost effective and environment friendly biodegradation strategies obtaining mc degrading bacteria and understanding their mc degrading mechanisms are outstanding challenges here a novel indigenous bacterium named sphingopyxis sp yf1 with a high efficient capacity for mc degradation was successfully isolated from eutrophic lake taihu through integrating mass spectrometer and multi omics analyses accompanied by functional verification of certain genes and proteins a complete mc degradation pathway was firstly identified in which mc lr was sequentially degraded into linearized mc lr tetrapeptide adda phenylacetic acid and finally potential product co2 some specific proteins such as microcystinase linearized microcystinase tetrapeptidease and paaase responsible for this pathway were identified this study pioneeringly demonstrated that mc lr can be completely degraded through natural remediation processes and revealed a significant potential for mc lr biodegradation in both natural environment and engineered systems graphical abstract image 1

individuals in brazil jochimsen et al 1998 mcs are a group of cyclic heptapeptide hepatotoxins that occur ubiquitously in a vast range of water bodies worldwide rastogi et al 2014 massey et al 2018 among over 250 identified isomer types spoof et al 2017 mc leucine arginine mc lr is the most widely distributed and very toxic huisman et al 2005 gupta et al 2003 the international agency for research on cancer categorized mc lr as a group 2b carcinogen iarc 2010 and the world health organization proposed a provisional guideline value of 1 μg l as the highest acceptable concentration of mc lr equivalents in drinking water who 1998 mc lr is quite stable in natural environments and resistant to various conditions including high temperatures ph changes and degradation by non specific enzymes tsuji et al 1994 rastogi et al 2014 due to the cyclical chemical structure of heptapeptide cyclo d ala l leu d measp l arg adda d glu mdha where measp is erythro β methylaspartic acid adda is

from water bodies jones et al 1994 okano et al 2009 jiang et al 2011 yang et al 2014a however the removal of mc lr from drinking and recreational water using physicochemical processes has been of limited success because of low efficiency expensive operating costs and formation of harmful by products gagala et al 2012 li et al 2017 recently bacterial biodegradation of mc lr starts gaining attention since it is environmentally friendly cost effective and the absence of harmful by products bourne et al 1996 2006 jones et al 1994 mc lr removal using indigenous bacteria is promising due to minimal environmental impacts but only a few mc degrading bacteria have been obtained bourne et al 1996 jin et al 2018 ho et al 2007 saito et al 2003 shimizu et al 2012 xiao et al 2011 yang et al 2014a thus far most of the isolated mc degrading bacteria were identified as sphingopyxis and sphingomonas genera belonging to α proteobacteria class li et al 2017 bourne et al 2001 okano et al 2009 maghsoudi et al 2016 only one gene cluster mlrbdac responsible for degradation of mc lr and other mc variants was firstly reported present in sphingomonas sp acm 3962 by bourne et al 1996 subsequently the gene cluster mlrbdac was also detected in sphingosinicella microcystinivorans b9 sphingomonas sp md 1 sphingopyxis sp c 1 mb e and ustb 05 novosphingobium sp thn1 and rhizobium sp th among others jin et al 2018 saitou et al 2003 shimizu et al 2012 maghsoudi et al 2016 xiao et al 2011 wang et al 2018 zhu et al 2016 these previous studies demonstrated the role of mlrbdac encoding proteins for degrading mc lr into adda as final nontoxic product bourne et al 1996 harada et al 2004 however a controversy still exists as to whether adda is the final mc lr degradation product and whether it is a toxic compound yang et al 2014b harada et al 2004 cousins et al 1996 chen et al 2012 cousins et al 1996 and chen et al 2012 found that adda exerted toxic effects therefore molecular mechanisms underlying mc lr decomposition processes are still largely unknown in this study we isolated a novel indigenous bacterial strain named yf1 with a high efficient capacity for complete degradation of mc lr in water samples taken from lake taihu wuxi china the third largest lake in china serving more than 2 million people and suffering from the most severe eutrophication in china paerl and otten 2013

and rod shaped bacterium fig s1 phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rdna sequences revealed that strain yf1 was affiliated with the genus sphingopyxis and closely resembled sphingopyxis macrogoltabida ifo 15033t 98 33 sequence similarity takeuchi et al 2001 fig 1 high quality reads quality score cut off 20 obtained through whole genome sequencing of sphingopyxis sp yf1 were assembled to produce a complete genome genbank accession number cp033204 yf1 genome consists of one circular chromosome of 4 367 405 bp with a maximum contig length of 1 156 067 bp and minimum contig length of 5 743 bp fig 2 and table s2 the contig length has an n50 length of 1 086 409 bp the gc content was determined to be 66 65 which was relatively higher than that of other mc degrading bacterial strains reported by okano et al 2015 and wang et al 2018 a whole genome based comparison further revealed that the values of ani between strain yf1 and other sphingopyxis spp were below thresholds 95 for bacterial species delimitation delineation richter et al 2009 suggesting that strain yf1 can be considered as a novel species of the genus sphingopyxis table s3 ani was based on pairwise genome comparison of all shared orthologous protein coding genes and reflected the degree of evolutionary distance between compared genomes the ani value was best suited for determining whether two organisms were of the same species richter et al 2009 sphingopyxis sp yf1 fig 3 a and its crude protein extracts fig 3b were able to degrade mc lr and its degradation products containing adda fig s2 mc degradation has been addressed for a few different bacterial strains including sphingomonas sp acm 3962 bourne et al 1996 y2 park et al 2001 and 7cy ishii et al 2004 bordetella sp mc lth1 yang et al 2014a sphingopyxis sp ustb 05 yan et al 2012 m6 ding et al 2018 and c 1 okano et al 2009 sphingopyxis sp im 1 lezcano et al 2016 paucibacter toxinvorans rapala et al 2005 sphingomonas sp cba4 valeria et al 2006 arhrobacter spp manage et al 2009 among others since each study uses different conditions to test mc degradation ability different medium type of mc pure or crude extract from a cyanobacterial bloom and initial inoculum of bacteria it is impossible to compare mc degrading rate 5 μg ml h of strain yf1 with other previously reported bacterial mc degrading rates these phenotypic and genotypic analyses provide sufficient evidence to support its taxonomic classification as a novel species of the genus sphingopyxis figs 1 and 2 and table s3 3 2 omics based study 3 2 1 genomic analysis the most significant finding was that sphingopyxis sp yf1 could completely degrade mc lr with adda not present as a final degradation product fig s2 to acquire unknown functional genes encoding enzymes responsible for mc lr and adda degradation genomic sequencing data of strain yf1 was further analyzed genome oriented study revealed that sphingopyxis sp yf1 was identified to harbor the homologues of a gene cluster mlrbdac eao27 19385 to eao27 19400 which were responsible for the conversion of mc lr to adda fig 4 a an online blast search in ncbi web showed that the mlra homologue eao27 19395 from strain yf1 was 92 and 97 similar to the genes from novosphingobium sp thn1 and sphingopyxis sp c 1 fig 4b okano et al 2015 wang et al 2018 the encoding protein cleaved adda arg peptide bond of mc lr which converted mc lr to linearized mc lr bourne et al 1996 yan et al 2012 the mlrb homologue eao27 19385 in the circular chromosome of strain yf1 exhibited high sequence 97 to the mlrb of sphingopyxis sp c 1 involved in the hydrolysis of ala leu peptide bond in the linearized mc lr molecule fig 4b bourne et al 1996 okano et al 2015 shimizu et al 2012 the mlrc homologue eao27 19400 encoding a metallopeptidase mlrc was located next to the mlra homologue and responsible for hydrolysis of adda glu for degradation of tetrapeptide to adda shimizu et al 2012 similar gene organization was observed in genomes of sphingopyxis sp c 1 and sphingosinicella microcystinivorans b9 fig 4b jin et al 2018 okano et al 2015 the mlrd homologue from strain yf1 was 92 similar to the gene from sphingomonas sp acm 3962 bourne et al 2001 previously bourne et al 2001 showed the role of mlrd is unclear it was postulated that mlrd gene was involved in transport of parent mc into the cellular environment or transport of final mc degradation products from the cell interestingly further inspection demonstrated the existence of homologues of paa gene cluster eao27 19510 to eao27 19540 for an aromatic compound phenylacetic acid paa degradation in the neighborhoods of mlrbdac genes homologues fig 4a this discovery implies that there was potential link between homologues of mlr and paa gene cluster indicating that paa metabolism may be the downstream route of mc degradation to date the whole genomic sequences of only three bacterial strains novosphingobium sp thn 1 sphingopyxis sp c 1 sphingosinicella microcystinivorans b9 have been obtained jin et al 2018 okano et al 2015 wang et al 2018 moreover functional genes for mc degradation were rarely explored except mlrbdac gene cluster the paa gene cluster identified in chromosome of strain yf1 might be involved in the process of mc degradation which was firstly reported in the mc degrading bacteria 3 2 2 transcriptomic analysis to acquire more evidences to support the involvement of mlr and paa gene clusters in mc degradation transcriptomics and proteomics were analyzed to illustrate the expression of encoding genes of sphingopyxis sp yf1 growing on mc lr transcriptomics quality score cut off 20 and proteomics dataset captured the expression of 4 230 genes based on the current annotation transcriptomics showed that 299 and 511 genes were significantly up regulated and down regulated 1 5 folds p 0 05 in comparison with control medium without mc lr respectively fig 5 a during mc lr degradation many of the up regulated genes were involved in amino acid transport and metabolism cog e 8 genes general function prediction cog r 11 genes lipid transport and metabolism cog i 8 genes and unknown function cog s 16 genes fig 5a we also detected the up regulation of 6 genes involved in energy production and conversion cog c 3 genes involved in carbohydrate transport and metabolism cog g and secondary metabolites biosynthesis transport and catabolism cog q 2 genes associated with defense mechanisms cog v fig 5a these results reflected a general physiological adaptation of sphingopyxis sp yf1 to grow on mc lr in addition 187 up regulated genes could not be classified into any cog categories and some new functions were found among these genes based on the cog analysis mlr gene cluster eao27 19385 eao27 19400 and paa gene cluster eao27 19510 eao27 19520 homologues were involved in defense mechanisms and lipid transport and metabolism respectively there was a gene eao27 19415 involved in lipid transport and metabolism as well as secondary metabolites biosynthesis transport and catabolism between the homologues of mlr gene cluster and paa gene cluster moreover homologues of mlr gene cluster paa gene cluster and the gene eao27 19415 were up regulated more than 3 1 5 and 1 5 fold p 0 05 during the growing period on mc lr table s4 which indicated that these functional genes probably played an important role in mc lr degradation 3 2 3 proteomic analysis there were 47 up regulated proteins and 35 down regulated proteins with 1 1 folds compared with control p 0 05 fig 5b these differentially expressed proteins were further analyzed to determine their participation in mc metabolism the most abundant up regulated proteins were found in the unknown function cog s lipid transport and metabolism cog i and general function prediction only cog r with 11 9 and 9 respectively fig 5b some proteins belonged to coenzyme transport and metabolism cog h 3 proteins inorganic ion transport and metabolism cog p 3 proteins and secondary metabolites biosynthesis transport and catabolism cog q 3 proteins fig 5b all proteins encoded by the homologues of mlr gene cluster eao27 19385 eao27 19400 and paa gene cluster eao27 19510 eao27 19520 were up regulated more than 1 1 fold when growing on mc lr table s4 the protein encoded by the gene eao27 19415 was up regulated 1 2 fold table s4 the proteomic results further indicated these functional genes were involved in mc lr degradation integrated transcriptomics and proteomics analysis demonstrated a series of differentially expressed genes and proteins fig 5c for catabolizing mc lr and its degradation products in comparison with a control medium without mc lr up regulation of mc lr and paa metabolic genes eao27 19385 eao27 19400 eao27 19510 eao27 19540 further supported their functionalities for degradation indicating that adda generated by mc lr might be subsequently degraded via paa metabolism until now only transcriptomic data of sphingopyxis sp mb e was obtained revealing the expression of mlr gene cluster responsible for degradation of mc variants maghsoudi et al 2016 previous researchers had not analyzed the mc lr degradation mechanisms using proteomics approaches in this study proteomics data of mc degrading bacteria were obtained for the first time when strain yf1 was exposed to mc lr proteomic analysis in this study show that up regulated proteins especially those located near mlr proteins probably played important roles in mc lr catabolism moreover the present study explored possible new mc degrading genes and mc degrading products especially paa and its catabolic products through the combination of data generated via omics approaches genomics transcriptomics and proteomics analysis consequently multi omics analysis may provide key insights in understanding and exploring the mc degrading mechanisms of bacteria 3 3 identification of mc lr degradation products degradation of mc lr by crude protein extracts of yf1 was performed at 30 c and ph 7 hplc chromatograms showed the peak area of mc lr fell substantially and three main intermediate products of mc lr peak a b and c appeared after incubation for 15 min fig 6 a and b peak d occurred when peak a and b disappeared along with a decline in peak c fig 6c and d degradation products peak a b and c were further identified using hplc esi ms the analysis of these peaks demonstrated major ions at m z 1013 57007 fig 6e m z 615 33936 fig 6f and m z 332 22235 fig 6g which were identical to linearized mc lr tetrapeptide and adda these three previously reported products indicated that the degradation pathway of sphingopyxis sp yf1 might be similar to that of bordetella sp mc lth1 sphingomonas sp acm 3962 novosphingobium sp thn 1 sphingopyxis sp c 1 ustb 05 and lh21 yang et al 2014a bourne et al 1996 jiang et al 2011 okano et al 2009 xiao et al 2011 ho et al 2007 gc ms analysis revealed an intermediate product generated after adda with a retention time a mass spectrum and the fragmentation scheme comparable to the reference spectrum of paa m z 136 090 in the mass spectrum library fig 6h paa standards analyzed by hplc showed the same retention time at 3 3 min as peak d hplc hplc esi ms and gc ms data collectively showed the conversion of mc lr to adda and then to paa the results confirmed that adda generated by mc lr was subsequently degraded via paa metabolism which was in accordance with the multi omics analyses described above adda has been well known to have a bioactive structure and contribute to mc induced toxicity bourne et al 2006 chen et al 2012 and adda has always been detected as the final mc lr biodegradation product bourne et al 1996 manage et al 2009 xiao et al 2011 however this study detected adda as mc degrading intermediate and revealed its degradation through paa metabolism the purified eao27 19395 protein mlra homologue termed as microcystinase hydrolyzed mc lr and its mc lr degradation activity was found to be 51 7 μg ml h which was 1 3 fold higher than mlra from sphingopyxis sp ustb 05 fig 7 a yan et al 2012 the purified eao27 19385 protein mlrb homologue termed as linearized microcystinase hydrolyzed linearized mc lr at the high rate of 75 μg ml h fig 7b michaelis menton constants were km 11 3 1 5 μm for the protein microcystinase and km 10 1 1 8 μm for protein linearized microcystinase michaelis menton constant is the concentration of substrates at half the maximum rate of enzymatic reaction and is critical to determine enzyme specificity efficiency and proficiency johnson 2013 michaelis menton constants of mc degrading enzymes provide a foundation for comparison of the efficiency of these enzymes homologues from different bacterial strains in the future 3 4 identification of paa pathway and functional verification of paaase the genes in strain yf1 potentially responsible for degradation of mc degrading product paa were annotated via alignment against the public database using blast as listed in fig 4a a gene cluster including paaa eao27 19520 paag eao27 19515 and paaz eao27 19510 were identified however the gene paak encoding phenylacetate coa ligase ec 6 2 1 30 linking paa and coa was not found interestingly both the protein encoded by the gene eao27 19415 fig 4b in yf1 and phenylacetate coa ligase belonged to fatty acyl coa synthase ec 6 2 1 which suggested these may have similar function moreover transcriptomics and proteomics analysis revealed that the gene eao27 19415 and its encoding protein were significantly up regulated compared with control thereby the gene may be responsible for linking paa and coa a purified protein encoded by gene eao27 19415 fig s3 was obtained and found to degrade paa in the presence of coa fig 8 in contrast absence of coa resulted in the inability for paa degradation despite the existence of this purified protein fig 8 this purified eao27 19415 protein designated as paaase possesses the potential to link paa and coa and was reported in genus sphingopyxis for the first time in this study these results demonstrated that paa could be degraded by sphingopyxis sp yf1 and thus advancing understanding of paa degrading bacterial strains to date pseudomonas putida bordetella pertussis and burkholderia cenocepacia were reported to contain phenylacetate coa ligase responsible for paa conversion into phenylacetyl coa teufel et al 2010 it is noteworthy that paaase and phenylacetyl coa ligase have similar function but different sequences 3 5 verification of genes expression involved in mc degradation to further identify genes encoding enzymes responsible for catabolism of mc lr and its degradation products in sphingopyxis sp yf1 qrt pcr was performed using mc lr adda and paa as substrates in comparison with control medium without these substrates mc lr catabolic genes and paa catabolic genes containing microcystinase linearized microcystinase tetrapeptidease paaase paaa paag and paaz homologues were significantly up regulated 1 5 fold fig 9 a suggesting these genes were used for metabolism of mc lr and its degradation products including adda and paa the qrt pcr results were consistent with those of transcriptomics and proteomics figs 5 and 9a and table s4 previous studies found expression levels of mlr gene homologues were up regulated in the process of mc lr degradation ding et al 2018 wang et al 2019 which were consistent with our qrt pcr results the multi omics and qrt pcr analysis showed that strain yf1 was identified to possess homologous of mlrbdac paaase paaa paag and paaz which are responsible for degrading mc lr into adda paa and then acetyl coenzyme a acetyl coa fig 9a and b the acetyl coa can be fully oxidized to co2 in the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle in many organisms van rossum et al 2016 thus sphingopyxis sp yf1 was predicted to convert mc lr into co2 hyenstrand et al 2003 also reported mc lr was biodegraded into co2 as a major end product while the degradation pathway was not identified 4 conclusions a novel indigenous bacterium with high mc degrading rate was successfully isolated from lake taihu moreover proteomics data of mc degrading bacteria were obtained for the first time a complete pathway fig 9b for mc lr degradation was proposed through integrating mass spectrometry and multi omics analyses accompanied by functional verification of certain genes and proteins a series of proteins consisting of microcystinase linearized microcystinase and tetrapeptidease were responsible for conversion of mc lr to linearized mc lr and tetrapeptide and subsequently into adda following adda degradation into paa paaase was postulated to convert paa into paa coa which was subsequently degraded to acetyl coa through a series of paa associated homologues finally acetyl coa was completely converted to co2 via the classical tca cycle the complete degradation of mcs into co2 catalyzed by mc degrading bacteria indicates that the potential link between mc producers e g microcystis and planktothrix and mc degraders e g sphingopyxis might play a key role in biogeochemical cycle of carbon element thus these findings provide new insight into mc lr biodegradation and biodetoxification in natural environments and engineered systems funding this study was supported by the

18070,microcystin leucine arginine mc lr a cyclic potentially carcinogenic hepatotoxin occurs frequently in aquatic habitats worldwide and seriously threatens ecosystem and public health limited effectiveness of physicochemical treatments to remove mc lr from drinking water has led to a search for alternative cost effective and environment friendly biodegradation strategies obtaining mc degrading bacteria and understanding their mc degrading mechanisms are outstanding challenges here a novel indigenous bacterium named sphingopyxis sp yf1 with a high efficient capacity for mc degradation was successfully isolated from eutrophic lake taihu through integrating mass spectrometer and multi omics analyses accompanied by functional verification of certain genes and proteins a complete mc degradation pathway was firstly identified in which mc lr was sequentially degraded into linearized mc lr tetrapeptide adda phenylacetic acid and finally potential product co2 some specific proteins such as microcystinase linearized microcystinase tetrapeptidease and paaase responsible for this pathway were identified this study pioneeringly demonstrated that mc lr can be completely degraded through natural remediation processes and revealed a significant potential for mc lr biodegradation in both natural environment and engineered systems graphical abstract image 1

from water bodies jones et al 1994 okano et al 2009 jiang et al 2011 yang et al 2014a however the removal of mc lr from drinking and recreational water using physicochemical processes has been of limited success because of low efficiency expensive operating costs and formation of harmful by products gagala et al 2012 li et al 2017 recently bacterial biodegradation of mc lr starts gaining attention since it is environmentally friendly cost effective and the absence of harmful by products bourne et al 1996 2006 jones et al 1994 mc lr removal using indigenous bacteria is promising due to minimal environmental impacts but only a few mc degrading bacteria have been obtained bourne et al 1996 jin et al 2018 ho et al 2007 saito et al 2003 shimizu et al 2012 xiao et al 2011 yang et al 2014a thus far most of the isolated mc degrading bacteria were identified as sphingopyxis and sphingomonas genera belonging to α proteobacteria class li et al 2017 bourne et al 2001 okano et al 2009 maghsoudi et al 2016 only one gene cluster mlrbdac responsible for degradation of mc lr and other mc variants was firstly reported present in sphingomonas sp acm 3962 by bourne et al 1996 subsequently the gene cluster mlrbdac was also detected in sphingosinicella microcystinivorans b9 sphingomonas sp md 1 sphingopyxis sp c 1 mb e and ustb 05 novosphingobium sp thn1 and rhizobium sp th among others jin et al 2018 saitou et al 2003 shimizu et al 2012 maghsoudi et al 2016 xiao et al 2011 wang et al 2018 zhu et al 2016 these previous studies demonstrated the role of mlrbdac encoding proteins for degrading mc lr into adda as final nontoxic product bourne et al 1996 harada et al 2004 however a controversy still exists as to whether adda is the final mc lr degradation product and whether it is a toxic compound yang et al 2014b harada et al 2004 cousins et al 1996 chen et al 2012 cousins et al 1996 and chen et al 2012 found that adda exerted toxic effects therefore molecular mechanisms underlying mc lr decomposition processes are still largely unknown in this study we isolated a novel indigenous bacterial strain named yf1 with a high efficient capacity for complete degradation of mc

and rod shaped bacterium fig s1 phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rdna sequences revealed that strain yf1 was affiliated with the genus sphingopyxis and closely resembled sphingopyxis macrogoltabida ifo 15033t 98 33 sequence similarity takeuchi et al 2001 fig 1 high quality reads quality score cut off 20 obtained through whole genome sequencing of sphingopyxis sp yf1 were assembled to produce a complete genome genbank accession number cp033204 yf1 genome consists of one circular chromosome of 4 367 405 bp with a maximum contig length of 1 156 067 bp and minimum contig length of 5 743 bp fig

okano et al 2015 and wang et al 2018 a whole genome based comparison further revealed that the values of ani between strain yf1 and other sphingopyxis spp were below thresholds 95 for bacterial species delimitation delineation richter et al 2009 suggesting that strain yf1 can be considered as a novel species of the genus sphingopyxis table s3 ani was based on pairwise genome comparison of all shared orthologous protein coding genes and reflected the degree of evolutionary distance between compared genomes the ani value was best suited for determining whether two organisms were of the same species richter et al 2009 sphingopyxis sp yf1 fig 3 a and its crude protein extracts fig 3b were able to degrade mc lr and its degradation products containing adda fig s2 mc degradation has been addressed for a few different bacterial strains including sphingomonas sp acm 3962 bourne et al 1996 y2 park et al 2001 and 7cy ishii et al 2004 bordetella sp mc lth1 yang et al 2014a sphingopyxis sp

inoculum of bacteria it is impossible to compare mc degrading rate 5 μg ml h of strain yf1 with other previously reported bacterial mc degrading rates these phenotypic and genotypic analyses provide sufficient evidence to support its taxonomic classification as a novel species of the genus sphingopyxis figs 1 and 2 and table s3 3 2 omics based study 3 2 1 genomic analysis the most significant finding was that sphingopyxis sp yf1 could completely degrade mc lr with adda not present as a final degradation product fig s2 to acquire unknown functional genes encoding enzymes responsible for mc lr and adda degradation genomic sequencing data of strain yf1 was further analyzed genome oriented study revealed that sphingopyxis sp yf1 was identified to harbor the homologues of a gene cluster mlrbdac eao27 19385 to eao27 19400 which were responsible for the conversion of mc lr to adda fig 4 a an online blast search in ncbi web showed that the mlra homologue eao27 19395 from strain yf1 was

metallopeptidase mlrc was located next to the mlra homologue and responsible for hydrolysis of adda glu for degradation of tetrapeptide to adda shimizu et al 2012 similar gene organization was observed in genomes of sphingopyxis sp c 1 and sphingosinicella microcystinivorans b9 fig 4b jin et al 2018 okano et al 2015 the mlrd homologue from strain yf1 was 92 similar to the gene from sphingomonas sp acm 3962 bourne et al 2001 previously bourne et al 2001 showed the role of mlrd is unclear it was postulated that mlrd gene was involved in transport of parent mc into the cellular environment or transport of final mc degradation products from the cell interestingly further inspection demonstrated the existence of homologues of paa gene cluster eao27 19510 to eao27 19540 for an aromatic compound phenylacetic acid paa degradation in the neighborhoods of mlrbdac genes homologues fig 4a this discovery implies that there was potential link between homologues of mlr and paa gene cluster indicating that paa metabolism may be the downstream route of mc degradation to date the whole genomic sequences of only three bacterial strains novosphingobium sp thn 1 sphingopyxis sp c 1 sphingosinicella microcystinivorans b9 have been obtained jin et al 2018 okano et al 2015 wang et al 2018 moreover functional genes for mc degradation were rarely explored except mlrbdac gene cluster the paa gene cluster identified in chromosome of strain yf1 might be involved in the process of mc degradation which was firstly reported in the mc degrading bacteria 3 2 2 transcriptomic analysis to acquire more evidences to support the involvement of mlr and paa gene clusters in mc degradation transcriptomics and proteomics were analyzed to illustrate the expression of encoding genes of sphingopyxis sp yf1 growing on mc lr transcriptomics quality score cut off 20 and proteomics dataset captured the expression of 4 230 genes based on the current annotation transcriptomics showed that 299 and 511 genes were significantly up regulated and down regulated 1 5 folds p 0 05 in comparison with control medium without mc lr respectively fig 5 a during mc lr degradation many of the up regulated genes were involved in amino acid transport and metabolism cog e 8 genes general function prediction cog r 11 genes lipid transport and metabolism cog i 8 genes and unknown function cog s 16 genes fig 5a we also detected the up regulation of 6 genes involved in energy production and conversion cog c 3 genes involved in carbohydrate transport and metabolism cog g and secondary metabolites biosynthesis transport and catabolism cog q 2 genes associated with defense mechanisms cog v fig 5a these results reflected a general physiological adaptation of sphingopyxis sp yf1 to grow on mc lr in addition 187 up regulated genes could not be classified into any cog categories and some new functions were found among these genes based on the cog analysis mlr gene cluster eao27 19385 eao27 19400 and paa gene cluster eao27 19510 eao27 19520 homologues were involved in defense mechanisms and lipid transport and metabolism respectively there was a gene eao27 19415 involved in lipid transport and metabolism as well as secondary metabolites biosynthesis transport and catabolism between the homologues of mlr gene cluster and paa gene cluster moreover homologues of mlr gene cluster paa gene cluster and the gene eao27 19415 were up regulated more than 3 1 5 and 1 5 fold p 0 05 during the growing period on mc lr table s4 which indicated that these functional genes probably played an important role in mc lr degradation 3 2 3 proteomic analysis there were 47 up regulated proteins and 35 down regulated proteins with 1 1 folds compared with control p 0 05 fig 5b these differentially expressed proteins were further analyzed to determine their participation in mc metabolism the most abundant up regulated proteins were found in the unknown function cog s lipid transport and metabolism cog i and general function prediction only cog r with 11 9 and 9 respectively fig 5b some proteins belonged to coenzyme transport and metabolism cog h 3 proteins inorganic ion transport and metabolism cog p 3 proteins and secondary metabolites biosynthesis transport and catabolism cog q 3 proteins fig 5b all proteins encoded by the homologues of mlr gene cluster eao27 19385 eao27 19400 and paa gene cluster eao27 19510 eao27 19520 were up regulated more than 1 1 fold when growing on mc lr table s4 the protein encoded by the gene eao27 19415 was up regulated 1 2 fold table s4 the proteomic results further indicated these functional genes were involved in mc lr degradation integrated transcriptomics and proteomics analysis demonstrated a series of differentially expressed genes and proteins fig 5c for catabolizing mc lr and its degradation products in comparison with a control medium without mc lr up regulation of mc lr and paa metabolic genes eao27 19385 eao27 19400 eao27 19510 eao27 19540 further supported their functionalities for degradation indicating that adda generated by mc lr might be subsequently degraded via paa metabolism until now only transcriptomic data of sphingopyxis sp mb e was obtained revealing the expression of mlr gene cluster responsible for degradation of mc variants maghsoudi et al 2016 previous researchers had not analyzed the mc lr degradation mechanisms using proteomics approaches in this study proteomics data of mc degrading bacteria were obtained for the first time when strain yf1 was exposed to mc lr proteomic analysis in this study show that up regulated proteins especially those located near mlr proteins probably played important roles in mc lr catabolism moreover the present study explored possible new mc degrading genes and mc degrading products especially paa and its catabolic products through the combination of data generated via omics approaches genomics transcriptomics and proteomics analysis consequently multi omics analysis may provide key insights in understanding and exploring the mc degrading mechanisms of bacteria 3 3 identification of mc lr degradation products degradation of mc lr by crude protein extracts of yf1 was performed at 30 c and ph 7 hplc chromatograms showed the peak area of mc lr fell substantially and three main intermediate products of mc lr peak a b and c appeared after incubation for 15 min fig 6 a and b peak d occurred when peak a and b disappeared along with a decline in peak c fig 6c and d degradation products peak a b and c were further identified using hplc esi ms the analysis of these peaks demonstrated major ions at m z 1013 57007 fig 6e m z 615 33936 fig 6f and m z 332 22235 fig 6g which were identical to linearized mc lr tetrapeptide and adda these three previously reported products indicated that the degradation pathway of sphingopyxis sp yf1 might be similar to that of bordetella sp mc lth1 sphingomonas sp acm 3962 novosphingobium sp thn 1 sphingopyxis sp c 1 ustb 05 and lh21 yang et al 2014a bourne et al 1996 jiang et al 2011 okano et al 2009 xiao et al 2011 ho et al 2007 gc ms analysis revealed an intermediate product generated after adda with a retention time a mass spectrum and the fragmentation scheme comparable to the reference spectrum of paa m z 136 090 in the mass spectrum library fig 6h paa standards analyzed by hplc showed the same retention time at 3 3 min as peak d hplc hplc esi ms and gc ms data collectively showed the conversion of mc lr to adda and then to paa the results confirmed that adda generated by mc lr was subsequently degraded via paa metabolism which was in accordance with the multi omics analyses described above adda has been well known to have a bioactive structure and contribute to mc induced toxicity bourne et al 2006 chen et al 2012 and adda has always been detected as the final mc lr biodegradation product bourne et al 1996 manage et al 2009 xiao et al 2011 however this study detected adda as mc degrading intermediate and revealed its degradation through paa metabolism the purified eao27 19395 protein mlra homologue termed as microcystinase hydrolyzed mc lr and its mc lr degradation activity was found to be 51 7 μg ml h which was 1 3 fold higher than mlra from sphingopyxis sp ustb 05 fig 7 a yan et al 2012 the purified eao27 19385 protein mlrb homologue termed as linearized microcystinase hydrolyzed linearized mc lr at the high rate of 75 μg ml h fig 7b michaelis menton constants were km 11 3 1 5 μm for the protein microcystinase and km 10 1 1 8 μm for protein linearized microcystinase michaelis menton constant is the concentration of substrates at half the maximum rate of enzymatic reaction and is critical to determine enzyme specificity efficiency and proficiency johnson 2013 michaelis menton constants of mc degrading enzymes provide a foundation for comparison of the efficiency of these enzymes homologues from different bacterial strains in the future 3 4 identification of paa pathway and functional verification of paaase the genes in strain yf1 potentially responsible for degradation of mc degrading product paa were annotated via alignment against the public database using blast as listed in fig 4a a gene cluster including paaa eao27 19520 paag eao27 19515 and paaz eao27 19510 were identified however the gene paak encoding phenylacetate coa ligase ec 6 2 1 30 linking paa and coa was not found interestingly both the protein encoded by the gene eao27 19415 fig 4b in yf1 and phenylacetate coa ligase belonged to fatty acyl coa synthase ec 6 2 1 which suggested these may have similar function moreover transcriptomics and proteomics analysis revealed that the gene eao27 19415 and its encoding protein were significantly up regulated compared with control thereby the gene may be responsible for linking paa and coa a purified protein encoded by gene eao27 19415 fig s3 was obtained and found to degrade paa in the presence of coa fig 8 in contrast absence of coa resulted in the inability for paa degradation despite the existence of this purified protein fig 8 this purified eao27 19415 protein designated as paaase possesses the potential to link paa and coa and was reported in genus sphingopyxis for the first time in this study these results demonstrated that paa could be degraded by sphingopyxis sp yf1 and thus advancing understanding of paa degrading bacterial strains to date pseudomonas putida bordetella pertussis and burkholderia cenocepacia were reported to contain phenylacetate coa ligase responsible for paa conversion into phenylacetyl coa teufel et al 2010 it is noteworthy that paaase and phenylacetyl coa ligase have similar function but different sequences 3 5 verification of genes expression involved in mc degradation to further identify genes encoding enzymes responsible for catabolism of mc lr and its degradation products in sphingopyxis sp yf1 qrt pcr was performed using mc lr adda and paa as substrates in comparison with control medium without these substrates mc lr catabolic genes and paa catabolic genes containing microcystinase linearized microcystinase tetrapeptidease paaase paaa paag and paaz homologues were significantly up regulated 1 5 fold fig 9 a suggesting these genes were used for metabolism of mc lr and its degradation products including adda and paa the qrt pcr results were consistent with those of transcriptomics and proteomics figs 5 and 9a and table s4 previous studies found expression levels of mlr gene homologues were up regulated in the process of mc lr degradation ding et al 2018 wang et al 2019 which were consistent with our qrt pcr results the multi omics and qrt pcr analysis showed that strain yf1 was identified to possess homologous of mlrbdac paaase paaa paag and paaz which are responsible for degrading mc lr into adda paa and then acetyl coenzyme a acetyl coa fig 9a and b the acetyl coa can be fully oxidized to co2 in the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle in many organisms van rossum et al 2016 thus sphingopyxis sp yf1 was predicted to convert mc lr into co2 hyenstrand et al 2003 also reported mc lr was biodegraded into co2 as a major end product while the degradation pathway was not identified 4 conclusions a novel indigenous bacterium with high mc degrading rate was successfully isolated from lake taihu moreover proteomics data of mc degrading bacteria were obtained for the first time a complete pathway fig 9b for mc lr degradation was proposed through integrating mass spectrometry and multi omics analyses accompanied by functional verification of certain genes and proteins a series of proteins consisting of microcystinase linearized microcystinase and tetrapeptidease were responsible for conversion of mc lr to linearized mc lr and tetrapeptide and subsequently into adda following adda degradation into paa paaase was postulated to convert paa into paa coa which was subsequently degraded to acetyl coa through a series of paa associated homologues finally acetyl coa was completely converted to co2 via the classical tca cycle the complete degradation of mcs into co2 catalyzed by mc degrading bacteria indicates that the potential link between mc producers e g microcystis and planktothrix and mc degraders e g sphingopyxis might play a key role in biogeochemical cycle of carbon element thus these findings provide new insight into mc lr biodegradation and biodetoxification in natural environments and engineered systems funding this study was supported by the

18071,assays based on the polymerase chain reaction pcr are widely applied to quantify enteric viruses in aquatic environments to study their fates and potential infection risks however inhibitory substances enriched by virus concentration processes can result in inaccurate quantification this study aimed to find a method for improving virus quantification by mitigating the effects of inhibitory environmental concentrates using previous knowledge of the properties of the inhibitory substances performances of anion exchange resins gel filtration and a hydrophobic resin dax 8 were comparatively evaluated using poliovirus and its extracted rna spiked into humic acid solutions these solutions served as good representatives of the inhibitory environmental concentrates a sequential treatment using dax 8 resin and gel filtration produced the most favorable results i e low virus losses that were stable and a reduced inhibitory effect furthermore the sequential treatment was applied to another set of 15 environmental concentrates without the sequential treatment serious underestimation 4 0 log10 to 1 1 log10 of a molecular process control murine norovirus was measured for eight samples with the treatment the control was detected with 1 0 log10 underestimation for all samples the treatment improved the quantification of seven types of indigenous viruses in summary the

frnaph genogroup iii f specific rna phage 1 introduction enteric viruses and their indicators are frequently found in environmental water impacted by human and animal feces haramoto et al 2018 viruses are initially excreted in high numbers from infected individuals and become highly diluted in the aqueous environment even if the concentration of these viruses is low they still pose infection risk who 2017 the detection of viruses in aqueous environments has been conducted globally to study their fate in the environment and potential infection risks monteiro and santos 2017 staggemeier et al 2017 tian et al 2018 assays based on the polymerase chain reaction pcr are widely used for virus detection but their test volumes around 5 μl are quite small this has motivated researchers to develop virus concentration methods that can reduce the sample volume from 10 1000 l to 1 ml or less ikner et al 2012 cashdollar and wymer 2013 however merely reducing the volume may not effectively increase the assay sensitivity gibson and schwab 2011 hata et al 2011 rodríguez et al 2012 environmental samples are highly complex and contain substances that can interfere with pcr and the relevant molecular processes such as nucleic acid extraction and reverse transcription rt schrader et al 2012 some of the interfering substances can become enriched with viruses during the concentration process and result in 3 log10 underestimation or false negative quantification of viruses rajal et al 2007 lodder et al 2010 hata et al 2011 wyn jones et al 2011 gibson et al 2012 rodríguez et al 2012 shulman et al 2012 tian et al 2018 varughese et al 2018 bortagaray et al 2019 due to the inhibitory effects many studies have produced unreliable results haramoto et al 2018 as have been reviewed schrader et al 2012 several methods to remove the inhibitory substances or to mitigate their inhibitory effects have been applied additives such as bovine serum albumin and betaine are known to mitigate the inhibitory effects kreader 1996 frackman et al 1998 treatments such as dax 8 resin gel filtration and cation exchange resins have also been applied abbaszadegan et al 1993 borchardt et al 2003 hata et al 2011 schriewer et al 2011 rodríguez et al 2012 however these treatments are not always sufficiently effective kermekchiev et al 2009 schrader et al 2012 diluting the sample should be effective in reducing any type of inhibitory substances however it also reduces the target numbers in the analyte the inhibitory effects are logarithmically pronounced according to the concentration hata et al 2017 suggesting that the use of a simple sample dilution or concentrating a larger volume is occasionally ineffective gibson et al 2012 therefore the accurate quantification of extremely low levels of viruses is often difficult currently filtration based methods known as the adsorption elution method and ultrafiltration uf have been established as the primary concentration methods for viruses in the environment cashdollar and wymer 2013 haramoto et al 2018 the adsorption elution methods involve the use of electronegative microfilter mf electropositive mf and glass wool cashdollar and wymer 2013 haramoto et al 2018 by coupling these techniques with secondary concentration methods sample volumes can be reduced from 10 1000 l to approximately 1 ml hill et al 2007 lambertini et al 2008 ikner et al 2011 hata et al 2014a however all concentration methods are prone to having inhibitory effects hill et al 2007 hata et al 2011 borchardt et al 2012 cashdollar et al 2013 consequently evaluating the reliability of virus quantification processes i e the concentration extraction and rt pcr processes by spiking and recovering process controls has become almost mandatory haramoto et al 2018 except for some additives used during the virus concentration processes like beef extract natural organic substances such as humic acid ha are suspected to be the causes of these inhibitory effects schrader et al 2012 our study group focuses on inhibitory effects occurring after the application of an electronegative mf based virus concentration method we have investigated the relationship between the inhibitory effects which are determined by the process control and the properties of the organic substances in the sample hata et al 2011 2012 2014b 2015 2017 these studies suggest that organic fractions in the 10 100 kda size range and those with hydrophobic substance like fluorescence properties are greatly enriched in the virus concentrates and are responsible for the inhibitory effects in addition they suggest that the commercially available ha powders supplied by sigma aldrich and wako chemical are suitable representatives of the environmental inhibitory substances in view of their size and fluorescence properties hata et al 2015 therefore a treatment that can remove these organic fractions will make virus quantification more reliable considering that both nucleic acid extraction and rt pcr processes can be affected by inhibitory substances hata et al 2011 the treatment should be applied before the nucleic acid extraction process the molecular weight of the presumptive inhibitory substances suggests that a simple size exclusion assay such as gel filtration is effective for sample purification the size of the enteric viruses 2000 kda granboulan and girard 1969 is far larger than those of potential inhibitors 10 100 kda because gel filtration can exclude substances smaller in size than the virus particle this method has been applied for virus purification purposes abbaszadegan et al 1993 borchardt et al 2003 hata et al 2011 rodríguez et al 2012 unfortunately gel filtration occasionally fails to improve the virus detection efficiency indicating that the inhibitory substances form aggregates that are not trapped in the gel fractionation of the dissolved organic matter dom using a hydrophobic resin and ion exchange resins has been widely applied to characterize dom leenheer 1981 imai et al 2001 peuravuori et al 2005 zhang et al 2009 typically dom is categorized as either hydrophobic or hydrophilic and as either an acid a neutral or a base hydrophobic dom is separated from hydrophilic dom by adsorbing hydrophobic dom onto a hydrophobic resin such as dax 8 resin acid and base dom can be separated from the whole dom with anion exchange and cation exchange resins respectively leenheer 1981 imai et al 2001 peuravuori et al 2005 zhang et al 2009 enteric viruses whose surfaces are covered by capsid proteins are regarded as hydrophilic bases leenheer 1981 whereas the potential inhibitory substances ha like are supposed to consist of hydrophobic acid substances imai et al 1998 2001 anion exchange resin adsorbs organic acids and hydrophobic resin adsorbs hydrophobic acids particularly under acidic ph conditions leenheer 1981 imai et al 2001 these notions indicate the potential applicability of hydrophobic resin and anion exchange resin for the separation of enteric viruses from the inhibitory substances in the present study a hydrophobic resin anion exchange resins and gel filtration were used to mitigate the inhibitory effects that occur during virus detection for environmental samples using rt pcr consequently a sample purification method using a hydrophobic resin and gel filtration dax 8 gel treatment was developed this method was optimized using artificial inhibitory samples containing a commercially available ha and with environmental virus concentrates furthermore this method was validated by detecting indigenous viruses in another set of environmental virus concentrates 2 materials and methods 2 1 viruses poliovirus type 1 pv lsc 2 ab sabin strain and murine norovirus mnv strain s7 pp3 were replicated in buffalo green monkey kidney cells bgm cells and in raw 264 7 cells respectively and purified according to previous studies wobus et al 2004 hata et al 2011 the concentrations of the purified pv 9 0 106 gene copies μl and mnv 7 0 106 gene copies μl were determined using rt qpcr as described below 2 2 preparation of ha solutions ha solutions were used as model solutions of the rt pcr inhibitor to prepare the ha solutions two commercially available ha powders denoted as ald ha sigma aldrich tokyo japan and wa ha wako chemicals tokyo japan were used these ha powders predominantly contain 10 100 kda size fractions which can be efficiently enriched by the adsorption elution method using an electronegative mf and are assumed to cause rt pcr inhibition hata et al 2015 suwanee river ha supplied by the international humic substances society is regarded as the reference ha chin et al 1994 chen et al 2003 kawasaki et al 2011 however this ha which contains less amount of the 10 100 kda size fraction has a negligible inhibitory effect on virus detection hata et al 2015 therefore the suwanee river ha was not used in this study the solutions were prepared by first dissolving 100 mg of each powder in 1 m naoh solution neutralized with hcl the solutions were then diluted with milli q water to be 200 mg l 2 3 preparation of dax 8 resin the hydrophobic resin dax 8 sigma aldrich was prepared in accordance with the process of thurman and malcolm 1981 with some modifications first dax 8 resin was mixed with 0 1 n naoh in a 1 l beaker and washed by stirring for 120 h 5 days with a magnetic stirrer after each 24 h the resin was separated from the liquids and mixed with fresh 0 1 n naoh the resin was then further sequentially rinsed for 24 h in a 1 l beaker with methanol diethyl ether acetonitrile and methanol by stirring for a total of 96 h 4 days with a magnetic stirrer following these rinsing processes the resin was stored in methanol at room temperature 2 4 virus concentration procedures three and fifteen environmental concentrates were collected from different sites in the coastal area of tokyo bay and ishinomaki bay respectively in japan the tokyo bay samples were collected from an estuarine region of the sumida river sample a and beach parks samples b and c from july 2011 to june 2012 the ishinomaki bay samples were collected from five sites including two sites located in an estuarine region of the kyukitakami river from december 2011 to march 2012 sample collection and concentration were conducted as described previously hata et al 2012 2017 briefly each sample 40 l was directly passed through a cartridge type electronegative membrane opticap xl 2 merck millipore on site using an aspirator the cartridge was then transported to the laboratory subsequently 2 0 l of 0 5 mm h2so4 ph 3 0 1 0 l of milli q water and 200 ml of 1 0 mm naoh ph 10 8 were successively passed through the cartridge the final naoh eluate was recovered as a primary concentrate into a tube containing 1 ml of 100 mm h2so4 for neutralization furthermore the volume of the primary concentrate was reduced using a centricon plus 70 centrifugal filter unit molecular weight cut off of 30 kda merck millipore according to the manufacturer s protocol to obtain approximately 1 ml of a secondary concentrate the concentrates from tokyo bay were used for comparing the efficacies of the sample purification methods using solutions spiked with pv whereas the concentrates from ishinomaki bay were used for the validation of the dax 8 gel treatment described below by quantifying the spiked mnv and indigenous viruses 2 5 sample purification procedures anion exchange resins gel filtration and a hydrophobic resin were used for the sample purification procedures these treatments were applied to the ha solutions spiked with pv and the environmental concentrates spiked with pv or mnv 2 5 1 sample purification using anion exchange resin two strong anion exchange resins ira 958 organo japan and ira 458 organo and a weak anion exchange resin xe 583 organo were used for sample purification these resins were washed in accordance with the procedure by humbert et al 2005 prior to use a certain amount of resin 140 μl and 560 μl for the strong and weak anion exchange resins respectively was mixed with 140 μl of a sample and incubated for 10 min at room temperature the water phase was recovered using ultrafree a centrifugal pvdf microfiltration unit 0 45 μm pore size millipore centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 1 min and then subjected to downstream rna extraction and rt qpcr 2 5 2 sample purification using gel filtration a centrifugal gel filtration unit microspin s 300 hr column ge healthcare was used for sample purification according to the manufacturer s instructions the resultant filtrate was subjected to downstream rna extraction and rt qpcr 2 5 3 sample purification using dax 8 resin a hydrophobic resin dax 8 organo was used after being rinsed as described in section 2 3 then 140 μl of the resin was dewatered using ultrafree and mixed with 140 μl of sample if necessary the ph of the sample was adjusted to 2 0 using 35 hcl before being mixed with the dax 8 resin the water phase was recovered using ultrafree centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 1 min as the dax 8 filtrate and was subjected to rna extraction and subsequent rt qpcr in order to recover viruses retained on the resin 560 μl of lysis buffer buffer avl provided with the qiaamp viral rna mini kit was mixed with the resin after passing through the sample by centrifuging at 8000 rpm for 1 min after 10 min of incubation at room temperature the lysis buffer was recovered using ultrafree as the dax 8 retentate and was subjected to rna extraction and subsequent rt qpcr 2 5 4 sample purification using dax 8 resin and gel filtration the dax 8 resin treatment followed by gel filtration was also tested in this study this procedure is schematically depicted in fig 1 at first a sample virus concentrate was subjected to dax 8 treatment without ph adjustment then the dax 8 filtrate 140 μl and the dax 8 retentate 560 μl were mixed and incubated for 10 min at room temperature following this incubation 560 μl of methanol was added to the mixture and passed through a spin column provided with the qiaamp viral rna mini kit the spin column was then washed and subjected to rna elution according to the manufacturer s instructions the obtained rna extract 60 μl was subjected to gel filtration as described in section 2 5 2 the recovered filtrate was further subjected to rt qpcr 2 6 rna extraction and rt qpcr quantification of viruses was conducted by rt qpcr briefly 140 μl of the sample was subjected to rna extraction using the qiaamp viral rna mini kit to obtain 60 μl of rna extract if necessary the rna extract was then diluted 10 fold with nuclease free water and both diluted and undiluted rna extracts were subjected to rt qpcr the rt reaction was conducted using the high capacity cdna reverse transcription kit life technologies tokyo japan according to the manufacturer s protocol taqman based qpcr was performed as described in our previous study hata et al 2011 primer pairs taqman probes and thermal cycling conditions for each viral target i e spiked pv and mnv indigenous genogroup i norovirus gi nov gii nov sapovirus sav enterovirus ev aichi virus i aiv genogroup ii f specific rna phage gii frnaph and giii frnaph were derived from previous studies katayama et al 2002 kageyama et al 2003 oka et al 2006 kitajima et al 2008 2013 wolf et al 2010 to obtain a calibration curve 10 fold serial dilutions with concentrations ranging from 1 0 101 to 1 0 106 gene copies per qpcr reaction of a plasmid dna containing the target sequence were amplified 2 7 statistical analysis a paired t test was performed with microsoft excel 2013 microsoft for comparing the efficacy of the dax 8 gel treatment with that of the sample dilution in terms of recovery of the spiked mnv and indigenous viruses in the environmental samples in this test log10 transformed observed concentrations of viruses were used if the resultant p value was lower than 0 05 the difference was considered statistically significant 3 results 3 1 efficacies of purification methods on ha solutions the recoveries of the spiked pv from the ha solutions subjected to sample purification procedures are summarized in table 1 in this study two types of ha solutions wa ha and ald ha were used to represent the environmental inhibitory substances the rna extract was diluted to mitigate the inhibitory effects and to observe virus loss during purification testing in the absence of the ha solutions was also conducted to observe virus loss during the purification however in cases where virus loss was considered to be either acceptably low or substantial 1 0 log10 or 1 0 log10 underestimation due to virus loss by tests without the dilution or in the absence of the ha solutions the sample dilution was not performed when the concentration of the ha solutions was 200 mg l the spiked pv 105 copies tube became negative after diluting the ha solutions 10 fold the spiked pv was still negative for wa ha while it became positive with substantial underestimation 3 9 log10 for ald ha the substantial underestimation occurred even after the sample dilution enabling the comparison of the efficacy of the sample purification procedures with that of the sample dilution by employing the two strong anion exchange resins ira 958 and ira 458 underestimations of pv in the 200 mg l ha solutions were mitigated but they were still around 2 0 log10 1 recovery diluting the ha solutions did not notably improve the pv quantification except for the 200 mg l of the wa ha treated with ira 958 indicating that the strong anion exchange resins removed both inhibitory substances and pv removal of the spiked pv by the resin can also be assumed as shown in the result obtained from a sample without the ha additionally when pv rna was treated with ira 958 in the absence of ha solutions it could not be detected the weak anion exchange resin xe 583 resulted in a poor improvement to pv quantification and in inefficient pv quantification even in the absence of ha this resin appeared to be ineffective for sample purification and therefore testing in the absence of ha was conducted only once n 1 gel filtration applied to the 200 mg l ha solutions improved pv quantification from 3 9 log10 to approximately 1 0 log10 underestimation even though its effect did not appear until the 10 fold sample dilution the efficacy of the dax 8 resin was examined under acidic ph 2 0 and neutral ph conditions for the tests conducted under acidic ph conditions the pv virion and its extracted rna were subjected to the treatment the test using pv virion showed no improvement to the quantification on the contrary the test using pv rna showed an acceptably low 0 3 log10 underestimation table 1 these results indicate that for dax 8 resin under low ph conditions both viruses and inhibitory substances in the ha solutions were efficiently excluded from the samples but rna can remain in the samples under neutral ph conditions without ha most of the pv was recovered from the dax 8 filtrate 0 3 log10 underestimation equivalent to 49 recovery and a small fraction was found from the dax 8 retentate 3 4 log10 underestimation equivalent to 0 040 recovery table 1 pv spiked in wa ha resulted in substantial underestimations 4 4 log10 and negative in dax 8 filtrate and dax 8 retentate respectively which were improved to be 0 1 log10 130 and 0 4 log10 40 respectively by the 10 fold dilutions pv spiked in ald ha was quantified with 1 4 log10 underestimation equivalent to 4 0 recovery from the dax 8 filtrate which was not improved by the sample dilution while it was quantified with high efficiency 0 2 log10 underestimation equivalent to 63 recovery from dax 8 retentate these results indicate that dax 8 resin retains some amount and most of the inhibitory substances in wa ha and ald ha respectively as supposed from the underestimation in the dax 8 retentate pv seems to be retained along with the inhibitory substances and the rna from the virus can be recovered by using the lysis buffer especially pv rna spiked into ald ha appeared to be separated from the inhibitory substances in the dax 8 retentate 3 2 efficacies of purification methods on environmental concentrates the performances of dax 8 resin ira 458 anion exchange resin and gel filtration were further evaluated using three environmental concentrates collected from tokyo bay samples a c fig 2 in these tests recoveries of the spiked pv from the dax 8 filtrate and retentate were evaluated also the dax 8 resin treatment coupled with gel filtration fig 1 which was denoted as dax 8 gel in fig 2 was validated among the three environmental concentrates samples a and b caused relatively moderate inhibitory effects they resulted in 3 1 and 3 9 log10 underestimations respectively of the spiked pv without dilution which became almost 0 log10 after 10 fold dilution in contrast sample c caused severe inhibitory effects which resulted in a negative for the spiked pv before and after the 10 fold dilution the dax 8 filtrate showed reasonably improved spiked pv quantifications which were underestimated by approximately 1 0 log10 against the moderately inhibitory samples however this effect was limited against the severely inhibitory sample the performance of dax 8 retentate was not better than that of dax 8 filtrate ira 458 showed ambiguous results it improved the quantification to almost 0 log10 underestimation against the severely inhibitory sample c but was not effective in improving the quantification against the moderately inhibitory samples a and b the sole use of gel filtration did not show notable improvement of the spiked pv quantification the dax 8 gel treatment fig 1 improved the spiked pv quantification from the moderately inhibitory samples to an acceptable level 1 0 log10 underestimation 0 7 and 0 9 log10 this treatment also improved the quantification of the severely inhibitory sample from negative 5 0 log10 underestimation to 1 8 log10 underestimation by diluting the severely inhibitory sample after the dax 8 gel treatment the quantification was further improved to be acceptable 0 9 log10 underestimation 3 3 application of the dax 8 gel treatment for detection of indigenous viruses efficacy of the dax 8 gel treatment was further investigated by quantifying indigenous viruses in another set of environmental concentrates these samples secondary concentrates were spiked with mnv as a molecular process control for evaluating the rna extraction rt qpcr efficiency without the dax 8 gel treatment or the sample dilution the spiked mnv was not detected 1 sample 4 0 log10 underestimation or detected with 1 0 log10 underestimation 3 2 1 1 log10 for 8 out of 15 samples fig 3 in contrast after applying the dax 8 gel treatment the spiked mnv was detected with 1 0 log10 underestimation 0 8 0 0 log10 for all 15 samples the spiked mnv detection was also conducted after 10 fold dilution of the rna extracts without dax 8 gel treatment and revealed a 1 0 log10 underestimation 0 9 0 1 log10 for 14 out of 15 samples the one remaining sample resulted in 1 0 log10 underestimation the underestimation of the spiked mnv following the application of the dax 8 gel treatment was not significantly different from that observed following the sample dilution paired t test p 0 06 the 15 samples were further subjected to quantification of seven types of indigenous viruses gi and gii nov sav ev aiv and gii and giii frnaph the quantifications have previously been conducted using the samples non diluted and 10 fold diluted rna extracts without the dax 8 gel treatment hata et al 2012 fig 4 and table s1 in the supplementary information among the 105 trials performed to quantify the seven types of viruses from the 15 non diluted rna extracts 34 switched from negative to positive after the dax 8 gel treatment fig 4a in two trials the quantifications of viruses improved by 1 0 log10 after the treatment no trial resulted in a 1 0 log10 reduction of the observed virus concentrations after the treatment however six trials switched from positive to negative after the treatment among these six trials four were those to quantify giii frnaph by diluting the rna extracts 18 trials switched from negative to positive whereas 28 switched from positive to negative when the dax 8 gel treatment results were compared with those of the sample dilution 27 trials were positive only after the dax 8 gel treatment whereas one trial was positive only after the sample dilution among the trials that were positive after both dilution and dax 8 gel treatments concentrations of indigenous viruses determined after the dax 8 gel treatment tended to be higher than those determined after the sample dilution however this difference was not statistically significant paired t test p 0 62 4 discussion to date many researchers have reported quantifications of viruses in water and food that are inaccurate because of inhibitory substances present in the samples haramoto et al 2018 several methods to reduce the inhibitory effect have been documented however these methods are not always effective kermekchiev et al 2009 schrader et al 2012 this might be owing to the lack of available information regarding the inhibitory substances that are retained in virus concentrates recently we successfully characterized some of these inhibitory substances based on their organic properties hata et al 2015 2017 these studies showed that the naturally occurring inhibitory substances that were retained throughout the electronegative mf and ultrafiltration virus concentration procedures were in the 10 100 kda size range and hydrophobic in addition inhibitory substances in ald ha and wa ha were found to supposedly be representatives of the naturally occurring ones these findings motivated us to investigate sample purification techniques to remove these inhibitory substances in ha solutions and environmental concentrates 4 1 efficacy of each sample purification method anion exchange resins onto which negatively charged substances adsorb have been applied to remove or separate organic acids such as ha imai et al 2001 bolto et al 2002 humbert et al 2005 cornelissen et al 2008 strong anion exchange resins are expected to adsorb organic acids more efficiently than weak anion exchange resins cornelissen et al 2008 in this study as expected the strong anion exchange resins greatly mitigated the inhibitory effects in ha solutions while the weak anion exchange resins did not show notable effects table 1 however the efficacy of this treatment on environmental concentrates was inconsistent it did not improve virus quantification for two samples but improved virus quantification from 5 log10 to 0 log10 underestimation for one sample fig 2 these results suggest that anion exchange resins are occasionally effective in purifying environmental concentrates as shown previously the inhibitory substances in the water environment vary hata et al 2017 some of them may adsorb on the resin while others may not tests conducted in the absence of inhibitory substances strongly suggested that viruses were also removed by the anion exchange resins under neutral ph conditions the surface charge of enteric viruses is supposed to be negative michen and graule 2010 and therefore viruses can be the target of the anion exchange resin the viral rna was removed entirely by the strong anion exchange resin table 1 and this was an expected result because nucleic acids are targeted by the resin dika et al 2011 demonstrated that viral rna could affect the viral charge thereby possibly affecting the interaction between the virus and resin these should be considered when an anion exchange resin is used for sample purification gel filtration is a technique used to exclude small substances from a sample in this study a gel column was selected to exclude 70 kda size particles 118 bp of dna the size of a virus particle is around 2000 kda ohlbaum et al 1970 thus this technique was expected to separate viruses from inhibitory substances whose sizes were around 30 kda the tests using ha solutions revealed that this technique can mitigate the inhibitory effects even though the samples were still inhibitive after the treatment table 1 nevertheless this technique did not show any notable improvements in virus quantification for environmental concentrates fig 2 these results indicate that the gel filtration is not sufficiently effective in samples containing high concentrations of inhibitory substances considering that the environmental concentrates were blackish with high viscosity it is also probable that these inhibitory substances were aggregated in the concentrate and became larger than the target size of the gel filtration treatment dax 8 resin is a hydrophobic resin onto which hydrophobic neutral and hydrophobic acid substances adsorb under any ph and acidic ph conditions respectively through hydrophobic interactions under acidic ph conditions inhibitory substances in wa ha and ald ha seem to be efficiently removed by the resin as expected however some of the viral particles in the ha solutions also seem to be removed one of the properties of ha is that it aggregates under acidic ph conditions ihss therefore it is possible that the viral particles were incorporated into the ha aggregate and retained on the resin in the absence of ha 49 of pv was recovered in the dax 8 filtrate this suggests that pv itself does not substantially adsorb onto the resin however the tests without ha were not performed in replicate since the degree of hydrophobicity varies depending on the type of virus van voorthuizen et al 2001 langlet et al 2008 dika et al 2015 some viruses may show high adsorption onto the dax 8 resin nevertheless as described below even if the virus adsorbs onto the resin viral rna can be recovered interestingly when the analyte was extracted viral rna spiked into the ha solution the viral rna could be recovered with an acceptably high recovery 0 3 log10 without inhibitory effects a similar result was obtained when a buffer for capsid lysis was passed through the resin after the virion in the ha solutions this suggests that the recovery of viral rna is possible even when the capsid has been adsorbed onto the dax 8 resin therefore application of the dax 8 treatment under acidic ph conditions is supposed to be highly effective for removing inhibitory substances without losing viral rna however our concern was that it would be difficult to adjust the sample ph to be optimal due to the alkalinity and small volume around 1 ml of the environmental concentrates 4 2 optimization of dax 8 gel treatment we further evaluated the interactions among ha virus or viral rna and dax 8 resin under neutral ph conditions most of the pv spiked into ald ha was recovered from the dax 8 retentate after capsid lysis without inhibitory effects on the contrary the pv spiked into wa ha was recovered both from the dax 8 filtrate and retentate with inhibitory effects these results imply that this interaction depends on the type of the inhibitory substance taken together the dax 8 treatment under neutral ph conditions seems to be effective in removing the inhibitory substances and recovering viruses or viral rna however in some settings by applying the lysis buffer inhibitory substances retained on the resin can be recovered along with viral rna ald ha and wa ha were used as the model solutions for the rt pcr inhibitor however environmental water is highly complex and contains a wide diversity of inhibitory substances hata et al 2017 therefore this purification method was further validated using environmental concentrates as we expected the application of the dax 8 treatment on environmental concentrates under neutral ph conditions showed ambiguous results fig 2 pv was efficiently recovered without inhibitory effects from both the filtrate and retentate sample a with and without inhibitory effects from the filtrate and retentate respectively sample b and with slightly mitigated inhibitory effects sample c the viscosities of the analytes after the treatment seemed to be low indicating that the inhibitory substances that had aggregated in the samples have been dispersed gel filtration was then supposed to be effective in removing the inhibitory substances the gel filtration following the dax 8 treatment efficiently mitigated the inhibitory effects with an acceptably low 1 0 log10 viral loss this treatment allowed us to detect the spiked pv from the highly inhibitive sample sample c even though it was still inhibitive to some extent 0 9 log10 underestimation after the treatment the tests depicted in fig 2 used only three environmental concentrates without replicate for further validation of the treatment various viruses including one spiked virus and seven indigenous viruses in the 15 environmental concentrates were targeted 4 3 validation of dax 8 gel treatment application of the dax 8 gel treatment to another set of environmental concentrates revealed its utility in recovering the molecular process control mnv and a variety of indigenous viruses figs 3 and 4 recovery of the molecular process control indicates that if the original concentrate is inhibitive 1 0 log10 underestimation of the control this treatment can improve the quantification none of the indigenous virus quantifications resulted in a 1 0 log10 reduction to the observed virus concentration indicating that viral loss caused by this treatment is not substantial however giii frnaph tended to switch to negative from positive when this treatment was applied this suggests that the virus recovery efficiency of the treatment depends on the type of virus the size and shape of giii frnaph around 20 nm in diameter icosahedral shape is similar to those of caliciviruses nov and sav and picornaviruses ev and aiv therefore giii frnaph was supposed to be recovered in a similar efficiency to other viruses in this study by gel filtration one possible explanation for this reduced recovery of giii frnaph by the dax 8 gel treatment is that in the samples giii frnaph was covered thoroughly with hydrophobic substances that preferentially adsorbed onto the dax 8 resin previous studies which determined viral reduction associated with the activated sludge process and viral adhesion onto solid surfaces suggested that giii frnaph can be characterized as a relatively adhesive virus even though its character is not substantially different from that of gii frnaph pelleïeux et al 2012 hata et al 2013 dika et al 2015 haramoto et al 2015 it is also known that the hydrophobicity of giii frnaph is not as high as that of gii frnaph langlet et al 2008 these previous studies suggest that giii frnaph is relatively adhesive on solid surfaces including the hydrophobic resin but some other viruses can be similarly adhesive thus the reason for the reduced recovery of giii frnaph by the dax 8 gel treatment remains unclear further investigation regarding the interactions among viruses organic substances and dax 8 resin is required sample dilution is the simplest method for mitigating the inhibitory effects and has been applied in several studies rajal et al 2007 lambertini et al 2008 gibson and schwab 2011 gibson et al 2012 varughese et al 2018 bortagaray et al 2019 however as has been pointed coudray et al 2013 this method dilutes the viral targets and can lead to false negative results in the present study false negative results were obtained after diluting environmental samples the dax 8 gel treatment was also suggested to reduce viruses in the sample however the dax 8 gel treatment showed a better positive rate than the sample dilution and only one trial was negative after the dax 8 gel treatment furthermore virus concentrations determined for both methods were comparable suggesting that the dax 8 gel treatment did not cause a substantial viral loss and was a better option for the detection of low concentrations of viruses in inhibitive samples compared with the 10 fold dilution however if the sample contained a sufficient number of viruses which allowed for a higher dilution factor the sample dilution method may have higher applicability than the dax 8 gel treatment therefore further validation of the dax 8 gel treatment against indigenous viruses in various water samples is warranted recently a spiked control like mnv used in this study has widely been used to see the significance of inhibitory effects on virus detection from environmental samples haramoto et al 2018 in this study we spiked the mnv virion prior to the dax 8 gel treatment then the control could work not only for showing the inhibitory effect but also for revealing the effects of the sample purification treatments such as the mitigation of inhibitory effects and potential loss of viruses by the treatment when an additional sample treatment is required a process control gains in importance underestimation of our spiked control occurs not only because of the rt pcr efficiency inhibition but also because of the rna extraction efficiency costafreda et al 2006 rajal et al 2007 hata et al 2011 shulman et al 2012 gentry shields and jaykus 2015 the rna extraction efficiency for the samples in this study ha solutions and environmental concentrates is supposed to be high and sufficient because the sample dilutions improved the virus detection efficiency to be an acceptable level the efficacy of the dax 8 gel treatment for improving the rna extraction efficiency is thus unknown in addition the efficacy of this treatment for dna viruses has not yet been evaluated all these aspects require evaluation in the future via comparison with the sample dilution in the present study electronegative membrane and ultrafiltration were used for concentrating viruses other virus concentration methods such as the electropositive membrane method glass wool method and peg precipitation can also lead to inhibitory effects ikner et al 2011 wyn jones et al 2011 rodríguez et al 2012 de keuckelaere et al 2013 it would be interesting to employ the dax 8 gel treatment to virus concentrates obtained by these methods even though the characteristics of the inhibitory substances retained in the concentrate probably depend on the virus concentration methods moreover the efficiency of the virus concentration process can substantially vary depending on water quality and methodology cashdollar and wymer 2013 petterson et al 2015 spiked controls to ascertain the virus recovery efficiency had been used in previous studies kundu et al 2013 hata et al 2014b prevost et al 2015 kazama et al 2017 however the present study did not use the control because the virus concentration process was conducted on site future investigations into relationships among the virus recovery efficiency water quality and virus concentration methods might be valuable for improving virus quantification in this study spiked pv was used for comparing the efficacy of the sample purification treatments on ha solutions and environmental concentrates while spiked mnv was used for validating the dax 8 gel treatment for environmental concentrates the former tests were simple spike tests and detection of indigenous viruses was out of the measurable scope therefore pv was used as a good representative of the enteric viruses in the tests the latter test aimed to quantify indigenous viruses and mnv was used as a molecular process control 5 conclusions in this study the efficacies of resin treatments and gel filtration on the mitigation of the inhibitory effects of the ha solutions and environmental concentrates were evaluated the anion exchange resin was occasionally effective in removing the inhibitory substances however it could also remove the virus and viral rna dax 8 resin was effective in recovering the virus and viral rna and in dispersing the inhibitory substances that formed aggregates in virus concentrates the dispersed inhibitory substances could be separated from viral rna using gel filtration a sequential treatment using the dax 8 resin and gel filtration was effective for various inhibitory samples by applying the sequential treatment to environmental concentrates quantifications of various types of indigenous viruses except for giii frnaph were improved to a satisfactory level the dax 8 gel treatment produced better results for samples containing low concentrations of rna viruses than the sample dilution the superiority of this method for high concentrations of viruses and dna viruses requires further investigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

18071,assays based on the polymerase chain reaction pcr are widely applied to quantify enteric viruses in aquatic environments to study their fates and potential infection risks however inhibitory substances enriched by virus concentration processes can result in inaccurate quantification this study aimed to find a method for improving virus quantification by mitigating the effects of inhibitory environmental concentrates using previous knowledge of the properties of the inhibitory substances performances of anion exchange resins gel filtration and a hydrophobic resin dax 8 were comparatively evaluated using poliovirus and its extracted rna spiked into humic acid solutions these solutions served as good representatives of the inhibitory environmental concentrates a sequential treatment using dax 8 resin and gel filtration produced the most favorable results i e low virus losses that were stable and a reduced inhibitory effect furthermore the sequential treatment was applied to another set of 15 environmental concentrates without the sequential treatment serious underestimation 4 0 log10 to 1 1 log10 of a molecular process control murine norovirus was measured for eight samples with the treatment the control was detected with 1 0 log10 underestimation for all samples the treatment improved the quantification of seven types of indigenous viruses in summary the

are initially excreted in high numbers from infected individuals and become highly diluted in the aqueous environment even if the concentration of these viruses is low they still pose infection risk who 2017 the detection of viruses in aqueous environments has been conducted globally to study their fate in the environment and potential infection risks monteiro and santos 2017 staggemeier et al 2017 tian et al 2018 assays based on the polymerase chain reaction pcr are widely used for virus detection but their test volumes around 5 μl are quite small this has motivated researchers to develop virus concentration methods that can reduce the sample volume from 10 1000 l to 1 ml or less ikner et al 2012 cashdollar and wymer 2013 however merely reducing the volume may not effectively increase the assay sensitivity gibson and schwab 2011 hata et al 2011 rodríguez et al 2012 environmental samples are highly complex and contain substances that can interfere with pcr and the relevant molecular processes such as nucleic acid extraction and reverse transcription rt schrader et al 2012 some of the interfering substances can become enriched with viruses during the concentration process and result in 3 log10 underestimation or false negative quantification of viruses rajal et al 2007 lodder et al 2010 hata et al 2011 wyn jones et al 2011 gibson et al 2012 rodríguez et al 2012 shulman et al 2012 tian et al 2018 varughese et al 2018 bortagaray et al 2019 due to the inhibitory effects many studies have produced unreliable results haramoto et al 2018 as have been reviewed schrader et al 2012 several methods to remove the inhibitory substances or to mitigate their inhibitory effects have been applied additives such as bovine serum albumin and betaine are known to mitigate the inhibitory effects kreader 1996 frackman et al 1998 treatments such as dax 8 resin gel filtration and cation exchange resins have also been applied abbaszadegan et al 1993 borchardt et al 2003 hata et al 2011 schriewer et al 2011 rodríguez et al 2012 however these treatments are not always sufficiently effective kermekchiev et al 2009 schrader et al 2012 diluting the sample should be effective in reducing any type of inhibitory substances however it also reduces the target numbers in the analyte the inhibitory effects are logarithmically pronounced according to the concentration hata et al 2017 suggesting that the use of a simple sample dilution or concentrating a larger volume is occasionally ineffective gibson et al 2012 therefore the accurate quantification of extremely low levels of viruses is often difficult currently filtration based methods known as the adsorption elution method and ultrafiltration uf have been established as the primary concentration methods for viruses in the environment cashdollar and wymer 2013 haramoto et al 2018 the adsorption elution methods involve the use of electronegative microfilter mf electropositive mf and glass wool cashdollar and wymer 2013 haramoto et al 2018 by coupling these techniques with secondary concentration methods sample volumes can be reduced from 10 1000 l to approximately 1 ml hill et al 2007 lambertini et al 2008 ikner et al 2011 hata et al 2014a however all concentration methods are prone to having inhibitory effects hill et al 2007 hata et al 2011 borchardt et al 2012 cashdollar et al 2013 consequently evaluating the reliability of virus quantification processes i e the concentration extraction and rt pcr processes by spiking and recovering process controls has become almost mandatory haramoto et al 2018 except for some additives used during the virus concentration processes like beef extract natural organic substances such as humic acid ha are suspected to be the causes of these inhibitory effects schrader et al 2012 our study group focuses on inhibitory effects occurring after the application of an electronegative mf based virus concentration method we have investigated the relationship between the inhibitory effects which are determined by the process control and the properties of the organic substances in the sample hata et al 2011 2012 2014b 2015 2017 these studies suggest that organic fractions in the 10 100 kda size range and those with hydrophobic substance like fluorescence properties are greatly enriched in the virus concentrates and are responsible for the inhibitory effects in addition they suggest that the commercially available ha powders supplied by sigma aldrich and wako chemical are suitable representatives of the environmental inhibitory substances in view of their size and fluorescence properties hata et al 2015 therefore a treatment that can remove these organic fractions will make virus quantification more reliable considering that both nucleic acid extraction and rt pcr processes can be affected by inhibitory substances hata et al 2011 the treatment should be applied before the nucleic acid extraction process the molecular weight of the presumptive inhibitory substances suggests that a simple size exclusion assay such as gel filtration is effective for sample purification the size of the enteric viruses 2000 kda granboulan and girard 1969 is far larger than those of potential inhibitors 10 100 kda because gel filtration can exclude substances smaller in size than the virus particle this method has been applied for virus purification purposes abbaszadegan et al 1993 borchardt et al 2003 hata et al 2011 rodríguez et al 2012 unfortunately gel filtration occasionally fails to improve the virus detection efficiency indicating that the inhibitory substances form aggregates that are not trapped in the gel fractionation of the dissolved organic matter dom using a hydrophobic resin and ion exchange resins has been widely applied to characterize dom leenheer 1981 imai et al 2001 peuravuori et al 2005 zhang et al 2009 typically dom is categorized as either hydrophobic or hydrophilic and as either an acid a neutral or a base hydrophobic dom is separated from hydrophilic dom by adsorbing hydrophobic dom onto a hydrophobic resin such as dax 8 resin acid and base dom can be separated from the whole dom with anion exchange and cation exchange resins respectively leenheer 1981 imai et al 2001 peuravuori et al 2005 zhang et al 2009 enteric viruses whose surfaces are covered by capsid proteins are regarded as hydrophilic bases leenheer 1981 whereas the potential inhibitory substances ha like are supposed to consist of hydrophobic acid substances imai et al 1998 2001 anion exchange resin adsorbs organic acids and hydrophobic resin adsorbs hydrophobic acids particularly under acidic ph conditions leenheer 1981 imai et al 2001 these notions indicate the potential applicability of hydrophobic resin and anion exchange resin for the separation of enteric viruses from the inhibitory substances in the present study a hydrophobic resin anion exchange resins and gel filtration were used to mitigate the inhibitory effects that occur during virus detection for environmental samples using rt pcr consequently a sample purification method using a hydrophobic resin and gel filtration dax 8 gel treatment was developed this method was optimized using artificial inhibitory samples containing a commercially available ha and with environmental virus concentrates furthermore this method was validated by detecting indigenous viruses in another set of environmental virus concentrates 2 materials and methods 2 1 viruses poliovirus type 1 pv lsc 2 ab sabin strain and murine norovirus mnv strain s7 pp3 were replicated in buffalo green monkey kidney cells bgm cells and in raw 264 7 cells respectively and purified according to previous studies wobus et al 2004 hata et al 2011 the concentrations of the purified pv 9 0 106 gene copies μl and mnv 7 0 106 gene copies μl were determined using rt qpcr as described below 2 2 preparation of ha solutions ha solutions were used as model solutions of the rt pcr inhibitor to prepare the ha solutions two commercially available ha powders denoted as ald ha sigma aldrich tokyo japan and wa ha wako chemicals tokyo japan were used these ha powders predominantly contain 10 100 kda size fractions which can be efficiently enriched by the adsorption elution method using an electronegative mf and are assumed to cause rt pcr inhibition hata et al 2015 suwanee river ha supplied by the international humic substances society is regarded as the reference ha chin et al 1994 chen et al 2003 kawasaki et al 2011 however this ha which contains less amount of the 10 100 kda size fraction has a negligible inhibitory effect on virus detection hata et al 2015 therefore the suwanee river ha was not used in this study the solutions were prepared by first dissolving 100 mg of each powder in 1 m naoh solution neutralized with hcl the solutions were then diluted with milli q water to be 200 mg l 2 3 preparation of dax 8 resin the hydrophobic resin dax 8 sigma aldrich was prepared in accordance with the process of thurman and malcolm 1981 with some modifications first dax 8 resin was mixed with 0 1 n naoh in a 1 l beaker and washed by stirring for 120 h 5 days with a magnetic stirrer after each 24 h the resin was separated from the liquids and mixed with fresh 0 1 n naoh the resin was then further sequentially rinsed for 24 h in a 1 l beaker with methanol diethyl ether acetonitrile and methanol by stirring for a total of 96 h 4 days with a magnetic stirrer following these rinsing processes the resin was stored in methanol at room temperature 2 4 virus concentration procedures three and fifteen environmental concentrates were collected from different sites in the coastal area of tokyo bay and ishinomaki bay respectively in japan the tokyo bay samples were collected from an estuarine region of the sumida river sample a and beach parks samples b and c from july 2011 to june 2012 the ishinomaki bay samples were collected from five sites including two sites located in an estuarine region of the kyukitakami river from december 2011 to march 2012 sample collection and concentration were conducted as described previously hata et al 2012 2017 briefly each sample 40 l was directly passed through a cartridge type electronegative membrane opticap xl 2 merck millipore on site using an aspirator the cartridge was then transported to the laboratory subsequently 2 0 l of 0 5 mm h2so4 ph 3 0 1 0 l of milli q water and 200 ml of 1 0 mm naoh ph 10 8 were successively passed through the cartridge the final naoh eluate was recovered as a primary concentrate into a tube containing 1 ml of 100 mm h2so4 for neutralization furthermore the volume of the primary concentrate was reduced using a centricon plus 70 centrifugal filter unit molecular weight cut off of 30 kda merck millipore according to the manufacturer s protocol to obtain approximately 1 ml of a secondary concentrate the concentrates from tokyo bay were used for comparing the efficacies of the sample purification methods using solutions spiked with pv whereas the concentrates from ishinomaki bay were used for the validation of the dax 8 gel treatment described below by quantifying the spiked mnv and indigenous viruses 2 5 sample purification procedures anion exchange resins gel filtration and a hydrophobic resin were used for the sample purification procedures these treatments were applied to the ha solutions spiked with pv and the environmental concentrates spiked with pv or mnv 2 5 1 sample purification using anion exchange resin two strong anion exchange resins ira 958 organo japan and ira 458 organo and a weak anion exchange resin xe 583 organo were used for sample purification these resins were washed in accordance with the procedure by humbert et al 2005 prior to use a certain amount of resin 140 μl and 560 μl for the strong and weak anion exchange resins respectively was mixed with 140 μl of a sample and incubated for 10 min at room temperature the water phase was recovered using ultrafree a centrifugal pvdf microfiltration unit 0 45 μm pore size millipore centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 1 min and then subjected to downstream rna extraction and rt qpcr 2 5 2 sample purification using gel filtration a centrifugal gel filtration unit microspin s 300 hr column ge healthcare was used for sample purification according to the manufacturer s instructions the resultant filtrate was subjected to downstream rna extraction and rt qpcr 2 5 3 sample purification using dax 8 resin a hydrophobic resin dax 8 organo was used after being rinsed as described in section 2 3 then 140 μl of the resin was dewatered using ultrafree and mixed with 140 μl of sample if necessary the ph of the sample was adjusted to 2 0 using 35 hcl before being mixed with the dax 8 resin the water phase was recovered using ultrafree centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 1 min as the dax 8 filtrate and was subjected to rna extraction and subsequent rt qpcr in order to recover viruses retained on the resin 560 μl of lysis buffer buffer avl provided with the qiaamp viral rna mini kit was mixed with the resin after passing through the sample by centrifuging at 8000 rpm for 1 min after 10 min of incubation at room temperature the lysis buffer was recovered using ultrafree as the dax 8 retentate and was subjected to rna extraction and subsequent rt qpcr 2 5 4 sample purification using dax 8 resin and gel filtration the dax 8 resin treatment followed by gel filtration was also tested in this study this procedure is schematically depicted in fig 1 at first a sample virus concentrate was subjected to dax 8 treatment without ph adjustment then the dax 8 filtrate 140 μl and the dax 8 retentate 560 μl were mixed and incubated for 10 min at room temperature following this incubation 560 μl of methanol was added to the mixture and passed through a spin column provided with the qiaamp viral rna mini kit the spin column was then washed and subjected to rna elution according to the manufacturer s instructions the obtained rna extract 60 μl was subjected to gel filtration as described in section 2 5 2 the recovered filtrate was further subjected to rt qpcr 2 6 rna extraction and rt qpcr quantification of viruses was conducted by rt qpcr briefly 140 μl of the sample was subjected to rna extraction using the qiaamp viral rna mini kit to obtain 60 μl of rna extract if necessary the rna extract was then diluted 10 fold with nuclease free water and both diluted and undiluted rna extracts were subjected to rt qpcr the rt reaction was conducted using the high capacity cdna reverse transcription kit life technologies tokyo japan according to the manufacturer s protocol taqman based qpcr was performed as described in our previous study hata et al 2011 primer pairs taqman probes and thermal cycling conditions for each viral target i e spiked pv and mnv indigenous genogroup i norovirus gi nov gii nov sapovirus sav enterovirus ev aichi virus i aiv genogroup ii f specific rna phage gii frnaph and giii frnaph were derived from previous studies katayama et al 2002 kageyama et al 2003 oka et al 2006 kitajima et al 2008 2013 wolf et al 2010 to obtain a calibration curve 10 fold serial dilutions with concentrations ranging from 1 0 101 to 1 0 106 gene copies per qpcr reaction of a plasmid dna containing the target sequence were amplified 2 7 statistical analysis a paired t test was performed with microsoft excel 2013 microsoft for comparing the efficacy of the dax 8 gel treatment with that of the sample dilution in terms of recovery of the spiked mnv and indigenous viruses in the environmental samples in this test log10 transformed observed concentrations of viruses were used if the resultant p value was lower than 0 05 the difference was considered statistically significant 3 results 3 1 efficacies of purification methods on ha solutions the recoveries of the spiked pv from the ha solutions subjected to sample purification procedures are summarized in table 1 in this study two types of ha solutions wa ha and ald ha were used to represent the environmental inhibitory substances the rna extract was diluted to mitigate the inhibitory effects and to observe virus loss during purification testing in the absence of the ha solutions was also conducted to observe virus loss during the purification however in cases where virus loss was considered to be either acceptably low or substantial 1 0 log10 or 1 0 log10 underestimation due to virus loss by tests without the dilution or in the absence of the ha solutions the sample dilution was not performed when the concentration of the ha solutions was 200 mg l the spiked pv 105 copies tube became negative after diluting the ha solutions 10 fold the spiked pv was still negative for wa ha while it became positive with substantial underestimation 3 9 log10 for ald ha the substantial underestimation occurred even after the sample dilution enabling the comparison of the efficacy of the sample purification procedures with that of the sample dilution by employing the two strong anion exchange resins ira 958 and ira 458 underestimations of pv in the 200 mg l ha solutions were mitigated but they were still around 2 0 log10 1 recovery diluting the ha solutions did not notably improve the pv quantification except for the 200 mg l of the wa ha treated with ira 958 indicating that the strong anion exchange resins removed both inhibitory substances and pv removal of the spiked pv by the resin can also be assumed as shown in the result obtained from a sample without the ha additionally when pv rna was treated with ira 958 in the absence of ha solutions it could not be detected the weak anion exchange resin xe 583 resulted in a poor improvement to pv quantification and in inefficient pv quantification even in the absence of ha this resin appeared to be ineffective for sample purification and therefore testing in the absence of ha was conducted only once n 1 gel filtration applied to the 200 mg l ha solutions improved pv quantification from 3 9 log10 to approximately 1 0 log10 underestimation even though its effect did not appear until the 10 fold sample dilution the efficacy of the dax 8 resin was examined under acidic ph 2 0 and neutral ph conditions for the tests conducted under acidic ph conditions the pv virion and its extracted rna were subjected to the treatment the test using pv virion showed no improvement to the quantification on the contrary the test using pv rna showed an acceptably low 0 3 log10 underestimation table 1 these results indicate that for dax 8 resin under low ph conditions both viruses and inhibitory substances in the ha solutions were efficiently excluded from the samples but rna can remain in the samples under neutral ph conditions without ha most of the pv was recovered from the dax 8 filtrate 0 3 log10 underestimation equivalent to 49 recovery and a small fraction was found from the dax 8 retentate 3 4 log10 underestimation equivalent to 0 040 recovery table 1 pv spiked in wa ha resulted in substantial underestimations 4 4 log10 and negative in dax 8 filtrate and dax 8 retentate respectively which were improved to be 0 1 log10 130 and 0 4 log10 40 respectively by the 10 fold dilutions pv spiked in ald ha was quantified with 1 4 log10 underestimation equivalent to 4 0 recovery from the dax 8 filtrate which was not improved by the sample dilution while it was quantified with high efficiency 0 2 log10 underestimation equivalent to 63 recovery from dax 8 retentate these results indicate that dax 8 resin retains some amount and most of the inhibitory substances in wa ha and ald ha respectively as supposed from the underestimation in the dax 8 retentate pv seems to be retained along with the inhibitory substances and the rna from the virus can be recovered by using the lysis buffer especially pv rna spiked into ald ha appeared to be separated from the inhibitory substances in the dax 8 retentate 3 2 efficacies of purification methods on environmental concentrates the performances of dax 8 resin ira 458 anion exchange resin and gel filtration were further evaluated using three environmental concentrates collected from tokyo bay samples a c fig 2 in these tests recoveries of the spiked pv from the dax 8 filtrate and retentate were evaluated also the dax 8 resin treatment coupled with gel filtration fig 1 which was denoted as dax 8 gel in fig 2 was validated among the three environmental concentrates samples a and b caused relatively moderate inhibitory effects they resulted in 3 1 and 3 9 log10 underestimations respectively of the spiked pv without dilution which became almost 0 log10 after 10 fold dilution in contrast sample c caused severe inhibitory effects which resulted in a negative for the spiked pv before and after the 10 fold dilution the dax 8 filtrate showed reasonably improved spiked pv quantifications which were underestimated by approximately 1 0 log10 against the moderately inhibitory samples however this effect was limited against the severely inhibitory sample the performance of dax 8 retentate was not better than that of dax 8 filtrate ira 458 showed ambiguous results it improved the quantification to almost 0 log10 underestimation against the severely inhibitory sample c but was not effective in improving the quantification against the moderately inhibitory samples a and b the sole use of gel filtration did not show notable improvement of the spiked pv quantification the dax 8 gel treatment fig 1 improved the spiked pv quantification from the moderately inhibitory samples to an acceptable level 1 0 log10 underestimation 0 7 and 0 9 log10 this treatment also improved the quantification of the severely inhibitory sample from negative 5 0 log10 underestimation to 1 8 log10 underestimation by diluting the severely inhibitory sample after the dax 8 gel treatment the quantification was further improved to be acceptable 0 9 log10 underestimation 3 3 application of the dax 8 gel treatment for detection of indigenous viruses efficacy of the dax 8 gel treatment was further investigated by quantifying indigenous viruses in another set of environmental concentrates these samples secondary concentrates were spiked with mnv as a molecular process control for evaluating the rna extraction rt qpcr efficiency without the dax 8 gel treatment or the sample dilution the spiked mnv was not detected 1 sample 4 0 log10 underestimation or detected with 1 0 log10 underestimation 3 2 1 1 log10 for 8 out of 15 samples fig 3 in contrast after applying the dax 8 gel treatment the spiked mnv was detected with 1 0 log10 underestimation 0 8 0 0 log10 for all 15 samples the spiked mnv detection was also conducted after 10 fold dilution of the rna extracts without dax 8 gel treatment and revealed a 1 0 log10 underestimation 0 9 0 1 log10 for 14 out of 15 samples the one remaining sample resulted in 1 0 log10 underestimation the underestimation of the spiked mnv following the application of the dax 8 gel treatment was not significantly different from that observed following the sample dilution paired t test p 0 06 the 15 samples were further subjected to quantification of seven types of indigenous viruses gi and gii nov sav ev aiv and gii and giii frnaph the quantifications have previously been conducted using the samples non diluted and 10 fold diluted rna extracts without the dax 8 gel treatment hata et al 2012 fig 4 and table s1 in the supplementary information among the 105 trials performed to quantify the seven types of viruses from the 15 non diluted rna extracts 34 switched from negative to positive after the dax 8 gel treatment fig 4a in two trials the quantifications of viruses improved by 1 0 log10 after the treatment no trial resulted in a 1 0 log10 reduction of the observed virus concentrations after the treatment however six trials switched from positive to negative after the treatment among these six trials four were those to quantify giii frnaph by diluting the rna extracts 18 trials switched from negative to positive whereas 28 switched from positive to negative when the dax 8 gel treatment results were compared with those of the sample dilution 27 trials were positive only after the dax 8 gel treatment whereas one trial was positive only after the sample dilution among the trials that were positive after both dilution and dax 8 gel treatments concentrations of indigenous viruses determined after the dax 8 gel treatment tended to be higher than those determined after the sample dilution however this difference was not statistically significant paired t test p 0 62 4 discussion to date many researchers have reported quantifications of viruses in water and food that are inaccurate because of inhibitory substances present in the samples haramoto et al 2018 several methods to reduce the inhibitory effect have been documented however these methods are not always effective kermekchiev et al 2009 schrader et al 2012 this might be owing to the lack of available information regarding the inhibitory substances that are retained in virus concentrates recently we successfully characterized some of these inhibitory substances based on their organic properties hata et al 2015 2017 these studies showed that the naturally occurring inhibitory substances that were retained throughout the electronegative mf and ultrafiltration virus concentration procedures were in the 10 100 kda size range and hydrophobic in addition inhibitory substances in ald ha and wa ha were found to supposedly be representatives of the naturally occurring ones these findings motivated us to investigate sample purification techniques to remove these inhibitory substances in ha solutions and environmental concentrates 4 1 efficacy of each sample purification method anion exchange resins onto which negatively charged substances adsorb have been applied to remove or separate organic acids such as ha imai et al 2001 bolto et al 2002 humbert et al 2005 cornelissen et al 2008 strong anion exchange resins are expected to adsorb organic acids more efficiently than weak anion exchange resins cornelissen et al 2008 in this study as expected the strong anion exchange resins greatly mitigated the inhibitory effects in ha solutions while the weak anion exchange resins did not show notable effects table 1 however the efficacy of this treatment on environmental concentrates was inconsistent it did not improve virus quantification for two samples but improved virus quantification from 5 log10 to 0 log10 underestimation for one sample fig 2 these results suggest that anion exchange resins are occasionally effective in purifying environmental concentrates as shown previously the inhibitory substances in the water environment vary hata et al 2017 some of them may adsorb on the resin while others may not tests conducted in the absence of inhibitory substances strongly suggested that viruses were also removed by the anion exchange resins under neutral ph conditions the surface charge of enteric viruses is supposed to be negative michen and graule 2010 and therefore viruses can be the target of the anion exchange resin the viral rna was removed entirely by the strong anion exchange resin table 1 and this was an expected result because nucleic acids are targeted by the resin dika et al 2011 demonstrated that viral rna could affect the viral charge thereby possibly affecting the interaction between the virus and resin these should be considered when an anion exchange resin is used for sample purification gel filtration is a technique used to exclude small substances from a sample in this study a gel column was selected to exclude 70 kda size particles 118 bp of dna the size of a virus particle is around 2000 kda ohlbaum et al 1970 thus this technique was expected to separate viruses from inhibitory substances whose sizes were around 30 kda the tests using ha solutions revealed that this technique can mitigate the inhibitory effects even though the samples were still inhibitive after the treatment table 1 nevertheless this technique did not show any notable improvements in virus quantification for environmental concentrates fig 2 these results indicate that the gel filtration is not sufficiently effective in samples containing high concentrations of inhibitory substances considering that the environmental concentrates were blackish with high viscosity it is also probable that these inhibitory substances were aggregated in the concentrate and became larger than the target size of the gel filtration treatment dax 8 resin is a hydrophobic resin onto which hydrophobic neutral and hydrophobic acid substances adsorb under any ph and acidic ph conditions respectively through hydrophobic interactions under acidic ph conditions inhibitory substances in wa ha and ald ha seem to be efficiently removed by the resin as expected however some of the viral particles in the ha solutions also seem to be removed one of the properties of ha is that it aggregates under acidic ph conditions ihss therefore it is possible that the viral particles were incorporated into the ha aggregate and retained on the resin in the absence of ha 49 of pv was recovered in the dax 8 filtrate this suggests that pv itself does not substantially adsorb onto the resin however the tests without ha were not performed in replicate since the degree of hydrophobicity varies depending on the type of virus van voorthuizen et al 2001 langlet et al 2008 dika et al 2015 some viruses may show high adsorption onto the dax 8 resin nevertheless as described below even if the virus adsorbs onto the resin viral rna can be recovered interestingly when the analyte was extracted viral rna spiked into the ha solution the viral rna could be recovered with an acceptably high recovery 0 3 log10 without inhibitory effects a similar result was obtained when a buffer for capsid lysis was passed through the resin after the virion in the ha solutions this suggests that the recovery of viral rna is possible even when the capsid has been adsorbed onto the dax 8 resin therefore application of the dax 8 treatment under acidic ph conditions is supposed to be highly effective for removing inhibitory substances without losing viral rna however our concern was that it would be difficult to adjust the sample ph to be optimal due to the alkalinity and small volume around 1 ml of the environmental concentrates 4 2 optimization of dax 8 gel treatment we further evaluated the interactions among ha virus or viral rna and dax 8 resin under neutral ph conditions most of the pv spiked into ald ha was recovered from the dax 8 retentate after capsid lysis without inhibitory effects on the contrary the pv spiked into wa ha was recovered both from the dax 8 filtrate and retentate with inhibitory effects these results imply that this interaction depends on the type of the inhibitory substance taken together the dax 8 treatment under neutral ph conditions seems to be effective in removing the inhibitory substances and recovering viruses or viral rna however in some settings by applying the lysis buffer inhibitory substances retained on the resin can be recovered along with viral rna ald ha and wa ha were used as the model solutions for the rt pcr inhibitor however environmental water is highly complex and contains a wide diversity of inhibitory substances hata et al 2017 therefore this purification method was further validated using environmental concentrates as we expected the application of the dax 8 treatment on environmental concentrates under neutral ph conditions showed ambiguous results fig 2 pv was efficiently recovered without inhibitory effects from both the filtrate and retentate sample a with and without inhibitory effects from the filtrate and retentate respectively sample b and with slightly mitigated inhibitory effects sample c the viscosities of the analytes after the treatment seemed to be low indicating that the inhibitory substances that had aggregated in the samples have been dispersed gel filtration was then supposed to be effective in removing the inhibitory substances the gel filtration following the dax 8 treatment efficiently mitigated the inhibitory effects with an acceptably low 1 0 log10 viral loss this treatment allowed us to detect the spiked pv from the highly inhibitive sample sample c even though it was still inhibitive to some extent 0 9 log10 underestimation after the treatment the tests depicted in fig 2 used only three environmental concentrates without replicate for further validation of the treatment various viruses including one spiked virus and seven indigenous viruses in the 15 environmental concentrates were targeted 4 3 validation of dax 8 gel treatment application of the dax 8 gel treatment to another set of environmental concentrates revealed its utility in recovering the molecular process control mnv and a variety of indigenous viruses figs 3 and 4 recovery of the molecular process control indicates that if the original concentrate is inhibitive 1 0 log10 underestimation of the control this treatment can improve the quantification none of the indigenous virus quantifications resulted in a 1 0 log10 reduction to the observed virus concentration indicating that viral loss caused by this treatment is not substantial however giii frnaph tended to switch to negative from positive when this treatment was applied this suggests that the virus recovery efficiency of the treatment depends on the type of virus the size and shape of giii frnaph around 20 nm in diameter icosahedral shape is similar to those of caliciviruses nov and sav and picornaviruses ev and aiv therefore giii frnaph was supposed to be recovered in a similar efficiency to other viruses in this study by gel filtration one possible explanation for this reduced recovery of giii frnaph by the dax 8 gel treatment is that in the samples giii frnaph was covered thoroughly with hydrophobic substances that preferentially adsorbed onto the dax 8 resin previous studies which determined viral reduction associated with the activated sludge process and viral adhesion onto solid surfaces suggested that giii frnaph can be characterized as a relatively adhesive virus even though its character is not substantially different from that of gii frnaph pelleïeux et al 2012 hata et al 2013 dika et al 2015 haramoto et al 2015 it is also known that the hydrophobicity of giii frnaph is not as high as that of gii frnaph langlet et al 2008 these previous studies suggest that giii frnaph is relatively adhesive on solid surfaces including the hydrophobic resin but some other viruses can be similarly adhesive thus the reason for the reduced recovery of giii frnaph by the dax 8 gel treatment remains unclear further investigation regarding the interactions among viruses organic substances and dax 8 resin is required sample dilution is the simplest method for mitigating the inhibitory effects and has been applied in several studies rajal et al 2007 lambertini et al 2008 gibson and schwab 2011 gibson et al 2012 varughese et al 2018 bortagaray et al 2019 however as has been pointed coudray et al 2013 this method dilutes the viral targets and can lead to false negative results in the present study false negative results were obtained after diluting environmental samples the dax 8 gel treatment was also suggested to reduce viruses in the sample however the dax 8 gel treatment showed a better positive rate than the sample dilution and only one trial was negative after the dax 8 gel treatment furthermore virus concentrations determined for both methods were comparable suggesting that the dax 8 gel treatment did not cause a substantial viral loss and was a better option for the detection of low concentrations of viruses in inhibitive samples compared with the 10 fold dilution however if the sample contained a sufficient number of viruses which allowed for a higher dilution factor the sample dilution method may have higher applicability than the dax 8 gel treatment therefore further validation of the dax 8 gel treatment against indigenous viruses in various water samples is warranted recently a spiked control like mnv used in this study has widely been used to see the significance of inhibitory effects on virus detection from environmental samples haramoto et al 2018 in this study we spiked the mnv virion prior to the dax 8 gel treatment then the control could work not only for showing the inhibitory effect but also for revealing the effects of the sample purification treatments such as the mitigation of inhibitory effects and potential loss of viruses by the treatment when an additional sample treatment is required a process control gains in importance underestimation of our spiked control occurs not only because of the rt pcr efficiency inhibition but also because of the rna extraction efficiency costafreda et al 2006 rajal et al 2007 hata et al 2011 shulman et al 2012 gentry shields and jaykus 2015 the rna extraction efficiency for the samples in this study ha solutions and environmental concentrates is supposed to be high and sufficient because the sample dilutions improved the virus detection efficiency to be an acceptable level the efficacy of the dax 8 gel treatment for improving the rna extraction efficiency is thus unknown in addition the efficacy of this treatment for dna viruses has not yet been evaluated all these aspects require evaluation in the future via comparison with the sample dilution in the present study electronegative membrane and ultrafiltration were used for concentrating viruses other virus concentration methods such as the electropositive membrane method glass wool method and peg precipitation can also lead to inhibitory effects ikner et al 2011 wyn jones et al 2011 rodríguez et al 2012 de keuckelaere et al 2013 it would be interesting to employ the dax 8 gel treatment to virus concentrates obtained by these methods even though the characteristics of the inhibitory substances retained in the concentrate probably depend on the virus concentration methods moreover the efficiency of the virus concentration process can substantially vary depending on water quality and methodology cashdollar and wymer 2013 petterson et al 2015 spiked controls to ascertain the virus recovery efficiency had been used in previous studies kundu et al 2013 hata et al 2014b prevost et al 2015 kazama et al 2017 however the present study did not use the control because the virus concentration process was conducted on site future investigations into relationships among the virus recovery efficiency water quality and virus concentration methods might be valuable for improving virus quantification in this study spiked pv was used for comparing the efficacy of the sample purification treatments on ha solutions and environmental concentrates while spiked mnv was used for validating the dax 8 gel treatment for environmental concentrates the former tests were simple spike tests and detection of indigenous viruses was out of the measurable scope therefore pv was used as a good representative of the enteric viruses in the tests the latter test aimed to quantify indigenous viruses and mnv was used as a molecular process control 5 conclusions in this study the efficacies of resin treatments and gel filtration on the mitigation of the inhibitory effects of the ha solutions and environmental concentrates were evaluated the anion exchange resin was occasionally effective in removing the inhibitory substances however it could also remove the virus and viral rna dax 8 resin was effective in recovering the virus and viral rna and in dispersing the inhibitory substances that formed aggregates in virus concentrates the dispersed inhibitory substances could be separated from viral rna using gel filtration a sequential treatment using the dax 8 resin and gel filtration was effective for various inhibitory samples by applying the sequential treatment to environmental concentrates quantifications of various types of indigenous viruses except for giii frnaph were improved to a satisfactory level the dax 8 gel treatment produced better results for samples containing low concentrations of rna viruses than the sample dilution the superiority of this method for high concentrations of viruses and dna viruses requires further investigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

18072,the sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation processes aops for the degradation of refractory organic pollutants consume a large amount of persulfate activators and often generate toxic

hydroxyl radicals oh to degrade over 95 of orange ii within 120 min both so4 and oh destructed orange ii through a sequence of electron transfer electrophilic addition and hydrogen abstraction reactions to generate several organic by products e g aromatic amines and phenol which were more toxic than the untreated orange ii the aop generated organic by products were further mineralized and detoxified in a sulfidogenic bioreactor with sewage treatment together in a 170 d trial the organic carbon removal efficiency was up to 90 the inhibition of the bioreactor effluents on the growth of chlorella pyrenoidosa became negligible due to the complete degradation and mineralization of toxic aop generated by products by aromatic degrading bacteria e g clostridium and dechloromonas and other bacteria the sulfidogenic process also well recovered the used fe0 fexoy particles through the reduction of surface feiii back into feii by hydrogen sulfide formed and iron reducing bacteria e g sulfurospirillum and paracoccus the regenerated fe0 fexoy particles had more reactive surface feii sites and exhibited much better reactivity in activating persulfate in at least 20 reuse cycles the findings demonstrate that the integrated process is a promising solution to the remediation of toxic and refractory organic pollutants because it reduces the chemical cost of persulfate activation and also completely detoxifies the toxic by products graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfate radicals advanced oxidation sulfate reducing bacteria iron reduction detoxification 1 introduction the advanced oxidation processes aops based on sulfate radicals so4 have been considered as an attractive solution to the degradation of refractory organic pollutants tsitonaki et al 2010 so4 has a high

activation of persulfate peroxymonosulfate is crucial to the so4 based aops iron based particles such as zero valent iron fe0 magnetite fe3o4 and iron sulfides feiis and feiis2 have been extensively used for persulfate peroxymonosulfate activation due to their promising features of easy separation from the treated water the low chemical costs and the environmentally friendly nature han et al 2015 teel et al 2011 xiong et al 2014 both feii and fe0 on the iron particle surface are capable of activating persulfate to generate so4 eqs 1 3 however the iron based particles can be passivated quickly after reactions with persulfate especially under alkaline conditions due to the formation of ferric feiii hydr oxide precipitates on the particle surface eq 4 which have low activity towards persulfate dong et al 2017 the regeneration and reuse of iron based particles are thus expected to further decrease their chemical costs and minimize the production of iron containing wastes 1 s 2 o 8

products during the degradation of organic pollutants the attack of organic pollutants by so4 and oh often partially destructs the organic pollutants but can t mineralize them completely lau et al 2007 olmez hanci et al 2013 the organic by products derived from the partial degradation of organic pollutants may be still toxic or even more toxic than the original pollutants qi et al 2014 sun et al 2019a for example the acute toxicity tests with photobacterium phosphoreum vibrio fischeri and vibrio qinghaiensis indicated the inhibitory effect increased by up to 100 when sulfamethoxazole was incompletely destructed by microwave activated persulfate qi et al 2014 olmez hanci et al 2013 also reported the increase in the acute toxicity during the degradation of bisphenol a by a hot persulfate process therefore further degradation and detoxification of toxic organic by products by additional treatment such as bio degradation process are often necessary sulfidogenic process driven by sulfate reducing bacteria srb which reduces sulfate to sulfide with the oxidation of organic carbon eq 5 could be a solution to regenerating the used iron particles and degrading the toxic organic

rusted and contained feii feiii oxides fexoy on the shell and fe0 in the core 2 the organic by products generated during aop were further degraded in a sulfidogenic process driven by srb which also simultaneously regenerated the used iron particles via the reduction of feiii hydr oxides on the particle surface back into feii by sulfide and organics 3 the regenerated iron particles which were magnetic were magnetically separated from the treated water and reused for the activation of persulfate in the aop in this study orange ii was selected as a model refractory organic pollutant because it widely occurs in industrial and domestic wastewater and resists to the bio degradation bakheet et al 2013 the degradation of orange ii by the so4 based aop mediated by the fe0 fexoy particles was evaluated and the used fe0 fexoy particles were regenerated in a sulfidogenic process driven by srb the further degradation and detoxification of organic by products generated from the so4 based aop in the sulfidogenic process were studied in addition the mechanisms of the iron particle regeneration degradation and detoxification of orange ii in this integrated process were also discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials all solutions were prepared by dissolving chemicals in deionized water 18 2 mω cm produced from a water purification system milli q element orange ii

detailed methods of sludge cultivation are presented in text s1 besides the chemical compositions of the nutrient stock solution and trace element solution for sludge cultivation are listed in table s2 2 3 degradation of orange ii by the integration of so4 based aop and sulfidogenic process experiments were conducted to evaluate the degradation of orange ii in the integrated process which consisted of so4 based aop mediated by the fe0 fexoy particles and a sulfidogenic process fig s1 the aop treatment of orange ii was conducted in a 1 l glass bottle at room temperature 27 c the initial concentrations of orange ii persulfate and fe0 fexoy particles were 0 2 mm 2 0 mm and 2 0 g l respectively the concentration of orange ii was in the range of the real industrial wastewater 30 200 mg l 0 085 0 57 mm bakheet et al 2013 mollah et al 2004 the dosages of persulfate and fe0 fexoy particles were selected from the results of preliminary tests to ensure the efficient degradation of orange ii and to minimize the persulfate residual after the reaction the test solution was thoroughly mixed using a blade stirrer at a rotating speed of 150 rpm to measure the concentrations of orange ii and total organic carbon toc solution samples were collected at the predetermined time intervals and sodium thiosulfate was spiked to quench persulfate anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 supplementary tests were also conducted in the presence of 1 0 m ethanol and tert butanol tba as radical scavengers to differentiate the contributions of oh and so4 to the degradation of orange ii to identify the formation of so4 and oh during the reactions of persulfate with fe0 fexoy particles 100 mm 5 5 dimethyl pyrroline n oxide dmpo solution was spiked into the reactor and the solution samples were collected and subjected to the analysis of electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra after 2 h aop treatment the treated solution and the used fe0 fexoy particles were collected and stored in a 5 l tank to further degrade the organic by products generated during the aop treatment and to regenerate the used fe0 fexoy particles the treated solutions with the used fe0 fexoy particles were transferred into a 2 5 l sequencing batch sulfidogenic bioreactor with the enriched srb sludge 2 53 g mlss l in addition to the aop treated solution the synthetic wastewater 85 120 mg c l was also added in the sulfidogenic bioreactor and the bioreactor was thoroughly mixed using a blade stirrer at a rotating speed of 150 rpm the synthetic wastewater was prepared to simulate the domestic sewage following the recipe of our previous studies table s2 sun et al 2018a wang et al 2018a the overall hydraulic retention time hrt was 48 h the operation of the sulfidogenic bioreactor was divided into two phases the detailed operational parameters including hrt the volume ratio of aop treated solution to synthetic sewage total influent toc concentration and sulfate concentration are listed in table s3 after each 48 h reaction the effluent samples were collected and subjected to the measurements of dissolved sulfide sulfate and toc and the regenerated fe0 fexoy particles were separated from the solutions using a neodymium magnet the regenerated fe0 fexoy particles were recycled and reused in the so4 based aop in the same manner as above supplementary batch tests at an initial toc concentration of 95 mg l and a sulfate concentration of 128 mg s l were performed to evaluate the kinetics of toc removal in the sulfidogenic process and the recovery of the persulfate reacted fe0 fexoy particles after different regeneration times 2 4 toxicity analysis the toxicity levels of untreated orange ii and its degradation by products were determined using c pyrenoidosa following the protocols of wang et al 2018b since c pyrenoidosa is an alga widely present in the fresh and marine waters shitanda et al 2005 the inhibition effect on the growth of c pyrenoidosa can well reflect the potential ecological risks of the treated wastewater after being discharged in natural waters the detail methods of sample pretreatment algae cultivation and toxicity tests are presented in text s2 in supplementary materials 2 5 microbial community analysis sludge samples were collected from the sulfidogenic bioreactor on 0 d and 100 d to evaluate the changes in the compositions of the microbial community using 16s rrna gene sequencing the dna extraction pcr amplification illumina miseq sequencing and data analysis followed the methods in our previous studies sun et al 2019c wang et al 2018a paired end sequencing was performed on an illumina hiseq 4000 platform illumina san diego ca usa at the bgi co ltd shenzhen china 2 6 analytical methods the solution samples were subjected to the analysis of orange ii persulfate toc sulfate and sulfide after being filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane millipore the analysis of orange ii was performed using a uv vis spectrophotometer rayleigh v 5600 shanghai china at a wavelength of 486 nm persulfate was determined by spectrophotometric determination with potassium iodide liang et al 2008 toc was analyzed using a toc analyzer shimadzu toc

blue method apha 2012 the concentrations of dissolved feii and feiii were measured with the phenanthroline method apha 2012 the solid feiii total fe and feii associated with sulfide acid volatile sulfide on the iron particles were determined after extraction via acidifying with 6 m hcl following the method of sun et al 2019c xps analysis was performed using an x ray photoelectron spectroscopy escalab 250xi thermo fisher scientific inc usa with al kα radiation 1486 6 ev all binding energies were referenced to the c 1s peak at 284 5 ev the xps peak fitting was performed using xpspeak version 4 1 xrd analysis was conducted using an x ray diffraction spectrometer ultima iv rigaku japan with cu kα radiation λ 1 5406 å over the 2θ range of 10 80 xrd patterns were compared to the joint committee on the power diffraction standards to identify the crystals the organic by products of orange ii degradation were analyzed using an ultra performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry uplc ms timstof pro bruker germany equipped with a thermo hypersil c18 column 100 mm 2 1 mm i d particle size 1 9 μm the eluent of acetonitrile with 0 1 formic acid solution was at a flow rate of 0 3

mean standard deviation of at least two duplicates the statistical analysis was conducted using one way analysis of variance on origin 8 0 software and the significance was determined at 95 confidence limits p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of orange ii by so4 based aop mediated by fe0 fexoy particles the degradation of orange ii by the so4 based aop mediated by fe0 fexoy particles was evaluated as shown in fig 1 a the degradation of orange ii by the fe0 fexoy persulfate system followed the pseudo first order kinetics and the observed rate constant was 0 057 min 1 meanwhile 95 of orange ii added was degraded within 120 min in addition the orange ii degradation by persulfate alone or fe0 fexoy particles alone within 120 min was negligible less than 2 the results suggest that the efficient degradation of orange ii by the fe0 fexoy persulfate system should be attributed to the oxidation by the radicals e g so4 an oh generated from the reactions of persulfate with feii on fe0 fexoy particles it is also worth noticing that the decrease in the toc concentrations during the orange ii degradation by the fe0 fexoy persulfate system was less pronounced compared to the decreases in the concentrations of orange ii fig 1b only 37 of toc was removed within 120 min the results indicate that the degradation of orange ii by radicals resulted in the formation of organic by products since the organic by products of orange ii degradation by so4 based aops are toxic even more toxic than the original orange ii chahbane et al 2007 li et al 2015 the further degradation and detoxification of these by products are still necessary 3 2 degradation of aop generated by products in the sulfidogenic process the further degradation of organic by products generated from the orange ii degradation in the fe0 fexoy persulfate system and the regeneration of the used fe0 fexoy particles in the sulfidogenic bioreactor were investigated in a 170 d trial it should be noticed that the samples treated by the fe0 fexoy persulfate system 26 30 mg c l and the used fe0 fexoy particles were mixed with synthetic sewage 85 120 mg c l to dilute the toxicity of aop treated products towards bacteria and increase the biodegradable organic substrate in the sulfidogenic bioreactor table s3 the volume ratios of aop treated solution to synthetic sewage in phases i and ii were 1 2 and 1 4 respectively fig 2 shows that the sulfide production in phase i fluctuated remarkably likely due to the toxicity of aop degradation products to bacteria when the volume ratios of aop treated solution to synthetic sewage was decreased to 1 4 in phase ii the stable sulfate reduction was observed which resulted in the formation of sulfide at 67 mg s l meanwhile the significant removal of toc was observed and around 90 of toc was removed the results demonstrate that the sulfidogenic process was capable of mineralizing the organic by products of orange ii degradation by the so4 based aop feiii on the used fe0 fexoy particles and sulfate generated from the aop process can serve as the electron acceptors and enhance the mineralization of organics in addition the sulfide generated in the sulfidogenic process could be used for the heavy metal precipitation and denitrification qiu et al 2020 sun et al 2018b 2019b wu et al 2016 more importantly the used fe0 fexoy particles can also be simultaneously regenerated in the sulfidogenic process feiii on the used fe0 fexoy particles may react with the formed sulfide to generate iron sulfide feiis and other feii compounds e g amorphous feii sun et al 2019c which are known to be good activators of persulfate yin et al 2018a in addition the microbial iron reduction which widely occurs under the organic rich conditions lovley 1997 may also contribute to the reduction of feiii back into feii compounds the transformations of fe0 fexoy particles in the sulfidogenic process will be discussed in section 3 6 it is worth noticing that the hrt of the sulfidogenic bioreactor can be shortened and optimized according to the results of a batch trial fig s2 after 24 h the toc concentration decreased to 38 mg c l about 98 mg cod l which was lower than the guideline value of the textile printing industries in china 100 mg cod l gb 4287 2012 in real practice the hrt can be further shortened if the initial concentration of orange ii is lower than the level in this study 0 2 mm 70 mg l in addition the domestic sewage which is often generated in factories and industrial parks sun et al 2018a can be mixed with the aop treated effluents and serve as the supplementary organic substrate in the sulfidogenic process an equalizing tank would be required to store the aop treated effluents because the quantity of the industrial wastewater containing orange ii is often low the aop treated effluents can be intermittently pumped into the bio reactor and mixed with domestic sewage till the quantity reaches a certain level therefore the co treatment of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater containing orange ii would thus be realized using the proposed process the photo enhanced fenton like process can be developed based on the fe0 fexoy persulfate system by introducing the uv light or solar light the light at wavelength 193 351 nm activates persulfate and enhances the formation of sulfate and hydroxyl radicals ismail et al 2017 although the photo enhanced fenton like process may not be applicable to the treatment of the industrial wastewater containing azo dyes which often has low light transmittance it is expected to be an attractive approach for the treatment of wastewater containing refractory pollutants and with high light transmittance 3 3 changes in the microbial community compositions the microbial community compositions in the sulfidogenic bioreactor on day 0 and day 100 were evaluated to reveal the changes in the microbial community compositions as shown in fig s3a the diversity of the microbial community was well represented by the sequencing depth of the sludge samples collected at the genus level obvious changes in the microbial community compositions were observed within 100 days fig s3b fig 3 shows that the relative abundances of three sulfate reducing genera desulfobacter desulfococus and desulfomicrobium increased by 12 720 hao et al 2014 which was well correlated with the enhanced sulfate reduction in the sulfidogenic bioreactor in phase ii meanwhile the relative abundances of three iron reducing genera sulfurospirillum paracoccus and geobacter increased significantly although that of one iron reducing genus clostridium decreased slightly lovley 1997 the growth in the iron reducing bacteria suggests the promoted microbial iron reduction which contributed to the regeneration of the used fe0 fexoy particles in addition the abundance of one fermentative genus dechloromonas increased from 0 to 2 3 the abundances of two fermentative genera macellibacteroides and propionivibrio also increased slightly clostridium is also capable of degrading aromatic compounds e g aromatic methyl ethers kasmi et al 1994 dechloromonas can degrade aromatic compounds e g xylene and dimethylbenzene through ring opening chakraborty et al 2005 saratale et al 2011 therefore these bacteria identified should be responsible for the degradation of toxic and refractory organic by products generated from the aop treatment 3 4 toxicity alteration the toxicity alteration of orange ii and its degradation by products indicated by the inhibition on the growth of c pyrenoidosa fig 4 a shows that the growth of c pyrenoidosa was inhibited by both untreated orange ii and the aop treated samples significantly p 0 05 but not affected by the effluents of the sulfidogenic bioreactor p 0 05 compared to the control the calculated inhibition rates of the three samples were 40 52 and 2 respectively fig 4b the results reinforce that the degradation of orange ii by the fe0 fexoy persulfate system generated more toxic organic by products than the original orange ii previous studies also reported that the so4 based aops partially degraded organic pollutants e g diclofenac phenol and sulfamethoxazole but increased the toxicity lu et al 2017 olmez hanci et al 2013 qi et al 2014 xia et al 2017 more importantly the sulfidogenic process efficiently destructed and detoxified these toxic by products therefore the integration of the fe0 fexoy persulfate system and the sulfidogenic process is a promising approach for the complete degradation and detoxification of toxic and refractory orange ii the mechanisms of orange ii degradation and detoxification will be discussed in section 3 7 3 5 reuse of fe0 fexoy particles the feasibility of regenerating and reusing the fe0 fexoy particles to activate persulfate for the degradation of orange ii was evaluated the observed rate constants of orange ii degradation in 21 use cycles were calculated and are shown in fig 5 when the fe0 fexoy particles were regenerated by the sulfidogenic process after each use cycle and continuously used in the fe0 fexoy persulfate system the rate constants were 24 55 higher in cycles 2 18 p 0 05 and still comparable after 21 use cycles p 0 05 compared to that in the first cycle the better reactivity of regenerated fe0 fexoy particles may be due to the formation of more reactive feii surface sites during the sulfidogenic process however the rate constants decreased sharply from 0 057 min 1 to less than 0 02 min 1 after 10 use cycles when the fe0 fexoy particles without regeneration were used the loss in reactivity was due to the consumption of reactive feii surface sites and the passivation of surface sites by the formed feiii hydr oxides eq 4 although the significant ph decrease from 7 to 4 induced by the decomposition of persulfate can partially reduce the precipitation of feiii fig s4 a large portion of feiii at ph above 4 was still in the form of feiii hydr oxides lofts et al 2008 the results demonstrate that the sulfidogenic process did not only mineralize and detoxify the toxic organic by products generated in the fe0 fexoy persulfate system but also recovered the reactivity of the used fe0 fexoy particles the good reusability of fe0 fexoy particles is expected to minimize the material cost of replacing persulfate activators and reduce the production of metal containing sludge which is a concern for the so4 based aop mediated by metal salts li et al 2014 it is worth noticing that the regeneration time significantly influenced the reactivity of the regenerated fe0 fexoy particles as shown in fig s5 the observed rate constants of the orange ii degradation mediated by the regenerated fe0 fexoy particles increased with increasing regeneration time from 6 h to 48 h after 24 h regeneration the rate constant for the fe0 fexoy particles 0 079 min 1 was about 40 higher than that for the virgin particles 0 057 min 1 therefore the regeneration time can be adjusted with the target of toc removal in the sulfidogenic process the good regeneration of the fe0 fexoy particles can be achieved with a shorter regeneration time e g 12 24 h 3 6 mechanisms of surface iron transformations and radical formation 3 6 1 transformations of surface iron compounds the persulfate activation by the fe0 fexoy particles and the regeneration of the used fe0 fexoy particles in the sulfidogenic process involved complex surface iron transformations the mechanisms were proposed in fig 6 the surface compositions of the fe0 fexoy particles were characterized using xps and xrd fig 7 a shows that two peaks at 709 8 and 711 2 ev were identified in the fe 2p3 2 orbital spectrum of the virgin fe0 fexoy particles indicating the presence of feiio and feiiiooh on the particle surface hawn and dekoven 1987 sun et al 2019c the xrd pattern further shows that these feii and feiii compounds were mainly in the amorphous form fig s6 after the reactions with persulfate the peak intensity of feiio decreased while that of feiiiooh increased correspondingly the ratio of feiio in total iron decreased from 16 1 to 9 5 fig 7b the changes were due to the oxidation of feiio into feiiiooh by persulfate eq 6 the fraction of feiii measured using the acid extraction method also exhibited a significant increase 10 fig s7 although the fe0 in the core may also be oxidized through electron transfer mediated by conductive iron oxides e g fe3o4 sun et al 2019c yin et al 2018b the indirect oxidation of the fe0 core should be limited within a reaction time of 120 min 6 f e ii o s 2 o 8 2 fe iii ooh during the regeneration of the used fe0 fexoy particles in the sulfidogenic process the remarkable iron reduction on the particle surface was observed as shown in fig 7a the peak intensity of feiio increased while that of feiiiooh decreased in addition one new peak at 710 4 ev was identified indicating the formation of feiis the ratio of feii feiio feiis was up to 46 7 which was much higher than that of the virgin particles fig 7b the changes in the fractions of feiii feii fe0 and feiis measured using the acid extraction method also confirm the reduction of feiii and the formation of and feiio and feiis fig s7 the formation of more reactive feii surface sites on the regenerated fe0 fexoy particles was responsible for their better performance in the persulfate activation during the reuse cycles fig 5 the reduction of surface feiii in the sulfidogenic process can be achieved through direct microbial iron reduction and indirect iron reduction mediated by hydrogen sulfide fig 6 in the bioreactor feiiiooh can be directly reduced by iron reducing bacteria irb clostridium sulfurospirillum paracoccus and geobacter which were identified in the sludge of the sulfidogenic bioreactor are known irb that are capable of reducing feiiiooh to feii using the organic by products from the orange ii degradation and supplementary substrate as electron donors eq 7 lovley and phillips 1987 sun et al 2019c in addition the reduction of feiiiooh can be reduced by hydrogen sulfide which was generated from the microbial reduction of sulfate using the organic by products from the orange ii degradation and supplementary substrate as electron donors eq 8 hydrogen sulfide reacted with feiiiooh via a sequence of reactions eq 9 11 which resulted in the formation of surface associated feii and feiis and elemental sulfur s0 poulton et al 2004 sun et al 2014 2019c 7 feooh organics irb f e ii o co 2 h 2 o 8 organic intermediates

virgin and regenerated fe0 fexoy particles radicals such as so4 and oh which can be generated from the reactions of feii compounds with persulfate yin et al 2018a 2018b should be the major contributors to the orange ii degradation in the fe0 fexoy persulfate system epr spin trapping analysis was performed to identify the radicals generated in the fe0 fexoy persulfate system after 10 20 and 30 min of reactions fig 8 a and fig 8b show that the distinct characteristic peaks of dmpo oh relative intensities of 1 2 2 1 spin adducts were observed during the reactions of persulfate with virgin and regenerated fe0 fexoy particles the signals of dmpo so4 were also identified in addition the intensities of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 increased remarkably from 10 min to 30 min suggesting the increasing generation of so4 and oh over time the results confirm that so4 and oh were efficiently produced from the reactions of persulfate with the surface feii i e feiio and feiis on the virgin and regenerated fe0 fexoy particles eq 12 15 in addition a portion of feii can be released into the solution phase and also activate persulfate eq 16 although the indirect oxidation of the fe0 core by persulfate may also produce so4 and oh yin et al 2018b the contribution should be limited within a reaction time of 120 min 12 f e ii o s 2 o 8 2 h 2 o so 4 fe iii ooh so 4 2 h 13 f e ii s 2 s 2 o 8 2

persulfate with the regenerated fe0 fexoy particles were higher than those during the reactions of persulfate with the virgin fe0 fexoy particles for example after 30 min of reaction the peak intensity at 3497 10 4 t for the regenerated iron particles was 8421 a u corresponding to the baseline which was about 80 higher than that for the virgin iron particles 4335 a u fig 8c the results suggest that regenerated fe0 fexoy particles were more efficient in the persulfate activation compared to the virgin ones this was due to the larger amount of reactive feii surface sites formed on the regenerated fe0 fexoy particles to reveal the contributions of so4 and oh to the orange ii degradation the degradation efficiencies were evaluated in the presence of ethanol and tba ethanol can quench both so4 and oh while tba selectively quenches oh alone buxton et al 1988 as shown in fig 9 ethanol and tba decreased the rate constants of the orange ii degradation in the fe0 fexoy persulfate system decreased by 92 and 51 respectively suggesting that the relative contributions of so4 and oh were 41 and 51 respectively similarly the determined contributions of so4 and oh in the aop mediated by the regenerated fe0 fexoy particles were calculated to be 36 and 56 respectively the results imply that both so4 and oh were important contributors to the degradation of orange ii 3 7 mechanisms of orange ii degradation and mineralization in the integrated process to elucidate the mechanisms of orange ii degradation and mineralization in the integrated process the organic by products generated in the aop and sulfidogenic process were analyzed using uplc ms after the aop treatment 11 organic intermediates products were identified table s4 while no organic intermediates products were detected in the effluents of the sulfidogenic bioreactor due to the complete mineralization based on the intermediates products identified using uplc ms and the rules of orange ii degradation by radicals and bacteria available in the literature cai et al 2014 thung et al 2018 zhou et al 2014 the pathways of the orange ii degradation and mineralization in the integrated process were proposed fig 10 in the fe0 fexoy persulfate system so4 and oh can attack orange ii and initiate the orange ii destruction generally so4 reacts with organic compounds mainly via selective electron transfer while oh reacts mainly through electrophilic addition and hydrogen abstraction anipsitakis et al 2006 zhao et al 2010 as shown in fig 10 the attack of orange ii by oh firstly destructed nn bond and resulted in the formation of 4 aminobenzenesulfonic acid a and 1 amino 2 naphthol b 4 aminobenzenesulfonic acid and 1 amino 2 naphthol can also be produced from the attack of the hydrozone form of orange ii by so4 cai et al 2014 meanwhile oh reacted with the hydrozone form of orange ii to produce 4 hydrazinebenzenesulfonic acid g and 2 naphthol konstantinou and albanis 2004 hammami et al 2008 it should be noted that 2 naphthol was not detected in this study because it is highly reductive and may be oxidized in the presence of oxygen cai et al 2014 4 aminobenzenesulfonic acid and 4 hydrazinebenzenesulfonic were converted to 4 phenolsulfonic acid c phenol d and benzoquinone e by so4 and oh through a sequence of electron transfer hydroxylation and hydrogen abstraction reactions anipsitakis et al 2006 cai et al 2014 the ring of benzoquinone was further destructed to form 3 ene 2 5 dino hexanedioic acid f in addition the attack of 2 naphthol and 1 amino 2 naphthol by so4 and oh led to the production of 1 2 naphthalenediol h and 3 hydroxy 1 4 naphthalenedione i which can be converted to phthalic anhydride j and benzoic acid k konstantinou and albanis 2004 yuan et al 2011 zhong et al 2011 most of the organic intermediates products generated in the fe0 fexoy persulfate system have been reported to have diverse toxicity 4 aminobenzenesulfanilic acid 1 amino 2 naphthhol and 4 hydrazinebenzenesulfonic acid are aromatic amines which are much more mutagenic and carcinogenic than their precursor azo dyes ekici et al 2001 khehra et al 2006 weisburger 2002 phenol is a well known cytotoxic compound and it is also toxic to bacteria alga and aquatic animals aruoja et al 2011 quint et al 1996 4 phenolsulfonic acid 4 hydrazinebenzenesulfonic acid 1 2 naphthalenediol and benzoic acid are found to present acute toxicity to mice nair 2001 the formation of these toxic organic by products was responsible for the higher toxicity of the aop treated samples than the untreated orange ii therefore the direct discharge of the aop treated water would cause adverse impacts on aquatic ecosystems and human health these toxic organic by products generated from aop were further degraded and mineralized in the sulfidogenic process fig 10 the destruction of the aromatic compounds was initiated by clostridium and dechloromonas which were detected in the sulfidogenic bioreactor after 100 d clostridium and dechloromonas are capable of destructing aromatic compounds e g xylene and dimethylbenzene through ring opening chakraborty et al 2005 kasmi et al 1994 saratale et al 2011 the ring opening products e

weight organics into co2 and h2o using sulfate and feiiiooh as the ultimate electron acceptors respectively hao et al 2014 liamleam and annachhatre 2007 lovley 1997 the degradation and mineralization in the sulfidogenic process can realize the complete detoxification of toxic organic by products generated in the fe0 fexoy persulfate system further investigation is needed to elucidate the detailed mechanisms of organic by product degradation in the sulfidogenic process 4 conclusions this study successfully developed a novel process integrating so4 based aop mediated by reusable fe0 fexoy particles and a sulfidogenic process to degrade and detoxify orange ii completely the fe0 fexoy particles recycled from a metal processing plant efficiently activated persulfate to produce so4 and oh to degrade orange ii the degradation followed the pseudo first order kinetics and over 95 of orange ii was removed within 120 min so4 and oh destructed orange ii through a sequence of electron transfer electrophilic addition and hydrogen abstraction reactions to generate several organic by products e g aromatic amines and phenol which were more toxic than orange ii the aop generated organic by products were further mineralized and detoxified in a sulfidogenic bioreactor in a 170 d trial the toc removal efficiency was up to 90 the results of toxicity tests using c pyrenoidosa show that the toxicity of the bioreactor effluents became negligible due to the complete degradation and mineralization of toxic aop generated by products by aromatic degrading bacteria e g clostridium and dechloromonas and fermentative bacteria srb and irb the sulfidogenic process also well regenerated the used fe0 fexoy particles through the reduction of surface feiii back into feii by hydrogen sulfide formed and iron reducing bacteria e g sulfurospirillum and paracoccus a larger amount of reactive surface feii sites was formed on regenerated fe0 fexoy particles and resulted in the better reactivity of the regenerated particles in activating persulfate in at least 20 reuse cycles compared to virgin particles therefore the integrated process can be a promising solution to the treatment of toxic and refractory organic pollutants such as dye wastewater it does not only reduce the chemical cost of persulfate activation through regenerating and reusing of fe0 fexoy particles but also eliminate the formation of toxic by products and the production of metal containing sludge declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

18072,the sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation processes aops for the degradation of refractory organic pollutants consume a large amount of persulfate activators and often generate toxic organic by products in this study we proposed a novel iron cycling process integrating so4 based aop mediated by reusable iron particles and a sulfidogenic process to degrade and detoxify orange ii completely the rusted waste iron particles fe0 fexoy which contained feii feiii oxides fexoy on the shell and zero valent iron fe0 in the core efficiently activated persulfate to produce so4 and hydroxyl radicals oh to degrade over 95 of orange ii within 120 min both so4 and oh destructed orange ii through a sequence of electron transfer electrophilic addition and hydrogen abstraction reactions to generate several organic by products e g aromatic amines and phenol which were more toxic than the untreated orange ii the aop generated organic by products were further mineralized and detoxified in a sulfidogenic bioreactor with sewage treatment together in a 170 d trial the organic carbon removal efficiency was up to 90 the inhibition of the bioreactor effluents on the growth of chlorella pyrenoidosa became negligible due to the complete degradation and mineralization of toxic aop generated by products by aromatic degrading bacteria e g clostridium and dechloromonas and other bacteria the sulfidogenic process also well recovered the used fe0 fexoy particles through the reduction of surface feiii back into feii by hydrogen sulfide formed and iron reducing bacteria e g sulfurospirillum and paracoccus the regenerated fe0 fexoy particles had more reactive surface feii sites and exhibited much better reactivity in activating persulfate in at least 20 reuse cycles the findings demonstrate that the integrated process is a promising solution to the remediation of toxic and refractory organic pollutants because it reduces the chemical cost of persulfate activation and also completely detoxifies the toxic by products graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfate radicals advanced oxidation sulfate reducing bacteria iron reduction detoxification 1 introduction the advanced oxidation processes aops based on sulfate radicals so4 have been considered as an attractive solution to the degradation of refractory organic pollutants tsitonaki et al 2010 so4 has a high redox potential of 2 5 3 1 v and it also reacts with water or hydroxyl ions to form hydroxyl radicals oh which is also a strong oxidant 1 9 2 7 v sun et al 2019a both so4 and oh are capable of destructing a number of refractory organic pollutants which are resistant to conventional water treatment processes such as chlorination and uv irradiation tsitonaki et al 2010 yuan et al 2013 compared to the widely used aops e g fenton process so4 based aops exhibit many advantages including the persistent feature of the precursor oxidants persulfate and peroxymonosulfate the versatile activating means the wide working ph range 2 10 and the stable performance in the presence of water components e g bicarbonate and natural organic matter fang and shang 2012 liang et al 2006 the activation of persulfate peroxymonosulfate is crucial to the so4 based aops iron based particles such as zero valent iron fe0 magnetite fe3o4 and iron sulfides feiis and feiis2 have been extensively used for persulfate peroxymonosulfate activation due to their promising features of easy separation from the treated water the low chemical costs and the environmentally friendly nature han et al 2015 teel et al 2011 xiong et al 2014 both feii and fe0 on the iron particle surface are capable of activating persulfate to generate so4 eqs 1 3 however the iron based particles can be passivated quickly after reactions with persulfate especially under alkaline conditions due to the formation of ferric feiii hydr oxide precipitates on the particle surface eq 4 which have low activity towards persulfate dong et al 2017 the regeneration and reuse of iron based particles are thus expected to further decrease their chemical costs and minimize the production of iron containing wastes 1 s 2 o 8

products during the degradation of organic pollutants the attack of organic pollutants by so4 and oh often partially destructs the organic pollutants but can t mineralize them completely lau et al 2007 olmez hanci et al 2013 the organic by products derived from the partial degradation of organic pollutants may be still toxic or even more toxic than the original pollutants qi et al 2014 sun et al 2019a for example the acute toxicity tests with photobacterium phosphoreum vibrio fischeri and vibrio qinghaiensis indicated the inhibitory effect increased by up to 100 when sulfamethoxazole was incompletely destructed by microwave activated persulfate qi et al 2014 olmez hanci et al 2013 also reported the increase in the acute toxicity during the degradation of bisphenol a by a hot persulfate process therefore further degradation and detoxification of toxic organic by products by additional treatment such as bio degradation process are often necessary sulfidogenic process driven by sulfate reducing bacteria srb which reduces sulfate to sulfide with the oxidation of organic carbon eq 5 could be a solution to regenerating the used iron particles and degrading the toxic organic by products produced from the so4 based aops simultaneously the feiii hydr oxides on the iron particles after reacting with persulfate can be reduced by sulfide from the sulfate reduction to form feii compounds feii oxide and feiis sun et al 2019c meanwhile some srb e g desulfobacter and desulfobulbus are also able to reduce feiii hydr oxides using organics as electron donors lovley 1997 in addition many srb e g desulfotomaculum and other anaerobes e g clostridium and dechloromonas have been reported to degrade toxic aromatic compounds such as benzene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons firmino et al 2015 kumar et al 2009 laban et al 2009 5 so 4 2 ch 3 cooh hs 2 co 2 oh h 2 o we thus proposed a novel process that integrated so4 based aop mediated by iron particles and a sulfidogenic process to degrade and detoxify refractory organic pollutants this integrated process included three key steps 1 persulfate was activated by waste iron particles to generate so4 for the degradation of pollutants the waste iron particles which can be easily recycled from the household wastes e g disposable heat pads and also metal processing plants sun et al 2019c yin et al 2018b were partially rusted and contained feii feiii oxides fexoy on the shell and fe0 in the core 2 the organic by products generated during aop were further degraded in a sulfidogenic process driven by srb which also simultaneously regenerated the used iron particles via the reduction of feiii hydr oxides on the particle surface back into feii by sulfide and organics 3 the regenerated iron particles which were magnetic were magnetically separated from the treated water and reused for the activation of persulfate in the aop in this study orange ii was selected as a model refractory organic pollutant because it widely occurs in industrial and domestic wastewater and resists to the bio degradation bakheet et al 2013 the degradation of orange ii by the so4 based aop mediated by the fe0 fexoy particles was evaluated and the used fe0 fexoy particles were regenerated in a sulfidogenic process driven by srb the further degradation and detoxification of organic by products generated from the so4 based aop in the sulfidogenic process were studied in addition the mechanisms of the iron particle regeneration degradation and detoxification of orange ii in this integrated process were also discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials all solutions were prepared by dissolving chemicals in deionized water 18 2 mω cm produced from a water purification system milli q element orange ii and sodium persulfate of reagent grade were purchased from aladdin shanghai china waste iron particles fe0 fexoy which were partially rusted were obtained from a metal processing plant in china the physical and chemical characteristics of the fe0 fexoy particles are presented in table s1 in supplementary materials chlorella pyrenoidosa strain fachb 9 which was parent cultures of the algae was obtained from the freshwater algae culture collection at the institute of hydrobiology wuhan china 2 2 cultivation of sulfate reducing sludge to obtain the sulfate reducing sludge a seeding sludge with a high abundance of srb wang et al 2011 was collected from the sha tin sewage treatment works in hong kong hong kong china 22 n 114 e and cultivated in a sealed sequencing batch reactor 2 l the detailed methods of sludge cultivation are presented in text s1 besides the chemical compositions of the nutrient stock solution and trace element solution for sludge cultivation are listed in table s2 2 3 degradation of orange ii by the integration of so4 based aop and sulfidogenic process experiments were conducted to evaluate the degradation of orange ii in the integrated process which consisted of so4 based aop mediated by the fe0 fexoy particles and a sulfidogenic process fig s1 the aop treatment of orange ii was conducted in a 1 l glass bottle at room temperature 27 c the initial concentrations of orange ii persulfate and fe0 fexoy particles were 0 2 mm 2 0 mm and 2 0 g l respectively the concentration of orange ii was in the range of the real industrial wastewater 30 200 mg l 0 085 0 57 mm bakheet et al 2013 mollah et al 2004 the dosages of persulfate and fe0 fexoy particles were selected from the results of preliminary tests to ensure the efficient degradation of orange ii and to minimize the persulfate residual after the reaction the test solution was thoroughly mixed using a blade stirrer at a rotating speed of 150 rpm to measure the concentrations of orange ii and total organic carbon toc solution samples were collected at the predetermined time intervals and sodium thiosulfate was spiked to quench persulfate anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 supplementary tests were also conducted in the presence of 1 0 m ethanol and tert butanol tba as radical scavengers to differentiate the contributions of oh and so4 to the degradation of orange ii to identify the formation of so4 and oh during the reactions of persulfate with fe0 fexoy particles 100 mm 5 5 dimethyl pyrroline n oxide dmpo solution was spiked into the reactor and the solution samples were collected and subjected to the analysis of electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra after 2 h aop treatment the treated solution and the used fe0 fexoy particles were collected and stored in a 5 l tank to further degrade the organic by products generated during the aop treatment and to regenerate the used fe0 fexoy particles the treated solutions with the used fe0 fexoy particles were transferred into a 2 5 l sequencing batch sulfidogenic bioreactor with the enriched srb sludge 2 53 g mlss l in addition to the aop treated solution the synthetic wastewater 85 120 mg c l was also added in the sulfidogenic bioreactor and the bioreactor was thoroughly mixed using a blade stirrer at a rotating speed of 150 rpm the synthetic wastewater was prepared to simulate the domestic sewage following the recipe of our previous studies table s2 sun et al 2018a wang et al 2018a the overall hydraulic retention time hrt was 48 h the operation of the sulfidogenic bioreactor was divided into two phases the detailed operational parameters including hrt the volume ratio of aop treated solution to synthetic sewage total influent toc concentration and sulfate concentration are listed in table s3 after each 48 h reaction the effluent samples were collected and subjected to the measurements of dissolved sulfide sulfate and toc and the regenerated fe0 fexoy particles were separated from the solutions using a neodymium magnet the regenerated fe0 fexoy particles were recycled and reused in the so4 based aop in the same manner as above supplementary batch tests at an initial toc concentration of 95 mg l and a sulfate concentration of 128 mg s l were performed to evaluate the kinetics of toc removal in the sulfidogenic process and the recovery of the persulfate reacted fe0 fexoy particles after different regeneration times 2 4 toxicity analysis the toxicity levels of untreated orange ii and its degradation by products were determined using c pyrenoidosa following the protocols of wang et al 2018b since c pyrenoidosa is an alga widely present in the fresh and marine waters shitanda et al 2005 the inhibition effect on the growth of c pyrenoidosa can well reflect the potential ecological risks of the treated wastewater after being discharged in natural waters the detail methods of sample pretreatment algae cultivation and toxicity tests are presented in text s2 in supplementary materials 2 5 microbial community analysis sludge samples were collected from the sulfidogenic bioreactor on 0 d and 100 d to evaluate the changes in the compositions of the microbial community using 16s rrna gene sequencing the dna extraction pcr amplification illumina miseq sequencing and data analysis followed the methods in our previous studies sun et al 2019c wang et al 2018a paired end sequencing was performed on an illumina hiseq 4000 platform illumina san diego ca usa at the bgi co ltd shenzhen china 2 6 analytical methods the solution samples were subjected to the analysis of orange ii persulfate toc sulfate and sulfide after being filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane millipore the analysis of orange ii was performed using a uv vis spectrophotometer rayleigh v 5600 shanghai china at a wavelength of 486 nm persulfate was determined by spectrophotometric determination with potassium iodide liang et al 2008 toc was analyzed using a toc analyzer shimadzu toc 5000a sulfate was quantified using an ion chromatograph 900 dionex usa equipped with a conductivity detector and an ionpac as9 hc analytical column dissolved sulfide was determined by the methylene blue method apha 2012 the concentrations of dissolved feii and feiii were measured with the phenanthroline method apha 2012 the solid feiii total fe and feii associated with sulfide acid volatile sulfide on the iron particles were determined after extraction via acidifying with 6 m hcl following the method of sun et al 2019c xps analysis was performed using an x ray photoelectron spectroscopy escalab 250xi thermo fisher scientific inc usa with al kα radiation 1486 6 ev all binding energies were referenced to the c 1s peak at 284 5 ev the xps peak fitting was performed using xpspeak version 4 1 xrd analysis was conducted using an x ray diffraction spectrometer ultima iv rigaku japan with cu kα radiation λ 1 5406 å over the 2θ range of 10 80 xrd patterns were compared to the joint committee on the power diffraction standards to identify the crystals the organic by products of orange ii degradation were analyzed using an ultra performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry uplc ms timstof pro bruker germany equipped with a thermo hypersil c18 column 100 mm 2 1 mm i d particle size 1 9 μm the eluent of acetonitrile with 0 1 formic acid solution was at a flow rate of 0 3

modes using full scans m z 50 400 for mass spectra acquisition epr spectra were recorded on a bruker a300 spectrometer germany 2 7 statistical analysis the experimental results were expressed as the mean standard deviation of at least two duplicates the statistical analysis was conducted using one way analysis of variance on origin 8 0 software and the significance was determined at 95 confidence limits p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of orange ii by so4 based aop mediated by fe0 fexoy particles the degradation of orange ii by the so4 based aop mediated by fe0 fexoy particles was evaluated as shown in fig 1 a the degradation of orange ii by the fe0 fexoy persulfate system followed the pseudo first order kinetics and the observed rate constant was 0 057 min 1 meanwhile 95 of orange ii added was degraded within 120 min in addition the orange ii degradation by persulfate alone or fe0 fexoy particles alone within 120 min was negligible less than 2 the results suggest that the efficient degradation of orange ii by the fe0 fexoy persulfate system should be attributed to the oxidation by the radicals e g so4 an oh generated from the reactions of persulfate with feii on fe0 fexoy particles it is also worth noticing that the decrease in the toc concentrations during the orange ii degradation by the fe0 fexoy persulfate system was less pronounced compared to the decreases in the concentrations of orange ii fig 1b only 37 of toc was removed within 120 min the results indicate that the degradation of orange ii by radicals resulted in the formation of organic by products since the organic by products of orange ii degradation by so4 based aops are toxic even more toxic than the original orange ii chahbane et al 2007 li et al 2015 the further degradation and detoxification of these by products are still necessary 3 2 degradation of aop generated by products in the sulfidogenic process the further degradation of organic by products generated from the orange ii degradation in the fe0 fexoy persulfate system and the regeneration of the used fe0 fexoy particles in the sulfidogenic bioreactor were investigated in a 170 d trial it should be noticed that the samples treated by the fe0 fexoy persulfate system 26 30 mg c l and the used fe0 fexoy particles were mixed with synthetic sewage 85 120 mg c l to dilute the toxicity of aop treated products towards bacteria and increase the biodegradable organic substrate in the sulfidogenic bioreactor table s3 the volume ratios of aop treated solution to synthetic sewage in phases i and ii were 1 2 and 1 4 respectively fig 2 shows that the sulfide production in phase i fluctuated remarkably likely due to the toxicity of aop degradation products to bacteria when the volume ratios of aop treated solution to synthetic sewage was decreased to 1 4 in phase ii the stable sulfate reduction was observed which resulted in the formation of sulfide at 67 mg s l meanwhile the significant removal of toc was observed and around 90 of toc was removed the results demonstrate that the sulfidogenic process was capable of mineralizing the organic by products of orange ii degradation by the so4 based aop feiii on the used fe0 fexoy particles and sulfate generated from the aop process can serve as the electron acceptors and enhance the mineralization of organics in addition the sulfide generated in the sulfidogenic process could be used for the heavy metal precipitation and denitrification qiu et al 2020 sun et al 2018b 2019b wu et al 2016 more importantly the used fe0 fexoy particles can also be simultaneously regenerated in the sulfidogenic process feiii on the used fe0 fexoy particles may react with the formed sulfide to generate iron sulfide feiis and other feii compounds e g amorphous feii sun et al 2019c which are known to be good activators of persulfate yin et al 2018a in addition the microbial iron reduction which widely occurs under the organic rich conditions lovley 1997 may also contribute to the reduction of feiii back into feii compounds the transformations of fe0 fexoy particles in the sulfidogenic process will be discussed in section 3 6 it is worth noticing that the hrt of the sulfidogenic bioreactor can be shortened and optimized according to the results of a batch trial fig s2 after 24 h the toc concentration decreased to 38 mg c l about 98 mg cod l which was lower than the guideline value of the textile printing industries in china 100 mg cod l gb 4287 2012 in real practice the hrt can be further shortened if the initial concentration of orange ii is lower than the level in this study 0 2 mm 70 mg l in addition the domestic sewage which is often generated in factories and industrial parks sun et al 2018a can be mixed with the aop treated effluents and serve as the supplementary organic substrate in the sulfidogenic process an equalizing tank would be required to store the aop treated effluents because the quantity of the industrial wastewater containing orange ii is often low the aop treated effluents can be intermittently pumped into the bio reactor and mixed with domestic sewage till the quantity reaches a certain level therefore the co treatment of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater containing orange ii would thus be realized using the proposed process the photo enhanced fenton like process can be developed based on the fe0 fexoy persulfate system by introducing the uv light or solar light the light at wavelength 193 351 nm activates persulfate and enhances the formation of sulfate and hydroxyl radicals ismail et al 2017 although the photo enhanced fenton like process may not be applicable to the treatment of the industrial wastewater containing azo dyes which often has low light transmittance it is expected to be an attractive approach for the treatment of wastewater containing refractory pollutants and with high light transmittance 3 3 changes in the microbial community compositions the microbial community compositions in the sulfidogenic bioreactor on day 0 and day 100 were evaluated to reveal the changes in the microbial community compositions as shown in fig s3a the diversity of the microbial community was well represented by the sequencing depth of the sludge samples collected at the genus level obvious changes in the microbial community compositions were observed within 100 days fig s3b fig 3 shows that the relative abundances of three sulfate reducing genera desulfobacter desulfococus and desulfomicrobium increased by 12 720 hao et al 2014 which was well correlated with the enhanced sulfate reduction in the sulfidogenic bioreactor in phase ii meanwhile the relative abundances of three iron reducing genera sulfurospirillum paracoccus and geobacter increased significantly although that of one iron reducing genus clostridium decreased slightly lovley 1997 the growth in the iron reducing bacteria suggests the promoted microbial iron reduction which contributed to the regeneration of the used fe0 fexoy particles in addition the abundance of one fermentative genus dechloromonas increased from 0 to 2 3 the abundances of two fermentative genera macellibacteroides and propionivibrio also increased slightly clostridium is also capable of degrading aromatic compounds e g aromatic methyl ethers kasmi et al 1994 dechloromonas can degrade aromatic compounds e g xylene and dimethylbenzene through ring opening chakraborty et al 2005 saratale et al 2011 therefore these bacteria identified should be responsible for the degradation of toxic and refractory organic by products generated from the aop treatment 3 4 toxicity alteration the toxicity alteration of orange ii and its degradation by products indicated by the inhibition on the growth of c pyrenoidosa fig 4 a shows that the growth of c pyrenoidosa was inhibited by both untreated orange ii and the aop treated samples significantly p 0 05 but not affected by the effluents of the sulfidogenic bioreactor p 0 05 compared to the control the calculated inhibition rates of the three samples were 40 52 and 2 respectively fig 4b the results reinforce that the degradation of orange ii by the fe0 fexoy persulfate system generated more toxic organic by products than the original orange ii previous studies also reported that the so4 based aops partially degraded organic pollutants e g diclofenac phenol and sulfamethoxazole but increased the toxicity lu et al 2017 olmez hanci et al 2013 qi et al 2014 xia et al 2017 more importantly the sulfidogenic process efficiently destructed and detoxified these toxic by products therefore the integration of the fe0 fexoy persulfate system and the sulfidogenic process is a promising approach for the complete degradation and detoxification of toxic and refractory orange ii the mechanisms of orange ii degradation and detoxification will be discussed in section 3 7 3 5 reuse of fe0 fexoy particles the feasibility of regenerating and reusing the fe0 fexoy particles to activate persulfate for the degradation of orange ii was evaluated the observed rate constants of orange ii degradation in 21 use cycles were calculated and are shown in fig 5 when the fe0 fexoy particles were regenerated by the sulfidogenic process after each use cycle and continuously used in the fe0 fexoy persulfate system the rate constants were 24 55 higher in cycles 2 18 p 0 05 and still comparable after 21 use cycles p 0 05 compared to that in the first cycle the better reactivity of regenerated fe0 fexoy particles may be due to the formation of more reactive feii surface sites during the sulfidogenic process however the rate constants decreased sharply from 0 057 min 1 to less than 0 02 min 1 after 10 use cycles when the fe0 fexoy particles without regeneration were used the loss in reactivity was due to the consumption of reactive feii surface sites and the passivation of surface sites by the formed feiii hydr oxides eq 4 although the significant ph decrease from 7 to 4 induced by the decomposition of persulfate can partially reduce the precipitation of feiii fig s4 a large portion of feiii at ph above 4 was still in the form of feiii hydr oxides lofts et al 2008 the results demonstrate that the sulfidogenic process did not only mineralize and detoxify the toxic organic by products generated in the fe0 fexoy persulfate system but also recovered the reactivity of the used fe0 fexoy particles the good reusability of fe0 fexoy particles is expected to minimize the material cost of replacing persulfate activators and reduce the production of metal containing sludge which is a concern for the so4 based aop mediated by metal salts li et al 2014 it is worth noticing that the regeneration time significantly influenced the reactivity of the regenerated fe0 fexoy particles as shown in fig s5 the observed rate constants of the orange ii degradation mediated by the regenerated fe0 fexoy particles increased with increasing regeneration time from 6 h to 48 h after 24 h regeneration the rate constant for the fe0 fexoy particles 0 079 min 1 was about 40 higher than that for the virgin particles 0 057 min 1 therefore the regeneration time can be adjusted with the target of toc removal in the sulfidogenic process the good regeneration of the fe0 fexoy particles can be achieved with a shorter regeneration time e g 12 24 h 3 6 mechanisms of surface iron transformations and radical formation 3 6 1 transformations of surface iron compounds the persulfate activation by the fe0 fexoy particles and the regeneration of the used fe0 fexoy particles in the sulfidogenic process involved complex surface iron transformations the mechanisms were proposed in fig 6 the surface compositions of the fe0 fexoy particles were characterized using xps and xrd fig 7 a shows that two peaks at 709 8 and 711 2 ev were identified in the fe 2p3 2 orbital spectrum of the virgin fe0 fexoy particles indicating the presence of feiio and feiiiooh on the particle surface hawn and dekoven 1987 sun et al 2019c the xrd pattern further shows that these feii and feiii compounds were mainly in the amorphous form fig s6 after the reactions with persulfate the peak intensity of feiio decreased while that of feiiiooh increased correspondingly the ratio of feiio in total iron decreased from 16 1 to 9 5 fig 7b the changes were due to the oxidation of feiio into feiiiooh by persulfate eq 6 the fraction of feiii measured using the acid extraction method also exhibited a significant increase 10 fig s7 although the fe0 in the core may also be oxidized through electron transfer mediated by conductive iron oxides e g fe3o4 sun et al 2019c yin et al 2018b the indirect oxidation of the fe0 core should be limited within a reaction time of 120 min 6 f e ii o s 2 o 8 2 fe iii ooh during the regeneration of the used fe0 fexoy particles in the sulfidogenic process the remarkable iron reduction on the particle surface was observed as shown in fig 7a the peak intensity of feiio increased while that of feiiiooh decreased in addition one new peak at 710 4 ev was identified indicating the formation of feiis the ratio of feii feiio feiis was up to 46 7 which was much higher than that of the virgin particles fig 7b the changes in the fractions of feiii feii fe0 and feiis measured using the acid extraction method also confirm the reduction of feiii and the formation of and feiio and feiis fig s7 the formation of more reactive feii surface sites on the regenerated fe0 fexoy particles was responsible for their better performance in the persulfate activation during the reuse cycles fig 5 the reduction of surface feiii in the sulfidogenic process can be achieved through direct microbial iron reduction and indirect iron reduction mediated by hydrogen sulfide fig 6 in the bioreactor feiiiooh can be directly reduced by iron reducing bacteria irb clostridium sulfurospirillum paracoccus and geobacter which were identified in the sludge of the sulfidogenic bioreactor are known irb that are capable of reducing feiiiooh to feii using the organic by products from the orange ii degradation and supplementary substrate as electron donors eq 7 lovley and phillips 1987 sun et al 2019c in addition the reduction of feiiiooh can be reduced by hydrogen sulfide which was generated from the microbial reduction of sulfate using the organic by products from the orange ii degradation and supplementary substrate as electron donors eq 8 hydrogen sulfide reacted with feiiiooh via a sequence of reactions eq 9 11 which resulted in the formation of surface associated feii and feiis and elemental sulfur s0 poulton et al 2004 sun et al 2014 2019c 7 feooh organics irb f e ii o co 2 h 2 o 8 organic intermediates

virgin and regenerated fe0 fexoy particles radicals such as so4 and oh which can be generated from the reactions of feii compounds with persulfate yin et al 2018a 2018b should be the major contributors to the orange ii degradation in the fe0 fexoy persulfate system epr spin trapping analysis was performed to identify the radicals generated in the fe0 fexoy persulfate system after 10 20 and 30 min of reactions fig 8 a and fig 8b show that the distinct characteristic peaks of dmpo oh relative intensities of 1 2 2 1 spin adducts were observed during the reactions of persulfate with virgin and regenerated fe0 fexoy particles the signals of dmpo so4 were also identified in addition the intensities of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 increased remarkably from 10 min to 30 min suggesting the increasing generation of so4 and oh over time the results confirm that so4 and oh were efficiently produced from the reactions of persulfate with the surface feii i e feiio and feiis on the virgin and regenerated fe0 fexoy particles eq 12 15 in addition a portion of feii can be released into the solution phase and also activate persulfate eq 16 although the indirect oxidation of the fe0 core by persulfate may also produce so4 and oh yin et al 2018b the contribution should be limited within a reaction time of 120 min 12 f e ii o s 2 o 8 2 h 2 o so 4 fe iii ooh so 4 2 h 13 f e ii s 2 s 2 o 8 2

persulfate with the regenerated fe0 fexoy particles were higher than those during the reactions of persulfate with the virgin fe0 fexoy particles for example after 30 min of reaction the peak intensity at 3497 10 4 t for the regenerated iron particles was 8421 a u corresponding to the baseline which was about 80 higher than that for the virgin iron particles 4335 a u fig 8c the results suggest that regenerated fe0 fexoy particles were more efficient in the persulfate activation compared to the virgin ones this was due to the larger amount of reactive feii surface sites formed on the regenerated fe0 fexoy particles to reveal the contributions of so4 and oh to the orange ii degradation the degradation efficiencies were evaluated in the presence of ethanol and tba ethanol can quench both so4 and oh while tba selectively quenches oh alone buxton et al 1988 as shown in fig 9 ethanol and tba decreased the rate constants of the orange ii degradation in the fe0 fexoy persulfate system decreased by 92 and 51 respectively suggesting that the relative contributions of so4 and oh were 41 and 51 respectively similarly the determined contributions of so4 and oh in the aop mediated by the regenerated fe0 fexoy particles were calculated to be 36 and 56 respectively the results imply that both so4 and oh were important contributors to the degradation of orange ii 3 7 mechanisms of orange ii degradation and mineralization in the integrated process to elucidate the mechanisms of orange ii degradation and mineralization in the integrated process the organic by products generated in the aop and sulfidogenic process were analyzed using uplc ms after the aop treatment 11 organic intermediates products were identified table s4 while no organic intermediates products were detected in the effluents of the sulfidogenic bioreactor due to the complete mineralization based on the intermediates products identified using uplc ms and the rules of orange ii degradation by radicals and bacteria available in the literature cai et al 2014 thung et al 2018 zhou et al 2014 the pathways of the orange ii degradation and mineralization in the integrated process were proposed fig 10 in the fe0 fexoy persulfate system so4 and oh can attack orange ii and initiate the orange ii destruction generally so4 reacts with organic compounds mainly via selective electron transfer while oh reacts mainly through electrophilic addition and hydrogen abstraction anipsitakis et al 2006 zhao et al 2010 as shown in fig 10 the attack of orange ii by oh firstly destructed nn bond and resulted in the formation of 4 aminobenzenesulfonic acid a and 1 amino 2 naphthol b 4 aminobenzenesulfonic acid and 1 amino 2 naphthol can also be produced from the attack of the hydrozone form of orange ii by so4 cai et al 2014 meanwhile oh reacted with the hydrozone form of orange ii to produce 4 hydrazinebenzenesulfonic acid g and 2 naphthol konstantinou and albanis 2004 hammami et al 2008 it should be noted that 2 naphthol was not detected in this study because it is highly reductive and may be oxidized in the presence of oxygen cai et al 2014 4 aminobenzenesulfonic acid and 4 hydrazinebenzenesulfonic were converted to 4 phenolsulfonic acid c phenol d and benzoquinone e by so4 and oh through a sequence of electron transfer hydroxylation and hydrogen abstraction reactions anipsitakis et al 2006 cai et al 2014 the ring of benzoquinone was further destructed to form 3 ene 2 5 dino hexanedioic acid f in addition the attack of 2 naphthol and 1 amino 2 naphthol by so4 and oh led to the production of 1 2 naphthalenediol h and 3 hydroxy 1 4 naphthalenedione i which can be converted to phthalic anhydride j and benzoic acid k konstantinou and albanis 2004 yuan et al 2011 zhong et al 2011 most of the organic intermediates products generated in the fe0 fexoy persulfate system have been reported to have diverse toxicity 4 aminobenzenesulfanilic acid 1 amino 2 naphthhol and 4 hydrazinebenzenesulfonic acid are aromatic amines which are much more mutagenic and carcinogenic than their precursor azo dyes ekici et al 2001 khehra et al 2006 weisburger 2002 phenol is a well known cytotoxic compound and

acute toxicity to mice nair 2001 the formation of these toxic organic by products was responsible for the higher toxicity of the aop treated samples than the untreated orange ii therefore the direct discharge of the aop treated water would cause adverse impacts on aquatic ecosystems and human health these toxic organic by products generated from aop were further degraded and mineralized in the sulfidogenic process fig 10 the destruction of the aromatic compounds was initiated by clostridium and dechloromonas which were detected in the sulfidogenic bioreactor after 100 d clostridium and

mechanisms of organic by product degradation in the sulfidogenic process 4 conclusions this study successfully developed a novel process integrating so4 based aop mediated by reusable fe0 fexoy particles and a sulfidogenic process to degrade and detoxify orange ii completely the fe0 fexoy particles recycled from a metal processing plant efficiently activated persulfate to produce so4 and oh to degrade orange ii the degradation followed the pseudo first order kinetics and over 95 of orange ii was removed within 120 min so4 and oh destructed orange ii through a sequence of electron transfer electrophilic addition and hydrogen abstraction reactions to generate several organic by products e g aromatic amines and phenol which were more toxic than orange ii the aop generated organic by products were further mineralized and detoxified in a sulfidogenic bioreactor in a 170 d trial the toc removal efficiency was up to 90 the results of toxicity tests using c pyrenoidosa show that the toxicity of the bioreactor effluents became negligible due to the complete degradation and mineralization of toxic aop generated by products by aromatic degrading bacteria e g clostridium and dechloromonas and fermentative bacteria srb and irb the sulfidogenic process also well regenerated the used fe0 fexoy particles through the reduction of surface feiii back into feii by hydrogen sulfide formed and iron reducing bacteria e g sulfurospirillum and paracoccus a larger amount of reactive surface feii sites was formed on regenerated fe0 fexoy particles and resulted in the better reactivity of the regenerated particles in activating persulfate in at least 20 reuse cycles compared to virgin particles therefore the integrated process can be a promising solution to the treatment of toxic and refractory organic pollutants such as dye wastewater it does not only reduce the chemical cost of persulfate activation through regenerating and reusing of fe0 fexoy particles but also eliminate the formation of toxic by products and the production of metal containing sludge declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

18073,pesticides are frequently detected in surface waters sometimes at levels exceeding ecotoxicological guidelines we screened for almost 100 pesticides in 32 streams from intense agricultural areas in southern sweden in concert with water chemistry parameters in addition we investigated the communities of benthic macroinvertebrates biofilm nematodes and algae and calculated multiple bioassessment metrics the number of pesticides found in each stream ranged between 2 and 52 but the sum of toxic units σtu for the mixtures was generally low and exceeded the european uniform principles only in a single sample for algae and in 2 of the samples for daphnia only nematode communities were significantly correlated with the σtu potentially due to their higher pesticide exposure in biofilms diatom metrics showed that most streams were impacted by eutrophication and macroinvertebrate metrics showed good status in most streams whereas the spearpesticides species at risk index specifically designed to indicate pesticide effects showed that about half of the samples were at risk interestingly spearpesticides was not correlated to σtu daphnia and this discrepancy suggests that redefining the boundaries for quality classes might be necessary for this index moreover spearpesticides was positively correlated with the commonly used macroinvertebrate index aspt although disparate results were found for several streams we argue that this questions the scaling of both metrics and the specificity of their responses we discuss that the overall good moderate status of the streams despite the intense agriculture in the catchments can be due to the fact that i a sampling strategy with repeated grab samples did not capture peak pesticide concentrations thus underestimating acute exposure ii pesticide run off indeed was low due to measures such as buffer strips and iii the nutrient rich conditions and high sediment loads counteracted pesticide toxicity we conclude that agricultural land use was the overriding stressor in the investigated streams including strong effects of nutrients less apparent effects of pesticides and likely impact of hydromorphological alterations not specifically addressed in this study graphical abstract image 1 keywords biological metrics mixtures eutrophication multiple stressors ecological status assessment 1 introduction the un s sustainable development goal zero hunger refers to the need for increased food production for a growing global population and for alleviating widespread malnourishment un 2018 simultaneously some 40 of crop harvests worldwide are lost due to pest infections peshin and dhawan 2009 agricultural pesticide use dampens the negative effects of pests on harvest and contributes to increased food production however the beneficial effects of pesticide use in crop production are frequently accompanied by environmental contamination of agricultural landscapes rasmussen et al 2015 and detrimental effects on non target species of aquatic flora dayan and zaccaro 2012 and fauna liess and schulz 1999 as well as pollinators gill et al 2012 and the ecosystem services they perform global use of agricultural pesticides is estimated to some 5 9 million tons active substance annually fao 2017 in the eu 476 active ingredients are currently approved for use as pesticides ec 2019 pesticide use and its impact on freshwater communities are expected to increase dramatically under current climate change scenarios kattwinkel et al 2011 although we have good knowledge about the effects of single pesticides on organisms and ecosystem functions from simplified laboratory studies much less is known about the effects of complex mixture exposures that occur under field conditions the acute mixture toxicity of pesticides associated with peak environmental concentrations make them a major stressor in surface waters in agricultural landscapes szöcs et al 2017 although there is consensus that the acute biological effects of most pesticide mixtures can be predicted using the concentration addition model bopp et al 2018 we still have a poor understanding of the long term effects of complex pesticide mixtures at low environmental concentrations under realistic field conditions field studies of communities offer the possibility to assess integrative effects in realistic exposure scenarios of pesticide mixtures however the pulse type nature of pesticide exposures the natural variability in biological communities as well as the co occurrence of other contaminants and stressors makes it challenging to establish causality between pesticides and their biological effects under field conditions for instance other stressors that might confound pesticide effects in agricultural streams are hydromorphological alterations e g changes in channel form and water flow such alterations may have substantial impacts on ecosystem processes such as nutrient and organic matter retention and litter decomposition see review by elosegi and sabater 2013 several methods exist to assess the ecological status of freshwaters as required by the european water framework directive wfd ec 2000 commonly including community composition of diatoms and macroinvertebrates dejonge et al 2008 and disregarding the rich micro and meiofauna that inhabits the biofilms on all submersed substrata the smaller fauna of benthic boundary layers consists primarily of nematodes copepods tardigrades and the early life stages of chironomids schroeder et al 2012 but is poorly studied largely due to taxonomic constraints many meiofauna taxa spend their entire life cycle in the water occur at high abundances and play an important role in epilithic communities schroeder et al 2012 which should make them good indicators of water quality organisms in biofilms are embedded in a layer of microbial exopolymer secretions compounds that accumulate contaminants headley et al 1998 and that are readily consumed by grazers decho and lopez 1993 weitere et al 2018 considering that biofilms may be sites for contaminant sorption lundqvist et al 2012 rooney et al 2020 their flora and fauna might be particularly exposed to pesticides especially the species rich nematodes are suitable bioindicators for assessing the ecological risks of anthropogenic chemicals for example höss et al 2011 developed a metric nemaspear index based on the nematode fauna of sediments of major german rivers to classify the ecological status of sediments and link it to chemical pollution in this study we assessed ecological pesticide risks on primary producers and consumers in 32 agricultural streams in southern sweden during two consecutive years more specifically we used data on pesticide water concentrations measured during the growing season and calculated toxic units for these samples furthermore we sampled these streams with regard to standard water chemistry and species composition of benthic algae epilithic biofilm nematodes and benthic macroinvertebrates the study thus provides a unique combination of large scale pesticide exposure and the potential risk to key organism groups in sweden s most intensive agricultural landscapes it also provides insight into the effects of pesticides as one of multiple stressors acting on stream communities we compare the suitability of biological metrics for various organism groups as a measure of stressor impact 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites sampling for biological and chemical analysis was carried out in streams from areas with intense agricultural land use in the catchment average 77 range 51 92 in southern sweden table 1 with autumn and spring sown cereals being the predominant crops these sites are generally drained and have at least 6 m wide buffer strips samples were collected from 30 streams and 2 rivers in 2015 and 12 streams and the same 2 rivers in 2016 four of the streams and both rivers are also part of the national pesticide monitoring program see bundschuh et al 2014 while the remaining streams were part of a screening study 2 2 sampling and sample treatment quantitative samples of benthic algal communities were collected from five cobbles using cylindrical brush samplers area 3 14 cm2 according to peters et al 2005 the brushing was done for 30 s on the upper side of the cobble the algal suspension was then transferred to a plastic bottle and preserved with basic lugol s solution taxonomic identification and quantification of algal biovolume was done by accredited laboratory staff using an inverted microscope with 100 400x magnification according to kahlert 2012 in addition benthic diatoms were sampled according to ss en 13946 2014 briefly five cobbles were collected from the streams and periphytic diatoms were brushed off with a toothbrush transferred to a bottle and fixed with ethanol final concentration 70 in the laboratory diatom samples were oxidized to remove all the cell contents and mounted in a high refractive index medium naphrax to obtain permanent slides for microscopy at least 400 diatom frustules per sample were identified and counted ss en 14407 2014 by accredited staff several metrics were computed for assessing water quality namely ips indice de polluo sensibilité spécifique cemagref 1982 pt fraction of frustules from pollution tolerant taxa and tdi trophic diatom index kelly 1998 which are all part of the swedish assessment criteria in addition to these metrics frustule deformations as indicators of metal and or pesticide contamination were quantified according to kahlert 2012 potential toxic effects are indicated when frustule deformations exceed 1 according to the review by morin et al 2012 nematodes in epilithic biofilms were collected from five cobbles per site using the same brush sampler as described for algae above samples were preserved in formaldehyde final concentration 4 until further analysis nematodes were extracted from the biofilm by density centrifugation with ludox tm50 silica suspension 1 13 g ml 1 according to pfannkuche and thiel 1998 following centrifugation the supernatant including nematodes was transferred onto a 10 μm mesh and animals were again preserved with 4 formalin and stained with rose bengal nematodes were counted under a microscope using a 40x magnification and 50 randomly chosen individuals were mounted for species level identification the nemaspear index was calculated for the nematodes according to höss et al 2017 benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled from stony habitats i e riffles along a stretch of the stream by semi quantitative standardized kick sampling 5 1 m x 1 min using a hand net mesh size 0 5 mm ss en 27828 in line with swedish national monitoring methods if no stony substratum was found as was the case in four streams five replicate samples were collected following the same protocol but by carefully stirring the upper sediment layer on the upstream side of the net samples were sieved 0 5 mm transferred quantitatively to a container and preserved in ethanol final concentration 70 in the field in our accredited laboratory taxa were sorted and identified to the lowest possible unit commonly species genus except for oligochaeta and chironomidae using microscopy magnification up to 40x for both rivers höje å and vege å some biological data are missing because high water levels made invertebrate sampling impossible several macroinvertebrate metrics for the assessment of ecological status and pesticide effects were calculated based on the collective information from the 5 replicate kick samples per site and using a standardized list of 500 taxa these metrics were aspt average score per taxon for general ecological quality armitage et al 1983 the multimetric dj index for eutrophication dahl and johnson 2004 taxon richness and the spearpesticides index liess and von der ohe 2005 spearpesticides was calculated using the online tool http www systemecology eu spearcalc while all other metrics were computed using the modules linked to the freshwater database at the swedish university of agricultural sciences slu aspt

daphnia recorded in 24 of the streams were similar to background pesticide levels based on the aforementioned study in both years the highest exposures occurred in the summer with peaks of 0 035 for σtu daphnia in june 2016 n34 and 0 12 for σtualgae in july 2016 lidan twelve pesticides accounted for more than half of the σtus with terbuthylazine metazachlor and picoxystrobin being quantitatively

did not attain good status see höss et al 2017 eight streams had a rich nematode fauna comprising of many pollutant sensitive species and were at high ecological status benthic macroinvertebrate communities were highly diverse with 188 and 106 different taxa identified in 2015 and 2016 respectively the most abundant taxa were oligochaeta in 2015 average 173 179 ind site and gammarus pulex in

correlated with the maximum σtu daphnia fig 4a despite this lack of correlation with σtu daphnia 63 of the streams that were classified as having background pesticide levels according to schäfer et al 2007 had poor or bad status according to spearpesticides 3 5 biota interactions with environmental drivers rda showed that σtu daphnia contributed significantly to the variation in nematodes communities in the summer of 2016 table 2 some predominant species at sites with relatively high species scores in the nemaspear metric can be categorized as tolerant species nemaspenotar eumonhystera pseudobulbosa chomadorita leuckarti yet also sensitive species nemaspear epidorylaimus agilis eudorylaimus carteri neotobrilus longus occurred at the sites with relatively high max σtu daphnia the eigen values for these rdas were low implying that other variables than pesticides also affected the nematode communities e g tn and toc see fig 5 b and table 2 community composition of benthic invertebrates and algae did not correlate with the pesticide σtus the variation in benthic macroinvertebrate communities was mainly explained by gradients in ph nh4 tn so4 and tp fig 5a while that of diatoms also was best explained by tn and so4 fig 5c the variation in the biovolume of benthic algal groups was not correlated with the environmental variables in the pooled year analysis fig 5d nonetheless the seasonal rdas showed a significant relationship with al in the summer of 2016 and with metal σtu in the autumn of 2016 table 2 rdas of all biological metrics with the environmental variables identified fe tp and σtualgae as significant explanatory variables fig 6 table 2 the species scores explaining which index correlated best with the two axes of the rda are listed in table s5 an additional rda using the 16 most common pesticides i e detected in most samples instead of σtu revealed that the fungicide azoxystrobin was a significant explanatory variable for the variation in biological metrics f 3 20 ev 21 1 fig s3 interestingly both σtu daphnia and σtualgae correlated positively with cumulative rainfall during a 30 day period prior to pesticide sampling in m42 in 2015 r 0 60 p 0 0016 and n 25 for both but negatively in 2016 r 0 58 and 0 60 p 0 0046 and 0 0029 n 22 for σtualgae and σtu daphnia respectively similar positive correlations with rainfall were also found in 2015 in e21 i e r 0 41 p 0 0432 n 25 for both σtualgae and σtu daphnia and in 2016 for σtu daphnia in vadsbäcken r 0 87 p 0 002 n 9 and vegeå r 0 66 p 0 038 n 10 4 discussion our study shows generally low pesticide σtus for algae and daphnia and moderate or good ecological status for the majority of streams according to the diatom and macroinvertebrate metrics respectively spearpesticides however deviated from this pattern with low index values indicating poor or bad status for about half of the streams the up uniform principles for pesticides indicated a risk for only a single algae sample and for 2 of the macroinvertebrate samples while the criteria developed by schäfer et al 2007 depicted 53 of the samples as representative of reference conditions our rda results show that only the nematode communities were significantly correlated to the σtus for pesticides these results are surprising considering that our study involved repeated sampling during two consecutive years and that our streams were situated in regions of sweden where agricultural land use strongly predominates the landscape 77 on average table 1 considering this we would have expected an impact of pesticides on biological communities in line with other studies liess and von der ohe 2005 schäfer et al 2007 we see basically three alternative not mutually exclusive explanations for this apparent discrepancy i the sampling design of our study did not capture the peak concentrations of pesticides thus underestimating acute exposure ii run off of pesticides is low due to appropriate usage and efficient buffer strips or iii positive effects of eutrophication i e increased n and p concentrations on stream biota and high sediment loads counteracted any negative effects of pesticide toxicity our sampling design followed the recommendations of grab water samples given in the wfd ec 2000 and our data should therefore meet the criteria of legally correct assessments despite repeated sampling during the growth season our observed σtus were generally low and unlikely to cause serious negative effects on stream biota however in view of the rapid fluctuations hours days of pesticide concentrations in streams and the inherent flaw of grab samples to detect these peaks holvoet et al 2007 we cannot exclude that peak concentrations have occurred our finding that pesticide concentrations correlate positively with increasing rainfall in some of the streams lends some support to this yet in the streams where time integrated samples were collected σtus were also low pesticide use in sweden is indeed lower than in most of europe fao 2017 and long term data covering a few intensively monitored sites have indicated relatively stable and low concentrations boye et al 2019 although exceedances of the swedish water quality guidelines kemi 2007 have also been observed boström et al 2017 improved application techniques education of farmers crop rotation and the gradual introduction of buffer strips likely also has contributed to a successive decline in pesticide run off and improvement of the ecological status of agricultural streams our observed low σtus confirm the conclusion by schriever and liess 2007 that both pesticide applications and the landscape s run off potential in sweden are low in a pan european perspective long term monitoring data i e 2002 2012 reveal that pesticide concentrations in surface waters in sweden have been rather constant lindström et al 2015 historical pesticide data are published as supplementary information in gustavsson et al 2017 the maximum concentrations observed in long term monitoring were on average median 2 1 85 pesticides almost 8 times higher than the maximum concentrations in our study biological metrics provide time integrated measures of contaminant effects and circumvent the inevitable dilemma of fluctuating concentrations in chemical analyses for instance due to differences in generation times and recovery rates diatoms likely preserve effects over relatively short time periods whereas macroinvertebrates would integrate effects over longer time intervals diatom deformities may be caused by contaminants such as herbicides and metals and have been proposed as a screening tool for contaminant exposure lavoie et al 2017 a third of our investigated streams had diatom deformity frequencies 1 suggesting contaminant exposure morin et al 2012 antagonistic interactions with other stressors may have counteracted any negative effects of pesticides for example pesticides may be diluted into the large organic loads of eutrophic systems hylland et al 1996 whereas nutrient rich conditions may allow organisms to allocate energy for detoxification halstead et al 2014 our water chemistry data showed that many of the streams were eutrophic suggesting that nutrient enrichment was a major stressor on these streams indeed diatom analyses showed communities typical of nutrient rich conditions and classified many of the streams as moderate or poor in addition our finding that diatom composition was not related to pesticide σtus but to nutrients e g tn fig 5c corroborates that the streams were more impacted by eutrophication than by pesticides similar results were reported by marcel et al 2013 who found that nutrients rather than herbicides affected diatom species composition and various metrics in french rivers furthermore the high sediment loads typical to agricultural streams contribute to the sorption of pesticides thereby making them less bioavailable likely the concerted action of landscape descriptors eutrophication turbidity and measures to limit run off and direct contamination has contributed to reduce pesticide concentration and consequently to the limited effects on biological communities in our streams moreover for both diatoms algae and invertebrates undisturbed upstream reaches hold source populations for recolonization of impacted downstream reaches and contribute to the good recovery potential of the streams schäfer et al 2007 swedish agricultural streams commonly have a large share of such undisturbed forested upstream areas that function as source populations for recolonization von der ohe and goedkoop 2013 and lakes where substantial dilution occurs likely further contributing to alleviating possible pesticide effects in downstream reaches our results show significant correlations with max σtu daphnia only for nematode assemblages in epilithic biofilms table 2 this finding suggests that biofilm nematodes are particularly sensitive to pesticides similar to sediment communities höss et al 2017 biofilms are in close contact with the water and function as sorption sites for pesticides headley et al 1998 lundqvist et al 2012 likely implying a higher contaminant exposure of biofilm nematodes however observed pesticide concentrations were generally low most maximal σtu values 0 001 and values for the nemaspear index generally high suggesting a good or high ecological status at most sites the few exceptions with a nemaspear 30 moderate status were not related to high pesticide concentrations only at m42 low nemaspear values might have been caused by pesticides see figs 1 and 5b this discrepancy between good ecological status and significant effect of σtus on nemaspear could be due to the fact that this index was developed for sediment inhabiting rather than for biofilm communities höss et al 2017 the apparent lack of effects on benthic macroinvertebrates shown by our rda analyses and the aspt index fit with the low σtu daphnia in the water samples the aspt and spearpesticides metrics were strongly correlated fig 4b which is in line with earlier findings by von der ohe and goedkoop 2013 for 100 streams across an agricultural land use gradient 5 90 arable land this strong correlation suggests that both metrics provide a similar response to multiple stressors despite their different approaches i e assessment of ecological integrity for aspt see armitage et al 1983 and pesticide specific effects for spearpesticides see liess and von der ohe 2005 the aspt metric has been intercalibrated for ecological status assessment in several european countries poikane et al 2016 whereas all but one of our streams had high aspt scores and good or high ecological status classifications based on spearpesticides and the criteria given by beketov et al 2009 provided good or high status only in four instances fig 3 this discrepancy in classifications is remarkable and questions the specific responses and or the scaling of both metrics our generally low σtus questions the poor classification by the spearpesticides metric indicating a high type i error frequency these results were largely contradicted by the relatively high aspt scores that provided much higher and likely more correct status classifications these findings suggest that the assessment of pesticide specific effects on macroinvertebrate assemblages is precarious in our study no correlation was found between the relative abundance of macroinvertebrates or algae and the maximum σtus for pesticides this lack of correlation might be partly due to differences in species sensitivities as the toxicity data used for calculating σtus originate from laboratory tests with standard species and are then extrapolated to all the species found in the field for instance daphnia data were used for neonicotinoids and this species has a tolerance about 2 3 orders of magnitude larger than that of insects morrissey et al 2015 hence the true risk for insects may be underestimated in our study due to insufficient toxicity data moreover the extrapolation of the physiological effects reported in standard toxicity tests to effects at community level is precarious in the field organisms are exposed to repeated pulses of contaminants thus building up a pollution induced community tolerance pict blanck 2002 this might also explain why no strong indications of toxicity were found in the investigated agricultural streams 5 conclusions and outlook our study spans multiple groups of benthic organisms and a wide range of agricultural pesticides thus creating a unique dataset this study is also one of the first to include biofilm meiofauna nematodes for ecological assessment a species rich group with fully aquatic life cycles that live in close contact with water as apparent taxonomic constraints can likely be overcome with metabarcoding techniques waeyenberge et al 2019 future studies should further address the use of meiofauna nematodes in bioassessment our results revealed good and moderate ecological status for most of the streams when assessment was done with macroinvertebrate and diatom metrics that are part of the swedish and eu legal framework which is in line with our findings of generally low σtus despite this spearpesticides scores showed poor bad status and we conclude that it is precarious to specifically assess pesticide effects when effects are small or even absent the limited pesticide exposure of stream biota could be attributed to decades of measures to avoid spills and direct exposure decrease run off from fields and develop sound agricultural practices these measures were reflected in low and rather constant pesticide concentrations in surface waters in the previous decade in sweden lindström et al 2015 nonetheless water chemistry data and diatom communities showed a clear impact of nutrient enrichment which was identified as the major stressor likely we should consider agricultural land use as the overriding stressor including effects of nutrient enrichment hydromorphological alterations including turbidity and stress from pesticides declaration of

18073,pesticides are frequently detected in surface waters sometimes at levels exceeding ecotoxicological guidelines we screened for almost 100 pesticides in 32 streams from intense agricultural areas in southern sweden in concert with water chemistry parameters in addition we investigated the communities of benthic macroinvertebrates biofilm nematodes and algae and calculated multiple bioassessment metrics the number of pesticides found in each stream ranged between 2 and 52 but the sum of toxic units σtu for the mixtures was generally low and exceeded the european uniform principles only in a single sample for algae and in 2 of the samples for daphnia only nematode communities were significantly correlated with the σtu potentially due to their higher pesticide exposure in biofilms diatom metrics showed that most streams were impacted by eutrophication and macroinvertebrate metrics showed good status in most streams whereas the spearpesticides species at risk index specifically designed to indicate pesticide effects showed that about half of the samples were at risk interestingly spearpesticides was not correlated to σtu daphnia and this discrepancy suggests that redefining the boundaries for quality classes might be necessary for this index moreover spearpesticides was positively correlated with the commonly used macroinvertebrate index aspt although disparate results were found for several streams we argue that this questions the scaling of both metrics and the specificity of their responses we discuss that the overall good moderate status of the streams despite the intense agriculture in the catchments can be due to the fact that i a sampling strategy with repeated grab samples did not capture peak pesticide concentrations thus underestimating acute exposure ii pesticide run off indeed was low due to measures such as buffer strips and iii the nutrient rich conditions and high sediment loads counteracted pesticide toxicity we conclude that agricultural land use was the overriding stressor in the investigated streams including strong effects of nutrients less apparent effects of pesticides and likely impact of hydromorphological alterations not specifically addressed in this study graphical abstract image 1 keywords biological metrics mixtures eutrophication multiple stressors ecological status assessment 1 introduction the un s sustainable development goal zero hunger refers to the need for increased food production for a growing global population and for alleviating widespread malnourishment un 2018 simultaneously some 40 of crop harvests worldwide are lost due to pest infections peshin and dhawan 2009 agricultural pesticide use dampens the negative effects of pests on harvest and contributes to increased food production however the beneficial effects of pesticide use in crop production are frequently accompanied by environmental contamination of agricultural landscapes rasmussen et al 2015 and detrimental effects on non target species of aquatic flora dayan and zaccaro 2012 and fauna liess and schulz 1999 as well as pollinators gill et al 2012 and the ecosystem services they perform global use of agricultural pesticides is estimated to some 5 9 million tons active substance annually fao 2017 in the eu 476 active ingredients are currently approved for use as pesticides ec 2019 pesticide use and its impact on freshwater communities are expected to increase dramatically under current climate change scenarios kattwinkel et al 2011 although we have good knowledge about the effects of single pesticides on organisms and ecosystem functions from simplified laboratory studies much less is known about the effects of complex mixture exposures that occur under field conditions the acute mixture toxicity of pesticides associated with peak environmental concentrations make them a major stressor in surface waters in agricultural landscapes szöcs et al 2017 although there is consensus that the acute biological effects of most pesticide mixtures can be predicted using the concentration addition model bopp et al 2018 we still have a poor understanding of the long term effects of complex pesticide mixtures at low environmental concentrations under realistic field conditions field studies of communities offer the possibility to assess integrative effects in realistic exposure scenarios of pesticide mixtures however the pulse type nature of pesticide exposures the natural variability in biological communities as well as the co occurrence of other contaminants and stressors makes it challenging to establish causality between pesticides and their biological effects under field conditions for instance other stressors that might confound pesticide effects in agricultural streams are hydromorphological alterations e g changes in channel form and water flow such alterations may have substantial impacts on ecosystem processes such as nutrient and organic matter retention and litter decomposition see review by elosegi and sabater 2013 several methods exist to assess the ecological status of freshwaters as required by the european water framework directive wfd ec 2000 commonly including community composition of diatoms and macroinvertebrates dejonge et al 2008 and disregarding the rich micro and meiofauna that inhabits the biofilms on all submersed substrata the smaller fauna of benthic boundary layers consists primarily of nematodes copepods tardigrades and the early life stages of chironomids schroeder et al 2012 but is poorly studied largely due to taxonomic constraints many meiofauna taxa spend their entire life cycle in the water occur at high abundances and play an important role in epilithic communities schroeder et al 2012 which should make them good indicators of water quality organisms in biofilms are embedded in a layer of microbial exopolymer secretions compounds that accumulate contaminants headley et al 1998 and that are readily consumed by grazers decho and lopez 1993 weitere et al 2018 considering that biofilms may be sites for contaminant sorption lundqvist et al 2012 rooney et al 2020 their flora and fauna might be particularly exposed to pesticides especially the species rich nematodes are suitable bioindicators for assessing the ecological risks of anthropogenic chemicals for example höss et al 2011 developed a metric nemaspear index based on the nematode fauna of sediments of major german rivers to classify the ecological status of sediments and link it to chemical pollution in this study we assessed ecological pesticide risks on primary producers and consumers in 32 agricultural streams in southern sweden during two consecutive years more specifically we used data on pesticide water concentrations measured during the growing season and calculated toxic units for these samples furthermore we sampled these streams with regard to standard water chemistry and species composition of benthic algae epilithic biofilm nematodes and benthic macroinvertebrates the study thus provides a unique combination of large scale pesticide exposure and the potential risk to key organism groups in sweden s most intensive agricultural landscapes it also provides insight into the effects of pesticides as one of multiple stressors acting on stream communities we compare the suitability of biological metrics for various organism groups as a measure of stressor impact 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites sampling for biological and chemical analysis was carried out in streams from areas with intense agricultural land use in the catchment average 77 range 51 92 in southern sweden table 1 with autumn and spring sown cereals being the predominant crops these sites are generally drained and have at least 6 m wide buffer strips samples were collected from 30 streams and 2 rivers in 2015 and 12 streams and the same 2 rivers in 2016 four of the streams and both rivers are also part of the national pesticide monitoring program see bundschuh et al 2014 while the remaining streams were part of a screening study 2 2 sampling and sample treatment quantitative samples of benthic algal communities were collected from five cobbles using cylindrical brush samplers area 3 14 cm2 according to peters et al 2005 the brushing was done for 30 s on the upper side of the cobble the algal suspension was then transferred to a plastic bottle and preserved with basic lugol s solution taxonomic identification and quantification of algal biovolume was done by accredited laboratory staff using an inverted microscope with 100 400x magnification according to kahlert 2012 in addition benthic diatoms were sampled according to ss en 13946 2014 briefly five cobbles were collected from the streams and periphytic diatoms were brushed off with a toothbrush transferred to a bottle and fixed with ethanol final concentration 70 in the laboratory diatom samples were oxidized to remove all the cell contents and mounted in a high refractive index medium naphrax to obtain permanent slides for microscopy at least 400 diatom frustules per sample were identified and counted ss en 14407 2014 by accredited staff several metrics were computed for assessing water quality namely ips indice de polluo sensibilité spécifique cemagref 1982 pt fraction of frustules from pollution tolerant taxa and tdi trophic diatom index kelly 1998 which are all part of the swedish assessment criteria in addition to these metrics frustule deformations as indicators of metal and or pesticide contamination were quantified according to kahlert 2012 potential toxic effects are indicated when frustule deformations exceed 1 according to the review by morin et al 2012 nematodes in epilithic biofilms were collected from five cobbles per site using the same brush sampler as described for algae above samples were preserved in formaldehyde final concentration 4 until further analysis nematodes were extracted from the biofilm by density centrifugation with ludox tm50 silica suspension 1 13 g ml 1 according to pfannkuche and thiel 1998 following centrifugation the supernatant including nematodes was transferred onto a 10 μm mesh and animals were again preserved with 4 formalin and stained with rose bengal nematodes were counted under a microscope using a 40x magnification and 50 randomly chosen individuals were mounted for species level identification the nemaspear index was calculated for the nematodes according to höss et al 2017 benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled from stony habitats i e riffles along a stretch of the stream by semi quantitative standardized kick sampling 5 1 m x 1 min using a hand net mesh size 0 5 mm ss en 27828 in line with swedish national monitoring methods if no stony substratum was found as was the case in four streams five replicate samples were collected following the same protocol but by carefully stirring the upper sediment layer on the upstream side of the net samples were sieved 0 5 mm transferred quantitatively to a container and preserved in ethanol final concentration 70 in the field in our accredited laboratory taxa were sorted and identified to the lowest possible unit commonly species genus except for oligochaeta and chironomidae using microscopy magnification up to 40x for both rivers höje å and vege å some biological data are missing because high water levels made invertebrate sampling impossible several macroinvertebrate metrics for the assessment of ecological status and pesticide effects were calculated based on the collective information from the 5 replicate kick samples per site and using a standardized list of 500 taxa these metrics were aspt average score per taxon for general ecological quality armitage et al 1983 the multimetric dj index for eutrophication dahl and johnson 2004 taxon richness and the spearpesticides index liess and von der ohe 2005 spearpesticides was calculated using the

σtu daphnia in june 2016 n34 and 0 12 for σtualgae in july 2016 lidan twelve pesticides accounted for more than half of the σtus with terbuthylazine metazachlor and picoxystrobin being quantitatively the most important i e 65 for σtualgae while picoxystrobin mecoprop and pirimicarb contributed most to σtu daphnia among the 14 streams that were sampled in both years 11 had higher σtu for both algae

did not attain good status see höss et al 2017 eight streams had a rich nematode fauna comprising of many pollutant sensitive species and were at high ecological status benthic macroinvertebrate communities were highly diverse with 188 and 106 different taxa identified in 2015 and 2016 respectively the most abundant taxa were oligochaeta in 2015 average 173 179 ind site and gammarus pulex in

spearpesticides showed significant p 0 0001 n 40 positive correlations with aspt r 0 83 fig 4 b taxon richness r 0 59 not shown and the dj index r 0 59 not shown neither aspt nor spearpesticides correlated with the maximum σtu daphnia fig 4a despite this lack of correlation with σtu daphnia 63 of the streams that were classified as having background pesticide levels according to schäfer et al 2007 had poor or bad status according to spearpesticides 3 5 biota interactions with environmental drivers rda showed that σtu daphnia contributed significantly to the variation in nematodes communities in the summer of 2016 table 2 some predominant species at sites with relatively high species scores in the nemaspear metric can be categorized as tolerant species nemaspenotar eumonhystera pseudobulbosa chomadorita leuckarti yet also sensitive species nemaspear epidorylaimus agilis eudorylaimus carteri neotobrilus longus occurred at the sites with relatively high max σtu daphnia the eigen values for these rdas were low implying that other variables than pesticides also affected the nematode communities e g tn and toc see fig 5 b and table 2 community composition of benthic invertebrates and algae did not correlate with the pesticide σtus the variation in benthic macroinvertebrate communities was mainly explained by gradients in ph nh4 tn so4 and tp fig 5a while that of diatoms also was best explained by tn and so4 fig 5c the variation in the biovolume of benthic algal groups was not correlated with the environmental variables in the pooled year analysis fig 5d nonetheless the seasonal rdas showed a significant relationship with al in the summer of 2016 and with metal σtu in the autumn of 2016 table 2 rdas of all biological metrics with the environmental variables identified fe tp and σtualgae as significant explanatory variables fig 6 table 2 the species scores explaining which index correlated best with the two axes of the rda are listed in table s5 an additional rda using the 16 most common pesticides i e detected in most samples instead of σtu revealed that the fungicide azoxystrobin was a significant explanatory variable for the variation in biological metrics f 3 20 ev 21 1 fig s3 interestingly both σtu daphnia and σtualgae correlated positively with cumulative rainfall during a 30 day period prior to pesticide sampling in m42 in 2015 r 0 60 p 0 0016 and n 25 for both but negatively in 2016 r 0 58 and 0 60 p 0 0046 and 0 0029 n 22 for σtualgae and σtu daphnia respectively similar positive correlations with rainfall were also found in 2015 in e21 i e r 0 41 p 0 0432 n 25 for both σtualgae and σtu daphnia and in 2016 for σtu daphnia in vadsbäcken r 0 87 p 0 002 n 9 and vegeå r 0 66 p 0 038 n 10 4 discussion our study shows generally low pesticide σtus for algae and daphnia and moderate or good ecological status for the majority of streams according to the diatom and macroinvertebrate metrics respectively spearpesticides however deviated from this pattern with low index values indicating poor or bad status for about half of the streams the up uniform principles for pesticides indicated a risk for only a single algae sample and for 2 of the macroinvertebrate samples while the criteria developed by schäfer et al 2007 depicted 53 of the samples as representative of reference conditions our rda results show that only the nematode communities were significantly correlated to the σtus for pesticides these results are surprising considering that our study involved repeated sampling during two consecutive years and that our streams were situated in regions of sweden where agricultural land use strongly predominates the landscape 77 on average table 1 considering this we would have expected an impact of pesticides on biological communities in line with other studies liess and von der ohe 2005 schäfer et al 2007 we see basically three alternative not mutually exclusive explanations for this apparent discrepancy i the sampling design of our study did not capture the peak concentrations of pesticides thus underestimating acute exposure ii run off of pesticides is low due to appropriate usage and efficient buffer strips or iii positive effects of eutrophication i e increased n and p concentrations on stream biota and high sediment loads counteracted any negative effects of pesticide toxicity our sampling design followed the recommendations of grab water samples given in the wfd ec 2000 and our data should therefore meet the criteria of legally correct assessments despite repeated sampling during the growth season our observed σtus were generally low and unlikely to cause serious negative effects on stream biota however in view of the rapid fluctuations hours days of pesticide concentrations in streams and the inherent flaw of grab samples to detect these peaks holvoet et al 2007 we cannot exclude that peak concentrations have occurred our finding that pesticide concentrations correlate positively with increasing rainfall in some of the streams lends some support to this yet in the streams where time integrated samples were collected σtus were also low pesticide use in sweden is indeed lower than in most of europe fao 2017 and long term data covering a few intensively monitored sites have indicated relatively stable and low concentrations boye et al 2019 although exceedances of the swedish water quality guidelines kemi 2007 have also been observed boström et al 2017 improved application techniques education of farmers crop rotation and the gradual introduction of buffer strips likely also has contributed to a successive decline in pesticide run off and improvement of the ecological status of agricultural streams our observed low σtus confirm the conclusion by schriever and liess 2007 that both pesticide applications and the landscape s run off potential in sweden are low in a pan european perspective long term monitoring data i e 2002 2012 reveal that pesticide concentrations in surface waters in sweden have been rather constant lindström et al 2015 historical pesticide data are published as supplementary information in gustavsson et al 2017 the maximum concentrations observed in long term monitoring were on average median 2 1 85 pesticides almost 8 times higher than the maximum concentrations in our study biological metrics provide time integrated measures of contaminant effects and circumvent the inevitable dilemma of fluctuating concentrations in chemical analyses for instance due to differences in generation times and recovery rates diatoms likely preserve effects over relatively short time periods whereas macroinvertebrates would integrate effects over longer time intervals diatom deformities may be caused by contaminants such as herbicides and metals and have been proposed as a screening tool for contaminant exposure lavoie et al 2017 a third of our investigated streams had diatom deformity frequencies 1 suggesting contaminant exposure morin et al 2012 antagonistic interactions with other stressors may have counteracted any negative effects of pesticides for example pesticides may be diluted into the large organic loads of eutrophic systems hylland et al 1996 whereas nutrient rich conditions may allow organisms to allocate energy for detoxification halstead et al 2014 our water chemistry data showed that many of the streams were eutrophic suggesting that nutrient enrichment was a major stressor on these streams indeed diatom analyses showed communities typical of nutrient rich conditions and classified many of the streams as moderate or poor in addition our finding that diatom composition was not related to pesticide σtus but to nutrients e g tn fig 5c corroborates that the streams were more impacted by eutrophication than by pesticides similar results were reported by marcel et al 2013 who found that nutrients rather than herbicides affected diatom species composition and various metrics in french rivers furthermore the high sediment loads typical to agricultural streams contribute to the sorption of pesticides thereby making them less bioavailable likely the concerted action of landscape descriptors eutrophication turbidity and measures to limit run off and direct contamination has contributed to reduce pesticide concentration and consequently to the limited effects on biological communities in our streams moreover for both diatoms algae and invertebrates undisturbed upstream reaches hold source populations for recolonization of impacted downstream reaches and contribute to the good recovery potential of the streams schäfer et al 2007 swedish agricultural streams commonly have a large share of such undisturbed forested upstream areas that function as source populations for recolonization von der ohe and goedkoop 2013 and lakes where substantial dilution occurs likely further contributing to alleviating possible pesticide effects in downstream reaches our results show significant correlations with max σtu daphnia only for nematode assemblages in epilithic biofilms table 2 this finding suggests that biofilm nematodes are particularly sensitive to pesticides similar to sediment communities höss et al 2017 biofilms are in close contact with the water and function as sorption sites for pesticides headley et al 1998 lundqvist et al 2012 likely implying a higher contaminant exposure of biofilm nematodes however observed pesticide concentrations were generally low most maximal σtu values 0 001 and values for the nemaspear index generally high suggesting a good or high ecological status at most sites the few exceptions with a nemaspear 30 moderate status were not related to high pesticide concentrations only at m42 low nemaspear values might have been caused by pesticides see figs 1 and 5b this discrepancy between good ecological status and significant effect of σtus on nemaspear could be due to the fact that this index was developed for sediment inhabiting rather than for biofilm communities höss et al 2017 the apparent lack of effects on benthic macroinvertebrates shown by our rda analyses and the aspt index fit with the low σtu daphnia in the water samples the aspt and spearpesticides metrics were strongly correlated fig 4b which is in line with earlier findings by von der ohe and goedkoop 2013 for 100 streams across an agricultural land use gradient 5 90 arable land this strong correlation suggests that both metrics provide a similar response to multiple stressors despite their different approaches i e assessment of ecological integrity for aspt see armitage et al 1983 and pesticide specific effects for spearpesticides see liess and von der ohe 2005 the aspt metric has been intercalibrated for ecological status assessment in several european countries poikane et al 2016 whereas all but one of our streams had high aspt scores and good or high ecological status classifications based on spearpesticides and the criteria given by beketov et al 2009 provided good or high status only in four instances fig 3 this discrepancy in classifications is remarkable and questions the specific responses and or the scaling of both metrics our generally low σtus questions the poor classification by the spearpesticides metric indicating a high type i error frequency these results were largely contradicted by the relatively high aspt scores that provided much higher and likely more correct status classifications these findings suggest that the assessment of pesticide specific effects on macroinvertebrate assemblages is precarious in our study no correlation was found between the relative abundance of macroinvertebrates or algae and the maximum σtus for pesticides this lack of correlation might be partly due to differences in species sensitivities as the toxicity data used for calculating σtus originate from laboratory tests with standard species and are then extrapolated to all the species found in the field for instance daphnia data were used for neonicotinoids and this species has a tolerance about 2 3 orders of magnitude larger than that of insects morrissey et al 2015 hence the true risk for insects may be underestimated in our study due to insufficient toxicity data moreover the extrapolation of the physiological effects reported in standard toxicity tests to effects at community level is precarious in the field organisms are exposed to repeated pulses of contaminants thus building up a pollution induced community tolerance pict blanck 2002 this might also explain why no strong indications of toxicity were found in the investigated agricultural streams 5 conclusions and outlook our study spans multiple groups of benthic organisms and a wide range of agricultural pesticides thus creating a unique dataset this study is also one of the first to include biofilm meiofauna nematodes for ecological assessment a species rich group with fully aquatic life cycles that live in close contact with water as apparent taxonomic constraints can likely be overcome with metabarcoding techniques waeyenberge et al 2019 future studies should further address the use of meiofauna nematodes in bioassessment our results revealed good and moderate ecological status for most of the streams when assessment was done with macroinvertebrate and diatom metrics that are part of the swedish and eu legal framework which is in line with our findings of generally low σtus despite this spearpesticides scores showed poor bad status and we conclude that it is precarious to specifically assess pesticide effects when effects are small or even absent the limited pesticide exposure of stream biota could be attributed to decades of measures to avoid spills and direct exposure decrease run off from fields and develop sound agricultural practices these measures were reflected in low and rather constant pesticide concentrations in surface waters in the previous decade in sweden lindström et al 2015 nonetheless water chemistry data and diatom communities showed a clear impact of nutrient enrichment which was identified as the major stressor likely we should consider agricultural land use as the overriding stressor including effects of nutrient enrichment hydromorphological alterations including turbidity and stress from pesticides declaration of

18074,emission of sulfide and methane from sewerage system has been a major concern for a long time sewers are now facing emerging challenges such as receiving food waste fw to relieve the burdens on solid waste treatment however the knowledge of the direct impact of fw addition on sulfide and methane production in and emission from sewers is still lacking in this study two lab scale sewer reactors one without and one with fw addition were continuously operated to investigate the production of sulfide and methane and microbial communities arising from fw discharge to freshwater sewerage system the 190 day long term monitoring and the batch tests on days 69 and 124 suggest that the fw addition has little impact on sulfide production possibly due to the limited sulfate concentration 40 mg s l but enhanced methane production by up to 60 moreover cryosection fluorescence in situ hybridization fish revealed that the fw addition significantly stimulated the accumulation of methanogenic archaea ma in sewer biofilms and altered the spatial distributions of sulfate reducing bacteria srb and ma moreover the relative abundance of ma in biofilms with fw addition was higher than that without fw addition whereas the relative abundance of srb was similar metabolic pathway analysis for sulfidogenesis and methanogenesis indicates that sufficient substrates derived from the fw addition were biodegraded during fermentation to produce acetate and hydrogen and consequently facilitate methanogenesis these findings shed light on the impacts of changes in wastewater compositions e g fw addition on sulfide and methane production in the freshwater sewerage system for improved policy making on sewer management graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewer sewer biofilm food waste methane sulfide 1 introduction nowadays sewer networks not only collect and convey wastewater from its source to the downstream treatment plants but also serve as a process reactor where chemical and biological processes occur auguet et al 2015 hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 sharma et al 2008 knowledge of the bioprocesses in the sewerage system facilitates the operation of sewers to mitigate negative environmental impacts such as the build up of hydrogen sulfide and the emission of methane gas production of sulfide and methane has been widely considered as a major concern in sewer management guisasola et al 2008 hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 liu et al 2016 nielsen et al 1998 sharma et al 2008 sulfide in sewers is produced by sulfate reducing bacteria srb in biofilms attached onto the pipe walls and causes a number of detrimental effects such as concrete corrosion malodors and health hazards liang et al 2019b liu et al 2016 nielsen et al 2008 pikaar et al 2014 sharma et al 2008 another microbially induced sewer bioprocess is methane gas generation and emission via the metabolism of methanogenic archaea ma through methanogenesis also in sewer biofilms guisasola et al 2008 liu et al 2016 it is necessary to quantify and control the generation of methane gas in the sewer network due to its high global warming potential as well as the explosive risks guisasola et al 2008 ipcc 2007 changes in wastewater organic matter can impose various influences on sewer processes chen et al 2001 liang et al 2019a nielsen et al 1988 raunkjær et al 1997 1995 moreover the abundance distribution and activity of srb and ma are highly dependent on the characteristics of the environment in sewers cao et al 2019 sun et al 2018 2014 zhang et al 2008 therefore it is of significance to investigate the impacts of changes in wastewater on sewer processes particularly for the production of sulfide and methane food waste fw management has been an important issue as it is associated with nutritional environmental economic and social concerns fisgativa et al 2016 gustavsson et al 2011 thyberg et al 2015 the discharge of fw into the sewerage system through kitchen food waste disposers fwds could be beneficial not only for conveying fw through the existing sewerage system but also for recovering energy via anaerobic digestion process at the wastewater treatment plants wwtps battistoni et al 2007 iacovidou et al 2012 thomas 2011 in addition the diversion of fw from the solid waste stream can relieve the onerous burdens on municipal solid waste treatment and reduce methane emissions at the landfill site to date the impact of fw addition on sewers has not received as much attention as on the operation of wwtps battistoni et al 2007 bolzonella et al 2003 ceced 2003 nyepd 1997 until recently it was reported that the addition of fw may promote a thick and dense sewer biofilm with a heterogeneous structure thus limiting oxygen diffusion increasing the srb population in biofilms and enhancing sulfide production in a gravity sewer zan et al 2019a however the knowledge of the direct impacts of fw addition to sewer on sulfide and methane production is still lacking especially in the pressure sewers with the anaerobic conditions to this end this work aims to evaluate the production of sulfide and methane in a lab scale sewer reactor system with and without fw addition sewer biofilms on the reactor walls were first developed during 190 day long term operation and the production of sulfide and methane monitored on days 69 and 124 anaerobic batch tests were carried out to examine biofilm development and variations in methane and sulfide concentrations on different days also from biofilm samples harvested from the reactors the spatial distributions of srb and ma were visualized by cryosection fluorescence in situ hybridization fish and the microbial communities were analyzed to reveal different key microbes with and without fw addition the results of this study are discussed to shed light on the potential implications of the fw discharge to the freshwater sewerage system 2 materials and methods 2 1 set up and operation of lab scale sewer reactors the experimental laboratory system was set up to simulate the sewer processes with and without the addition of fw which consisted of two air tight reactors namely r1 and r2 fig 1 each reactor had a volume of 0 60 l with a height of 0 12 m and an inner diameter of 0 08 m creating a ratio of area to volume a v equal to 58 3 m2 m3 synthetic wastewater comprising glucose acetate and yeast as carbon sources was prepared according to wastewater characteristics in hong kong hao et al 2013 lau et al 2006 and the composition of fw was obtained from a local survey in hong kong i e 50 of fruits 20 of starchy food 20 of vegetables and 10 of meat zan et al 2018 the addition of fw in this study was maintained at 1 g l i e 1 g fw to 1 l synthetic wastewater which is the average ratio of fw to wastewater in hong kong hkdsd 2018 hkepd 2018 zan et al 2019a sulfate level at 40 mg s l in the biofilm sewer reactors was prepared using sodium sulfate the r1 and r2 reactors were intermittently fed with the prepared sewage through a peristaltic pump longer pump bt100 2j baoding china there were twelve 5 min feeding events every 24 h each transferring 0 3 l of sewage into each reactor to form a hydraulic retention time of 4 h the reactor system was stirred by magnetic stirrers dlab ms s beijing china during feeding to simulate the real condition in pressure sewers gutierrez et al 2008 the freshwater sewerage system was operated for over 190 days to allow the development of a stable performance with mature anaerobic biofilm the formation of methane and sulfide were measured as the baseline monitoring of the system 2 2 anaerobic batch tests in sewer reactors to assess the impact of fw addition on the production of sulfide and methane from the lab scale sewer reactors at different stages of biofilm age in situ batch tests were carried out at the hrt of 4 h in reactors r1 and r2 on days 69 and 124 immediately prior to these batch experiments influent was pumped into the reactors r1 with synthetic wastewater at sulfate of 40 mg s l and r2 with synthetic wastewater and fw at sulfate of 40 mg s l after feeding around 1 min stirring was provided by the magnetic stirrers dlab ms s at 200 rpm to homogenize the mixed liquor before sampling during the batch tests ph acetate methane and sulfide were measured for 4 h on days 69 and 124 2 3 fluorescence in situ hybridization cryosection fluorescence in situ hybridization fish was conducted to determine the distributions of srb and ma in the reactor wall biofilms to collect biofilm samples the reactors were first emptied of mixed liquor and allowed to further drain in air at room temperature 20 2 c for 30 min after 30 min the wall biofilms were cut into sections and carefully detached from the reactor wall with dimensions of around 10 mm by 10 mm after biofilm collection the reactors were refilled with the drained mixed liquor the collected biofilms were placed on a stage and fixed with freshly prepared 4 paraformaldehyde solution at 4 c after a 2 h fixation the biofilm samples were embedded in tissue tek oct compound sakura finetek tokyo japan on the base of the oct molds and were then transferred into a freezer at 20 c the frozen biofilm samples were sliced into 25 μm sections parallel to the substratum reactor wall from the surface to the base using a thermo cryostar nx70 cryostat thermo fisher scientific waltham u s with a blade at a temperature of 20 c the cryosectioned slices were placed on microscope slides superfrost plus thermo fisher scientific waltham u s and dried in air for 2 h 4 h the samples on the slides were dehydrated for 3 min in an aqueous ethanol solution with 50 80 and 98 the cryosectioned slices were imaged to determine the relative populations of srb and ma in different depths within the biofilm with and without fw addition cell hybridization was carried out as described by amann et al 1995 and zan et al 2019a the sequences of all oligonucleotide probes used in this study were made to cover the appropriate ranges eubmix eub338 eub338 ii and eub338 iii for all bacteria srbmix srb385 and srb385db for srb and ma with probes msmx860 and mg1200b as summarized in table s1 in the supplementary information si all probes were used at a formamide hybridization level of 35 after hybridization the different layer biofilm slices were imaged with an lsm 710 confocal laser scanning microscope carl zeiss germany equipped with a diode laser 405 nm an argon ml laser 458 488 514 nm a dass laser 560 nm and a he ne laser 633 nm the captured fish images at different depths of the biofilms were analyzed by using imagej national institutes of health u s to determine the biovolume fractions of srb and ma in the biofilms relative populations of srb and ma were calculated on the basis of the sum of srb and ma representing the total population over ten confocal images of different sections were used for analyzing each slice and the average results were obtained from the randomly captured images 2 4 microbial community analysis biofilm samples were quickly removed from the reactor and then placed in 1 ml tubes containing 0 5 ml of phosphate buffered saline pbs for dna extraction dna was extracted from the biofilm sample stored at 20 c utilizing the fastdna spin kit for soil mpbiomedicals france for illumina sequencing for phylogenetic analysis the 16s rrna gene paired end reads generated from illumina hiseq pe250 platform were merged to get the full length of the v4 region the quality control of the sequences was carried out by following the default criteria in mothur v 1 39 software subsequently the qualified clean data was imported into qiime 1 9 to conduct the otu operational taxonomic unit picking and the annotation was performed by using silva v 123 database for taxonomic classification detailed procedures could be found in wang et al 2017 based on the phylogenetic information of the 16s rrna gene sequences the metabolic pathways for sulfidogenesis and methanogenesis were predicted by using the phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust approach langille et al 2013 the predictions were precalculated for genes in databases including the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg the output of picrust consists of a table of functional gene counts as kegg orthologs this study mainly focused on the kegg orthologs related to the functional enzymes for sulfidogenesis and methanogenesis 2 5 chemical analysis samples of dissolved organic carbon doc volatile fatty acids vfa acetate

determined with high performance liquid chromatography hic 20a super shimadzu japan equipped with a conductivity detector and an ic sa3 analytical column ammonium was determined using a flow injection analyzer quikchem fia 8000 lachat usa dissolved methane was measured according to the previous studies alberto et al 2000 guisasola et al 2008 around 5 ml of fresh samples from the sewer reactors were first collected into a 10 ml plastic syringe and then injected into vacuumed bd vacutainer tubes using a hypodermic needle connected with the syringe the tubes were mixed overnight in a shaker to reach equilibration between gas and liquid phases at 25 c more than 97 of methane can be transferred to the gas phase through this process the concentration of methane in the gas phase was determined using an agilent 7890b gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector the remaining concentration of methane in the liquid phase was estimated using mass balance and henry s law 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term operation of the lab scale sewer reactors the formation of methane and sulfide in the lab scale sewer reactors with and without fw addition was monitored during the long term operation as shown in fig 2 in general sulfide production from both reactors i e r1 and r2 was in a similar range whereas methane production was enhanced by the fw addition in r2 in the first 40 days the formation of sulfide gradually increased and then fluctuated in a range from 1 45 to 2 37 g s m2 d this may be attributed to the unstable formation of biofilms in the reactors after 100 days methane production in r1 and r2 were 0 72 and 1 14 g cod m2 d respectively indicating an enhanmcement of 60 by the fw addition the insignificant difference in sulfide production is perhaps due to the limited sulfate concentration 40 mg s l this suggests that the fw addition can facilitate methane production in sewer reactors to further evaluate the impact of fw addition on the production of methane and sulfide the detailed batch tests results are considered below 3 2 batch tests for sulfide and methane production on days 69 and 124 batch tests monitored the changes of ph acetate methane and sulfide in the lab scale sewer reactors over a 4 h period as shown in fig 3 and fig s1 in the si in the batch tests on day 69 ph dropped sharply from 8 17 to 7 53 for r1 and from 7 99 to 7 39 for r2 in the first 1 h and then reached a stable value of 7 47 and 7 35 respectively fig s1 of the si similar trend of ph was also observed on day 124 in r1 and r2 moreover the fw addition resulted in a slight fluctuation of acetate within a narrow range of 49 58 mg c l on day 69 and 46 59 mg c l on day 124 compared with the decreases of acetate from 54 to 26 mg c l on day 69 and 45 to 24 mg c l on day 124 in the reactor without fw addition the slight increases of acetate during the experiments in all cases may be attributable to the hydrolysis and the conversion of the substrates the concentration of acetate remained elevated with the addition of fw because the fw used in this study contained substantial amounts of biodegradable substances zan et al 2018 this suggests that the fw addition can contribute to acetate production from the conversion of macromolecule substrates in the batch tests methane and sulfide were simultaneously generated in both sewer reactors on the different days with sulfate reduction stopping within 4 h while methane production continued similar trends were observed as well in other lab scale sewer reactors with a long term operation guisasola et al 2008 liu et al 2016 sun et al 2018 in general sulfide production was not notably affected by fw addition whereas methane production was significantly enhanced by the fw addition in the batch tests on the days 69 and 124 specifically on day 69 sulfide production from r1 was slightly higher than that from r2 22 31 versus 18 06 mg s l around 56 and 45 of sulfate were converted in the sewer reactors of r1 and r2 respectively according to the long term results sewer biofilms were not well developed by day 69 however it is evident that the build up of methane was significantly enhanced by 215 with the fw addition 5 45 mg cod l in r1 versus 17 13 mg cod l in r2 this indicates that methane production was enhanced with the addition of fw during the biofilm formation in addition batch test on day 124 shows similar trends in the production of sulfide and methane but with much higher concentrations in r1 and r2 on day 124 the maximum sulfide concentrations in r1 and r2 during the test were 29 67 and 31 11 mg s l respectively as for methane production enhancement of 59 in r2 with fw addition was identified 14 07 mg cod l in r1 versus 22 35 mg cod l in r2 this further confirmed the impact of fw addition on the increased methane production in the sewer reactor to provide insight into the production rate of sulfide and methane a kinetic rate analysis was conducted to evaluate the impacts of the fw addition on the different batch test days fitting the experimental results to a first order reaction rate ln c c0 kt was satisfactory to estimate approximate reaction rates r2 0 91 for sulfide production ksulfide and r2 0 88 for methane production kmethane in the sewer reactors on different batch tests days 69 and 124 table 1 although the maximum sulfide production was not affected by the fw addition the reaction rate constants ksulfide were clearly enhanced by 18 during the development of biofilm after day 69 0 73 1 h in r1 versus 0 86 1 h in r2 after the biofilm became stable the difference in the ksulfide was insignificant between r1 and r2 in contrast the methane production rate constant kmethane was enhanced by 69 in r2 with fw addition on day 69 0 32 1 h in r1 versus 0 55 1 h in r2 whereas similar reaction rate constants kmethane were observed in r1 and r2 on day 124 with a similar reaction rate constant the enhanced methane production in r2 can be ascribed to the higher substrate concentration provided by the fw addition this implies that the fw addition accelerates methane and sulfide production in the sewer reactors during the biofilm formation and may directly affect the microbial communities in the sewer biofilms 3 3 spatial distributions of srb and ma in sewer biofilms the localization of srb and ma was visualized by fish analysis of the biofilm sections which were cut parallel to the reactor wall from the surface at the bulk liquid to the attached base at the reactor wall fig 4 shows the selected typical fish images at the surface middle and base of the sewer biofilms in r1 and r2 whereas the sectioned images with an interval of 100 μm are listed in fig s2 of si fig 5 shows the relative spatial distributions of the srb and ma at different depths of the biofilms the addition of fw to r2 resulted in a greater thickness of biofilm compared with the biofilm in r1 0 6 mm versus 0 5 mm in r1 srb was dominant at the surface with a relative population of 98 and decreased with the increased depths of biofilm figs 4a and 5 in contrast ma started to accumulate in the middle of the biofilm at a depth of 200 μm with a relative population of 30 and dominant at the bottom of the biofilm about 89 figs 4c and 5 at a biofilm depth of 300 μm a similar population proportion was identified for srb and ma 50 each the spatial distributions of srb and ma are consistent with the previous study sun et al 2014 in which srb were mainly located in the outer layer and ma inhabited the inner layer of the biofilm however the fw addition significantly enhanced the population of ma from the bottom to the surface at the surface of the biofilm the relative population of ma was 38 whereas srb accounted for 62 figs 4d and 5 moreover ma outcompeted srb at a depth of 100 μm suggesting the boosting accumulation of ma in the biofilm with fw addition compared with the biofilm in r1 there was a gradual change in ma and srb with the biofilm depth in r2 this indicates a potential coexistence of srb and ma despite competition for substrate dar et al 2008 ozuolmez et al 2015 with the increased depth ma reached to 67 at the biofilm depth of 200 μm 82 at 400 μm and 97 at 600 μm fig 5 this implies that the addition of fw significantly promoted the accumulation of ma and altered the spatial distributions of srb and ma in sewer biofilms the distribution of srb and ma are mainly determined by the availability of sulfate and substrate bhattacharya et al 1996 omil et al 1998 santegoeds et al 1999 yoda et al 1987 the decrease in the srb population in biofilms can result from the depletion of sulfate whereas the fw addition increases the substrate concentration and enhances mass transfer in the biofilms to this end a high ma population was formed in the biofilm and produced substantial methane from the biofilm 3 4 microbial community analysis in sewer biofilm the 16s rrna gene sequence analysis was successively applied to the biofilms from sewer reactors with and without fw addition i e r1 and r2 to identify the bacteria and archaea at genus level fig 6 sewer biofilms from r1 and r2 shared similar bacterial groups of which the majority were different kinds of fermentative bacteria capable of fermenting carbohydrates such as trichococcus 32 and 6 pikuta et al 2006 strepis et al 2016 van gelder et al 2012 longilinea 1 and 5 yamada et al 2007 ornatilinea 3 and 3 hemp et al 2015 proteins and amino acids such as longilinea 0 5 and 2 yamada et al 2007 anaerovorax 1 and 2 matthies et al 2000 aminivibrio 0 3 and 1 honda et al 2013 generally sewer biofilm in r1 without fw mainly trichococcus 32 in r1 utilized carbohydrates whereas in r2 with fw addition a diverse fermentative bacterial groups co existed for carbohydrate degradation this indicates that the addition of fw may promote development of a diversity of microbial communities in the sewer biofilm producing a biofilm with high resilience and resistance to the changes in the environment as for srb three genera desulfobacter desulfomicrobium and desulfomonile were dominant in sewer biofilms but the proportion of each group varied with different conditions i e 9 in r1 and 5 in r2 these three genera can use ethanol pyruvate acetate and hydrogen as electron donor in the presence of sulfate as the terminal electron acceptor azabou et al 2007 brandt and ingvorsen 1997 dias et al 2008 sun et al 2001 thevenieau et al 2007 widdel 1987 the addition of fw shows a limited influence on the relative abundance of srb in sewer biofilms in contrast methanogens were dominant with an overall relative abundance of 76 in r1 and 91 in r2 the accumulated ma in the biofilms are mainly affiliated with four genera as follows methanomethylovorans methanothrix methanomassiliicoccus methanospirillum the relative abundance of methanomethylovorans was 37 in r1 and 8 in r2 a genus which consumes methanol methylamines and methyl groups for growth and methane production cha et al 2013 jiang et al 2005 lomans et al 1999 with the addition of fw microbial groups in r2 were mainly dominated by methanothrix at 65 which is a methanogenic specialist showing a high affinity for acetate uptake huser et al 1982 jetten et al 1992 patel 1984 patel and sprott 1990 zinder et al 1987 the relative abundance of methanomassiliicoccus was similar in r1 and r2 whereas a higher relative abundance of methanospirillum was observed in r1 than in r2 17 versus 10 methanomassiliicoccus and methanospirillum use hydrogen as the electron donor to produce methane barredo and evison 1991 de bok et al 2005 dridi et al 2012 gorlas et al 2012 kröninger et al 2016 this suggests that the addition of fw stimulated the conversion of ma from methyl groups consumption to acetate utilization by altering the microbial community moreover the diversion of the dominant ma in sewer biofilms implies the addition of fw may change the major pathways of methane production according to the available substrates 3 5 metabolic pathways for sulfidogenesis and methanogenesis the functional enzymes for sulfidogenesis and methanogenesis were predicted by using the picrust approach derived from the phylogenetic information of the 16s rrna sequences langille et al 2013 the metabolic pathways for sulfate reduction and methane production are illustrated in fig 7 to evaluate the impacts of the fw addition on the expression of the key enzymes for dissimilatory sulfate reduction the total abundance of functional enzymes was similar with 6162 units in r1 and 5995 units in r2 fig 7a in particular a relatively high abundance of sat was identified in r2 whereas aprab and dsrab in r2 were lower than those in r1 this variable impact of the fw addition on the expression of functional enzymes may be the reason for the similar concentration of sulfide production in the long term operation of the sewer reactor in contrast functional enzymes for methanogenesis were significantly enhanced by the fw addition 193522 in r1 versus 228416 units in r2 fig 7b the expression of the key enzymes for methanogenesis in r2 was up regulated by 0 24 log2 rpkm rpkm reads per kilobase per million mapped reads compared with r1 the metabolic pathways for methanogenesis consist of two types i e utilization of acetate or carbon dioxide with hydrogen to be specific the expression of the key enzymes in r2 was up regulated by 0 39 log2 rpkm for the metabolic pathway from acetate to ch4 and 0 12 log2 rpkm from carbon dioxide to ch4 compared with r1 fig 7b this suggests that the addition of fw induced a higher enhancement on acetate conversion for methane production moreover the up regulated expression of the key enzymes is probably a direct result of the increased population of ma in the biofilm and thus results in the boosted methane production with fw addition in the sewer 3 6 potential implications of the fw addition into the freshwater sewerage system this study demonstrates that the addition of fw into a lab scale sewer reactor system can enhance methane production based on long term observation and batch tests on different days whereas sulfide production was not affected by the fw addition due to the limited sulfate level in light of the results of this study an underlying mechanism was proposed as shown in fig 8 with the addition of fw the concentration of biodegradable substrates was increased and formed a thicker biofilm as also reported in a pilot scale gravity sewer system zan et al 2019a moreover the fish analysis revealed that the spatial distribution of srb and ma was significantly altered by the fw addition leading to an increased accumulation of ma from the bottom to the surface of the sewer biofilm from a point of view of the metabolic pathways the expression of functional enzymes for methanogenesis was up regulated by the fw addition sufficient substrates derived from the fw addition were biodegraded during fermentation to produce acetate and hydrogen as a result the increase in substrate supply facilitated the methanogens and enhanced methane production given that acetate and hydrogen fermentation products are the main electron donors for methanogenesis brenner et al 2005 in this context the addition of fw into the lab scale sewer reactor enhanced methane production and potentially increases methane gas emission from the freshwater sewerage system methane gas is an important contributor for the greenhouse gas with the 20 year and 100 year global warming potential of about 84 and 23 times higher than carbon dioxide edf 2020 ipcc 2006 myhre et al 2013 however methane gas emission from the freshwater sewerage system has long been overlooked in the past decades guisasola et al 2008 recent studies have reported methane production from the freshwater sewerage system which has attracted growing attention guisasola et al 2008 mohanakrishnan et al 2009 xu et al 2018 the formation of methane and sulfide mainly attributes to the interaction between ma and srb in the freshwater sewerage system auguet et al 2016 gutierrez et al 2009 liu et al 2016 sun et al 2018 in the sewer biofilms srb were mainly located in the outer layer of the biofilm and ma were mainly situated in the inner layer sun et al 2018 2014 in this study methane and sulfide were simultaneously generated in the sewer reactors as further validated by the coexistence of ma and srb in both the fish analysis and the microbial community identification of sewer biofilms more importantly the present study reported the enhanced methane production from the freshwater sewerage system with the fw addition for the first time the release of methane gas from the sewer may further strengthen the role of the sewer as an important greenhouse gas contributor mannina et al 2018 to this end specific methane production kg cod ton fw was estimated with different hrts in the sewers fig s3 a 4 h hrt could result in the methane production of 13 15 kg cod ton fw accounting for 6 of total cod in fw this can increase to 38 35 kg cod ton fw i e 17 of total cod in fw with an hrt of 8 h in the sewers by contrast direct methane emission from the landfill can range from 208 to 396 kg cod ton fw bernstad and la cour jansen 2012 iqbal et al 2019 which is significantly higher than that from the sewers this suggests that ground food waste discharge to the sewer shows the advantages over the landfill in terms of methane emission in contrast sulfide production was not affected by the addition of fw in this study this may be due to the limited sulfate concentration 40 mg s l in the sewer reactors sulfate concentration and the ratio of cod to sulfate are the critical factors in methanogenesis and sulfidogenesis by diverting the electron flow bhattacharya et al 1996 cetecioglu et al 2019 kiyuna et al 2017 li et al 2015 lu et al 2016 zan et al 2019b zan and hao 2020 moreover sulfate concentration in sewage varied from location to location ranging from 20 to 300 mg s l burak et al 2004 van den brand et al 2015 zan et al 2019a sulfate concentration in this study may restrict a higher sulfide production since the fw addition provides adequate substrates therefore more research is needed to advance the knowledge about the impacts of the fw addition on sulfide production with different sulfate concentrations 4 conclusion this work investigated the impact of fw addition on the production of sulfide and methane in a lab scale sewer reactor system supplemented with fish and microbial community analysis of the sewer reactor biofilms the main findings are 1 ground fw discharge to the freshwater sewerage system has little impact on sulfide production possibly due to the limited sulfate concentration 40 mg s l but enhanced methane production by up to 60 2 the addition of fw significantly promoted the accumulation of ma and altered the spatial distributions of srb and ma in sewer biofilms 3 the relative abundance of ma in biofilms with fw addition was higher than that without fw addition whereas the relative abundance of srb was similar and 4 the expression of functional enzymes for methanogenesis was up regulated by the fw addition thus further enhancing methane production from the sewer biofilm declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

18074,emission of sulfide and methane from sewerage system has been a major concern for a long time sewers are now facing emerging challenges such as receiving food waste fw to relieve the burdens on solid waste treatment however the knowledge of the direct impact of fw addition on sulfide and methane production in and emission from sewers is still lacking in this study two lab scale sewer reactors one without and one with fw addition were continuously operated to investigate the production of sulfide and methane and microbial communities arising from fw discharge to freshwater sewerage system the 190 day long term monitoring and the batch tests on days 69 and 124 suggest that the fw addition has little impact on sulfide production possibly due to the limited sulfate concentration 40 mg s l but enhanced methane production by up to 60 moreover cryosection fluorescence in situ hybridization fish revealed that the fw addition significantly stimulated the accumulation of methanogenic archaea ma in sewer biofilms and altered the spatial distributions of sulfate reducing bacteria srb and ma moreover the relative abundance of ma in biofilms with fw addition was higher than that without fw addition whereas the relative abundance of srb was similar metabolic pathway analysis for sulfidogenesis and methanogenesis indicates that sufficient substrates derived from the fw addition were biodegraded during fermentation to produce acetate and hydrogen and consequently facilitate methanogenesis these findings shed light on the impacts of changes in wastewater compositions e g fw addition on sulfide and methane production in the freshwater sewerage system for improved policy making on sewer management graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewer sewer biofilm food waste methane sulfide 1 introduction nowadays sewer networks not only collect and convey wastewater from its source to the downstream treatment plants but also serve as a process reactor where chemical and biological processes occur auguet et al 2015 hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 sharma et al 2008 knowledge of the bioprocesses in the sewerage system facilitates the operation of sewers to mitigate negative environmental impacts such as the build up of hydrogen sulfide and the emission of methane gas production of sulfide and methane has been widely considered as a major concern in sewer management guisasola et al 2008 hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 liu et al 2016 nielsen et al 1998 sharma et al 2008 sulfide in sewers is produced by sulfate reducing bacteria srb in biofilms attached onto the pipe walls and causes a number of detrimental effects such as concrete corrosion malodors and health hazards liang et al 2019b liu et al 2016 nielsen et al 2008 pikaar et al 2014 sharma et al 2008 another microbially induced sewer bioprocess is methane gas generation and emission via the metabolism of methanogenic archaea ma through methanogenesis also in sewer biofilms guisasola et al 2008 liu et al 2016 it is necessary to quantify and control the generation of methane gas in the sewer network due to its high global warming potential as well as the explosive risks guisasola et al 2008 ipcc 2007 changes in wastewater organic matter can impose various influences on sewer processes chen et al 2001 liang et al 2019a nielsen et al 1988 raunkjær et al 1997 1995 moreover the abundance distribution and activity of srb and ma are highly dependent on the characteristics of the environment in sewers cao et al 2019 sun et al 2018 2014 zhang et al 2008 therefore it is of significance to investigate the impacts of changes in wastewater on sewer processes particularly for the production of sulfide and methane food waste fw management has been an important issue as it is associated with nutritional environmental economic and social concerns fisgativa et al 2016 gustavsson et al 2011 thyberg et al 2015 the discharge of fw into the sewerage system through kitchen food waste disposers fwds could be beneficial not only for conveying fw through the existing sewerage system but also for recovering energy via anaerobic digestion process at the wastewater treatment plants wwtps battistoni et al 2007 iacovidou et al 2012 thomas 2011 in addition the diversion of fw from the solid waste stream can relieve the onerous burdens on municipal solid waste treatment and reduce methane emissions at the landfill site to date the impact of fw addition on sewers has not received as much attention as on the operation of wwtps battistoni et al 2007 bolzonella et al 2003 ceced 2003 nyepd 1997 until recently it was reported that the addition of fw may promote a thick and dense sewer biofilm with a heterogeneous structure thus limiting oxygen diffusion increasing the srb population in biofilms and enhancing sulfide production in a gravity sewer zan et al 2019a however the knowledge of the direct impacts of fw addition to sewer on sulfide and methane production is still lacking especially in the pressure sewers with the anaerobic conditions to this end this work aims to evaluate the production of sulfide and methane in a lab scale sewer reactor system with and without fw addition sewer biofilms on the reactor walls were first developed during 190 day long term operation and the production of sulfide and methane monitored on days 69 and 124 anaerobic batch tests were carried out to examine biofilm development and variations in methane and sulfide concentrations on different days also from biofilm samples harvested from the reactors the spatial distributions of srb and ma were visualized by cryosection fluorescence in situ hybridization fish and the microbial communities were analyzed to reveal different key microbes with and without fw addition the results of this study are discussed to shed light on the potential implications of the fw discharge to the freshwater sewerage system 2 materials and methods 2 1 set up and operation of lab scale sewer reactors the experimental laboratory system was set up to simulate the sewer processes with and without the addition of fw which consisted of two air tight reactors namely r1 and r2 fig 1 each reactor had a volume of 0 60 l with a height of 0 12 m and an inner diameter of 0 08 m creating a ratio of area to volume a v equal to 58 3 m2 m3 synthetic wastewater comprising glucose acetate and yeast as carbon sources was prepared according to wastewater characteristics in hong kong hao et al 2013 lau et al 2006 and the composition of fw was obtained from a local survey in hong kong i e 50 of fruits 20 of starchy food 20 of vegetables and 10 of meat zan et al 2018 the addition of fw in this study was maintained at 1 g l i e 1 g fw to 1 l synthetic wastewater which is the average ratio of fw to wastewater in hong kong hkdsd 2018 hkepd 2018 zan et al 2019a sulfate level at 40 mg s l in the biofilm sewer reactors was prepared using sodium sulfate the r1 and r2 reactors were intermittently fed with the prepared sewage through a peristaltic pump longer pump bt100 2j baoding china there were twelve 5 min feeding events every 24 h each transferring 0 3 l of sewage into each reactor to form a hydraulic retention time of 4 h the reactor system was stirred by magnetic stirrers dlab ms s beijing china during feeding to simulate the real condition in pressure sewers gutierrez et al 2008 the freshwater sewerage system was operated for over 190 days to allow the development of a stable performance with mature anaerobic biofilm the formation of methane and sulfide were measured as the baseline monitoring of the system 2 2 anaerobic batch tests in sewer reactors to assess the impact of fw addition on the production of sulfide and methane from the lab scale sewer reactors at different stages of biofilm age in situ batch tests were carried out at the hrt of 4 h in reactors r1 and r2 on days 69 and 124 immediately prior to these batch experiments influent was pumped into the reactors r1 with synthetic wastewater at sulfate of 40 mg s l and r2 with synthetic wastewater and fw at sulfate of 40 mg s l after feeding around 1 min stirring was provided by the magnetic stirrers dlab ms s at 200 rpm to homogenize the mixed liquor before sampling during the batch tests ph acetate methane and sulfide were measured for 4 h on days 69 and 124 2 3 fluorescence in situ hybridization cryosection fluorescence in situ hybridization fish was conducted to determine the distributions of srb and ma in the reactor wall biofilms to collect biofilm samples the reactors were first emptied of mixed liquor and allowed to further drain in air at room temperature 20 2 c for 30 min after 30 min the wall biofilms were cut into sections and carefully detached from the reactor wall with dimensions of around 10 mm by 10 mm after biofilm collection the reactors were refilled with the drained mixed liquor the collected biofilms were placed on a stage and fixed with freshly prepared 4 paraformaldehyde solution at 4 c after a 2 h fixation the biofilm samples were embedded in tissue tek oct compound sakura finetek tokyo japan on the base of the oct molds and were then transferred into a freezer at 20 c the frozen biofilm samples were sliced into 25 μm sections parallel to the substratum reactor wall from the surface to the base using a thermo cryostar nx70 cryostat thermo fisher scientific waltham u s with a blade at a temperature of 20 c the cryosectioned slices were placed on microscope slides superfrost plus thermo fisher scientific waltham u s and dried in air for 2 h 4 h the samples on the slides were dehydrated for 3 min in an aqueous ethanol solution with 50 80 and 98 the cryosectioned slices were imaged to determine the relative populations of srb and ma in different depths within the biofilm with and without fw addition cell hybridization was carried out as described by amann et al 1995 and zan et al 2019a the sequences of all oligonucleotide probes used in this study were made to cover the appropriate ranges eubmix eub338 eub338 ii and eub338 iii for all bacteria srbmix srb385 and srb385db for srb and ma with probes msmx860 and mg1200b as summarized in table s1 in the supplementary information si all probes were used at a formamide hybridization level of 35 after hybridization the different layer biofilm slices were imaged with an lsm 710 confocal laser scanning microscope carl zeiss germany equipped with a diode laser 405 nm an argon ml laser 458 488 514 nm a dass laser 560 nm and a he ne laser 633 nm the captured fish images at different depths of the biofilms were analyzed by using imagej national institutes of health u s to determine the biovolume fractions of srb and ma in the biofilms relative populations of srb and ma were calculated on the basis of the sum of srb and ma representing the total population over ten confocal images of different sections were used for analyzing each slice and the average results were obtained from the randomly captured images 2 4 microbial community analysis biofilm samples were quickly removed from the reactor and then placed in 1 ml tubes containing 0 5 ml of phosphate buffered saline pbs for dna extraction dna was extracted from the biofilm sample stored at 20 c utilizing the fastdna spin kit for soil mpbiomedicals france for illumina sequencing for phylogenetic analysis the 16s rrna gene paired end reads generated from illumina hiseq pe250 platform were merged to get the full length of the v4 region the quality control of the sequences was carried out by following the default criteria in mothur v 1 39 software subsequently the qualified clean data was imported into qiime 1 9 to conduct the otu operational taxonomic unit picking and the annotation was performed by using silva v 123 database for taxonomic classification detailed procedures could be found in wang et al 2017 based on the phylogenetic information of the 16s rrna gene sequences the metabolic pathways for sulfidogenesis and methanogenesis were predicted by using the phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust approach langille et al 2013 the predictions were precalculated for genes in databases including the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg the output of picrust consists of a table of functional gene counts as kegg orthologs this study mainly focused on the kegg orthologs related to the functional enzymes for sulfidogenesis and methanogenesis 2 5 chemical analysis samples of dissolved organic carbon doc volatile fatty acids vfa acetate ammonium soluble protein soluble polysaccharides and sulfate were prepared and filtered through disposable millipore filters with pore size of 0 45 μm so4 2 was measured using an ion chromatograph hic

bovine serum albumin as the standard smith et al 1985 while soluble polysaccharides were determined using the colorimetric method dubois et al 1956 vfas e g acetate propionate and butyrate were determined with high performance liquid chromatography hic 20a super shimadzu japan equipped with a conductivity detector and an ic sa3 analytical column ammonium was determined using a flow injection analyzer quikchem fia 8000 lachat usa dissolved methane was measured according to the previous studies alberto et al 2000 guisasola et al 2008 around 5 ml of fresh samples from the sewer reactors were first collected into a 10 ml plastic syringe and then injected into vacuumed bd vacutainer tubes using a hypodermic needle connected with the syringe the tubes were mixed overnight in a shaker to reach equilibration between gas and liquid phases at 25 c more than 97 of methane can be transferred to the gas phase through this process the concentration of methane in the gas phase was determined using an agilent 7890b gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector the remaining concentration of methane in the liquid phase was estimated using mass balance and henry s law 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term operation of the lab scale sewer reactors the formation of methane and sulfide in the lab scale sewer reactors with and without fw addition was monitored during the long term operation as shown in fig 2 in general sulfide production from both reactors i e r1 and r2 was in a similar range whereas methane production was enhanced by the fw addition in r2 in the first 40 days the formation of sulfide gradually increased and then fluctuated in a range from 1 45 to 2 37 g s m2 d this may be attributed to the unstable formation of biofilms in the reactors after 100 days methane production in r1 and r2 were 0 72 and 1 14 g cod m2 d respectively indicating an enhanmcement of 60 by the fw addition the insignificant difference in sulfide production is perhaps due to the limited sulfate concentration 40 mg s l this suggests that the fw addition can facilitate methane production in sewer reactors to further evaluate the impact of fw addition on the production of methane and sulfide the detailed batch tests results are considered below 3 2 batch tests for sulfide and methane production on days 69 and 124 batch tests monitored the changes of ph acetate methane and sulfide in the lab scale sewer reactors over a 4 h period as shown in fig 3 and fig s1 in the si in the batch tests on day 69 ph dropped sharply from 8 17 to 7 53 for r1 and from 7 99 to 7 39 for r2 in the first 1 h and then reached a stable value of 7 47 and 7 35 respectively fig s1 of the si similar trend of ph was also observed on day 124 in r1 and r2 moreover the fw addition resulted in a slight fluctuation of acetate within a narrow range of 49 58 mg c l on day 69 and 46 59 mg c l on day 124 compared with the decreases of acetate from 54 to 26 mg c l on day 69 and 45 to 24 mg c l on day 124 in the reactor without fw addition the slight increases of acetate during the experiments in all cases may be attributable to the hydrolysis and the conversion of the substrates the concentration of acetate remained elevated with the addition of fw because the fw used in this study contained substantial amounts of biodegradable substances zan et al 2018 this suggests that the fw addition can contribute to acetate production from the conversion of macromolecule substrates in the batch tests methane and sulfide were simultaneously generated in both sewer reactors on the different days with sulfate reduction stopping within 4 h while methane production continued similar trends were observed as well in other lab scale sewer reactors with a long term operation guisasola et al 2008 liu et al 2016 sun et al 2018 in general sulfide production was not notably affected by fw addition whereas methane production was significantly enhanced by the fw addition in the batch tests on the days 69 and 124 specifically on day 69 sulfide production from r1 was slightly higher than that from r2 22 31 versus 18 06 mg s l around 56 and 45 of sulfate were converted in the sewer reactors of r1 and r2 respectively according to the long term results sewer biofilms were not well developed by day 69 however it is evident that the build up of methane was significantly enhanced by 215 with the fw addition 5 45 mg cod l in r1 versus 17 13 mg cod l in r2 this indicates that methane production was enhanced with the addition of fw during the biofilm formation in addition batch test on day 124 shows similar trends in the production of sulfide and methane but with much higher concentrations in r1 and r2 on day 124 the maximum sulfide concentrations in r1 and r2 during the test were 29 67 and 31 11 mg s l respectively as for methane production enhancement of 59 in r2 with fw addition was identified 14 07 mg cod l in r1 versus 22 35 mg cod l in r2 this further confirmed the impact of fw addition on the increased methane production in the sewer reactor to provide insight into the production rate of sulfide and methane a kinetic rate analysis was conducted to evaluate the impacts of the fw addition on the different batch test days fitting the experimental results to a first order reaction rate ln c c0 kt was satisfactory to estimate approximate reaction rates r2 0 91 for sulfide production ksulfide and r2 0 88 for methane production kmethane in the sewer reactors on different batch tests days 69 and 124 table 1 although the maximum sulfide production was not affected by the fw addition the reaction rate constants ksulfide were clearly enhanced by 18 during the development of biofilm after day 69 0 73 1 h in r1 versus 0 86 1 h in r2 after the biofilm became stable the difference in the ksulfide was insignificant between r1 and r2 in contrast the methane production rate constant kmethane was enhanced by 69 in r2 with fw addition on day 69 0 32 1 h in r1 versus 0 55 1 h in r2 whereas similar reaction rate constants kmethane were observed in r1 and r2 on day 124 with a similar reaction rate constant the enhanced methane production in r2 can be ascribed to the higher substrate concentration provided by the fw addition this implies that the fw addition accelerates methane and sulfide production in the sewer reactors during the biofilm formation and may directly affect the microbial communities in the sewer biofilms 3 3 spatial distributions of srb and ma in sewer biofilms the localization of srb and ma was visualized by fish analysis of the biofilm sections which were cut parallel to the reactor wall from the surface at the bulk liquid to the attached base at the reactor wall fig 4 shows the selected typical fish images at the surface middle and base of the sewer biofilms in r1 and r2 whereas the sectioned images with an interval of 100 μm are listed in fig s2 of si fig 5 shows the relative spatial distributions of the srb and ma at different depths of the biofilms the addition of fw to r2 resulted in a greater thickness of biofilm compared with the biofilm in r1 0 6 mm versus 0 5 mm in r1 srb was dominant at the surface with a relative population of 98 and decreased with the increased depths of biofilm figs 4a and 5 in contrast ma started to accumulate in the middle of the biofilm at a depth of 200 μm with a relative population of 30 and dominant at the bottom of the biofilm about 89 figs 4c and 5 at a biofilm depth of 300 μm a similar population proportion was identified for srb and ma 50 each the spatial distributions of srb and ma are consistent with the previous study sun et al 2014 in which srb were mainly located in the outer layer and ma inhabited the inner layer of the biofilm however the fw addition significantly enhanced the population of ma from the bottom to the surface at the surface of the biofilm the relative population of ma was 38 whereas srb accounted for 62 figs 4d and 5 moreover ma outcompeted srb at a depth of 100 μm suggesting the boosting accumulation of ma in the biofilm with fw addition compared with the biofilm in r1 there was a gradual change in ma and srb with the biofilm depth in r2 this indicates a potential coexistence of srb and ma despite competition for substrate dar et al 2008 ozuolmez et al 2015 with the increased depth ma reached to 67 at the biofilm depth of 200 μm 82 at 400 μm and 97 at 600 μm fig 5 this implies that the addition of fw significantly promoted the accumulation of ma and altered the spatial distributions of srb and ma in sewer biofilms the distribution of srb and ma are mainly determined by the availability of sulfate and substrate bhattacharya et al 1996 omil et al 1998 santegoeds et al 1999 yoda et al 1987 the decrease in the srb population in biofilms can result from the depletion of sulfate whereas the fw addition increases the substrate concentration and enhances mass transfer in the biofilms to this end a high ma population was formed in the biofilm and produced substantial methane from the biofilm 3 4 microbial community analysis in sewer biofilm the 16s rrna gene sequence analysis was successively applied to the biofilms from sewer reactors with and without fw addition i e r1 and r2 to identify the bacteria and archaea at genus level fig 6 sewer biofilms from r1 and r2 shared similar bacterial groups of which the majority were different kinds of fermentative bacteria capable of fermenting carbohydrates such as trichococcus 32 and 6 pikuta et al 2006 strepis et al 2016 van gelder et al 2012 longilinea 1 and 5 yamada et al 2007 ornatilinea 3 and 3 hemp et al 2015 proteins and amino acids such as longilinea 0 5 and 2 yamada et al 2007 anaerovorax 1 and 2 matthies et al 2000 aminivibrio 0 3 and 1 honda et al 2013 generally sewer biofilm in r1 without fw mainly trichococcus 32 in r1 utilized carbohydrates whereas in r2 with fw addition a diverse fermentative bacterial groups co existed for carbohydrate degradation this indicates that the addition of fw may promote development of a diversity of microbial communities in the sewer biofilm producing a biofilm with high resilience and resistance to the changes in the environment as for srb three genera desulfobacter desulfomicrobium and desulfomonile were dominant in sewer biofilms but the proportion of each group varied with different conditions i e 9 in r1 and 5 in r2 these three genera can use ethanol pyruvate acetate and hydrogen as electron donor in the presence of sulfate as the terminal electron acceptor azabou et al 2007 brandt and ingvorsen 1997 dias et al 2008 sun et al 2001 thevenieau et al 2007 widdel 1987 the addition of fw shows a limited influence on the relative abundance of srb in sewer biofilms in contrast methanogens were dominant with an overall relative abundance of 76 in r1 and 91 in r2 the accumulated ma in the biofilms are mainly affiliated with four genera as follows methanomethylovorans methanothrix methanomassiliicoccus methanospirillum the relative abundance of methanomethylovorans was 37 in r1 and 8 in r2 a genus which consumes methanol methylamines and methyl groups for growth and methane production cha et al 2013 jiang et al 2005 lomans et al 1999 with the addition of fw microbial groups in r2 were mainly dominated by methanothrix at 65 which is a methanogenic specialist showing a high affinity for acetate uptake huser et al 1982 jetten et al 1992 patel 1984 patel and sprott 1990 zinder et al 1987 the relative abundance of methanomassiliicoccus was similar in r1 and r2 whereas a higher relative abundance of methanospirillum was observed in r1 than in r2 17 versus 10 methanomassiliicoccus and methanospirillum use hydrogen as the electron donor to produce methane barredo and evison 1991 de bok et al 2005 dridi et al 2012 gorlas et al 2012 kröninger et al 2016 this suggests that the addition of fw stimulated the conversion of ma from methyl groups consumption to acetate utilization by altering the microbial community moreover the diversion of the dominant ma in sewer biofilms implies the addition of fw may change the major pathways of methane production according to the available substrates 3 5 metabolic pathways for sulfidogenesis and methanogenesis the functional enzymes for sulfidogenesis and methanogenesis were predicted by using the picrust approach derived from the phylogenetic information of the 16s rrna sequences langille et al 2013 the metabolic pathways for sulfate reduction and methane production are illustrated in fig 7 to evaluate the impacts of the fw addition on the expression of the key enzymes for dissimilatory sulfate reduction the total abundance of functional enzymes was similar with 6162 units in r1 and 5995 units in r2 fig 7a in particular a relatively high abundance of sat was identified in r2 whereas aprab and dsrab in r2 were lower than those in r1 this variable impact of the fw addition on the expression of functional enzymes may be the reason for the similar concentration of sulfide production in the long term operation of the sewer reactor in contrast functional enzymes for methanogenesis were significantly enhanced by the fw addition 193522 in r1 versus 228416 units in r2 fig 7b the expression of the key enzymes for methanogenesis in r2 was up regulated by 0 24 log2 rpkm rpkm reads per kilobase per million mapped reads compared with r1 the metabolic pathways for methanogenesis consist of two types i e utilization of acetate or carbon dioxide with hydrogen to be specific the expression of the key enzymes in r2 was up regulated by 0 39 log2 rpkm for the metabolic pathway from acetate to ch4 and 0 12 log2 rpkm from carbon dioxide to ch4 compared with r1 fig 7b this suggests that the addition of fw induced a higher enhancement on acetate conversion for methane production moreover the up regulated expression of the key enzymes is probably a direct result of the increased population of ma in the biofilm and thus results in the boosted methane production with fw addition in the sewer 3 6 potential implications of the fw addition into the freshwater sewerage system this study demonstrates that the addition of fw into a lab scale sewer reactor system can enhance methane production based on long term observation and batch tests on different days whereas sulfide production was not affected by the fw addition due to the limited sulfate level in light of the results of this study an underlying mechanism was proposed as shown in fig 8 with the addition of fw the concentration of biodegradable substrates was increased and formed a thicker biofilm as also reported in a pilot scale gravity sewer system zan et al 2019a moreover the fish analysis revealed that the spatial distribution of srb and ma was significantly altered by the fw addition leading to an increased accumulation of ma from the bottom to the surface of the sewer biofilm from a point of view of the metabolic pathways the expression of functional enzymes for methanogenesis was up regulated by the fw addition sufficient substrates derived from the fw addition were biodegraded during fermentation to produce acetate and hydrogen as a result the increase in substrate supply facilitated the methanogens and enhanced methane production given that acetate and hydrogen fermentation products are the main electron donors for methanogenesis brenner et al 2005 in this context the addition of fw into the lab scale sewer reactor enhanced methane production and potentially increases methane gas emission from the freshwater sewerage system methane gas is an important contributor for the greenhouse gas with the 20 year and 100 year global warming potential of about 84 and 23 times higher than carbon dioxide edf 2020 ipcc 2006 myhre et al 2013 however methane gas emission from the freshwater sewerage system has long been overlooked in the past decades guisasola et al 2008 recent studies have reported methane production from the freshwater sewerage system which has attracted growing attention guisasola et al 2008 mohanakrishnan et al 2009 xu et al 2018 the formation of methane and sulfide mainly attributes to the interaction between ma and srb in the freshwater sewerage system auguet et al 2016 gutierrez et al 2009 liu et al 2016 sun et al 2018 in the sewer biofilms srb were mainly located in the outer layer of the biofilm and ma were mainly situated in the inner layer sun et al 2018 2014 in this study methane and sulfide were simultaneously generated in the sewer reactors as further validated by the coexistence of ma and srb in both the fish analysis and the microbial community identification of sewer biofilms more importantly the present study reported the enhanced methane production from the freshwater sewerage system with the fw addition for the first time the release of methane gas from the sewer may further strengthen the role of the sewer as an important greenhouse gas contributor mannina et al 2018 to this end specific methane production kg cod ton fw was estimated with different hrts in the sewers fig s3 a 4 h hrt could result in the methane production of 13 15 kg cod ton fw accounting for 6 of total cod in fw this can increase to 38 35 kg cod ton fw i e 17 of total cod in fw with an hrt of 8 h in the sewers by contrast direct methane emission from the landfill can range from 208 to 396 kg cod ton fw bernstad and la cour jansen 2012 iqbal et al 2019 which is significantly higher than that from the sewers this suggests that ground food waste discharge to the sewer shows the advantages over the landfill in terms of methane emission in contrast sulfide production was not affected by the addition of fw in this study this may be due to the limited sulfate concentration 40 mg s l in the sewer reactors sulfate concentration and the ratio of cod to sulfate are the critical factors in methanogenesis and sulfidogenesis by diverting the electron flow bhattacharya et al 1996 cetecioglu et al 2019 kiyuna et al 2017 li et al 2015 lu et al 2016 zan et al 2019b zan and hao 2020 moreover sulfate concentration in sewage varied from location to location ranging from 20 to 300 mg s l burak et al 2004 van den brand et al 2015 zan et al 2019a sulfate concentration in this study may restrict a higher sulfide production since the fw addition provides adequate substrates therefore more research is needed to advance the knowledge about the impacts of the fw addition on sulfide production with different sulfate concentrations 4 conclusion this work investigated the impact of fw addition on the production of sulfide and methane in a lab scale sewer reactor system supplemented with fish and microbial community analysis of the sewer reactor biofilms the main findings are 1 ground fw discharge to the freshwater sewerage system has little impact on sulfide production possibly due to the limited sulfate concentration 40 mg s l but enhanced methane production by up to 60 2 the addition of fw significantly promoted the accumulation of ma and altered the spatial distributions of srb and ma in sewer biofilms 3 the relative abundance of ma in biofilms with fw addition was higher than that without fw addition whereas the relative abundance of srb was similar and 4 the expression of functional enzymes for methanogenesis was up regulated by the fw addition thus further enhancing methane production from the sewer biofilm declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
