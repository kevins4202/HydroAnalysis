3105,the aim of this research is to enlarge knowledge of space time evolution of precipitation in california over the last decade on a monthly seasonal and annual time scale this study also analyses the relationship between precipitation and teleconnection patterns with most influence on californian climate the homogeneity of the data from the selected stations was verified and finally 165 meteorological stations were used with an observation period that ranged from 1980 to 2019 in order to evaluate trends and statistical significance both the non parametric mann kendall test and modified sen s slope method were used correlation analysis using the partial non parametric spearman test 95 confidence level was performed to find out relationships between precipitation and nine teleconnection patterns in the state of california spatial analysis was achieved using empirical bayesian kriging ebk finally this research as a novelty shows regionalisation of california state as a function of significance in the correlation of precipitation with teleconnection patterns to achieve this principal component analysis pca and agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis hca was performed results show a positive precipitation trend in winter and negative precipitation trend in late summer and autumn the teleconnection patterns more correlated with precipitation are el niño along southern oscillation enso antarctic oscillation aao and north atlantic oscillation nao four areas were discerned outlining the mojave climate region area 4 by having enso as the teleconnection pattern that best account precipitation keywords precipitation trends teleconnection patterns regionalisation california data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change has been drawing the scientific community s attention for more than three decades stoddard et al 2021 in this regard the increase in the frequency of extreme weather events has boosted economic losses over recent decades due to tropical cyclones winter storms floods droughts heatwaves and wildfires beniston 2007 beniston et al 2021 ehsani et al 2020 roksvåg et al 2021 in fact the occurrence and intensity of rainstorms has increased since the 1950s around the world where trend analysis data are obtainable owing to the surge in human co2 emissions dong et al 2021 fischer and knutti 2015 held and soden 2006 masson delmotte et al 2021 one of the most expensive natural hazards is flooding causing billions of dollars in damage each year cheung et al 2016 davenport et al 2021 particularly in california where in 2017 extreme precipitation and flooding led to damage worth around 1 5 billion mallakpour et al 2019 incidentally and including other issues during flood events public water systems fail to provide fresh water due to the destruction of treatment plants located near in close proximity to rivers exum et al 2018 another important factor leading to major economic and social losses are aviation accidents most of these accidents are caused by weather conditions such as fog and precipitation that reduce visibility gultepe et al 2019 at this point it is important to mention that precipitation is any creation of the condensation of atmospheric water vapour that falls rapidly from a cloud the principal forms include drizzle rain sleet and snow nasa goddard space flight center 2018 in this regard it is important to identify that ice fog suspended ice crystals can affect local climates due to the alteration of surface albedo in fact ice fog modulates the heat and the moisture fluxes in the troposphere thereby altering the climate gultepe et al 2017 it is widely known that precipitation is an important part of the water cycle and at the same time probably one of the main variables associated with atmospheric circulation in climate studies sun et al 2018 moreover snow precipitation can be either in a liquid or ice phase and plays an important role in the water cycle of the mountain s ecosystem gultepe 2015 precipitation and clouds along with water vapour mass exchanges play a major role in climate fluctuations at both global and regional levels levizzani and cattani 2019 it is of note that not only do they make an impact on the climate but also on the weather at every scale and affect water obtainability levizzani and cattani 2019 in addition precipitation is the primary source of fresh water for numerous systems such as agriculture and ecosystems lausier and jain 2018 therefore changes in precipitation could cause unprecedented consequences for society agriculture and the environment guo et al 2019 foreseeing precipitation trends is important for a country s future economic development ahmad et al 2015 carvalho 2020 have claimed that precipitation is expected to increase in wet regions and decrease in dry regions nevertheless there is a growing body of literature that identifies precipitation trends becoming less predictable at finer spatial scales even in observational data gultepe et al 2016 because of the increasingly strong influence of climate variability in different regions de luis et al 2009 jiang et al 2016 lausier and jain 2018 mohammad and goswami 2019 torres batlló and martí cardona 2020 treppiedi et al 2021 and specifically in the united states davenport et al 2021 powell and keim 2015 sayemuzzaman and jha 2014 precipitation differs greatly due to both topographic effects and mesoscale atmospheric dynamical processes huang et al 2020a it is important to mention that some studies agree that a reduction in the frequency of warm season precipitation combined with anthropogenic impact could lead to an increase in forest fires in the state of california abatzoglou and williams 2016 diffenbaugh et al 2015 williams et al 2019 understanding the variability and trends in precipitation could help to improve water resource management in different parts of the world such as california where frequent droughts occur he and gautam 2016 serra llobet et al 2016 in addition several research papers have shown a huge loss of snowpack due to early thaws and more rain instead of snow huang et al 2020a some researchers have claimed that drought risk and the decrease in precipitation in california are due to anthropogenic forcing and the greenhouse effect dasgupta et al 2020 diffenbaugh et al 2015 swain et al 2016 moreover physical and dynamical processes force changes in precipitation for this reason several studies have focused on the relationships between precipitation and teleconnection patterns the term teleconnection pattern is often defined as a large scale repetitive atmospheric pattern that occurs over months to years as a result of changes in surface fluxes and covers widespread geographic areas yuan et al 2020 additionally sometimes these can last for several consecutive years it is worth noting that teleconnection patterns have been associated with alterations in seasonal rainfall in california zhang et al 2021 in fact there are some patterns of teleconnection that may be related to precipitation and do not occur in isolation wise et al 2015 together these research papers provide important insights into the understanding of climate unpredictability on a global scale including north america ge and gong 2009 lau and weng 2002 trenberth et al 2014 and california abatzoglou 2011 allen and anderson 2018 guan et al 2013 sheppard et al 2002 zhang et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 those research projects establish the main large scale teleconnection patterns that could affect the united states and in particular the state of california they are antarctic oscillation aao jian qi 2010 arctic oscillation ao dai and tan 2017 north atlantic oscillation nao hurrell and deser 2010 pacific north american pattern pna wallace and gutzler 1981 madden julian oscillation mjo zhou et al 2020 west pacific oscillation wpo that is west pacific wp choi and moon 2012 previously described by barnston et al 1991 and j wallace and gutzler 1981 eastern pacific oscillation epo dai and tan 2019a el niño along southern oscillation enso whan and zwiers 2016 and pacific decadal oscillation pdo mcafee 2014 newman et al 2016 additional observational work in combination with modelling studies is essential to acquire knowledge of the relationship between precipitation in california and teleconnection patterns luković et al 2021 as has been previously mentioned examining precipitation is an enduring concern both in the long term and within extreme weather events this research is original and it is important to highlight that it shows the most recent results in rainfall trends in california on a monthly seasonal and annual time scale the leading aim of this study is to investigate the space time progression of precipitation at a regional level in order to enlighten on the one hand the trend and its statistical significance for the entire state of california for the period of 1980 2019 at a monthly seasonal and annual rate on the other hand this study ground breaking to our knowledge examines the relationship between precipitation and up to a total of nine teleconnection patterns with its most probable influence on the californian climate during the period mentioned above it provides the possible links between different teleconnection patterns on rainfall in california another unique feature of this research is to achieve objective regionalisation by clustering meteorological stations according to their links with rainfall recorded in california and the teleconnection patterns selected finally it is considered that the conclusions of this might support managers of land planning not only will they be able to put into practice confidence building measures to tackle global warming but also to take measures in order to overcome the adverse effects of this phenomenon subsequent work is needed to evaluate how trends may evolve in response to future climate variability moreover it will become possible to anticipate future climate change the recognition of upcoming trends across a series of thresholds allows for risk management with more suitable adaptation goals 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area this research is conducted in the state of california one of largest states in the u s that covers an area of 423 955 km2 this state exhibits two main mountain ranges the sierra nevada and the coast range which give california a varied landscape the coast range goes from the northwest right down to the mexican border spanning 1300 km the longest and largest range in california is the sierra nevada where mount whitney at 4421 m is california s highest peak luteyn and hickman 1993 in addition the state has two distinct desert zones mojave and colorado california boasts several major rivers and lakes such as the sacramento river and lake tahoe fig 1 the californian climate is highly variable although a mediterranean climate prevails all over the state except for the highland area of klamath where there is a temperate climate rivas martínez et al 2011 moreover in the southeast of this state there is a somewhat tropical climate in the sonoran desert killam et al 2014 its complex topography and great latitudinal extension favour a wide variety of climates from desert to subalpine environments pathak et al 2018 thus its proximity to the pacific coast is one of the determining factors in the climate of the state 2 2 data rainfall values from the climatic database of the meteorological stations were used and were available on the wrcc website western regional climate center 2020 from 1980 to 2019 initially monthly rainfall mm data were selected from 350 stations the meteorological stations were chosen due to criteria based on completeness length and homogeneity in most of the state he and gautam 2016 only stations with less than 10 of missing values were chosen the gaps were completed with the corresponding monthly long term mean value ríos cornejo et al 2015 after that analysis of the homogeneity of the data was tested blöschl et al 2019 gocic and trajkovic 2013 karmeshu 2015 song et al 2019 this study was determined by the run test thom 1966 at a 95 confidence level this test is recommended by the wmo because it is not necessary for the analysed series to follow normal criteria and it has also been used previously in other climatic studies del río et al 2013 meseguer ruiz and sarricolea 2017 finally 165 stations were chosen for the study adding their altitude values and geographic coordinates fig 1 to enable the results be represented on maps as will be discussed below moreover for each one of the meteorological stations seasonal and annual rainfall values were calculated it is widely known that there are four seasons in california spring march april and may summer june july and august autumn september october and november and winter december january and february henceforth those months will be named mam jja son djf the annual rainfall series in california were computed using voronoi polygons considering the weather stations in accordance with the area of each polygon hijmans et al 2021 2 3 trend analysis firstly to attain the slope results from the selected stations we applied a modified sen s slope method and the mann kendall test liu et al 2020 with r package version 4 1 0 the sen slope estimator is a non parametric technique that estimates variations per unit of time in a series where there is a linear trend trend analysis was carried out on a monthly seasonal and annual basis secondly to estimate trends and statistical significance the non parametric mann kendall test was used this kendall tau test is one of the most commonly applied non parametric tests for noticing trends in environmental time series data he and gautam 2016 kukal and irmak 2016 peña angulo et al 2021 sarricolea et al 2019 particularly in hydrological ones ahmad et al 2015 in many areas of the globe it is complicated to assess the climate since there is a lack in the number of weather stations available díaz padilla et al 2011 therefore statistical interpolation of the values is necessary for some specific regions empirical bayesian kriging ebk was used as a method of interpolation of geographic values as it is superior to other predictors and progressively so with data complexity in addition it provides both a straightforward and robust method of data interpolation barber et al 2017 gribov and krivoruchko 2020 krivoruchko 2012 to conduct this interpolation arcgis 10 8 environmental systems research institute esri 2019 software was used and to be more precise an ebk geoprocessing tool was applied furthermore 17 rainfall trend contour maps were created using the same software and areas with statistical significance 95 confidence level were overlaid onto the contour maps 2 4 selecting the atmospheric teleconnection patterns similar to other research cordero et al 2011 guirguis et al 2019 yu et al 2019 values of the atmospheric circulation pattern indices were selected from the climate prediction center available on the noaa national climatic data center ncdc website https www ncdc noaa gov teleconnections it must be pointed out that the real time multivariate madden julian oscillation rmm indices were obtained from the australian bureau of meteorology https www bom gov au climate mjo graphics rmm 74torealtime txt it is important to mention that madden julian oscillation mjo is both a global scale complex teleconnection pattern of tropical atmosphere and the dominant mode of inter seasonal tropical variability zheng et al 2018 the real time multivariate index rmm is a commonly used index for defining mjo the two principal components are rmm1 and rmm2 and they have been shown to be suitable indices of mjo and related variability wheeler and hendon 2004 consequently mjo is a two dimensional phase space rmm1 and rmm2 pattern and their union results in 8 equatorial phases the teleconnection patterns chosen first that can influence the climate in the united states and in the state of california were el niño 3 4 enso and pacific decadal oscillation pdo jiménez quiroz 2014 lee and grotjahn 2019 due to the connections in atmospheric rivers that may modify the californian climate indices for antarctic oscillation aao arctic oscillation ao madden julian oscillation mjo north atlantic oscillation nao pacific north american pattern pna west pacific oscillation wpo and east pacific oscillation epo were also considered to discover relationships between rainfall and the teleconnection patterns selected the partial non parametric spearman test was applied at confidence level of 95 liu et al 2020 its simple interpretation robustness and ability to capture nonlinear correlations makes it a perfect choice for detecting monotonic trends this method gives less importance to outliers and eliminates the effect that the time variable can have on rainfall and teleconnection pattern variables which thereby avoids false relationships ríos cornejo et al 2015 finally using r software both the correlation results and their statistical significance were shown on monthly maps 2 5 regionalisation in order to obtain homogeneous areas both agglomerative hierarchical cluster hca and principal component analysis pca were utilized with all the correlations obtained using the non parametric spearman test ríos cornejo et al 2015 these areas contain the meteorological stations whose precipitation is related to the same teleconnection patterns studied the pca was done based on eigenvalues 1 and the hca was conducted by the ward method and squared euclidean distance once the number of both clusters and stations belonging to each cluster was obtained a voronoi interpolation was carried out with the data in order to obtain the regionalised map this was then divided into areas according to the patterns that have shown the most correlation with precipitation 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall trends rainfall results from the global analysis in california table 1 show differences in trend directions in the entire state in april 0 28 mm year 1 may 0 13 mm year 1 and december 0 24 mm year 1 the highest values of increases are found it is worth noting that both november and march 0 68 and 0 71 mm year 1 have shown a negative trend during the period studied in addition autumn shared the same trend 0 38 mm year 1 and is the only season in which the decrease is statistically significant some of the results from examining rainfall trends positive and negative ones at monthly seasonal and annual levels from 1980 to 2019 in the state of california are shown in fig 2 in general negative trends are found in most of the months except for april may and december fig 3 when positive trends outweigh the negative ones as it can be seen in fig 3 the median slope values are located below the zero line in the majority of the months excluding may june july august september and summer where the slope is zero or close to it should be specified that in the summer period precipitation trends do not exist due to the fact that precipitation in those months is 0 mm for most years in the period studied this lack of precipitation in summer is similar to mediterranean climate territories around the world one particular example of how trends vary each month season or annually can be observed in the station at yosemite and is represented in both figs 4 and 5 in this meteorological station both positive april and negative september trends are shown with a red line it is also important to mention the difference between the results presented in table 1 and fig 6 both of them show rainfall trends but the former is for the whole state in a general approach and the latter is an empirical bayesian kriging interpolation of all the meteorological stations selected in this study giving a detailed result for each part of the state of california as was mentioned above fig 6 shows the geographical distribution of rainfall trends on a monthly seasonal and annual time scale the results of the spatial distribution trends in rainfall and their statistical significance on annual levels in california show two localized areas discriminated by the trends they present from yreka to sacramento and from the san joaquin valley over to san francisco and the rest of southern california a negative rainfall trend is presented in fact 70 of the meteorological stations studied have shown that trend in the aforementioned areas there has been a gradual decline in rainfall up to 0 2 mm year 1 which is consistent with other research polade et al 2017 however northern areas of the state such as coastal ranges 0 49 mm year 1 the klamath mountains cascade ranges 0 20 mm year 1 susanville and lake tahoe 0 40 mm year 1 have shown positive trends as is mentioned above several researchers have found that daily precipitation events had shown a steady rise over the last five decades showing a difference between the north and the south in terms of precipitation berg and hall 2015 killam et al 2014 swain et al 2016 according to previous research he and gautam 2016 average precipitation has shown no statistically significant trends in any month for any territories and remarkably in our case none of the study areas have shown statistically significant trends annually seasonally or monthly but for june and autumn a decrease in the precipitation trend could be observed in march 92 of the stations this is consistent with previous research conducted in other parts of the world which showed a negative trend during this month boé and terray 2008 da silva et al 2015 mosaffa et al 2020 río et al 2011 in this study empirical proof has shown over the period studied a negative trend of 2 mm year 1 in some points of sierra nevada curiously from bridgeport to mount whitney 0 8 mm year 1 which constitute higher altitude areas it is worth pointing out that the snow accumulation period became shorter and for this reason the snowpack accumulation in sierra nevada will decrease guan et al 2013 in addition a downward trend was found in most of the territory except for in the vicinity of eureka in this area a positive trend was found of 0 8 mm year 1 turning now to results in april and may they show increasing trends which is the general pattern in most of the state 58 and 63 of the stations respectively fig 2 during april mainly in the northern territories from yreka the klamath mountains asarian and walker 2016 redding to oroville placerville auburn and over to mount whitney there is a sharp increase 1 4 mm year 1 in rainfall it is remarkable that in may on the coast ranges san francisco sacramento valley and northern california a steady decline in rainfall 0 15 mm year 1 can be seen if we focus on our results in spring 0 06 mm year 1 they are consistent up to a point with a decreasing trend 0 1 cm decade 1 found in other research he and gautam 2016 in our research it has been found that in the north apart from the sacramento valley a positive trend appears from 0 12 mm to 0 6 mm year 1 fig 6 this is entirely different to what happens in southern areas such as in san diego the laguna mountains and riverside where there is negative rainfall up to 0 6 mm year 1 in this regard 73 of the meteorological stations show negative trends according to this data water storage and supply systems are essentially dependent on winter spring snowpack diffenbaugh et al 2015 in addition rainfall decreases for the months of march through may which explains much of the variation in the area destroyed by fires each year in this regard years with low spring rainfall meant a disproportionately large percentage of the total area was devastated by fire dennison et al 2008 if we now turn to the results in june july and august no increase in rainfall trends were found for instance 55 of the stations in june show negative trends it is important to mention that during these months most of the state has values of 0 mm over the period studied in fact in june there is a significant negative trend 0 1 mm year 1 in the mojave desert in that area the results showed a steady decline in the last month 0 35 mm year 1 however it is not statistically significant related to summer similar results 90 of stations have been found although a negative trend 0 25 mm year 1 appears in sierra nevada and this suggests an intensification of the probability of dry summers in the future this will become more common throughout california he and gautam 2016 and it will be prone to occasional drought episodes droughts in southwestern united states have been intensified by unusual warm summer temperatures and by the lack of rainfall cayan et al 2013 according to the results in rainfall trends during the months of september october and november negative values are found in each of those months 75 82 and 95 of the stations studied respectively negative trends bestrew the whole of california but the southern areas show the lowest values for instance the vicinities of mount ritter showed the highest negative values in september 1 26 mm year 1 while in november up to 2 8 mm year 1 this result coincides up to a point with other research that claimed a negative precipitation trend of 0 62 mm month year for november luković et al 2021 our results fig 6 are differentiated into regional isoclines where different gradients are observed unlike in the aforementioned research where the values are for the entire state of california the rainfall trend observed in autumn by other authors establishes that based on observational precipitation records from the last few decades decreases in rainfall trends were considered during son season since 1979 luković et al 2021 that statement coincides with our results the whole of the state of california displays a decrease in rainfall over the period of study 92 of the stations the negative trend found in sierra nevada areas is meaningful 1 35 mm year 1 and the fact that a statistically significant negative trend appears in the surroundings of san francisco 0 9 mm year 1 is of interest this coincides with the research that claimed that there is a statically significant decrease in rainfall in autumn 0 25 mm month year and suggests lower precipitation conditions at the beginning of the wet season in recent decades luković et al 2021 in addition a decrease in non extreme precipitation dominates the drier autumn and spring dong et al 2019 according to the monthly results in january a steady rise in rainfall was observed over sierra nevada 0 3 mm year 1 and it spreads to the san rafael mountains santa lucia ranges and the san gabriel mountains up to 0 9 mm year 1 meanwhile in the southern part of the state and inland in the vicinity of the mojave desert there is a negative trend in rainfall 0 6 mm year 1 this trend is found in 60 of the stations and can be clearly observed in the san francisco bay 0 9 mm year 1 it also spreads north through the sacramento valley 0 6 mm year 1 to yreka 0 3 mm year 1 moving to february the results show that there is a positive trend 2 25 mm year 1 in the northern half of the state particularly in sierra nevada areas close to oroville 1 85 mm year 1 and auburn in contrast during this month the areas in the south have shown decreases 1 35 mm year 1 in rainfall mainly in the area adjacent to mount witney 0 40 mm year 1 independence and mariposa this result in february coincides with other research that northern mid and high latitude regions are expected to become wetter while southern subtropical areas are likely to become drier berg and hall 2015 finally some research explains that in response to global warming there is usually a dry winter throughout the mediterranean climate regions as a consequence of poleward expansion in subtropical dry zones dong and leung 2021 as can be observed in fig 6 a positive trend 1 2 mm year 1 is shown in december except for in some coastal areas with no trends such as san francisco bay monterey the san rafael mountains diablo range and san luis obispo moreover the vicinities of el centro show negative trends 0 6 mm year 1 the trends are mostly small during the wet season but there is a slight tendency toward moisture being positive but similar to zero 0 35 cm decade 1 berg and hall 2015 some research explains that more than half of the annual precipitation drops in winter chang et al 2015 he and gautam 2016 it is worth noting that in this research the analysis of trend anomalies in precipitation low during two consecutive winters 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 with the influence of el niño pattern has been considered wang et al 2017 for example during winter in sierra nevada california a great number of storms are associated with atmospheric rivers ar guan et al 2013 moreover ar will probably increase rainfall and snowmelt in sierra nevada huang et al 2020b atmospheric rivers are modulated by teleconnection patterns guirguis et al 2019 the following section elaborates on the correlations of precipitation with teleconnection patterns taking everything into consideration these results suggest that the situation could be leading to a rise in seasonal rainfall in california in this regard creating models of hydrological procedures already provide adequate spatial detail in order to evaluate hydroclimatic causes that will be life threatening in preparation for risk to water resources and ecosystems risk of wildfire and other crucial matters cayan et al 2013 climate models show that extended warming and intensification of seasonal drying trends in the future are likely to result in further rises in extreme autumn fire weather situations all over california goss et al 2020 3 2 teleconnection patterns this section will show the results of the spatial and statistical analysis between rainfall and the nine teleconnection patterns chosen together these results provide important insights into understanding the link that teleconnection patterns might have had on the rainfall over california from 1980 to 2019 the results are summarised in fig 7 except for the epo data in december which was not available the results are also shown on monthly maps where the meteorological stations in red are significantly correlated positive or negative with each one of the patterns studied figs 8 to 17 it is well known that pacific decadal oscillation pdo affects the rainfall relationship with el niño southern oscillation enso in this area with positive interference pavia et al 2016 if we focus on our results the meteorological stations which significantly correlate with pdo are located in northern coastal areas in april may and august except for in december where the correlations also appear in southern coastal areas fig 8 these results are consistent with other research in which pdo enso brings precipitation and takes place along the northern californian coast and over sierra nevada guirguis et al 2019 it is important to observe that previous research work has pointed out that in summer over the centre and southern areas of california despite the lack of correlation small or insignificant the contributions of these two patterns to causing precipitation are significant cheng et al 2021 in the same manner as in other local research los angeles has years where there is more than beyond average rainfall during a positive phase of pdo this variability in precipitation is influenced by enso and pdo whose relationships becomes stronger in the southern areas of the state killam et al 2014 the increase in winter pluvial risks over the entire state of california are connected with positive phases of pdo while positive phases of enso affect northern california kam and sheffield 2016 our study found that enso is likely to explain the precipitation trend in january february and march fig 9 and accordingly enso is a more meaningful predictor than pdo over briefer periods such as from october to march cheng et al 2021 in our study 18 1 of the stations seem to be affected by enso in january and 11 5 in both february and march in other research californian precipitation showed a strong correlation with extratropical cyclone weather conditions over the eastern pacific to the west of california with positive correlation 0 8 chang et al 2015 however chang et al 2015 mentioned that enso can only shed light on part of the link between californian rainfall and extratropical cyclone activity due to the fact that the correlation between winter rainfall and el niño 3 4 index was just 0 38 between 1979 1980 and 2013 2014 moving to the results of correlations between pacific north american teleconnection patterns pna and precipitation it is interesting that 37 0 of the stations correlate in june fig 10 positive pna circulation phases make northern california dry because of the association of pna with drier forms that seep into northern california this in turn leads to fewer dry conditions in southern california and west coast southwest california lin et al 2017 during the month of june most of the stations correlated with pna are located in the central areas of the state this pattern might therefore be related to the distribution of rainfall for example as we saw in the previous section there is a slight decrease in the precipitation trend in june during the years of study in addition pdo enso and pna have been proven to have significant correlation with precipitation and groundwater fluctuations velasco et al 2017 it is worth noting that predicting winter precipitation over a 3 4 week period in the southern and eastern us it is highly correlated to nao enso 3 4 and pna indices wang and robertson 2019 if we focus on north atlantic oscillation nao fig 11 it is the major large scale teleconnection pattern over the extra tropical atlantic ocean whan and zwiers 2016 in this study the results show that february and may are the months with the highest correlation with precipitation 61 8 and 50 3 in addition there is a lower value in april 13 9 where the correlated meteorological stations are found both in the coastal areas of los angeles san diego and sierra nevada ranges fig 11 decadal wet phases of the precipitation pattern in california are associated with november to march circulation modes such as low south eastern pressure from the nao pattern this favours recurrent north pacific winter storms shifting towards california cayan et al 1998 hurrell 1995 in this regard the nao exerts a substantial influence on precipitation in other mediterranean climate type regions lópez moreno et al 2011 nao is a regional manifestation of a hemispheric wide mode known as arctic oscillation ao ao has been defined as the atmospheric pressure at middle latitudes that fluctuates between negative and positive phases its high frequency oscillation from those phases impacts on both daily and weekly patterns brolley 2007 sellars et al 2015 a typically positive negative ao phase is linked with wetter drier conditions over california in fact ao has been claimed to correlate with the forecast of precipitation differences across california at least from 2015 to 2017 wang and robertson 2019 moreover this pattern correlates highly with the north atlantic oscillation pattern walker and bliss 1932 and has been an issue of much interest over the last few years e g wallace and gutzler 1981 hurrell 1995 previous research has claimed that those two patterns correlate well together there is a clear difference that could illustrate how we attempt to unravel physical mechanisms in northern hemisphere atmospheric irregularity ambaum et al 2001 according to this our ao correlation results fig 12 showed 29 1 in the central northern areas of the state mainly in june according to our madden julian oscillation mjo results rmm1 seems to have a stronger relationship with precipitation than rmm2 over the period studied figs 13 and 14 it is important to note that mainly meteorological stations located in san francisco bay and its vicinities had shown any correlation these results agree with other research that investigated the inter annual variability in the range of mjo found and apparently there are no direct and systematic relationships between extreme precipitation and this index jones 2000 however recent research has claimed that mjo would be suitable as a predictor of pentad precipitation at weeks 3 6 15 42 days nardi et al 2020 the western pacific oscillation wpo pattern is one of the foremost teleconnection patterns over winter months in the northern hemisphere dai and tan 2019b in addition wpo epo is connected with more precipitation in california which has been attributed to circulation features that disturb the path and orientation of atmospheric rivers at landfall guirguis et al 2019 according to our results epo fig 15 seems to be connected with precipitation in october 40 6 and related to trend results the effect might mean a decrease in precipitation wpo fig 16 on the other hand could have a greater effect on the increase in precipitation over april and may 41 2 and 21 2 respectively fig 12 finally according to antarctic oscillation aao high correlations have been found in february 54 5 and april 70 9 fig 17 despite these results this teleconnection pattern mainly takes place in the southern hemisphere it was stated that positive phases could alter the circulation of mjo and enso in extratropical zones of the pacific specifically in wintertime carvalho et al 2005 to sum up it can be seen that the relationship between teleconnection patterns and precipitation is widespread all over the state of california according to table 2 and related to what has been stated above precipitation in january seems to correlate mainly with enso while in february aao and nao are the most correlated patterns with precipitation 54 6 and 61 8 respectively in that month epo and enso show correlation to a lesser extent it is significant that only enso correlates in march 11 moving on to april aao is the most correlated pattern 70 3 followed by epo 18 2 and nao 13 9 the latter is the most correlated in may 50 3 followed by epo 21 2 during the summer in june for instance pna is the most correlated to precipitation in 37 0 of the meteorological stations in august the correlation values obtained by epo 11 5 and mjo 7 9 stand out the latter is the one that most correlates with precipitation 9 1 in the month of september epo and wpo are the most correlated in october while in november neither value is worth noting finally in december the teleconnection patterns that could have the greatest effect on rainfall are pdo 17 0 and pna 16 4 3 2 1 regionalisation the results of regionalisation show four different areas clusters as can be observed in fig 18 the percentage of correlation for each area is presented in fig 19 and table 2 supplementary material in the north of the state area 1 in yellow rainfall is highly correlated with aao 68 5 nao 84 9 and epo 72 6 fig 19 it is important that both of the former are related to rainfall in february while the latter are in october the area is made up of 66 meteorological stations related to the area in blue area 2 it consists of 45 meteorological stations and it extends from the centre of california up to los angeles and to the southern areas of sierra nevada in this area both aao 84 3 and wpo 69 8 correlate in april in addition here precipitation is correlated with nao 77 8 in may and to a lesser extent with pna 52 4 in june if we move to the green one area 4 that goes from death valley to r the entire mojave desert and up to oceanside 34 meteorological stations enso is highly correlated with precipitation in january february and march 62 5 58 33 and 79 8 respectively and also to a lesser extent in may 37 5 interestingly this area resembles the mojave climate region abatzoglou et al 2009 the southern area in red area 3 deals with imperial valley the southern santa rosa mountains and the mojave desert this area is made up of 20 meteorological stations and there are no clear teleconnection patterns which show high correlation to precipitation related to ao in february nao in march and pdo in december merely 40 is shown fig 18 4 conclusions the main purposes of this research were firstly to determine precipitation trends in california from 1980 to 2019 on monthly seasonal and annual levels in addition precipitation trend contour maps were designed for 17 levels moreover statistically significant areas were also overlaid on the contour maps secondly to clarify the relationship between precipitation and up to nine teleconnection patterns whose results were given on a monthly basis thirdly to highlight areas where the teleconnection patterns are correlated with precipitation and to what extent finally in accordance with the results some of the significant outcomes of this research are specified along these lines the global analysis of precipitation in california shows broad spatial and seasonal differences in trend directions throughout the whole state during the period studied the highest positive values are found in april 0 28 mm year 1 and december 0 24 mm year 1 while in march 0 71 mm year 1 and november 0 68 mm year 1 there is a negative trend both increases and decreases are established mainly in mountainous areas and consequently in those areas the difference in monthly rainfall rises showing that the precipitation phenomena happens over shorter periods of time moreover on a seasonal scale autumn has shown a significant decrease 0 38 mm year 1 in rainfall trends the data reported here appears to support the assumption that on an annual level from yreka to sacramento and san joaquin valley over san francisco to the rest of southern california a negative precipitation trend in presented 0 2 mm year 1 while the remaining territories mainly in the north have shown a positive trend 0 3 mm year 1 one of the most significant findings to emerge from this study is that in rainy seasons both in winter and spring the positive rainfall trend is located in the northern half of the state while a decrease in rainfall was brought to the fore in the southern half the teleconnection patterns that correlate most with precipitation in california are north atlantic oscillation nao el niño southern oscillation enso east pacific oscillation epo west pacific oscillation wpo and antarctic oscillation aao monthly precipitation is correlated with teleconnection patterns in april may july and august showing at least a little correlation with every pattern studied in december precipitation correlates with pacific decadal oscillation pdo and pacific north american pna california is a territory based on what is observed in this study where rainfall trends have shown great variability throughout the state due to its orography mainly in mountainous areas in addition this precipitation might be influenced by the behaviour of atmospheric teleconnection patterns due to the fact that it is a territory where teleconnection patterns commonly take place however there are four different areas where area 4 described above has shown high correlation values with enso el niño southern oscillation and rainfall over the period studied during january february and march in area 2 aao and wpo correlate the most in april while nao and pna are in may and june respectively in addition in area 1 rainfall correlates highly with aao 68 5 nao 84 9 and epo 72 6 while in area 3 there is not a clearly teleconnection pattern with more than 40 of stations correlated finally the authors consider that these findings provide insights for future research related to teleconnection patterns and meteorological phenomena in addition it is important to research local physics topography thermodynamics and also to investigate other potential driving factors of change moreover the results of this study have a broad implication for the future for example knowing about the past and trying to predict how precipitation will behave on a more detailed scale than that which has been investigated previously to our knowledge in this regard this research can help other professionals such as environmental managers and politicians to take the necessary measures in the face of precipitation processes whereabouts they should take them and with what urgency processes that due to climate change are expected to worsen in the course of time data availability the datasets generated and analysed during the current study are not publicly available due to the fact that r package is in the process of being

3105,the aim of this research is to enlarge knowledge of space time evolution of precipitation in california over the last decade on a monthly seasonal and annual time scale this study also analyses the relationship between precipitation and teleconnection patterns with most influence on californian climate the homogeneity of the data from the selected stations was verified and finally 165 meteorological stations were used with an observation period that ranged from 1980 to 2019 in order to evaluate trends and statistical significance both the non parametric mann kendall test and modified sen s slope method were used correlation analysis using the partial non parametric spearman test 95 confidence level was performed to find out relationships between precipitation and nine teleconnection patterns in the state of california spatial analysis was achieved using empirical bayesian kriging ebk finally this research as a novelty shows regionalisation of california state as a function of significance in the correlation of precipitation with teleconnection patterns to achieve this principal component analysis pca and agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis hca was performed results show a positive precipitation trend in winter and negative precipitation trend in late summer and autumn the teleconnection patterns more correlated with precipitation are el niño along southern oscillation enso antarctic oscillation aao and north atlantic oscillation nao four areas were discerned outlining the mojave climate region area 4 by having enso as the teleconnection pattern that best account precipitation keywords precipitation trends teleconnection patterns regionalisation california data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change has been drawing the scientific community s attention for more than three decades stoddard et al 2021 in this regard the increase in the frequency of extreme weather events has boosted economic losses over recent decades due to tropical cyclones winter storms floods droughts heatwaves and wildfires beniston 2007 beniston et al 2021 ehsani et al 2020 roksvåg et al 2021 in fact the occurrence and intensity of rainstorms has increased since the 1950s around the world where trend analysis data are obtainable owing to the surge in human co2 emissions dong et al 2021 fischer and knutti 2015 held and soden 2006 masson delmotte et al 2021 one of the most expensive natural hazards is flooding causing billions of dollars in damage each year cheung et al 2016 davenport et al 2021 particularly in california where in 2017 extreme precipitation and flooding led to damage worth around 1 5 billion mallakpour et al 2019 incidentally and including other issues during flood events public water systems fail to provide fresh water due to the destruction of treatment plants located near in close proximity to rivers exum et al 2018 another important factor leading to major economic and social losses are aviation accidents most of these accidents are caused by weather conditions such as fog and precipitation that reduce visibility gultepe et al 2019 at this point it is important to mention that precipitation is any creation of the condensation of atmospheric water vapour that falls rapidly from a cloud the principal forms include drizzle rain sleet and snow nasa goddard space flight center 2018 in this regard it is important to identify that ice fog suspended ice crystals can affect local climates due to the alteration of surface albedo in fact ice fog modulates the heat and the moisture fluxes in the troposphere thereby altering the climate gultepe et al 2017 it is widely known that precipitation is an important part of the water cycle and at the same time probably one of the main variables associated with atmospheric circulation in climate studies sun et al 2018 moreover snow precipitation can be either in a liquid or ice phase and plays an important role in the water cycle of the mountain s ecosystem gultepe 2015 precipitation and clouds along with water vapour mass exchanges play a major role in climate fluctuations at both global and regional levels levizzani and cattani 2019 it is of note that not only do they make an impact on the climate but also on the weather at every scale and affect water obtainability levizzani and cattani 2019 in addition precipitation is the primary source of fresh water for numerous systems such as agriculture and ecosystems lausier and jain 2018 therefore changes in precipitation could cause unprecedented consequences for society agriculture and the environment guo et al 2019 foreseeing precipitation trends is important for a country s future economic development ahmad et al 2015 carvalho 2020 have claimed that precipitation is expected to increase in wet regions and decrease in dry regions nevertheless there is a growing body of literature that identifies precipitation trends becoming less predictable at finer spatial scales even in observational data gultepe et al 2016 because of the increasingly strong influence of climate variability in different regions de luis et al 2009 jiang et al 2016 lausier and jain 2018 mohammad and goswami 2019 torres batlló and martí cardona 2020 treppiedi et al 2021 and specifically in the united states davenport et al 2021 powell and keim 2015 sayemuzzaman and jha 2014 precipitation differs greatly due to both topographic effects and mesoscale atmospheric dynamical processes huang et al 2020a it is important to mention that some studies agree that a reduction in the frequency of warm season precipitation combined with anthropogenic impact could lead to an increase in forest fires in the state of california abatzoglou and williams 2016 diffenbaugh et al 2015 williams et al 2019 understanding the variability and trends in precipitation could help to improve water resource management in different parts of the world such as california where frequent droughts occur he and gautam 2016 serra llobet et al 2016 in addition several research papers have shown a huge loss of snowpack due to early thaws and more rain instead of snow huang et al 2020a some researchers have claimed that drought risk and the decrease in precipitation in california are due to anthropogenic forcing and the greenhouse effect dasgupta et al 2020 diffenbaugh et al 2015 swain et al 2016 moreover physical and dynamical processes force changes in precipitation for this reason several studies have focused on the relationships between precipitation and teleconnection patterns the term teleconnection pattern is often defined as a large scale repetitive atmospheric pattern that occurs over months to years as a result of changes in surface fluxes and covers widespread geographic areas yuan et al 2020 additionally sometimes these can last for several consecutive years it is worth noting that teleconnection patterns have been associated with alterations in seasonal rainfall in california zhang et al 2021 in fact there are some patterns of teleconnection that may be related to precipitation and do not occur in isolation wise et al 2015 together these research papers provide important insights into the understanding of climate unpredictability on a global scale including north america ge and gong 2009 lau and weng 2002 trenberth et al 2014 and california abatzoglou 2011 allen and anderson 2018 guan et al 2013 sheppard et al 2002 zhang et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 those research projects establish the main large scale teleconnection patterns that could affect the united states and in particular the state of california they are antarctic oscillation aao jian qi 2010 arctic oscillation ao dai and tan 2017 north atlantic oscillation nao hurrell and deser 2010 pacific north american pattern pna wallace and gutzler 1981 madden julian oscillation mjo zhou et al 2020 west pacific oscillation wpo that is west pacific wp choi and moon 2012 previously described by barnston et al 1991 and j wallace and gutzler 1981 eastern pacific oscillation epo dai and tan 2019a el niño along southern oscillation enso whan and zwiers 2016 and pacific decadal oscillation pdo mcafee 2014 newman et al 2016 additional observational work in combination with modelling studies is essential to acquire knowledge of the relationship between precipitation in california and teleconnection patterns luković et al 2021 as has been previously mentioned examining precipitation is an enduring concern both in the long term and within extreme weather events this research is original and it is important to highlight that it shows the most recent results in rainfall trends in california on a monthly seasonal and annual time scale the leading aim of this study is to investigate the space time progression of precipitation at a regional level in order to enlighten on the one hand the trend and its statistical significance for the entire state of california for the period of 1980 2019 at a monthly seasonal and annual rate on the other hand this study ground breaking to our knowledge examines the relationship between precipitation and up to a total of nine teleconnection patterns with its most probable influence on the californian climate during the period mentioned above it provides the possible links between different teleconnection patterns on rainfall in california another unique feature of this research is to achieve objective regionalisation by clustering meteorological stations according to their links with rainfall recorded in california and the teleconnection patterns selected finally it is considered that the conclusions of this might support managers of land planning not only will they be able to put into practice confidence building measures to tackle global warming but also to take measures in order to overcome the adverse effects of this phenomenon subsequent work is needed to evaluate how trends may evolve in response to future climate variability moreover it will become possible to anticipate future climate change the recognition of upcoming trends across a series of thresholds allows for risk management with more suitable adaptation goals 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area this research is conducted in the state of california one of largest states in the u s that covers an area of 423 955 km2 this state exhibits two main mountain ranges the sierra nevada and the coast range which give california a varied landscape the coast range goes from the northwest right down to the mexican border spanning 1300 km the longest and largest range in california is the sierra nevada where mount whitney at 4421 m is california s highest peak luteyn and hickman 1993 in addition the state has two distinct desert zones mojave and colorado california boasts several major rivers and lakes such as the sacramento river and lake tahoe fig 1 the californian climate is highly variable although a mediterranean climate prevails all over the state except for the highland area of klamath where there is a temperate climate rivas martínez et al 2011 moreover in the southeast of this state there is a somewhat tropical climate in the sonoran desert killam et al 2014 its complex topography and great latitudinal extension favour a wide variety of climates from desert to subalpine environments pathak et al 2018 thus its proximity to the pacific coast is one of the determining factors in the climate of the state 2 2 data rainfall values from the climatic database of the meteorological stations were used and were available on the wrcc website western regional climate center 2020 from 1980 to 2019 initially monthly rainfall mm data were selected from 350 stations the meteorological stations were chosen due to criteria based on completeness length and homogeneity in most of the state he and gautam 2016 only stations with less than 10 of missing values were chosen the gaps were completed with the corresponding monthly long term mean value ríos cornejo et al 2015 after that analysis of the homogeneity of the data was tested blöschl et al 2019 gocic and trajkovic 2013 karmeshu 2015 song et al 2019 this study was determined by the run test thom 1966 at a 95 confidence level this test is recommended by the wmo because it is not necessary for the analysed series to follow normal criteria and it has also been used previously in other climatic studies del río et al 2013 meseguer ruiz and sarricolea 2017 finally 165 stations were chosen for the study adding their altitude values and geographic coordinates fig 1 to enable the results be represented on maps as will be discussed below moreover for each one of the meteorological stations seasonal and annual rainfall values were calculated it is widely known that there are four seasons in california spring march april and may summer june july and august autumn september october and november and winter december january and february henceforth those months will be named mam jja son djf the annual rainfall series in california were computed using voronoi polygons considering the weather stations in accordance with the area of each polygon hijmans et al 2021 2 3 trend analysis firstly to attain the slope results from the selected stations we applied a modified sen s slope method and the mann kendall test liu et al 2020 with r package version 4 1 0 the sen slope estimator is a non parametric technique that estimates variations per unit of time in a series where there is a linear trend trend analysis was carried out on a monthly seasonal and annual basis secondly to estimate trends and statistical significance the non parametric mann kendall test was used this kendall tau test is one of the most commonly applied non parametric tests for noticing trends in environmental time series data he and gautam 2016 kukal and irmak 2016 peña angulo et al 2021 sarricolea et al 2019 particularly in hydrological ones ahmad et al 2015 in many areas of the globe it is complicated to assess the climate since there is a lack in the number of weather stations available díaz padilla et al 2011 therefore statistical interpolation of the values is necessary for some specific regions empirical bayesian kriging ebk was used as a method of interpolation of geographic values as it is superior to other predictors and progressively so with data complexity in addition it provides both a straightforward and robust method of data interpolation barber et al 2017 gribov and krivoruchko 2020 krivoruchko 2012 to conduct this interpolation arcgis 10 8 environmental systems research institute esri 2019 software was used and to be more precise an ebk geoprocessing tool was applied furthermore 17 rainfall trend contour maps were created using the same software and areas with statistical significance 95 confidence level were overlaid onto the contour maps 2 4 selecting the atmospheric teleconnection patterns similar to other research cordero et al 2011 guirguis et al 2019 yu et al 2019 values of the atmospheric circulation pattern indices were selected from the climate prediction center available on the noaa national climatic data center ncdc website https www ncdc noaa gov teleconnections it must be pointed out that the real time multivariate madden julian oscillation rmm indices were obtained from the australian bureau of meteorology https www bom gov au climate mjo graphics rmm 74torealtime txt it is important to mention that madden julian oscillation mjo is both a global scale complex teleconnection pattern of tropical atmosphere and the dominant mode of inter seasonal tropical variability zheng et al 2018 the real time multivariate index rmm is a commonly used index for defining mjo the two principal components are rmm1 and rmm2 and they have been shown to be suitable indices of mjo and related variability wheeler and hendon 2004 consequently mjo is a two dimensional phase space rmm1 and rmm2 pattern and their union results in 8 equatorial phases the teleconnection patterns chosen first that can influence the climate in the united states and in the state of california were el niño 3 4 enso and pacific decadal oscillation pdo jiménez quiroz 2014 lee and grotjahn 2019 due to the connections in atmospheric rivers that may modify the californian climate indices for antarctic oscillation aao arctic oscillation ao madden julian oscillation mjo north atlantic oscillation nao pacific north american pattern pna west pacific oscillation wpo and east pacific oscillation epo were also considered to discover relationships between rainfall and the teleconnection patterns selected the partial non parametric spearman test was applied at confidence level of 95 liu et al 2020 its simple interpretation robustness and ability to capture nonlinear correlations makes it a perfect choice for detecting monotonic trends this method gives less importance to outliers and eliminates the effect that the time variable can have on rainfall and teleconnection pattern variables which thereby avoids false relationships ríos cornejo et al 2015 finally using r software both the correlation results and their statistical significance were shown on monthly maps 2 5 regionalisation in order to obtain homogeneous areas both agglomerative hierarchical cluster hca and principal component analysis pca were utilized with all the correlations obtained using the non parametric spearman test ríos cornejo et al 2015 these areas contain the meteorological stations whose precipitation is related to the same teleconnection patterns studied the pca was done based on eigenvalues 1 and the hca was conducted by the ward method and squared euclidean distance once the number of both clusters and stations belonging to each cluster was obtained a voronoi interpolation was carried out with the data in order to obtain the regionalised map this was then divided into areas according to the patterns that have shown the most correlation with precipitation 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall trends rainfall results from the global analysis in california table 1 show differences in trend directions in the entire state in april 0 28 mm year 1 may 0 13 mm year 1 and december 0 24 mm year 1 the highest values of increases are found it is worth noting that both november and march 0 68 and 0 71 mm year 1 have shown a negative trend during the period studied in addition autumn shared the same trend 0 38 mm year 1 and is the only season in which the decrease is statistically significant some of the results from examining rainfall trends positive and negative ones at monthly seasonal and annual levels from 1980 to 2019 in the state of california are shown in fig 2 in general negative trends are found in most of the months except for april may and december fig 3 when positive trends outweigh the negative ones as it can be seen in fig 3 the median slope values are located below the zero line in the majority of the months excluding may june july august september and summer where the slope is zero or close to it should be specified that in the summer period precipitation trends do not exist due to the fact that precipitation in those months is 0 mm for most years in the period studied this lack of precipitation in summer is similar to mediterranean climate territories around the world one particular example of how trends vary each month season or annually can be observed in the station at yosemite and is represented in both figs 4 and 5 in this meteorological station both positive april and negative september trends are shown with a red line it is also important to mention the difference between the results presented in table 1 and fig 6 both of them show rainfall trends but the former is for the whole state in a general approach and the latter is an empirical bayesian kriging interpolation of all the meteorological stations selected in this study giving a detailed result for each part of the state of california as was mentioned above fig 6 shows the geographical distribution of rainfall trends on a monthly seasonal and annual time scale the results of the spatial distribution trends in rainfall and their statistical significance on annual levels in california show two localized areas discriminated by the trends they present from yreka to sacramento and from the san joaquin valley over to san francisco and the rest of southern california a negative rainfall trend is presented in fact 70 of the meteorological stations studied have shown that trend in the aforementioned areas there has been a gradual decline in rainfall up to 0 2 mm year 1 which is consistent with other research polade et al 2017 however northern areas of the state such as coastal ranges 0 49 mm year 1 the klamath mountains cascade ranges 0 20 mm year 1 susanville and lake tahoe 0 40 mm year 1 have shown positive trends as is mentioned above several researchers have found that daily precipitation events had shown a steady rise over the last five decades showing a difference between the north and the south in terms of precipitation berg and hall 2015 killam et al 2014 swain et al 2016 according to previous research he and gautam 2016 average precipitation has shown no statistically significant trends in any month for any territories and remarkably in our case none of the study areas have shown statistically significant trends annually seasonally or monthly but for june and autumn a decrease in the precipitation trend could be observed in march 92 of the stations this is consistent with previous research conducted in other parts of the world which showed a negative trend during this month boé and terray 2008 da silva et al 2015 mosaffa et al 2020 río et al 2011 in this study empirical proof has shown over the period studied a negative trend of 2 mm year 1 in some points of sierra nevada curiously from bridgeport to mount whitney 0 8 mm year 1 which constitute higher altitude areas it is worth pointing out that the snow accumulation period became shorter and for this reason the snowpack accumulation in sierra nevada will decrease guan et al 2013 in addition a downward trend was found in most of the territory except for in the vicinity of eureka in this area a positive trend was found of 0 8 mm year 1 turning now to results in april and may they show increasing trends which is the general pattern in most of the state 58 and 63 of the stations respectively fig 2 during april mainly in the northern territories from yreka the klamath mountains asarian and walker 2016 redding to oroville placerville auburn and over to mount whitney there is a sharp increase 1 4 mm year 1 in rainfall it is remarkable that in may on the coast ranges san francisco sacramento valley and northern california a steady decline in rainfall 0 15 mm year 1 can be seen if we focus on our results in spring 0 06 mm year 1 they are consistent up to a point with a decreasing trend 0 1 cm decade 1 found in other research he and gautam 2016 in our research it has been found that in the north apart from the sacramento valley a positive trend appears from 0 12 mm to 0 6 mm year 1 fig 6 this is entirely different to what happens in southern areas such as in san diego the laguna mountains and riverside where there is negative rainfall up to 0 6 mm year 1 in this regard 73 of the meteorological stations show negative trends according to this data water storage and supply systems are essentially dependent on winter spring snowpack diffenbaugh et al 2015 in addition rainfall decreases for the months of march through may which explains much of the variation in the area destroyed by fires each year in this regard years with low spring rainfall meant a disproportionately large percentage of the total area was devastated by fire dennison et al 2008 if we now turn to the results in june july and august no increase in rainfall trends were found for instance 55 of the stations in june show negative trends it is important to mention that during these months most of the state has values of 0 mm over the period studied in fact in june there is a significant negative trend 0 1 mm year 1 in the mojave desert in that area the results showed a steady decline in the last month 0 35 mm year 1 however it is not statistically significant related to summer similar results 90 of stations have been found although a negative trend 0 25 mm year 1 appears in sierra nevada and this suggests an intensification of the probability of dry summers in the future this will become more common throughout california he and gautam 2016 and it will be prone to occasional drought episodes droughts in southwestern united states have been intensified by unusual warm summer temperatures and by the lack of rainfall cayan et al 2013 according to the results in rainfall trends during the months of september october and november negative values are found in each of those months 75 82 and 95 of the stations studied respectively negative trends bestrew the whole of california but the southern areas show the lowest values for instance the vicinities of mount ritter showed the highest negative values in september 1 26 mm year 1 while in november up to 2 8 mm year 1 this result coincides up to a point with other research that claimed a negative precipitation trend of 0 62 mm month year for november luković et al 2021 our results fig 6 are differentiated into regional isoclines where different gradients are observed unlike in the aforementioned research where the values are for the entire state of california the rainfall trend observed in autumn by other authors establishes that based on observational precipitation records from the last few decades decreases in rainfall trends were considered during son season since 1979 luković et al 2021 that statement coincides with our results the whole of the state of california displays a decrease in rainfall over the period of study 92 of the stations the negative trend found in sierra nevada areas is meaningful 1 35 mm year 1 and the fact that a statistically significant negative trend appears in the surroundings of san francisco 0 9 mm year 1 is of interest this coincides with the research that claimed that there is a statically significant decrease in rainfall in autumn 0 25 mm month year and suggests lower precipitation conditions at the beginning of the wet season in recent decades luković et al 2021 in addition a decrease in non extreme precipitation dominates the drier autumn and spring dong et al 2019 according to the monthly results in january a steady rise in rainfall was observed over sierra nevada 0 3 mm year 1 and it spreads to the san rafael mountains santa lucia ranges and the san gabriel mountains up to 0 9 mm year 1 meanwhile in the southern part of the state and inland in the vicinity of the mojave desert there is a negative trend in rainfall 0 6 mm year 1 this trend is found in 60 of the stations and can be clearly observed in the san francisco bay 0 9 mm year 1 it also spreads north through the sacramento valley 0 6 mm year 1 to yreka 0 3 mm year 1 moving to february the results show that there is a positive trend 2 25 mm year 1 in the northern half of the state particularly in sierra nevada areas close to oroville 1 85 mm year 1 and auburn in contrast during this month the areas in the south have shown decreases 1 35 mm year 1 in rainfall mainly in the area adjacent to mount witney 0 40 mm year 1 independence and mariposa this result in february coincides with other research that northern mid and high latitude regions are expected to become wetter while southern subtropical areas are likely to become drier berg and hall 2015 finally some research explains that in response to global warming there is usually a dry winter throughout the mediterranean climate regions as a consequence of poleward expansion in subtropical dry zones dong and leung 2021 as can be observed in fig 6 a positive trend 1 2 mm year 1 is shown in december except for in some coastal areas with no trends such as san francisco bay monterey the san rafael mountains diablo range and san luis obispo moreover the vicinities of el centro show negative trends 0 6 mm year 1 the trends are mostly small during the wet season but there is a slight tendency toward moisture being positive but similar to zero 0 35 cm decade 1 berg and hall 2015 some research explains that more than half of the annual precipitation drops in winter chang et al 2015 he and gautam 2016 it is worth noting that in this research the analysis of trend anomalies in precipitation low during two consecutive winters 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 with the influence of el niño pattern has been considered wang et al 2017 for example during winter in sierra nevada california a great number of storms are associated with atmospheric rivers ar guan et al 2013 moreover ar will probably increase rainfall and snowmelt in sierra nevada huang et al 2020b atmospheric rivers are modulated by teleconnection patterns guirguis et al 2019 the following section elaborates on the correlations of precipitation with teleconnection patterns taking everything into consideration these results suggest that the situation could be leading to a rise in seasonal rainfall in california in this regard creating models of hydrological procedures already provide adequate spatial detail in order to evaluate hydroclimatic causes that will be life threatening in preparation for risk to water resources and ecosystems risk of wildfire and other crucial matters cayan et al 2013 climate models show that extended warming and intensification of seasonal drying trends in the future are likely to result in further rises in extreme autumn fire weather situations all over california goss et al 2020 3 2 teleconnection patterns this section will show the results of the spatial and statistical analysis between rainfall and the nine teleconnection patterns chosen together these results provide important insights into understanding the link that teleconnection patterns might have had on the rainfall over california from 1980 to 2019 the results are summarised in fig 7 except for the epo data in december which was not available the results are also shown on monthly maps where the meteorological stations in red are significantly correlated positive or negative with each one of the patterns studied figs 8 to 17 it is well known that pacific decadal oscillation pdo affects the rainfall relationship with el niño southern oscillation enso in this area with positive interference pavia et al 2016 if we focus on our results the meteorological stations which significantly correlate with pdo are located in northern coastal areas in april may and august except for in december where the correlations also appear in southern coastal areas fig 8 these results are consistent with other research in which pdo enso brings precipitation and takes place along the northern californian coast and over sierra nevada guirguis et al 2019 it is important to observe that previous research work has pointed out that in summer over the centre and southern areas of california despite the lack of correlation small or insignificant the contributions of these two patterns to causing precipitation are significant cheng et al 2021 in the same manner as in other local research los angeles has years where there is more than beyond average rainfall during a positive phase of pdo this variability in precipitation is influenced by enso and pdo whose relationships becomes stronger in the southern areas of the state killam et al 2014 the increase in winter pluvial risks over the entire state of california are connected with positive phases of pdo while positive phases of enso affect northern california kam and sheffield 2016 our study found that enso is likely to explain the precipitation trend in january february and march fig 9 and accordingly enso is a more meaningful predictor than pdo over briefer periods such as from october to march cheng et al 2021 in our study 18 1 of the stations seem to be affected by enso in january and 11 5 in both february and march in other research californian precipitation showed a strong correlation with extratropical cyclone weather conditions over the eastern pacific to the west of california with positive correlation 0 8 chang et al 2015 however chang et al 2015 mentioned that enso can only shed light on part of the link between californian rainfall and extratropical cyclone activity due to the fact that the correlation between winter rainfall and el niño 3 4 index was just 0 38 between 1979 1980 and 2013 2014 moving to the results of correlations between pacific north american teleconnection patterns pna and precipitation it is interesting that 37 0 of the stations correlate in june fig 10 positive pna circulation phases make northern california dry because of the association of pna with drier forms that seep into northern california this in turn leads to fewer dry conditions in southern california and west coast southwest california lin et al 2017 during the month of june most of the stations correlated with pna are located in the central areas of the state this pattern might therefore be related to the distribution of rainfall for example as we saw in the previous section there is a slight decrease in the precipitation trend in june during the years of study in addition pdo enso and pna have been proven to have significant correlation with precipitation and groundwater fluctuations velasco et al 2017 it is worth noting that predicting winter precipitation over a 3 4 week period in the southern and eastern us it is highly correlated to nao enso 3 4 and pna indices wang and robertson 2019 if we focus on north atlantic oscillation nao fig 11 it is the major large scale teleconnection pattern over the extra tropical atlantic ocean whan and zwiers 2016 in this study the results show that february and may are the months with the highest correlation with precipitation 61 8 and 50 3 in addition there is a lower value in april 13 9 where the correlated meteorological stations are found both in the coastal areas of los angeles san diego and sierra nevada ranges fig 11 decadal wet phases of the precipitation pattern in california are associated with november to march circulation modes such as low south eastern pressure from the nao pattern this favours recurrent north pacific winter storms shifting towards california cayan et al 1998 hurrell 1995 in this regard the nao exerts a substantial influence on precipitation in other mediterranean climate type regions lópez moreno et al 2011 nao is a regional manifestation of a hemispheric wide mode known as arctic oscillation ao ao has been defined as the atmospheric pressure at middle latitudes that fluctuates between negative and positive phases its high frequency oscillation from those phases impacts on both daily and weekly patterns brolley 2007 sellars et al 2015 a typically positive negative ao phase is linked with wetter drier conditions over california in fact ao has been claimed to correlate with the forecast of precipitation differences across california at least from 2015 to 2017 wang and robertson 2019 moreover this pattern correlates highly with the north atlantic oscillation pattern walker and bliss 1932 and has been an issue of much interest over the last few years e g wallace and gutzler 1981 hurrell 1995 previous research has claimed that those two patterns correlate well together there is a clear difference that could illustrate how we attempt to unravel physical mechanisms in northern hemisphere atmospheric irregularity ambaum et al 2001 according to this our ao correlation results fig 12 showed 29 1 in the central northern areas of the state mainly in june according to our madden julian oscillation mjo results rmm1 seems to have a stronger relationship with precipitation than rmm2 over the period studied figs 13 and 14 it is important to note that mainly meteorological stations located in san francisco bay and its vicinities had shown any correlation these results agree with other research that investigated the inter annual variability in the range of mjo found and apparently there are no direct and systematic relationships between extreme precipitation and this index jones 2000 however recent research has claimed that mjo would be suitable as a predictor of pentad precipitation at weeks 3 6 15 42 days nardi et al 2020 the western pacific oscillation wpo pattern is one of the foremost teleconnection patterns over winter months in the northern hemisphere dai and tan 2019b in addition wpo epo is connected with more precipitation in california which has been attributed to circulation features that disturb the path and orientation of atmospheric rivers at landfall guirguis et al 2019 according to our results epo fig 15 seems to be connected with precipitation in october 40 6 and related to trend results the effect might mean a decrease in precipitation wpo fig 16 on the other hand could have a greater effect on the increase in precipitation over april and may 41 2 and 21 2 respectively fig 12 finally according to antarctic oscillation aao high correlations have been found in february 54 5 and april 70 9 fig 17 despite these results this teleconnection pattern mainly takes place in the southern hemisphere it was stated that positive phases could alter the circulation of mjo and enso in extratropical zones of the pacific specifically in wintertime carvalho et al 2005 to sum up it can be seen that the relationship between teleconnection patterns and precipitation is widespread all over the state of california according to table 2 and related to what has been stated above precipitation in january seems to correlate mainly with enso while in february aao and nao are the most correlated patterns with precipitation 54 6 and 61 8 respectively in that month epo and enso show correlation to a lesser extent it is significant that only enso correlates in march 11 moving on to april aao is the most correlated pattern 70 3 followed by epo 18 2 and nao 13 9 the latter is the most correlated in may 50 3 followed by epo 21 2 during the summer in june for instance pna is the most correlated to precipitation in 37 0 of the meteorological stations in august the correlation values obtained by epo 11 5 and mjo 7 9 stand out the latter is the one that most correlates with precipitation 9 1 in the month of september epo and wpo are the most correlated in october while in november neither value is worth noting finally in december the teleconnection patterns that could have the greatest effect on rainfall are pdo 17 0 and pna 16 4 3 2 1 regionalisation the results of regionalisation show four different areas clusters as can be observed in fig 18 the percentage of correlation for each area is presented in fig 19 and table 2 supplementary material in the north of the state area 1 in yellow rainfall is highly correlated with aao 68 5 nao 84 9 and epo 72 6 fig 19 it is important that both of the former are related to rainfall in february while the latter are in october the area is made up of 66 meteorological stations related to the area in blue area 2 it consists of 45 meteorological stations and it extends from the centre of california up to los angeles and to the southern areas of sierra nevada in this area both aao 84 3 and wpo 69 8 correlate in april in addition here precipitation is correlated with nao 77 8 in may and to a lesser extent with pna 52 4 in june if we move to the green one area 4 that goes from death valley to r the entire mojave desert and up to oceanside 34 meteorological stations enso is highly correlated with precipitation in january february and march 62 5 58 33 and 79 8 respectively and also to a lesser extent in may 37 5 interestingly this area resembles the mojave climate region abatzoglou et al 2009 the southern area in red area 3 deals with imperial valley the southern santa rosa mountains and the mojave desert this area is made up of 20 meteorological stations and there are no clear teleconnection patterns which show high correlation to precipitation related to ao in february nao in march and pdo in december merely 40 is shown fig 18 4 conclusions the main purposes of this research were firstly to determine precipitation trends in california from 1980 to 2019 on monthly seasonal and annual levels in addition precipitation trend contour maps were designed for 17 levels moreover statistically significant areas were also overlaid on the contour maps secondly to clarify the relationship between precipitation and up to nine teleconnection patterns whose results were given on a monthly basis thirdly to highlight areas where the teleconnection patterns are correlated with precipitation and to what extent finally in accordance with the results some of the significant outcomes of this research are specified along these lines the global analysis of precipitation in california shows broad spatial and seasonal differences in trend directions throughout the whole state during the period studied the highest positive values are found in april 0 28 mm year 1 and december 0 24 mm year 1 while in march 0 71 mm year 1 and november 0 68 mm year 1 there is a negative trend both increases and decreases are established mainly in mountainous areas and consequently in those areas the difference in monthly rainfall rises showing that the precipitation phenomena happens over shorter periods of time moreover on a seasonal scale autumn has shown a significant decrease 0 38 mm year 1 in rainfall trends the data reported here appears to support the assumption that on an annual level from yreka to sacramento and san joaquin valley over san francisco to the rest of southern california a negative precipitation trend in presented 0 2 mm year 1 while the remaining territories mainly in the north have shown a positive trend 0 3 mm year 1 one of the most significant findings to emerge from this study is that in rainy seasons both in winter and spring the positive rainfall trend is located in the northern half of the state while a decrease in rainfall was brought to the fore in the southern half the teleconnection patterns that correlate most with precipitation in california are north atlantic oscillation nao el niño southern oscillation enso east pacific oscillation epo west pacific oscillation wpo and antarctic oscillation aao monthly precipitation is correlated with teleconnection patterns in april may july and august showing at least a little correlation with every pattern studied in december precipitation correlates with pacific decadal oscillation pdo and pacific north american pna california is a territory based on what is observed in this study where rainfall trends have shown great variability throughout the state due to its orography mainly in mountainous areas in addition this precipitation might be influenced by the behaviour of atmospheric teleconnection patterns due to the fact that it is a territory where teleconnection patterns commonly take place however there are four different areas where area 4 described above has shown high correlation values with enso el niño southern oscillation and rainfall over the period studied during january february and march in area 2 aao and wpo correlate the most in april while nao and pna are in may and june respectively in addition in area 1 rainfall correlates highly with aao 68 5 nao 84 9 and epo 72 6 while in area 3 there is not a clearly teleconnection pattern with more than 40 of stations correlated finally the authors consider that these findings provide insights for future research related to teleconnection patterns and meteorological phenomena in addition it is important to research local physics topography thermodynamics and also to investigate other potential driving factors of change moreover the results of this study have a broad implication for the future for example knowing about the past and trying to predict how precipitation will behave on a more detailed scale than that which has been investigated previously to our knowledge in this regard this research can help other professionals such as environmental managers and politicians to take the necessary measures in the face of precipitation processes whereabouts they should take them and with what urgency processes that due to climate change are expected

3106,two way feedback between humans and flood systems is important for a better understanding of flood resilience and how flood risk evolves over time through human adaptation however most studies on this subject have assumed human traits and actions to be uniform overlooking the diversity of human responses to floods furthermore in many developing countries the flood protection infrastructure is co managed and co maintained through the involvement of local communities as well as external or governmental support however the influences of differing levels of external intervention on the long term outcome of co management and on community behavior remain underexplored in this study we aimed to overcome this issue by considering a community as a heterogeneous group under flood risk via geographically explicit agent based modeling this method allowed us to computationally experiment on how human flood interactions are conditioned by variations in household level attributes and governmental support specifically our study considered the community based flood protection system in the ganges brahmaputra river basin in bangladesh our results suggest that heterogeneities in the geographic location income and flood damage have significant effects on the outcome of human flood interactions specifically cooperative efforts toward minimizing flood damage and maintaining flood protection structures our results also highlight that a moderate level of governmental support i e assisting with only a part of the required labor is necessary to maintain the infrastructure built to promote cooperative action in a community scale flood protection system overall we believe our agent based model provides a potential for investigating the community dynamics from modeling individual level human flood interactions ultimately provide a guidance for planning future governmental support for self managed flood protection system keywords human flood interaction external support agent based modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction flooding is the most common natural hazard worldwide and is a leading cause of human fatality economic loss and damage to the built and natural environments ncei 2021 smith and matthews 2015 efforts to minimize flood damage have focused on better managing floodplains such as by building levees or improving the accuracy of flood forecasting despite these efforts the results have been less than satisfactory in many cases further climate change has led to an increase in the frequency and intensity of floods in many regions escalating flood risks in the long run di baldassarre 2017 abebe et al 2019 structural measures such as levees and dams remain the norm for containing floods however there is growing evidence that these methods may lead to increases in flood risk in the long run because of human adaptation i e increased floodplain development and a gradual decline of people s awareness of flood risk ludy and kondolf 2012 di baldassarre et al 2018 human activity is increasingly recognized to be a key factor in evaluating flood risk this stems from the recognition that humans adapt their activities in response to evolving flood risks and in turn the modified activity feeds back to alter the flood risks although considerable research has been performed on the human dimension of flood risk aerts et al 2018 tonn and guikema 2018 gober and wheater 2015 most studies have either been static in nature the hydrological and socioeconomic conditions that defined the context in which the human response to flooding occurred were assumed to be fixed or non interactive or they have been limited to a quantitative description of human behavior and flood risk awareness aerts et al 2018 recently scholars have begun to view the issue as a dynamic one consequently they have applied modeling to study the co evolution or two way feedback between humans and flood systems and the system level outcomes that emerge from such interactions e g di baldassarre et al 2013 2015 sivapalan et al 2012 2014 pande and sivapalan 2017 these socio hydrology studies have incorporated the interplay of flood events risk perception and flood coping strategies into their modeling frameworks di baldassarre et al 2013 2015 liao 2012 sung et al 2018 yu et al 2017 one less explored aspect of the existing socio hydrology modeling framework is the representation of the heterogeneities in individual level traits and the spatial explicitness of such individual level interactions often individuals responses to floods are assumed to be homogeneous individuals are also assumed to be well mixed with equal probabilities of encountering and interacting with every other person in the model society in reality however individual households tend to be heterogeneous in attributes such as income flood risk awareness and geographic location which can influence how human flood interactions play out lechowska 2018 botzen et al 2009 qasim et al 2016 for example people living in a flood prone area have a greater perception of flood risks being exposed to frequent floods causes income disparity especially when people s sources of income are negatively affected by floods for example farming and crop failure due to floods lechowska 2018 further differences in the physical locations of households can induce variations in flood experience thereby causing heterogeneities in their risk perception and household income lechowska 2018 knighton et al 2021 these differences affect how individuals respond to future floods o neil et al 2016 nevertheless little research has focused on the effects of household level heterogeneities especially the attributes of geographic location income and flood risk awareness on the trajectory of human flood interactions sultana 2010 lechowska 2018 few but a growing number of studies have pointed toward the importance of incorporating individual level heterogeneities and interactions into dynamic modeling to gain system level insights loucks 2015 abebe et al 2019 hyun et al 2019 in this regard agent based modeling is a suitable modeling approach because it facilitates the representation of the heterogeneous decision making of individual agents and the exploration of the macro level outcomes that emerge from such decisions troy et al 2015 dewan et al 2015 agent based modeling is also spatially explicit in the sense that it allows localized interactions among agents on patches or spatial grids with different physical conditions balica et al 2009 there are studies that reflected such spatial aspects of human responses to floods aerts et al 2018 dawson et al 2011 tesfatsion et al 2017 haer et al 2017 dubbelboer et al 2017 these studies reported that the spatial disparity of individual agents is one of the key factors influencing human behavior and the perception of disaster risk another important aspect of human flood interaction is the role of external or governmental support in building and maintaining flood management systems this aspect has been studied in the context of developing countries where flood protection systems are often co managed and co maintained by local communities and public agencies khalid and shafiai 2015 abbas et al 2015 van voorst 2015 some studies reported the positive effects of external support for example early flood warnings and the partial support from outside have contributed to improved evacuation and recovery efforts khalid and shafiai 2015 abbas et al 2015 on the other hand studies also suggested that unintended consequences can arise in the long run from external support abbas et al 2015 van voorst 2015 for example the support of the bangladesh government and non governmental organizations ngos in the construction of large scale levees in coastal areas helped reduce flood damage but might also have led to a decline in the flood risk awareness and voluntary behavior among people bwdb 1989 shaw 2006 one interesting notion explaining this phenomenon is motivation crowding which means that providing extrinsic incentives e g monetary rewards for voluntary tasks or community affairs can undermine or crowd out people s intrinsic motivation that previously enabled them to make voluntary contributions frey and jegen 2001 the concept of motivation crowding has been applied to the context of flood management and it has been reported that governmental assistance to reduce or compensate flood damage tends to minimize individual efforts for self protection in the long run raschky et al 2013 these studies however were mostly qualitative in nature and the long term effects of external support on people s motivation and flood coping capacity remain underexplored islam and walkerden 2015 calling for quantitative modeling research this study aimed to bridge the previously mentioned research gaps 1 incorporating individual level heterogeneity to investigate its influence on human flood interaction and 2 exploring the effect of external governmental support on human flood interaction accordingly we examined the emergence of system dynamics from the spatially explicit interactions of household agents in managing a community level flood protection system specifically in the context of a developing country we also investigated how different levels of government intervention influence emergent outcomes we developed an agent based model abm by extending an existing dynamic model of a community managed flood protection system known as polders yu et al 2017 sung et al 2018 our model was motivated by the use of polders in the ganges brahmaputra river basin bangladesh where considerable flood risk is ever present and the maintenance of the flood protection infrastructure has partially devolved to local communities we developed a stylized abm for the specific case wherein the built infrastructure for flood protection is managed by the community members voluntary actions the abm is used as a tool to understand the general system dynamics by studying the different possible responses of a modeled system the general dynamics in our study encompassed the process whereby previous flood experiences shaped the reactions toward future flood damage in terms of having different payoffs social memories and decision making for participating avoiding flood maintenance work in this respect our model used heuristic values for understanding human flood interactions in a developing country context 2 study area and methods 2 1 polder maintenance in coastal bangladesh in this study we focused on the human flood interactions in the ganges brahmaputra river in southwestern bangladesh bangladesh has long suffered from flooding because most of the region is located in a low lying delta and heavy monsoons bring frequent and large floods yang et al 2015 yu et al 2017 in addition poverty and low rates of economic growth with high population density have prevented the society from responding appropriately to flood disasters thereby increasing the vulnerability to floods ahmad and ahmed 2004 the bangladesh government and ngos have implemented engineering measures for flood protection including the construction of embankments along the coast to protect communities from floods although these embankments have contributed to mitigating flood damage and allowing agriculture ahmed et al 2008 ishtiaque et al 2017 this governmental support has not been effective or helpful in controlling floods in addition the support of ngos has not been sufficiently sustained to manage flood protection systems in the long term and some support projects were not well designed for the community shaw 2006 for these reasons many studies have suggested that external support complicates flood risk and increases vulnerability in relation to the independent management ability of community members ahmad and ahmed 2004 pal et al 2011 although the role of government is less explicit in rural areas ngos and local governments still exist and try to support polder management work priyanka 2006 therefore this study aimed to investigate how external support changes the dynamics of the voluntarily flood protection system in the ganges brahmaputra river basin in bangladesh 2 2 socio hydrologic modeling framework for flood community interactions the general modeling framework is described in fig 1 a the social conditions marked in the shaded area were investigated via the abm because each agent had different social conditions depending on their tendency to participate in flood maintenance work or their physical location a basic equation for each variable was formulated based on the existing literature including yu et al 2017 and di baldassarre et al 2013 this section first explains the hydrological variables that are uniformly assigned to the whole system and then explains the social variables including governmental support modeled for individual agents subsequently we provide the detailed setups and parameters of the simulations that we performed table 1 provides the parameter values used in this study 2 2 1 flood damage to levee the damage from floods f was modeled according to the equation below which was developed by di baldassarre et al 2013 we assumed that flooding occurs when the water level w is higher than the current flood protection level k which was represented by the levee height above the riverbank in this study 1 f 1 exp σ f w w k 0 o t h e r w i s e where σ f represents the sensitivity of the damage to high water levels households located in high flood risk areas are assumed to experience more severe damage under floods thus σ f varies depending on the location of the household 2 2 2 soil salinity dynamics for farming productivity floods also cause saline water logging in the polder and significantly reduce farming productivity world bank group 2001 because the crop output of the polder critically depends on the average salinity in the root zone of the soil s the farming yield is highly influenced by flooding events based on yu et al 2017 the dynamics of s are modeled in eq 2 2 ds dt q f σ s where q is the rate of gain in soil salinity caused by floods f and σ is the leaching efficiency used to factor the contribution to effectively washing out the salt mass such as for the soil moisture soil porosity and root depth suweis et al 2010 2 2 3 flood protection level dynamics we represent the average height of the embankment above the riverbank as the flood protection level k with the dynamics of k shown in the equation below 3 dk dt r δ k k h where k decays because of natural erosion and sometimes breached by large floods community members mobilize collective action to satisfy k as their flood protection goal k and reduce the gap between k and k i e minimize δ k k k here r denotes the amount of the embankment repaired by collective maintenance and h is the decay caused by embankment breaching the embankment height deteriorated by natural erosion is calculated as δ k k where the term δ k represents the annual erosion rate for further details refer to yu et al 2017 and sung et al 2018 2 2 4 social memory dynamics social memory m represents how much the community is aware of the seriousness of flood risk di baldassarre et al 2013 viglione et al 2014 the level of flood awareness largely depends on the previous experience with flood events and naturally decreases if the community does not experience floods thus we model the dynamics of social memory m as shown in eq 4 following di baldassarre et al 2013 4 dm dt μ m f δ m m where μ m is the coefficient for the rate of gain in social memory of a flooding event and δ m represents the annual decay rate of social memory because social memory m is dependent on flood damage f it differs between a high flood risk area and the other areas people living in a high flood risk area tend to have a stronger and longer social memory of the same flood event 2 2 5 maintenance labor under external support in our study area i e the ganges brahmaputra river basin in southwestern bangladesh the government provides economic benefits to community members such as wages or agricultural production as compensation priyanka 2006 to capture the role of the government engaging in flood maintenance work we introduce eq 5 to quantify the maintenance work done by cooperators and government according to the changing level of governmental support sp 5 l m l m s p l m 1 s p where l m s p represents the amount of labor performed by the government and l m 1 s p is the amount of labor performed by cooperators who actively engage in flood maintenance work 2 3 agent based model for community behavior 2 3 1 spatially explicit agent based model the objective of developing the abm in this study was to better capture the decision making process of each agent concerning their decision to participate in or avoid levee maintenance work which was determined by the interaction with their adjacent neighbors these decision making processes ultimately shape the entire dynamics of the collective action for maintaining the flood protection infrastructure we implemented the abm using netlogo software wilensky and rand 2015 which is widely used for agent based modeling and for monitoring the characteristics of agents on spatial and temporal scales furthermore it allowed spatially explicit data to be incorporated into the model which could reveal the effects of the geospatial characteristics of the agents as shown in fig 1 b and table 2 the abm was initialized with the geospatial information of the study area which is based on the flood inundation map generated when a large flood occurred in 2017 furthermore community members choose their strategies i e cooperators or defectors every year based on the financial benefits received by their adjacent neighbors additionally note that the model assumed that households in high flood risk areas suffered larger flood damage than households outside high flood risk areas 2 3 2 decision making processes of agents the agents in this study are households and they were divided into two groups cooperators and defectors the cooperators are community members that try to contribute to flood relief efforts these people voluntarily participate in levee maintenance work on a regular basis or immediately after flooding to mitigate flood damage paul and routray 2010 on the other hand the defectors avoid levee maintenance work and try to find another income source outside of the polder when flooding makes farming impossible each household decides every year about whether to be a cooperator or defector as they learn about and follow in the steps of their geographically adjacent neighbors with better payoffs regarding flood mitigation activities in bangladesh we set up the following rule for the decision process of each agent a household compares its annual payoff π to those of its four adjacent neighbors every year and follows the strategy of the neighbors with the greatest income following yu et al 2017 the payoff of cooperators and defectors π c and π d respectively are modeled as shown in eqs 6 and 7 respectively 6 π c p 1 f b l f c α a 1 α z l e c λ 1 ε 1 x 7 π d p 1 f b l f d α a 1 α z l e d l f l l m γ 1 ξ x x 1 ξ m m where x refers to the rate of cooperators and is calculated by counting the cooperators each year the superscripts c and d refer to the benefits received by cooperators and defectors respectively in addition b is a farming yield productivity factor that is a function of salinity sung et al 2018 this study assumed that all the households have the same amount of available labor and acreage a for farming a household allocates their labor among three activities every year farming l f polder maintenance l m and outside employment l e among these laborers only defectors offer their labor for outside employment the farming income diverges as a result of two factors 1 people seeking outside employment cooperators or defectors and 2 people in a flood prone area experiencing more damage from floodwater along with more severe soil salinity living in a flood prone area or outside it the third term in eq 7 models social ostracism this study assumed that the intensity of ostracism varied in the following situations rule violations are overlooked when households depend much more on outside employment than agriculture that is l f l l m 0 which occurs because the individuals receive fewer incentives to maintain the polder such tolerance diminishes as the dependence on agriculture increases social ostracism intensifies when there are a large number of cooperators or the community is well aware of the flood risk overall the effect of social ostracism can be modeled as shown in eq 8 8 socialostracism l f l l m γ 1 ξ x x 1 ξ m m where γ is the default penalty and ξ x and ξ m represent the multiplicative coefficients for the additional penalties induced by one unit increases in x and m respectively here social ostracism encompasses all the penalties that the defector receives via the formal or informal institutions that exist in a society these consequences include the councils or watchmen appointed by community members chastising their behavior resulting in giving the defectors a bad reputation and limiting their access to certain types of common resources sethi and somanathan 1996 our model calculates the payoffs at the individual level to make a comparison with neighbors to assist in decision making individuals can have one of four different payoffs in each year payoffs for cooperators defectors in high general flood risk areas the payoffs for cooperators and defectors vary with the amount of labor including that of defectors pursuing outside income and cooperators participating in flood maintenance along with the social ostracism imposed on defectors the difference in the payoffs in high and general flood risk areas is mainly the result of flood damage and its impacts on social memory and soil salinity which are larger in high flood risk areas investigating individual level modeling is distinctive to the study of yu et al 2017 which calculated the payoffs of two different groups and compared the group scale incomes to calculate the number of cooperators table 3 provides the list of heterogeneity factors used in the model appendix table a 1 also provides the abm of human water interaction of this study according to the odd d protocol which stands for overview design concepts and details for the abm that includes human decision making 2 3 3 numerical experiments in this study we conducted a set of simulations with 100 repetitions with k varying from 0 4 to 1 and sp varying from 0 0 no governmental support to 0 8 we assumed that when either the group of cooperators or that of the defectors was highly dominant i e larger than 99 and the average payoff of the dominant group was smaller than that of the other group 1 of all the households turned into the opposite group this assumption was made to prevent the effect of close neighbors from being excessively assessed and to capture the effect of the general atmosphere of the entire community on individuals the other underlying assumption was that the initial rate of cooperators was 90 based on the situation in our study area where the cooperation of local communities is currently the major driver in maintaining the flood protection infrastructure sultana and thompson 2017 we note that the dynamics of the modeled system can vary significantly with different initial conditions for example a flood protection system with a very low rate of cooperators is less likely to be maintained yu et al 2017 nevertheless this study focused on the ideal situation in our case study context that of a high rate of cooperators with relatively high social memory regarding the number of simulations we found that the use of 100 simulations reduced the variance of the modeled variables sufficiently to describe the general phenomena of the modeled system fig 2 we investigated the dynamics for 100 years with the following rationales the hydrological cycle was assumed to have non stationary variability for 100 years and the flood protection structure was generally designed for a 100 year return period although this concept is debatable in the hydrologic field read and vogel 2015 moreover 100 years is a sufficiently long time period to investigate the evolution of human traits such as social norms and ultimately the trajectories of human water interactions furthermore we conducted an additional set of simulations with 100 repititons with k varying from 0 4 to 1 using a lumped model that did not consider the household based heterogeneity this was done to compare the results when using the models from the studies of yu et al 2016 and sung et al 2017 to those with our agent based model 3 results and discussion 3 1 dynamics of collective action under external support in this section we examine how different levels of external support affected cooperators community behavior we investigated the average rate of cooperators in a simulation repeated 100 times the rate of cooperators was calculated over 50 and 100 years under various levels of external support and flood protection goals fig 3 overall the average rate of cooperators roc in fig 3 highlights the importance of external support to reinforce collective action for cooperation the external support tends to allow a wider range of flood protection goals to maintain the flood protection system in a relatively short term i e 50 years fig 3 a the community could have a high roc if the external support by the government sp was greater than 0 3 with a moderate flood protection goal k we can see that significant external support from the government would make it possible to maintain a high roc even with a very high flood protection goal when almost all the maintenance work is done by external support sp 0 9 the community could maintain a high roc under a flood protection goal of more than 0 8 however with a moderate level of support that is assistance in terms of only a part of the required labor management was sufficiently effective to ensure a high roc with a less flexible range of flood protection goals the role of governmental support is clearer when observing a system over a longer term fig 3 b similar to the previous case a high roc could be maintained when the external support was greater than 0 3 with certain range of flood protection goals the system tended to be more flexible when the external support was 0 7 in terms of maintaining cooperators under a wide range of flood protection goals significant external support sp 0 9 could better maintain cooperators under a more robust flood protection level note that this significant external support did not provide flexibility in the system but switched from a high roc to a higher protection goal in both the short term and long term scenarios the flood protection goal k had a clear spectrum that showed high roc values of approximately 0 7 and 0 8 respectively this goal was not too high or too low thus it could be achieved by cooperators and provide protection to prevent flooding our results highlight that a moderate level of support is sufficient to manage collective action provided reasonable flood protection goals are set although significant external support can better protect the community a system with a very robust protection level is not sustainable in particular when external support significantly contributes to building the system and the community has already adapted to such a system cutting that support off can cause significant damage our modeling results showed that the possibility of maintaining collective action was reduced after 100 years when the support level was too high i e sp greater than 0 8 and k was smaller than 0 9 governmental support significantly reduced the amount of maintenance labor required by cooperators which weakened the effect of social ostracism toward defectors as the amount of required maintenance labor increased the payoffs for cooperators decreased because the time for cooperators to engage in economic activities decreased this resulted in social ostracism toward defectors for not participating in the maintenance work leading to a decrease in their payoffs in contrast when the government took over the maintenance work of cooperators the social pressure on defectors was not significant because the labor burden of cooperators was reduced accordingly the payoffs for defectors were not affected regardless of the required amount of maintenance work these results imply that a significant amount of governmental support can lead to a paradoxical phenomenon excessive governmental engagement in a voluntarily maintained flood protection system tends to increase the number of defectors in this respect our results suggest that a modest level of governmental support i e assisting with approximately half of the required labor is desirable to reinforce collective action our analysis differs from that of previous researchers such as yu et al 2017 who presented different regimes of social norms for collective action with all cooperators or all defectors based on the target embankment height levels yu et al 2017 investigated the system using a lumped model that did not consider individual level heterogeneity see section 3 4 for further discussion our model allowed individual households to make heterogeneous decisions based on their circumstances thus the rate of cooperators could not be completely dominant or too low which was considered to be realistic 3 2 spatial patterns of cooperators and defectors this section compares two representative cases with a high roc after 100 years fig 4 b and c and the same initial model condition fig 4 a both cases effectively maintained a high roc in one most of the community members turned into cooperators whereas stable collective action arose in the other in spite of numerous defectors note that the dynamics of the social and hydrological variables in fig 5 are those for successful and fair cases both cases were simulated under the same conditions with governmental support equal to zero and a flood protection level of 0 8 under these conditions we examined how the distribution of cooperators and defectors evolved from the initial conditions fig 4 b shows a case where cooperative behavior is prevalent in this case the flood protection structure effectively safeguarded against flood events with the community well aware of the risk and the necessity of cooperation though not significant a few defectors still existed those members were located in an isolated area thus they did not have many opportunities to change their behavior and pursue greater payoffs fig 4 c shows that the remaining defectors are spatially aggregated this illustrates the important role of neighbors in a member s decision making regarding participation in flood maintenance work in addition those clustered groups could keep their current characteristics more stable by influencing their neighbors to display the same characteristics the detailed human flood dynamics of this case are shown in fig 5 fair case the spatial characteristics and their detailed dynamics indicate that the flood protection system was well maintained when the clustered cooperators helped to maintain a high rate of roc although some defectors adhered to their behaviors in addition our results showed that the defectors were mostly located outside of the high flood risk area some defectors were clustered at the edge of that area but did not spread their behaviors to the high flood risk area people living in the high flood risk area were highly aware of the potential risk and necessity of participation in flood maintenance work this caused strong social ostracism toward defectors in this area in addition sharing the work with people in other areas under a higher risk of damage by flooding reduced the labor burden ultimately the combination of less pressure for flood maintenance work and increased social ostracism toward defectors caused more people to decide to be cooperators compared to those outside the high flood risk area the spatial patterns of cooperators and defectors in our model coincided well with the results of evolutionary game theory especially the evolution of cooperators wu et al 2011 roca et al 2009 explaining the spatial aspect of the dynamics of community behaviors evolutionary game theory is popularly used in ecology and suggests that the cooperation of a community is determined by the robustness and growth of clusters of cooperators therefore the dynamics of their behaviors do not depend on the global population but on the local densities of the cooperators at the cluster interfaces in their neighborhood wu et al 2011 this supports our findings that the flood protection system can be well maintained when the cooperators increase to the dominant level i e a sufficiently high number of cooperators to achieve the required labor burden in this study and those cooperators are spatially aggregated to spread their cooperative behavior regardless of the existence of defectors 3 3 dynamics of social and hydrological variables this section describes the dynamics of the social and hydrological variables fig 5 compares randomly chosen three representative cases involving flood protection structures that have failed fail case have suffered some damage but are still well managed fair case and are well managed success case in this system each individual household compared its current payoffs to those of its adjacent neighbors to determine their participation in flood structure maintenance work and thus the spread of either defection or cooperation determined the success of the flood protection system i e fail fair and success cases fig 5 shows that the payoff gap between defectors and cooperators is the major factor driving the same system along opposite trajectories in conjunction with other factors the cooperators maintenance labor burden social ostracism and social memory the labor burden of cooperators reinforced the recognition of their devotion to the common good and increased the social ostracism of defectors who avoided maintenance responsibility and pursued their own benefits this ultimately reduced the defectors payoffs the fair case in fig 5 captures this phenomenon showing a sudden decrease in the number of cooperators and their payoffs at 60 80 years relative to defectors nevertheless the remaining cooperators continued to maintain the flood protection system as their payoffs were still slightly larger than those of defectors as cooperators were devoted to maintenance work their social ostracism toward defectors increased resulting in continually decreasing payoffs of defectors ultimately more community members chose to be cooperators because of considerable social pressure the roc recovered in the long run as in the fail case of fig 5 the opposite occurred when the labor burden required of the cooperators posed a risk to their farming livelihood and exceeded the costs associated with the social pressure they were subject to as defectors in this case more people chose to become defectors as they sought new sources of income outside their residence in addition social memory played an important role in maintaining high roc by affecting the payoffs of the two groups as suggested in previous studies di baldassarre et al 2015 sung et al 2018 yu et al 2017 the fail and fair cases in fig 5 show that social memory increased when the community suffered flood damage and decayed over time if there were no subsequent flood experiences this decreased social memory in turn diluted the awareness of the importance of flood infrastructure management as shown at 50 years in fig 5 g and at 32 50 and 80 years in fig 5 h the success case in fig 5 shows that with the community experiencing intermittent and moderate flood awareness of the importance of the flood protection system tended to promote participation in flood maintenance work thereby reducing the labor of individual cooperators these positive dynamics motivated most community members to choose to cooperate throughout the entire simulation period these results indicate that the flood protection system can be maintained despite a temporary failure to achieve flood protection goals because of an increased number of defectors which was neglected in previous studies di baldassarre et al 2015 sung et al 2018 yu et al 2017 the fair case in fig 5 b shows that the flood protection system could be restored along with the number of cooperators even though the system underwent a period when the balance of the system collapsed the protection system failed to achieve the protection goal at the 80 90 year time steps resulting in high flood damages with fewer cooperators and decreased payoffs this study captured this phenomenon by considering the behavioral changes of individuals through their interactions while previous studies have reported only all time success or failure case as they assumed that the roc was decided by the average difference in payoffs as an individual s decision making was based on their own experiences and the influence of adjacent neighbors in every time step year they were less likely to change their behavior specifically a cooperator defector completely surrounded by cooperators defectors rarely changed its behavior until the other group pervaded into its neighborhood sharing the same behavior as neighbors regulated their behavior even with a slight reduction in their payoffs in addition the results in all region solid lines and in high flood risk region dashed lines of fig 5 show that the dynamics of a flood prone area manifest distinctive characteristics compared to those of an average community the fail and fair cases show that a flood prone area had larger flood damage which led to stronger social memory for the same flood event notably the roc showed a smaller reduction as floods continued to occur cooperators in a flood prone region tended to have higher payoffs with a smaller labor burden and defectors had smaller payoffs because of greater social ostracism and stronger social memory this induced more people in a flood prone area to adjust their behavior when more people in the other region had already started to avoid maintenance work this difference did not appear in the success case 3 4 comparison to lumped model in this section we compare the results of this study to a set of simulations with a lumped model i e an existing approach with homogenous households fig 6 shows a comparison of the cooperator ratios of the agent based model and lumped model overall we found that the agent based model provided great flexibility in describing a well maintained flood protection system the 50 percentile values for the ratios of cooperators box sizes in the agent based model fig 6 a are much wider than those in the lumped case fig 6 b in all the ranges of k except when the roc is zero this implies that the flood protection system can be successfully maintained with various ranges of cooperators which reflects the reality while the lumped model describes the community as a much more rigid system furthermore the lumped model shows that the average ratio of cooperators was highly dependent on the maintenance goal the range for the ratio of cooperators in the lumped case is very high with very little uncertainty when k is 0 8 and 1 0 and it is mostly zero outside of that range k is 0 8 1 0 the low value of k infers that the community could not provide maintenance in most of the simulation cases when the actual levee height is far from their goal fig 6 b the agent based model shows that the flood protection system can be maintained under various flood maintenance goals our results highlight that the heterogeneity of individual conditions and their interactions should not be overlooked if situations on the individual level show distinctive heterogeneity and their interactions play a significant role in managing flood protection 4 conclusions this study developed and analyzed socio hydrological abm to focus on how human actions and infrastructure management affect flood resilience by incorporating individuals decision making processes related to infrastructure maintenance specifically we examined how a change in the internalized motivation or social norm for participating in levee maintenance work is conditioned by social pressure and individual level heterogeneities related to location income and flood memory in addition we created scenarios in which the government externally supports some levee maintenance work and explored how human flood dynamics are affected by this governmental support our result showed that a cooperator s reduced income with a severe burden related to managing a flood protection structure and a community s low flood awareness weaken the robustness in clusters of cooperators these social and hydrological conditions affect individual decision making resulting in reduced contributions to flood maintenance work and ultimately become hurdles in the evolution of cooperators clusters the modeling results also showed a gradual process when cooperators become nearly completely dominant we found that when individuals interact with their nearby neighbors cooperators tend to survive better in the case of spatial clusters ultimately growing into a dominant population this result matched the results reported in studies that investigated spatial evolution cooperators roca et al 2009 wang et al 2012 wu et al 2011 we also observed that robust local clusters of cooperators even provided an opportunity to make a highly defector dominant community to be cooperative again this result was distinct from the results of previous lump modeling studies which did not consider the heterogeneity of community members and their interactions when individual interactions were not considered the rate of cooperators rapidly became 100 when their payoffs were larger than those of defectors or it became a community with no cooperators when their payoffs were smaller than those of defectors however in reality the atmosphere of a community gradually changes depending on its social and hydrological conditions in this regard our modeling which considered spatial patterns and individual interactions could provide highly applicable results in a spatially varied environment nowak and may 1992 our modeling results emphasized the importance of considering the cooperation of a local scale community because the robustness of a small community plays an important role in spreading its cooperative atmosphere in addition we observed that the flood protection system could be well maintained even if defectors existed this was especially true when the government assumed part of the cooperators labor burden which allowed an insufficient number of cooperators to still maintain the flood infrastructure with the government s support we also found that a moderate level of governmental support contributed to maintaining a high rate of cooperators in particular governmental support had a greater effect after 100 years than after 50 years thus we suggest that governmental support is necessary to reinforce the long term resilience of a community even if significant short term improvement is not observed in the community however we also found that excessive governmental support tended to weaken voluntary participation by disturbing the existing human flood interactions in the community our model contributes to investigations of community scale flood management from the perspective of crowding theory capturing the fact that excessive external support weakens the flood coping capacity overall our results imply that community based activities are deeply rooted in the social and hydrological conditions of an area thus monitoring people s needs and priorities defining problems and taking responsive measures are important for designing and implementing a flood management plan shaw 2006 despite our findings our results should be considered in light of certain limitations we used a simulation period of 100 years during which the social dynamics including the number of households or farming income cannot be constant however a longer term simulation was used to better investigate the feedback process for the decline and recovery of collective action rate of cooperators in response to flood damage additionally our study focused on one type of external support government participation in maintenance labor work there are other types of governmental support for flood protection such as subsidies to volunteers or policies to promote management work bwdb 1989 despite concerns that the traditional way of support examined in our study can disturb voluntary dynamics other types of external support can preserve local rules and cultures to prevent any unexpected backlash from sudden central governance rubiños and anderies 2020 thus incorporating various forms of external support and comparing them from a variety of perspectives can expand our knowledge of the dynamics of community scale flood management systems moreover the direct relationship between government support and each study variable are not examined although they are inter related in the feedback dynamics of human flood interactions observing the effects of different levels of government support on social memory or the roc will help policy makers better understand the dynamics of community scale management ultimately helping them identify the best means of support also note that our model was not designed to predict real world results or extrapolate to other geographic locations rather the purpose of this study was to understand the general dynamics of flood damage and human responses over time under different levels of external support our model was developed based on a real world case study but was not calibrated for a detailed process especially in relation to social variables instead our model focused on obtaining general insights about the underlying dynamics of human flood interactions in a certain type of system as shown in previous study mostert 2018 we believe that converting this generalized model into one that provides future predictions will benefit socio hydrological studies and their practical use for policymakers future study will be needed to address this issue using quantified time series of social variables and comparative studies overarching various cases roobavannan et al 2018 applying measured social variables would improve the proposed agent based model and contribute to developing a predictive model for practical use by policymakers we believe that the proposed agent based model provides the means for understanding complex human flood interactions and effective guidance for planning external support for a self managed flood protection system 5 funding sources this work was supported by the national research foundation of korea

3106,two way feedback between humans and flood systems is important for a better understanding of flood resilience and how flood risk evolves over time through human adaptation however most studies on this subject have assumed human traits and actions to be uniform overlooking the diversity of human responses to floods furthermore in many developing countries the flood protection infrastructure is co managed and co maintained through the involvement of local communities as well as external or governmental support however the influences of differing levels of external intervention on the long term outcome of co management and on community behavior remain underexplored in this study we aimed to overcome this issue by considering a community as a heterogeneous group under flood risk via geographically explicit agent based modeling this method allowed us to computationally experiment on how human flood interactions are conditioned by variations in household level attributes and governmental support specifically our study considered the community based flood protection system in the ganges brahmaputra river basin in bangladesh our results suggest that heterogeneities in the geographic location income and flood damage have significant effects on the outcome of human flood interactions specifically cooperative efforts toward minimizing flood damage and maintaining flood protection structures our results also highlight that a moderate level of governmental support i e assisting with only a part of the required labor is necessary to maintain the infrastructure built to promote cooperative action in a community scale flood protection system overall we believe our agent based model provides a potential for investigating the community dynamics from modeling individual level human flood interactions ultimately provide a guidance for planning future governmental support for self managed flood protection system keywords human flood interaction external support agent based modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction flooding is the most common natural hazard worldwide and is a leading cause of human fatality economic loss and damage to the built and natural environments ncei 2021 smith and matthews 2015 efforts to minimize flood damage have focused on better managing floodplains such as by building levees or improving the accuracy of flood forecasting despite these efforts the results have been less than satisfactory in many cases further climate change has led to an increase in the frequency and intensity of floods in many regions escalating flood risks in the long run di baldassarre 2017 abebe et al 2019 structural measures such as levees and dams remain the norm for containing floods however there is growing evidence that these methods may lead to increases in flood risk in the long run because of human adaptation i e increased floodplain development and a gradual decline of people s awareness of flood risk ludy and kondolf 2012 di baldassarre et al 2018 human activity is increasingly recognized to be a key factor in evaluating flood risk this stems from the recognition that humans adapt their activities in response to evolving flood risks and in turn the modified activity feeds back to alter the flood risks although considerable research has been performed on the human dimension of flood risk aerts et al 2018 tonn and guikema 2018 gober and wheater 2015 most studies have either been static in nature the hydrological and socioeconomic conditions that defined the context in which the human response to flooding occurred were assumed to be fixed or non interactive or they have been limited to a quantitative description of human behavior and flood risk awareness aerts et al 2018 recently scholars have begun to view the issue as a dynamic one consequently they have applied modeling to study the co evolution or two way feedback between humans and flood systems and the system level outcomes that emerge from such interactions e g di baldassarre et al 2013 2015 sivapalan et al 2012 2014 pande and sivapalan 2017 these socio hydrology studies have incorporated the interplay of flood events risk perception and flood coping strategies into their modeling frameworks di baldassarre et al 2013 2015 liao 2012 sung et al 2018 yu et al 2017 one less explored aspect of the existing socio hydrology modeling framework is the representation of the heterogeneities in individual level traits and the spatial explicitness of such individual level interactions often individuals responses to floods are assumed to be homogeneous individuals are also assumed to be well mixed with equal probabilities of encountering and interacting with every other person in the model society in reality however individual households tend to be heterogeneous in attributes such as income flood risk awareness and geographic location which can influence how human flood interactions play out lechowska 2018 botzen et al 2009 qasim et al 2016 for example people living in a flood prone area have a greater perception of flood risks being exposed to frequent floods causes income disparity especially when people s sources of income are negatively affected by floods for example farming and crop failure due to floods lechowska 2018 further differences in the physical locations of households can induce variations in flood experience thereby causing heterogeneities in their risk perception and household income lechowska 2018 knighton et al 2021 these differences affect how individuals respond to future floods o neil et al 2016 nevertheless little research has focused on the effects of household level heterogeneities especially the attributes of geographic location income and flood risk awareness on the trajectory of human flood interactions sultana 2010 lechowska 2018 few but a growing number of studies have pointed toward the importance of incorporating individual level heterogeneities and interactions into dynamic modeling to gain system level insights loucks 2015 abebe et al 2019 hyun et al 2019 in this regard agent based modeling is a suitable modeling approach because it facilitates the representation of the heterogeneous decision making of individual agents and the exploration of the macro level outcomes that emerge from such decisions troy et al 2015 dewan et al 2015 agent based modeling is also spatially explicit in the sense that it allows localized interactions among agents on patches or spatial grids with different physical conditions balica et al 2009 there are studies that reflected such spatial aspects of human responses to floods aerts et al 2018 dawson et al 2011 tesfatsion et al 2017 haer et al 2017 dubbelboer et al 2017 these studies reported that the spatial disparity of individual agents is one of the key factors influencing human behavior and the perception of disaster risk another important aspect of human flood interaction is the role of external or governmental support in building and maintaining flood management systems this aspect has been studied in the context of developing countries where flood protection systems are often co managed and co maintained by local communities and public agencies khalid and shafiai 2015 abbas et al 2015 van voorst 2015 some studies reported the positive effects of external support for example early flood warnings and the partial support from outside have contributed to improved evacuation and recovery efforts khalid and shafiai 2015 abbas et al 2015 on the other hand studies also suggested that unintended consequences can arise in the long run from external support abbas et al 2015 van voorst 2015 for example the support of the bangladesh government and non governmental organizations ngos in the construction of large scale levees in coastal areas helped reduce flood damage but might also have led to a decline in the flood risk awareness and voluntary behavior among people bwdb 1989 shaw 2006 one interesting notion explaining this phenomenon is motivation crowding which means that providing extrinsic incentives e g monetary rewards for voluntary tasks or community affairs can undermine or crowd out people s intrinsic motivation that previously enabled them to make voluntary contributions frey and jegen 2001 the concept of motivation crowding has been applied to the context of flood management and it has been reported that governmental assistance to reduce or compensate flood damage tends to minimize individual efforts for self protection in the long run raschky et al 2013 these studies however were mostly qualitative in nature and the long term effects of external support on people s motivation and flood coping capacity remain underexplored islam and walkerden 2015 calling for quantitative modeling research this study aimed to bridge the previously mentioned research gaps 1 incorporating individual level heterogeneity to investigate its influence on human flood interaction and 2 exploring the effect of external governmental support on human flood interaction accordingly we examined the emergence of system dynamics from the spatially explicit interactions of household agents in managing a community level flood protection system specifically in the context of a developing country we also investigated how different levels of government intervention influence emergent outcomes we developed an agent based model abm by extending an existing dynamic model of a community managed flood protection system known as polders yu et al 2017 sung et al 2018 our model was motivated by the use of polders in the ganges brahmaputra river basin bangladesh where considerable flood risk is ever present and the maintenance of the flood protection infrastructure has partially devolved to local communities we developed a stylized abm for the specific case wherein the built infrastructure for flood protection is managed by the community members voluntary actions the abm is used as a tool to understand the general system dynamics by studying the different possible responses of a modeled system the general dynamics in our study encompassed the process whereby previous flood experiences shaped the reactions toward future flood damage in terms of having different payoffs social memories and decision making for participating avoiding flood maintenance work in this respect our model used heuristic values for understanding human flood interactions in a developing country context 2 study area and methods 2 1 polder maintenance in coastal bangladesh in this study we focused on the human flood interactions in the ganges brahmaputra river in southwestern bangladesh bangladesh has long suffered from flooding because most of the region is located in a low lying delta and heavy monsoons bring frequent and large floods yang et al 2015 yu et al 2017 in addition poverty and low rates of economic growth with high population density have prevented the society from responding appropriately to flood disasters thereby increasing the vulnerability to floods ahmad and ahmed 2004 the bangladesh government and ngos have implemented engineering measures for flood protection including the construction of embankments along the coast to protect communities from floods although these embankments have contributed to mitigating flood damage and allowing agriculture ahmed et al 2008 ishtiaque et al 2017 this governmental support has not been effective or helpful in controlling floods in addition the support of ngos has not been sufficiently sustained to manage flood protection systems in the long term and some support projects were not well designed for the community shaw 2006 for these reasons many studies have suggested that external support complicates flood risk and increases vulnerability in relation to the independent management ability of community members ahmad and ahmed 2004 pal et al 2011 although the role of government is less explicit in rural areas ngos and local governments still exist and try to support polder management work priyanka 2006 therefore this study aimed to investigate how external support changes the dynamics of the voluntarily flood protection system in the ganges brahmaputra river basin in bangladesh 2 2 socio hydrologic modeling framework for flood community interactions the general modeling framework is described in fig 1 a the social conditions marked in the shaded area were investigated via the abm because each agent had different social conditions depending on their tendency to participate in flood maintenance work or their physical location a basic equation for each variable was formulated based on the existing literature including yu et al 2017 and di baldassarre et al 2013 this section first explains the hydrological variables that are uniformly assigned to the whole system and then explains the social variables including governmental support modeled for individual agents subsequently we provide the detailed setups and parameters of the simulations that we performed table 1 provides the parameter values used in this study 2 2 1 flood damage to levee the damage from floods f was modeled according to the equation below which was developed by di baldassarre et al 2013 we assumed that flooding occurs when the water level w is higher than the current flood protection level k which was represented by the levee height above the riverbank in this study 1 f 1 exp σ f w w k 0 o t h e r w i s e where σ f represents the sensitivity of the damage to high water levels households located in high flood risk areas are assumed to experience more severe damage under floods thus σ f varies depending on the location of the household 2 2 2 soil salinity dynamics for farming productivity floods also cause saline water logging in the polder and significantly reduce farming productivity world bank group 2001 because the crop output of the polder critically depends on the average salinity in the root zone of the soil s the farming yield is highly influenced by flooding events based on yu et al 2017 the dynamics of s are modeled in eq 2 2 ds dt q f σ s where q is the rate of gain in soil salinity caused by floods f and σ is the leaching efficiency used to factor the contribution to effectively washing out the salt mass such as for the soil moisture soil porosity and root depth suweis et al 2010 2 2 3 flood protection level dynamics we represent the average height of the embankment above the riverbank as the flood protection level k with the dynamics of k shown in the equation below 3 dk dt r δ k k h where k decays because of natural erosion and sometimes breached by large floods community members mobilize collective action to satisfy k as their flood protection goal k and reduce the gap between k and k i e minimize δ k k k here r denotes the amount of the embankment repaired by collective maintenance and h is the decay caused by embankment breaching the embankment height deteriorated by natural erosion is calculated as δ k k where the term δ k represents the annual erosion rate for further details refer to yu et al 2017 and sung et al 2018 2 2 4 social memory dynamics social memory m represents how much the community is aware of the seriousness of flood risk di baldassarre et al 2013 viglione et al 2014 the level of flood awareness largely depends on the previous experience with flood events and naturally decreases if the community does not experience floods thus we model the dynamics of social memory m as shown in eq 4 following di baldassarre et al 2013 4 dm dt μ m f δ m m where μ m is the coefficient for the rate of gain in social memory of a flooding event and δ m represents the annual decay rate of social memory because social memory m is dependent on flood damage f it differs between a high flood risk area and the other areas people living in a high flood risk area tend to have a stronger and longer social memory of the same flood event 2 2 5 maintenance labor under external support in our study area i e the ganges brahmaputra river basin in southwestern bangladesh the government provides economic benefits to community members such as wages or agricultural production as compensation priyanka 2006 to capture the role of the government engaging in flood maintenance work we introduce eq 5 to quantify the maintenance work done by cooperators and government according to the changing level of governmental support sp 5 l m l m s p l m 1 s p where l m s p represents the amount of labor performed by the government and l m 1 s p is the amount of labor performed by cooperators who actively engage in flood maintenance work 2 3 agent based model for community behavior 2 3 1 spatially explicit agent based model the objective of developing the abm in this study was to better capture the decision making process of each agent concerning their decision to participate in or avoid levee maintenance work which was determined by the interaction with their adjacent neighbors these decision making processes ultimately shape the entire dynamics of the collective action for maintaining the flood protection infrastructure we implemented the abm using netlogo software wilensky and rand 2015 which is widely used for agent based modeling and for monitoring the characteristics of agents on spatial and temporal scales furthermore it allowed spatially explicit data to be incorporated into the model which could reveal the effects of the geospatial characteristics of the agents as shown in fig 1 b and table 2 the abm was initialized with the geospatial information of the study area which is based on the flood inundation map generated when a large flood occurred in 2017 furthermore community members choose their strategies i e cooperators or defectors every year based on the financial benefits received by their adjacent neighbors additionally note that the model assumed that households in high flood risk areas suffered larger flood damage than households outside high flood risk areas 2 3 2 decision making processes of agents the agents in this study are households and they were divided into two groups cooperators and defectors the cooperators are community members that try to contribute to flood relief efforts these people voluntarily participate in levee maintenance work on a regular basis or immediately after flooding to mitigate flood damage paul and routray 2010 on the other hand the defectors avoid levee maintenance work and try to find another income source outside of the polder when flooding makes farming impossible each household decides every year about whether to be a cooperator or defector as they learn about and follow in the steps of their geographically adjacent neighbors with better payoffs regarding flood mitigation activities in bangladesh we set up the following rule for the decision process of each agent a household compares its annual payoff π to those of its four adjacent neighbors every year and follows the strategy of the neighbors with the greatest income following yu et al 2017 the payoff of cooperators and defectors π c and π d respectively are modeled as shown in eqs 6 and 7 respectively 6 π c p 1 f b l f c α a 1 α z l e c λ 1 ε 1 x 7 π d p 1 f b l f d α a 1 α z l e d l f l l m γ 1 ξ x x 1 ξ m m where x refers to the rate of cooperators and is calculated by counting the cooperators each year the superscripts c and d refer to the benefits received by cooperators and defectors respectively in addition b is a farming yield productivity factor that is a function of salinity sung et al 2018 this study assumed that all the households have the same amount of available labor and acreage a for farming a household allocates their labor among three activities every year farming l f polder maintenance l m and outside employment l e among these laborers only defectors offer their labor for outside employment the farming income diverges as a result of two factors 1 people seeking outside employment cooperators or defectors and 2 people in a flood prone area experiencing more damage from floodwater along with more severe soil salinity living in a flood prone area or outside it the third term in eq 7 models social ostracism this study assumed that the intensity of ostracism varied in the following situations rule violations are overlooked when households depend much more on outside employment than agriculture that is l f l l m 0 which occurs because the individuals receive fewer incentives to maintain the polder such tolerance diminishes as the dependence on agriculture increases social ostracism intensifies when there are a large number of cooperators or the community is well aware of the flood risk overall the effect of social ostracism can be modeled as shown in eq 8 8 socialostracism l f l l m γ 1 ξ x x 1 ξ m m where γ is the default penalty and ξ x and ξ m represent the multiplicative coefficients for the additional penalties induced by one unit increases in x and m respectively here social ostracism encompasses all the penalties that the defector receives via the formal or informal institutions that exist in a society these consequences include the councils or watchmen appointed by community members chastising their behavior resulting in giving the defectors a bad reputation and limiting their access to certain types of common resources sethi and somanathan 1996 our model calculates the payoffs at the individual level to make a comparison with neighbors to assist in decision making individuals can have one of four different payoffs in each year payoffs for cooperators defectors in high general flood risk areas the payoffs for cooperators and defectors vary with the amount of labor including that of defectors pursuing outside income and cooperators participating in flood maintenance along with the social ostracism imposed on defectors the difference in the payoffs in high and general flood risk areas is mainly the result of flood damage and its impacts on social memory and soil salinity which are larger in high flood risk areas investigating individual level modeling is distinctive to the study of yu et al 2017 which calculated the payoffs of two different groups and compared the group scale incomes to calculate the number of cooperators table 3 provides the list of heterogeneity factors used in the model appendix table a 1 also provides the abm of human water interaction of this study according to the odd d protocol which stands for overview design concepts and details for the abm that includes human decision making 2 3 3 numerical experiments in this study we conducted a set of simulations with 100 repetitions with k varying from 0 4 to 1 and sp varying from 0 0 no governmental support to 0 8 we assumed that when either the group of cooperators or that of the defectors was highly dominant i e larger than 99 and the average payoff of the dominant group was smaller than that of the other group 1 of all the households turned into the opposite group this assumption was made to prevent the effect of close neighbors from being excessively assessed and to capture the effect of the general atmosphere of the entire community on individuals the other underlying assumption was that the initial rate of cooperators was 90 based on the situation in our study area where the cooperation of local communities is currently the major driver in maintaining the flood protection infrastructure sultana and thompson 2017 we note that the dynamics of the modeled system can vary significantly with different initial conditions for example a flood protection system with a very low rate of cooperators is less likely to be maintained yu et al 2017 nevertheless this study focused on the ideal situation in our case study context that of a high rate of cooperators with relatively high social memory regarding the number of simulations we found that the use of 100 simulations reduced the variance of the modeled variables sufficiently to describe the general phenomena of the modeled system fig 2 we investigated the dynamics for 100 years with the following rationales the hydrological cycle was assumed to have non stationary variability for 100 years and the flood protection structure was generally designed for a 100 year return period although this concept is debatable in the hydrologic field read and vogel 2015 moreover 100 years is a sufficiently long time period to investigate the evolution of human traits such as social norms and ultimately the trajectories of human water interactions furthermore we conducted an additional set of simulations with 100 repititons with k varying from 0 4 to 1 using a lumped model that did not consider the household based heterogeneity this was done to compare the results when using the models from the studies of yu et al 2016 and sung et al 2017 to those with our agent based model 3 results and discussion 3 1 dynamics of collective action under external support in this section we examine how different levels of external support affected cooperators community behavior we investigated the average rate of cooperators in a simulation repeated 100 times the rate of cooperators was calculated over 50 and 100 years under various levels of external support and flood protection goals fig 3 overall the average rate of cooperators roc in fig 3 highlights the importance of external support to reinforce collective action for cooperation the external support tends to allow a wider range of flood protection goals to maintain the flood protection system in a relatively short term i e 50 years fig 3 a the community could have a high roc if the external support by the government sp was greater than 0 3 with a moderate flood protection goal k we can see that significant external support from the government would make it possible to maintain a high roc even with a very high flood protection goal when almost all the maintenance work is done by external support sp 0 9 the community could maintain a high roc under a flood protection goal of more than 0 8 however with a moderate level of support that is assistance in terms of only a part of the required labor management was sufficiently effective to ensure a high roc with a less flexible range of flood protection goals the role of governmental support is clearer when observing a system over a longer term fig 3 b similar to the previous case a high roc could be maintained when the external support was greater than 0 3 with certain range of flood protection goals the system tended to be more flexible when the external support was 0 7 in terms of maintaining cooperators under a wide range of flood protection goals significant external support sp 0 9 could better maintain cooperators under a more robust flood protection level note that this significant external support did not provide flexibility in the system but switched from a high roc to a higher protection goal in both the short term and long term scenarios the flood protection goal k had a clear spectrum that showed high roc values of approximately 0 7 and 0 8 respectively this goal was not too high or too low thus it could be achieved by cooperators and provide protection to prevent flooding our results highlight that a moderate level of support is sufficient to manage collective action provided reasonable flood protection goals are set although significant external support can better protect the community a system with a very robust protection level is not sustainable in particular when external support significantly contributes to building the system and the community has already adapted to such a system cutting that support off can cause significant damage our modeling results showed that the possibility of maintaining collective action was reduced after 100 years when the support level was too high i e sp greater than 0 8 and k was smaller than 0 9 governmental support significantly reduced the amount of maintenance labor required by cooperators which weakened the effect of social ostracism toward defectors as the amount of required maintenance labor increased the payoffs for cooperators decreased because the time for cooperators to engage in economic activities decreased this resulted in social ostracism toward defectors for not participating in the maintenance work leading to a decrease in their payoffs in contrast when the government took over the maintenance work of cooperators the social pressure on defectors was not significant because the labor burden of cooperators was reduced accordingly the payoffs for defectors were not affected regardless of the required amount of maintenance work these results imply that a significant amount of governmental support can lead to a paradoxical phenomenon excessive governmental engagement in a voluntarily maintained flood protection system tends to increase the number of defectors in this respect our results suggest that a modest level of governmental support i e assisting with approximately half of the required labor is desirable to reinforce collective action our analysis differs from that of previous researchers such as yu et al 2017 who presented different regimes of social norms for collective action with all cooperators or all defectors based on the target embankment height levels yu et al 2017 investigated the system using a lumped model that did not consider individual level heterogeneity see section 3 4 for further discussion our model allowed individual households to make heterogeneous decisions based on their circumstances thus the rate of cooperators could not be completely dominant or too low which was considered to be realistic 3 2 spatial patterns of cooperators and defectors this section compares two representative cases with a high roc after 100 years fig 4 b and c and the same initial model condition fig 4 a both cases effectively maintained a high roc in one most of the community members turned into cooperators whereas stable collective action arose in the other in spite of numerous defectors note that the dynamics of the social and hydrological variables in fig 5 are those for successful and fair cases both cases were simulated under the same conditions with governmental support equal to zero and a flood protection level of 0 8 under these conditions we examined how the distribution of cooperators and defectors evolved from the initial conditions fig 4 b shows a case where cooperative behavior is prevalent in this case the flood protection structure effectively safeguarded against flood events with the community well aware of the risk and the necessity of cooperation though not significant a few defectors still existed those members were located in an isolated area thus they did not have many opportunities to change their behavior and pursue greater payoffs fig 4 c shows that the remaining defectors are spatially aggregated this illustrates the important role of neighbors in a member s decision making regarding participation in flood maintenance work in addition those clustered groups could keep their current characteristics more stable by influencing their neighbors to display the same characteristics the detailed human flood dynamics of this case are shown in fig 5 fair case the spatial characteristics and their detailed dynamics indicate that the flood protection system was well maintained when the clustered cooperators helped to maintain a high rate of roc although some defectors adhered to their behaviors in addition our results showed that the defectors were mostly located outside of the high flood risk area some defectors were clustered at the edge of that area but did not spread their behaviors to the high flood risk area people living in the high flood risk area were highly aware of the potential risk and necessity of participation in flood maintenance work this caused strong social ostracism toward defectors in this area in addition sharing the work with people in other areas under a higher risk of damage by flooding reduced the labor burden ultimately the combination of less pressure for flood maintenance work and increased social ostracism toward defectors caused more people to decide to be cooperators compared to those outside the high flood risk area the spatial patterns of cooperators and defectors in our model coincided well with the results of evolutionary game theory especially the evolution of cooperators wu et al 2011 roca et al 2009 explaining the spatial aspect of the dynamics of community behaviors evolutionary game theory is popularly used in ecology and suggests that the cooperation of a community is determined by the robustness and growth of clusters of cooperators therefore the dynamics of their behaviors do not depend on the global population but on the local densities of the cooperators at the cluster interfaces in their neighborhood wu et al 2011 this supports our findings that the flood protection system can be well maintained when the cooperators increase to the dominant level i e a sufficiently high number of cooperators to achieve the required labor burden in this study and those cooperators are spatially aggregated to spread their cooperative behavior regardless of the existence of defectors 3 3 dynamics of social and hydrological variables this section describes the dynamics of the social and hydrological variables fig 5 compares randomly chosen three representative cases involving flood protection structures that have failed fail case have suffered some damage but are still well managed fair case and are well managed success case in this system each individual household compared its current payoffs to those of its adjacent neighbors to determine their participation in flood structure maintenance work and thus the spread of either defection or cooperation determined the success of the flood protection system i e fail fair and success cases fig 5 shows that the payoff gap between defectors and cooperators is the major factor driving the same system along opposite trajectories in conjunction with other factors the cooperators maintenance labor burden social ostracism and social memory the labor burden of cooperators reinforced the recognition of their devotion to the common good and increased the social ostracism of defectors who avoided maintenance responsibility and pursued their own benefits this ultimately reduced the defectors payoffs the fair case in fig 5 captures this phenomenon showing a sudden decrease in the number of cooperators and their payoffs at 60 80 years relative to defectors nevertheless the remaining cooperators continued to maintain the flood protection system as their payoffs were still slightly larger than those of defectors as cooperators were devoted to maintenance work their social ostracism toward defectors increased resulting in continually decreasing payoffs of defectors ultimately more community members chose to be cooperators because of considerable social pressure the roc recovered in the long run as in the fail case of fig 5 the opposite occurred when the labor burden required of the cooperators posed a risk to their farming livelihood and exceeded the costs associated with the social pressure they were subject to as defectors in this case more people chose to become defectors as they sought new sources of income outside their residence in addition social memory played an important role in maintaining high roc by affecting the payoffs of the two groups as suggested in previous studies di baldassarre et al 2015 sung et al 2018 yu et al 2017 the fail and fair cases in fig 5 show that social memory increased when the community suffered flood damage and decayed over time if there were no subsequent flood experiences this decreased social memory in turn diluted the awareness of the importance of flood infrastructure management as shown at 50 years in fig 5 g and at 32 50 and 80 years in fig 5 h the success case in fig 5 shows that with the community experiencing intermittent and moderate flood awareness of the importance of the flood protection system tended to promote participation in flood maintenance work thereby reducing the labor of individual cooperators these positive dynamics motivated most community members to choose to cooperate throughout the entire simulation period these results indicate that the flood protection system can be maintained despite a temporary failure to achieve flood protection goals because of an increased number of defectors which was neglected in previous studies di baldassarre et al 2015 sung et al 2018 yu et al 2017 the fair case in fig 5 b shows that the flood protection system could be restored along with the number of cooperators even though the system underwent a period when the balance of the system collapsed the protection system failed to achieve the protection goal at the 80 90 year time steps resulting in high flood damages with fewer cooperators and decreased payoffs this study captured this phenomenon by considering the behavioral changes of individuals through their interactions while previous studies have reported only all time success or failure case as they assumed that the roc was decided by the average difference in payoffs as an individual s decision making was based on their own experiences and the influence of adjacent neighbors in every time step year they were less likely to change their behavior specifically a cooperator defector completely surrounded by cooperators defectors rarely changed its behavior until the other group pervaded into its neighborhood sharing the same behavior as neighbors regulated their behavior even with a slight reduction in their payoffs in addition the results in all region solid lines and in high flood risk region dashed lines of fig 5 show that the dynamics of a flood prone area manifest distinctive characteristics compared to those of an average community the fail and fair cases show that a flood prone area had larger flood damage which led to stronger social memory for the same flood event notably the roc showed a smaller reduction as floods continued to occur cooperators in a flood prone region tended to have higher payoffs with a smaller labor burden and defectors had smaller payoffs because of greater social ostracism and stronger social memory this induced more people in a flood prone area to adjust their behavior when more people in the other region had already started to avoid maintenance work this difference did not appear in the success case 3 4 comparison to lumped model in this section we compare the results of this study to a set of simulations with a lumped model i e an existing approach with homogenous households fig 6 shows a comparison of the cooperator ratios of the agent based model and lumped model overall we found that the agent based model provided great flexibility in describing a well maintained flood protection system the 50 percentile values for the ratios of cooperators box sizes in the agent based model fig 6 a are much wider than those in the lumped case fig 6 b in all the ranges of k except when the roc is zero this implies that the flood protection system can be successfully maintained with various ranges of cooperators which reflects the reality while the lumped model describes the community as a much more rigid system furthermore the lumped model shows that the average ratio of cooperators was highly dependent on the maintenance goal the range for the ratio of cooperators in the lumped case is very high with very little uncertainty when k is 0 8 and 1 0 and it is mostly zero outside of that range k is 0 8 1 0 the low value of k infers that the community could not provide maintenance in most of the simulation cases when the actual levee height is far from their goal fig 6 b the agent based model shows that the flood protection system can be maintained under various flood maintenance goals our results highlight that the heterogeneity of individual conditions and their interactions should not be overlooked if situations on the individual level show distinctive heterogeneity and their interactions play a significant role in managing flood protection 4 conclusions this study developed and analyzed socio hydrological abm to focus on how human actions and infrastructure management affect flood resilience by incorporating individuals decision making processes related to infrastructure maintenance specifically we examined how a change in the internalized motivation or social norm for participating in levee maintenance work is conditioned by social pressure and individual level heterogeneities related to location income and flood memory in addition we created scenarios in which the government externally supports some levee maintenance work and explored how human flood dynamics are affected by this governmental support our result showed that a cooperator s reduced income with a severe burden related to managing a flood protection structure and a community s low flood awareness weaken the robustness in clusters of cooperators these social and hydrological conditions affect individual decision making resulting in reduced contributions to flood maintenance work and ultimately become hurdles in the evolution of cooperators clusters the modeling results also showed a gradual process when cooperators become nearly completely dominant we found that when individuals interact with their nearby neighbors cooperators tend to survive better in the case of spatial clusters ultimately growing into a dominant population this result matched the results reported in studies that investigated spatial evolution cooperators roca et al 2009 wang et al 2012 wu et al 2011 we also observed that robust local clusters of cooperators even provided an opportunity to make a highly defector dominant community to be cooperative again this result was distinct from the results of previous lump modeling studies which did not consider the heterogeneity of community members and their interactions when individual interactions were not considered the rate of cooperators rapidly became 100 when their payoffs were larger than those of defectors or it became a community with no cooperators when their payoffs were smaller than those of defectors however in reality the atmosphere of a community gradually changes depending on its social and hydrological conditions in this regard our modeling which considered spatial patterns and individual interactions could provide highly applicable results in a spatially varied environment nowak and may 1992 our modeling results emphasized the importance of considering the cooperation of a local scale community because the robustness of a small community plays an important role in spreading its cooperative atmosphere in addition we observed that the flood protection system could be well maintained even if defectors existed this was especially true when the government assumed part of the cooperators labor burden which allowed an insufficient number of cooperators to still maintain the flood infrastructure with the government s support we also found that a moderate level of governmental support contributed to maintaining a high rate of cooperators in particular governmental support had a greater effect after 100 years than after 50 years thus we suggest that governmental support is necessary to reinforce the long term resilience of a community even if significant short term improvement is not observed in the community however we also found that excessive governmental support tended to weaken voluntary participation by disturbing the existing human flood interactions in the community our model contributes to investigations of community scale flood management from the perspective of crowding theory capturing the fact that excessive external support weakens the flood coping capacity overall our results imply that community based activities are deeply rooted in the social and hydrological conditions of an area thus monitoring people s needs and priorities defining problems and taking responsive measures are important for designing and implementing a flood management plan shaw 2006 despite our findings our results should be considered in light of certain limitations we used a simulation period of 100 years during which the social dynamics including the number of households or farming income cannot be constant however a longer term simulation was used to better investigate the feedback process for the decline and recovery of collective action rate of cooperators in response to flood damage additionally our study focused on one type of external support government participation in maintenance labor work there are other types of governmental support for flood protection such as subsidies to volunteers or policies to promote management work bwdb 1989 despite concerns that the traditional way of support examined in our study can disturb voluntary dynamics other types of external support can preserve local rules and cultures to prevent any unexpected backlash from sudden central governance rubiños and anderies 2020 thus incorporating various forms of external support and comparing them from a variety of perspectives can expand our knowledge of the dynamics of community scale flood management systems moreover the direct relationship between government support and each study variable are not examined although they are inter related in the feedback dynamics of human flood interactions observing the effects of different levels of government support on social memory or the roc will help policy makers better understand the dynamics of community scale management ultimately helping them identify the best means of support also note that our model was not designed to predict real world results or extrapolate to other geographic locations rather the purpose of this study was to understand the general dynamics of flood damage and human responses over time under different levels of external support our model was developed based on a real world case study but was not calibrated for a detailed process especially in relation to social variables instead our model focused on obtaining general insights about the underlying dynamics of human flood interactions in a certain type of system as shown in previous study mostert 2018 we believe that converting this generalized model into one that provides future predictions will benefit socio hydrological studies and their practical use for policymakers future study will be needed to address this issue using quantified time series of social variables and comparative studies overarching various cases roobavannan et al 2018 applying measured social variables would improve the proposed agent based model and contribute to developing a predictive model for practical use by policymakers we believe that the proposed agent based model provides the means for understanding complex human flood interactions and effective guidance for planning external support for a self managed flood protection system 5 funding sources this work was supported by the national research foundation of korea

3107,the köppen geiger kg climate classification has been widely used to determine the climate at global and regional scales using precipitation and temperature data kg maps are typically developed using a single product however uncertainties in kg climate types resulting from different precipitation and temperature datasets have not been explored in detail here we assess seven global datasets to show uncertainties in kg classification from 1980 to 2017 using a pairwise comparison at global and zonal scales we quantify the similarity among the seven kg maps gauge and reanalysis based kg maps have a notable difference spatially the highest and lowest similarity is observed for the north and south temperate zones respectively notably 17 of grids among the seven maps show variations even in the major kg climate types while 35 of grids are described by more than one kg climate subtype strong uncertainty is observed in south asia central and south africa western america and northeastern australia we created two kg master maps 0 5 resolution by merging the climate maps directly and by combining the precipitation and temperature data from the seven datasets these master maps are more robust than the individual ones showing coherent spatial patterns this study reveals the large uncertainty in climate classification and offers two robust kg maps that may help to better evaluate historical climate and quantify future climate shifts keywords köppen geiger classification uncertainty quantification precipitation and temperature products data availability the original

global distribution of solar radiation and the large scale atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns this leads to many different climate types and the need to classify them climate classifications identify regions with similar climate characteristics these classifications help to evaluate regional climate changes or shifts domroes 2003 fraedrich et al 2001 gao giorgi 2008 rohli et al 2015

such as 1 precipitation and temperature köppen and geiger 1928 2 biome olson et al 2001 3 geographical location altitude and humidity holdridge 1947 and 4 plant physiology gardner et al 2020 however the most popular climate classification is the köppen geiger kg which is based on temperature and precipitation data köppen and geiger 1928 given several readily available gridded precipitation and temperature products the interest in climate classification has intensified over the last decades yet literature lacks information on how the kg classification varies with different global products in 1900 wladimir köppen established the first quantitative climate classification and produced the first climate map a revised climate classification map was published in 1918 köppen 1918 in 1923 köppen used the classification to investigate the boundaries of climate around the globe köppen 1923 köppen and geiger presented the first world map of climate classification in 1928 köppen and geiger 1928 creating the well known köppen geiger kg classification the classification was further refined by köppen 1936 and improved by geiger 1954 a modification was proposed by köppen and trewartha trewartha horn 1980 trewartha 1968 as well as by peel et al 2007 who amended some criteria the global kg maps have been updated many times over the last decades and gained popularity not only for linking climate and vegetation bailey 2009 but also for their simplicity wilcock 1968 in the early 1990s triantafyllou and tsonis 1994 used station data for the first time from the northern hemisphere to identify the kg climate types some studies investigated climate changes by creating kg maps from the outputs of climate models and compared them with the köppen s 1923 map gnanadesikan stouffer 2006 kalvová et al 2003 kleidon et al 2000 lohmann et al 1993 wang overland 2004 kottek et al 2006 adopted gridded data to update the world kg classification map between 1951 and 2000 while chen chen 2013 and peel et al 2007 adopted station based datasets with more than 30 years of data for each record a recent fine resolution of kg classification was derived by using climate model ensemble datasets and observations beck et al 2018 here we apply the kg classification as modified by peel et al 2007 by using seven global temperature and precipitation data products in order to quantify the uncertainty in classifying climate types global precipitation and temperature datasets have been widely used for different purposes including ecological and hydrological modelling validating climate models analyzing climate variation synthesizing extreme events characteristics and calibrating forecast models gleckler et al 2008 kidston et al 2010 kravtsov et al 2014 mackellar et al 2007 new et al 2000 these datasets were derived by combining different sources gauge based observations radars satellites and reanalysis models at various spatial from 0 1 to 5 and temporal resolutions from sub daily to monthly most of the global gridded products provide estimates of both precipitation and temperature at different spatial and temporal resolutions see e g the gauge based university of delaware udel the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep etc other products such as the global precipitation climatology center gpcc the climate prediction center cpc unified and the ncep ncar focus only on precipitation data these products often show notable differences due to different data sources and different processing methods costa foley 1998 dore 2005 folland et al 2001 hawkins et al 2017 rajulapati et al 2020 sun et al 2018 wong et al 2017 thus the climate type identified in a region since the kg classification uses temperature and precipitation measurements might differ depending on the dataset used the literature lacks information on how kg climate types vary given that different global precipitation and temperature products are used kg maps are typically used to identify the geographical distribution of climate types to do so kg maps have been developed using gridded 1 station based data chen chen 2013 de oliveira aparecido et al 2020 kottek et al 2006 peel et al 2007 rubel kottek 2010 triantafyllou tsonis 1994 2 climate models outputs fraedrich et al 2001 gnanadesikan stouffer 2006 guetter kutzbach 1990 kalvová et al 2003 kim et al 2008 lohmann et al 1993 and 3 ensembles of station based and climate models data beck et al 2018 another aim is to detect changes and shifts in climate types over time climate change and long term climate variations can affect the regional climate and the distribution of plants and thus the climate types elmendorf et al 2012 specifically changes in climate type have been investigated by comparing regions identified by climate subtypes chen chen 2013 diaz eischeid 2007 wang overland 2004 kim et al 2008 showed that between 1951 and 1970 and 1981 2000 northern china experienced shifts to drier conditions fraedrich et al 2001 showed substantial changes in the modified köppen climate zones in the late 20th century and statistically significant shifts over the deserts of southern africa and the tropics in east asia regional climate changes were investigated by calculating the frequency of occurrence of kg subtypes yoshino kazuko 1981 the kg classification has also been used to show projected kg world maps and future changes in climate types yun et al 2012 investigated the sub tropical area of the future climate in korea and showed an increase of 21 and 35 based on the trewartha and kg classifications respectively according to kalvová et al 2003 and lohmann et al 1993 regions with tropical and dry climate types will expand in the future while regions described by the rest of the climate types will shrink projected global kg maps were derived using different climate models and methods rubel and kottek 2010 presented the future global kg map resolution 0 5 from 2076 to 2100 using temperature and precipitation data from an ensemble of global climate model projections provided by the tyndall centre for climate change research tyn mitchell et al 2004 for four ipcc emission scenarios beck et al 2018 used an ensemble of climate projections 32 models rcp8 5 scenario from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cimip5 taylor et al 2012 to derive a fine resolution resolution 0 0083 global kg map for the 2071 2100 period they depicted the present day 1980 2016 and future 2071 2100 confidence maps of kg subtypes by calculating the fraction of the most common climate subtype and the ensemble size although kg climate maps have been updated and used many times the study of beck et al 2018 is one of the few studies that compared the similarity of kg climate subtypes between climate models and observations yet they did not show the uncertainty among the data products they used in this study we assess how different global datasets affect the kg classification we use seven gridded products of precipitation and temperature including reanalysis gauge based and satellite datasets covering the 1980 2017 period our objectives are to 1 develop kg classification maps using seven global datasets 2 assess the uncertainty in evaluating kg climate types and 3 create a kg map by combining all datasets 2 data there are many large scale climate data sets from in situ observations that can be used for climate studies however gauge measurements have several limitations such as incomplete areal coverage and deficiencies over sparsely populated areas sun et al 2018 satellite derived datasets can alleviate some of these constraints by providing spatially homogeneous coverage despite their short length record products merging satellite and gauge measurements can also improve the accuracy of climate variable measurements such as the global precipitation climatology project gpcp monthly precipitation analysis which merges gauge observations with low orbit satellite microwave data and geosynchronous orbit satellite infrared data reanalysis is a retrospective analysis which uses data assimilation to construct long term datasets reanalysis datasets are sequences of snapshots of atmospheric conditions produced by a numerical weather prediction model and a data assimilation method over past periods combined with the observed data available during those periods bengtsson shukla 1988 parker 2016 trenberth olson 1988 they are attractive and popular for climate studies since they provide complete time series over long time periods reanalysis datasets have been criticized by scientists based on parker 2016 the most important difference between observational and reanalysis datasets is that errors and uncertainties associated with reanalysis are often less well understood than those associated with observations uncertainty in reanalysis products originates from errors or limitations in the observations needed for data assimilation or uncertainties in the atmospheric models used to generate the forecast for data assimilation hofer et al 2012 here we used a variety of global datasets to alleviate their limitations specifically we used near surface 2 meter temperature and precipitation data from gauged based and reanalysis products and from products combining various sources of information e g satellites reanalysis gauges etc particularly we included two gauge based products that is 1 the university of delaware air temperature precipitation udel version 5 01 derived from station data such as the global historical climatology network ghcn2 and the global surface summary of day gsod willmott matsuura 1995 and 2 the climate research unit university of east anglia cru ts version 4 04 which offers land based data excluding antarctica by interpolating monthly climate anomalies from an extensive weather station network harris et al 2014 the four reanalysis products are 1 the national centers for environmental prediction ncep climate forecast system reanalysis ncep cfsr versions 1 and 2 a high resolution reanalysis product which couples ocean atmospheric sea ice and land surface data sources saha et al 2014 2 the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 a comprehensive reanalysis climate dataset covering more than half a century by applying the four dimensional variational analysis 4d var assimilation system kobayashi et al 2015 3 the fifth generation of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts era5 a reanalysis global dataset including records of land surface atmosphere and ocean waves hersbach et al 2020 and 4 and the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra version 2 a reanalysis atmospheric product using satellite data generated by nasa s global modeling and assimilation office gmao gelaro et al 2017 finally the multi source product we used is the wfdei meteorological forcing data a combined satellite and reanalysis data product created by applying the watch forcing data methodology and making use of the era interim reanalysis data weedon et al 2014 note that although reanalysis estimates are based on observations and model forecasts these estimates are not real observations e g bosilovich et al 2013 in practice reanalysis precipitation estimates use different gauge satellite based datasets combined with numerical weather prediction models and data assimilation methods to create the climate variables see supplementary table s1 specifically the ncep csfr is based on the cpc merged analysis of precipitation cmap the jra 55 uses the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc and the global precipitation climatology project gpcp the era5 is based on the global precipitation monitoring mission microwave imager gmi the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc and the global precipitation climatology project gpcp and the wfdei uses the cru ts3 101 gauge data and the ts3 21 for the period 2010 2012 the observational data used by merra2 vary for latitudes over 62 5 no observational data are used for mid to high latitudes between 42 5 and 62 5 and low to mid latitudes less than 42 5 except africa the cpc unified cpcu gauged based analysis of global daily precipitation xie et al 2010 gauge data is used and for africa and the oceans the noaa cpc merged analysis of prediction global precipitation climatology project version 2 1 gpco2 1 cmap2 satellite and gauge data adler et al 2003 xie et al 2007 is used table 1 summarizes information on these datasets such as their temporal and spatial resolution coverage period variables included and so forth there are several other datasets available yet datasets with a resolution close to 0 5 were considered to keep consistency between the datasets all datasets were regridded to 0 5 by using the bilinear interpolation method also to have a common temporal coverage in all datasets a common period is chosen that is from 1980 to 2017 monthly precipitation and temperature data were extracted from datasets with daily and sub daily temporal resolution finally the kg climate types were obtained for the cru udel merra2 jra 55 wfdei ncep cfsr and era5 products 3 köppen geiger climate classification the köppen geiger kg climate classification uses monthly and annual total precipitation and monthly near surface temperature to identify the climate type of a region the scheme groups terrestrial climates into five main types tropical a dry b temperate c snow d and polar e these major types are refined into subtypes based on precipitation represented by the second letter except for the e type and temperature criteria third letter the criteria used in the kg classification were initially defined by köppen 1936 and modified by peel et al 2007 peel et al 2007 altered the temperate c and cold d climate types by replacing the threshold of 3 c with 0 c as suggested by russell 1931 an additional check is also added by peel et al 2007 depending on the amount of precipitation occurring in winter w and summer s to subtypes within the c or d type where both cs and cw or ds and dw are satisfied if the summer precipitation was greater than the winter precipitation cw or dw is assigned otherwise cs or ds is assigned this additional check is required as cs and cw or ds and dw are not mutually exclusive the climate types bs and bw are modified by considering that 70 of precipitation falls in summer and winter respectively here we use the datasets in table 1 to construct global kg maps following the modification of peel et al 2007 similar to other studies beck et al 2018 kriticos et al 2012 the detailed criteria that identify a kg climate subtype are summarized in table 2 the letter combinations correspond to the description and corresponding criterion in the table for example climate type bwh corresponds to dry arid and hot desert csa corresponds to temperate dry and hot summer and so on 4 kg maps and discrepancies in climate types 4 1 kg maps of the seven global products we used monthly temperature and precipitation from seven gridded products to derive global kg climate maps over the 1980 2017 period fig 1 visual inspection of the kg maps fig 1 reveals differences in climate subtypes over regions such as alaska northern and western canada northeastern russia known as the russian far east the middle east the central eastern and southeast asia the northeastern and central africa and both the western and eastern part of united states in greenland cru shows differences in the polar frost ef and tundra et climate types fig 1a that is climate type et covers on average 0 3 less area compared to reanalysis products fig 1c d e f and 1 2 more area compared to the wfdei fig 1g in three maps derived from reanalysis products fig 1d e the cold climate subtype dfc dominates in most regions of alaska northern and western canada and northeastern russia however maps derived from observation datasets fig 1a b depict in these regions both polar tundra and dfc notable differences among the kg maps are spotted in central africa which is described by the tropical climate subtypes af and am these subtypes in observation based kg maps fig 1a b cover in general a smaller area compared to reanalysis based kg maps fig 1c d e f in the northwestern part of south america and southeast asia the tropical climate subtypes am af and aw show also different spatial patterns among the maps regions described by the dry climate subtypes bsk bsh and bwk differ in the western united states middle east australia and central asia most regions described by temperate climate subtypes coincide in europe and the eastern united states polar climate subtypes are defined solely on temperature criteria table 2 thus the different spatial patterns observed in the kg maps are explained by differences in temperature values among the datasets however both temperature and precipitation patterns should be analyzed to understand discrepancies in other climate subtypes next we provide a detailed comparison of the seven kg maps and investigate how differences in temperature and precipitation values among the products result in different kg climate subtypes 4 2 quantifying differences among the kg maps first we performed a pairwise comparison of the seven kg maps fig 1 by assessing the similarity of each pair here the similarity is defined as the percentage of grid points in a pair of maps that have the same climate type the results for the 21 different pairs are presented in fig 2 the lowest level of similarity 69 6 is observed between the gauge based cru and the reanalysis based ncep cfsr maps the highest level of similarity 90 4 is shown between the gauge based cru and multi source products wfdei maps because wfdei uses cru data in its data assimilation approach in general the percentage of similarity between pairs of reanalysis kg maps is high 82 86 5 with an average of 84 5 the similarity between pairs of gauge based maps is 78 4 pairs of gauge based and reanalysis show high variation in similarity 69 4 84 4 with an average of 77 3 pairs of gauge based kg maps show high variation in similarity 78 89 5 with an average of 84 wfdei and merra2 kg maps show more than 79 similarity to the other maps followed by the udel with approximately 78 similarity compared with the other maps cru and wfdei maps show the lowest and highest number of grid points with similar climate types at an average of 77 and 84 respectively these calculations indicate that there are terrestrial regions in the kg maps displaying different climate subtypes to determine the source of variation we analyzed grid points of each map in geographical zones based on specific latitudes ϕ north polar 66 5 ϕ 90 covering 4 1 of the earth s surface north temperate 23 5 ϕ 66 5 with 26 land coverage tropics 23 5 ϕ 23 5 with 39 8 land coverage south temperate 66 5 ϕ 23 5 with 26 land coverage south polar 90 ϕ 66 5 with 4 1 land coverage the similarity between all pairs of kg maps within geographical zones except for the south polar zone is presented in the heat maps in fig 3 over the north polar zone hereafter referred to as the polar zone we observed 10 distinct climate subtypes from the major kg groups of b c d and e including bsk hot steppe and arid cfc temperate cold summer without dry season dfc cold summer without dry season and ef polar frost the largest similarity of 94 is observed between pairs of gauge based and multi source kg maps wfdei and cru in addition 68 3 to 80 2 similarity is observed among gauge based udel cru vs reanalysis era5 jra 55 merra2 kg maps as latitudes decrease from polar to north temperate zones the diversity of detected climate subtypes increases 28 distinct kg climate subtypes including tropical rainforest af tropical monsoon am cold steppe and arid bsk hot desert and arid bwh temperate cold and warm summers without dry season cfc cfb cold summers without dry season dfb dfc and polar frost ef in this zone we observe a higher similarity in most pairs of kg maps except between pairs of reanalysis based kg maps for instance 68 3 89 4 similarity is shown in maps derived from reanalysis and gauge based products compared to polar zone maps similarity between pairs of reanalysis based maps can barely meet the 85 similarity notably we see a substantial increase in similarity between multi source and other kg maps except for wfdei vs cru over the tropics 17 different climate subtypes including af am bsk cfc ef and et are detected from all kg maps only kg maps derived from the wfdei and cru show more than 90 similarity fig 3 in general the highly similar maps in the north temperate and polar zones show less similarity in the tropics over the south temperate zone 24 kg subtypes are detected in all kg maps in this zone we observe the lowest level of similarity 73 on average compared to other zones the highest similarity 87 7 is observed between wfdei and cru kg maps a possible reason for this high similarity is that wfdei uses cru to assimilate precipitation and temperature we estimated the average similarity of a kg map with all the rest of the maps in different zones table 3 and the variability among different zones and datasets fig 4 the average similarity is shown in marks for example the merra2 map shows an 80 average similarity with other maps in the polar zone in the south temperate and tropics reanalysis maps show lower similarity than gauge based maps cru however the multi source kg map shows a larger similarity 77 with the other maps table 3 on the contrary in north temperate and polar zones gauge based maps and reanalysis maps have the least and largest average similarity with the other maps notably the jra 55 map has the lowest average similarity in the south temperate and tropic while it shows the largest similarity in the polar zones table 3 in general the multi source kg map shows a larger similarity with other maps except for the polar zones the highest variation of average similarity in the four zones as assessed by the range is observed for the jra 55 map with a range observed in 69 79 in general the variation in the four zones is much smaller for the other kg maps fig 4a rows in table 3 if we focus on the average similarity of all maps within each zone fig 4b columns in table 3 it seems that kg maps agree more for the north temperate zone although it is expected to observe the polar subtypes in high latitudes era5 and udel kg maps depicted ef regions over the tropics and south temperate zones additionally udel cru and wfdei kg maps show regions with a semi arid cold climate bsk in northern western canada which is not realistic as these regions have a cold climate and there are major differences among precipitation and temperature patterns in regions with arid vs cold climates to investigate these surprising findings and the low similarity among maps we investigated which climate subtypes account for these anomalies by assessing the variations in spatial patterns land coverage and density of each climate subtype fig 5 supplementary figure s1 and table s2 note that the percentage of land coved by a specific climate type is estimated as the ratio of the actual area described by this climate type over the global land area and not as the number of grids over the total number of grids also in cases where products have missing grid points the total land cover see fig 5f will not add to 100 the arid climate b has the highest and lowest land coverage for the merra2 and jra 55 maps respectively table 4 for the other major climates a c and d reanalysis product maps jra 55 merra2 and ncep cfsr show the highest land coverage while the udel map shows the lowest for climate e the gauge based cru map did not represent the subtypes in antarctica due to the lack of data in this region this resulted in lower land coverage percentages of ef and et in these maps fig 5e although the ncep cfsr map shows the largest area covered by the c climate 13 no regions are described by the climate subtype csc however the csc type exists in all the other maps covering small regions the largest variation in land coverage percentage in all seven maps is observed in the dfc subtype which in most maps represents the largest portion 9 of the d climate type the second largest variation is observed in the bwk type representing the b climate type s lowest land coverage fig 5 in 60 of the climate subtypes gauge based product maps show lower land coverage than the others however some climate subtypes are missing in the reanalysis maps for example dsd is missing from merra2 jra 55 ncep cfsr and era5 dwd is missing from jra 55 and merra2 dfd is missing from jra 55 table s2 to investigate the missing climate subtypes we focused on their kg climate classification criteria of temperature t c o l d and t h o t and precipitation p s d r y and p w w e t according to kg climate classification table 2 regions with t c o l d 38 c lead to climate subtypes that have d as the third letter including dwd dfd and dsd no regions show t c o l d 38 c in the jra 55 map as noted also in donat et al 2016 and pitman and perkins 2009 this explains why the jra 55 kg map does not include the dwd dfd and dsd types notably the reanalysis maps show warmer t c o l d than gauge based maps as highlighted by wang and zeng 2013 and kharyutkina et al 2012 one of the coldest places on earth is yakutia sakha located in north eastern russia 55 29 n to 76 46 n and 105 32 e to 162 55 e studies show that the average and minimum temperatures in the coldest month are below 40 c and 60 c respectively nazarova et al 2011 petrov et al 2011 however neither the merra2 nor the jra 55 t c o l d maps showed regions with t c o l d 40 c however over yakutia the range of t c o l d in the cru map is 54 1 38 c our findings indicate that reanalysis products jra 55 do not represent well minimum temperature patterns in this region although regions having t c o l d 38 c are spotted in the merra2 ncep cfsr and era5 the rest of the criteria defining the dsd climate subtype p s d r y 40 m m and p s d r y p w w e t 3 are not fulfilled none of the regions in the merra2 p w d r y map depicts t c o l d 38 c thus merra2 kg map does not include the dwd type refer to supplementary section s1 and figures s2 to s5 for a detailed explanation of why the climate subtypes are missing in reanalysis datasets clearly the temperature and precipitation products we use differ from each other since they use different sources and methods to estimate their values this can lead to different climate type assessments for the same grid point to measure the climate type uncertainty in the constructed kg maps we counted the number of different climate types observed in each grid among the seven kg maps the uncertainty in major climate types and subtypes fig 6 shows that globally 82 7 of grid points have the same major climate type yet 16 1 of grid points are described by two different major types or more generally 17 3 of grid points are described by more than one up to four major climate type fig 6a the variability of climate subtypes at grid points is even larger and results in coherent spatial patterns fig 6b specifically only 64 8 of grid points show the same climate subtype fig 6b with agreement observed in antarctica central russia greenland the northern part of africa and some regions in the eastern united states and brazil approximately 26 4 and 7 2 of the grid points are described by two and three different subtypes respectively these grid points are located for example in large regions of australia central and southern africa and the western united states regions having four climate subtypes 1 35 of grid points are southern africa western parts of south america north eastern russia and the mountainous regions north of india five climate subtypes 0 17 are spotted in western america eastern and southern africa eastern asia and eastern australia and six climate subtypes 0 01 are observed in a few grid points in tanzania mexico peru and bolivia the variability of climate subtypes in specific regions differs also in each product for example the subtypes of ef and et in greenland are uncertain due to the lack of gauge based data in that region over the tropics western america mexico central and southern parts of africa central asia and china the reanalysis products show more climate subtypes than the gauge based products however over the polar zone e g alaska western canada and central africa gauge based kg maps show more climate subtypes than the reanalysis maps overall compared with other regions uncertainty among climate subtypes in the middle east western america china and north eastern russia is high in these regions the low density of stations and the topographic complexity high elevations and mountainous regions may be the reason for higher uncertainty among climate subtypes this agrees also with the findings of beck et al 2018 the comparison among the datasets is not completely independent for example both era 5 and jra 55 use gpcc for assimilation and wfdei uses cru table s1 yet combining different sources of information leads to different precipitation estimates rajulapati et al 2020 sun et al 2018 though wfdei uses cru other sources reanalysis satellites are also considered similarly era 5 and jra 55 have different estimates from reanalysis this introduces uncertainty in the precipitation and temperature data and consequently in obtaining climate types which is the major goal of this manuscript to understand discrepancies in kg climate classification from different datasets we therefore used all sources of data that is seven products to obtain robust kg climate maps 5 development of robust kg maps the previous analysis showed that the seven kg maps have similarities and differences we developed two kg master maps by 1 merging the kg classes and 2 combining the precipitation and temperature data from the seven datasets in the first method at each grid point a climate subtype was obtained as the most frequently observed among the seven kg maps fig 7 a note that we discarded some grids in the reanalysis based maps where climate subtypes e g dfd dwd and dsd are lacking in some regions such as yakutia also if three or more climate types were observed in a grid for example in 0 01 of grids the bsk and bwk types are observed in three different kg maps each we performed a regional analysis to assign the climate subtype by assessing the highest frequency in that region particularly we studied 8 surrounding grids to determine the climate subtype of each ambiguous grid the second map combines temperature and precipitation data from the seven gridded products fig 7b several options including weighting methods objective analysis and statistical methods are available in the literature weighting methods such as bayesian moving average bma triantafyllopoulos and nason 2007 are not applicable because there are no independent station data to evaluate the weight from the many stations used in gauge based products e g cru in terms of the objective analysis methods the triple collocation method stoffelen 1998 is also not applicable for two reasons first it only accepts three input datasets while we use seven global products and second its input datasets must be independent whereas our gauge based products have many overlapping data we therefore used a statistical method that is we estimated the median of precipitation and temperature at each grid point for the seven products we obtained thus a single dataset of precipitation and temperature and used them to develop the second master kg map fig 7b the two master kg maps are 95 similar with most climate types showing less than a 0 5 difference in land coverage table 5 and table s3 this land coverage percentage agrees with the finding of chen and chen 2013 and rubel and kottek 2010 although kg maps derived from several products do not include the climate subtypes of dsd dwd dfb and csc these types are presented in the two master kg maps table 5 to assess which single product produces the most reliable kg map we compared the similarity of each of the seven kg maps with the two kg master maps fig 8 the wfdei jra 55 and era 5 shows approximately 88 similarity with both kg master maps whereas the wfdei map has a high similarity of over 88 reanalysis kg maps have in general more than 88 similarity except for ncep cfsr with the kg master map the gauge based kg maps show slightly less similarity 85 compared to the reanalysis if we assume the master map is more reliable than individual maps then both gauged based and reanalysis maps are performing equally well however wfdei could be an option as it covers the climate types missing in the merra2 and era5 maps table 5 and has the highest similarity with the master kg maps we do not observe any notable differences in the similarity of each dataset s kg map with the two master kg maps for every latitudinal zone supplementary figure s6 in the north temperate each dataset has an almost equal similarity percentage with the master kg maps around 85 2 owing to the abundance of gauge stations in the zone this leads to more robust data from the reanalysis datasets resembling the observational ones in the tropics the highest percentages of similarity are observed for the two observational and the one multi source datasets while most of the reanalysis datasets have lower similarity this grouping is owed to the uncertainty of convective rainfall modeling by reanalysis datasets in the tropics in the polar zone the opposite is observed due to the scarcity of observational data and the good performance of reanalysis data at high latitudes barrett et al 2020 krogh et al 2015 krogh pomeroy 2018 lindsay et al 2014 serreze et al 2005 in the south temperate zone the relatively high variability of the similarity percentages is again owed to data scarcity the two robust köppen geiger climate classification maps are available as background data in the online version of the current manuscript and as mendeley data at https data mendeley com datasets 6f7nrdnyrx 1 hobbi et al 2022 6 discussion and conclusions here we derived kg climate classification maps using seven gridded precipitation and temperature datasets including two gauge based four reanalyses and one multi source global products first we assessed the similarity of the seven kg maps through a pairwise comparison at global and zonal scales the similarity between the two maps is defined here as the percentage of grid points having the same kg climate subtype in general there are notable differences among the maps with the similarity between gauge based and reanalysis kg maps being lower than in other pairs e g between gauge based and multi source maps focusing on different geographical zones south temperate tropics north temperate and polar the analysis shows that in general the highest and lowest similarity among the maps is observed in the north and south temperate zones respectively in all kg maps the north temperate zone displayed the largest number of climate subtypes in a large percentage of grid points there is notable variability or uncertainty even in major climate types among the seven maps specifically the analysis shows that 82 7 of grid points among the seven maps have the same major climate type however 17 3 of grid points are described by more than one major climate type the analysis also reveals coherent spatial patterns of grids described with more than one major climate type investigation of the climate subtypes shows a stronger uncertainty with 64 8 of grids having the same subtype some notable regions where the maps agree are spotted in antarctica central russia greenland the northern part of africa and some regions in the eastern united states and brazil the 35 13 of the grids are described by more than one climate subtype up to six subtypes in some cases and very large regions all over the globe e g in south asia central and south africa west north and south america etc are marked as ambiguous in terms of their climate subtype the variability of climate subtypes in specific regions may be attributed to differences between the observational data used in their original form or used for the generation of reanalysis datasets the orography and finally the specific form of regional rainfall which introduces additional uncertainty in reanalysis data the state of the art review of sun et al 2018 can provide useful feedback on these discrepancies considering the observational data source cru ts and wfdei should present similarities since wfdei is based on cru ts observations see supplementary table s1 and so should jra 55 and era5 both based on the global precipitation climatology centre and the global precipitation climatology project indeed 90 4 of the grid points showed similar kg climate types between cru ts and wfdei and 86 5 between jra 55 and era5 which were the two highest similarity percentages in the comparisons of the datasets by two the differences between these pairs of datasets are owed to the different approaches used in developing each product overall in our analysis we notice higher disagreement among the datasets for the choice of climate sub type in regions with a low density of stations a simmons et al 2016 a j simmons et al 2017 e g northeastern russia southeastern china north canada and regions in africa and south america as also has been noted in other studies e g donat et al 2014 a j simmons et al 2017 although this makes the need for appropriate gauge observations imperative the number of gauges has been declining globally sun et al 2018 aggravating the production of reliable gridded products based on ground observations herrera et al 2019 we should note that over the polar zone e g alaska western canada and central africa where the lack of data is evident gauge based kg maps have higher uncertainty show more climate subtypes for the same region than the reanalysis maps other studies have also found that reanalysis products can produce credible precipitation fields when analyzing atmospheric and surface fields at high latitudes gauge based datasets are not reliable here due to the undercatch since a high percentage of precipitation falls as snow barrett et al 2020 krogh et al 2015 krogh pomeroy 2018 lindsay et al 2014 prein gobiet 2017 serreze et al 2005 the spatial pattern of the discrepancies among kg maps based on different datasets clearly resembles the global topographic map supplementary figure s7 with higher elevations having a higher degree of kg discrepancy e g henn et al 2018 based on the review of sun et al 2018 for south asia most data sets including gauge based estimates reanalysis systems and satellite retrievals have limitations in reproducing orographic rainfall as has been reported for the western ghats mountain range northeast india and the himalayan foothills hu et al 2016 palazzi et al 2013 prakash et al 2015a prakash et al 2015b sun et al 2018 it is in these areas that we also noticed the highest discrepancies among the datasets in our study western america also presents inconsistencies among datasets due to the mountain ranges along the west coasts in south america for example reanalysis products overestimated the amount of mountain rainfall compared with the observational datasets silva et al 2011 we also detected climate type differences in the mountainous regions of southern and western europe where reanalysis products are less consistent sun et al 2018 in europe orography also affects the accuracy of the satellite rainfall retrieval techniques stampoulis anagnostou 2012 the rainfall type may induce high uncertainty in creating reanalysis data huang et al 2016 kidd et al 2012 ma et al 2009 miao et al 2015 sun et al 2014 in the tropics the precipitation is mainly convective and the reanalysis datasets differ from the other products in terms of the spatial patterns of kg maps a reason for this difference is the parametrization of deep convection in the tropics kharin et al 2005 convective rainfall also increases uncertainty in gauge interpolation stampoulis anagnostou 2012 satellite based products also do not always provide reliable convective precipitation during monsoon season e g india south america and eastern africa compared to gauge based gridded precipitation data salio et al 2015 shah mishra 2014 sunilkumar et al 2015 thiemig et al 2012 due to the erroneous estimation of moisture content and therefore precipitable water shah mishra 2014 there is no single dataset that is considered the best to develop a kg map at the global scale given the uncertainty in the precipitation and temperature estimates from different datasets it is important to consider these discrepancies in developing a master kg map as kharin et al 2005 suggested in global dataset intercomparison studies no single model can be selected as the optimum and therefore it is crucial to include a multi model ensemble approach to exploit the information from the seven global datasets used here and reduce the uncertainty in characterizing the climate in different regions we implicitly and explicitly combined the datasets to create two robust kg maps the first kg master map assigns in each grid the most frequently observed climate subtype among the seven kg maps however individual datasets of a given type e g reanalysis might cluster together and outnumber the other datasets resulting in a biased climate type to alleviate any possible clustering we considered a second approach by combining temperature and precipitation data from the seven gridded products creating a unique set of temperature and precipitation which is then used to construct the master kg map the two master maps show more robust spatial patterns than the individual ones and the similarity between them is 95 also specific climate subtypes that were not found in some individual maps e g in some reanalysis maps are observed in the two master maps we also used the first master map to benchmark which one of the individual maps is the most reliable judging only by similarity the era5 and merra2 performed equally well yet since there are climate subtypes missing and the wfdei shows similar performance we deem the latter is a better choice finally we note that both master maps are equally good by including the uncertainty from different data sources of information as a future direction it is worth exploring different climate classifications and their variation in different products and the potential effects of downscaling methods for finer spatial resolution maps also we acknowledge that the true variability of the climate subtypes in each grid might be even larger than the one we present to improve the representation of this variability a promising option could be to use large ensemble probabilistic datasets e g tang et al 2021 that could help quantify more thoroughly the uncertainty although this research could be further expanded we believe it reveals the large uncertainty in climate classification and offers a robust kg map that might help researchers to better evaluate future climate shifts credit authorship contribution statement salma

3107,the köppen geiger kg climate classification has been widely used to determine the climate at global and regional scales using precipitation and temperature data kg maps are typically developed using a single product however uncertainties in kg climate types resulting from different precipitation and temperature datasets have not been explored in detail here we assess seven global datasets to show uncertainties in kg classification from 1980 to 2017 using a pairwise comparison at global and zonal scales we quantify the similarity among the seven kg maps gauge and reanalysis based kg maps have a notable difference spatially the highest and lowest similarity is observed for the north and south temperate zones respectively notably 17 of grids among the seven maps show variations even in the major kg climate types while 35 of grids are described by more than one kg climate subtype strong uncertainty is observed in south asia central and south africa western america and northeastern australia we created two kg master maps 0 5 resolution by merging the climate maps directly and by combining the precipitation and temperature data from the seven datasets these master maps are more robust than the individual ones showing coherent spatial patterns this study reveals the large uncertainty in climate classification and offers two robust kg maps that may help to better evaluate historical climate and quantify future climate shifts keywords köppen geiger classification uncertainty quantification precipitation and temperature products data availability the original

datasets 6f7nrdnyrx 1 hobbi et al 2022 1 introduction climate determines the distribution of major ecosystems such as forests deserts tundra etc on earth the regional climate is mainly affected by the global distribution of solar radiation and the large scale atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns this leads to many different climate types and the need to classify them climate classifications identify regions with similar climate characteristics these classifications help to evaluate regional climate changes or shifts domroes 2003 fraedrich et al 2001 gao giorgi 2008 rohli et al 2015 effects of climate change on agriculture and vegetation cramer leemans 1993 maracchi et al 2005 taylor philp 2016 determine suitable local or regional crops araya et al 2010 meybeck et al 2012 develop agro climatic zones bouma 2005 and improve infrastructure design e g dams roads etc hossain et al 2012 taylor philp 2015 several climate classifications exist representing regional characteristics such as 1 precipitation and temperature köppen and geiger 1928 2 biome olson et al 2001 3 geographical location altitude and humidity holdridge 1947 and 4 plant physiology gardner et al 2020 however the most popular climate classification is the köppen geiger kg which is based on temperature and precipitation data köppen and geiger 1928 given several readily available gridded precipitation and temperature products the interest in climate classification has intensified over the last decades yet literature lacks information on how the kg classification varies with different global products in 1900 wladimir köppen established the first quantitative climate classification and produced the first climate map a revised climate classification map was published in 1918 köppen 1918 in 1923 köppen used the classification to investigate the boundaries of climate around the globe köppen 1923 köppen and geiger presented the first world map of climate classification in 1928 köppen and geiger 1928 creating the well known köppen geiger kg classification the classification was further refined by köppen 1936 and improved by geiger 1954 a modification was proposed by köppen and trewartha trewartha horn 1980 trewartha 1968 as well as by peel et al 2007 who amended some criteria the global kg maps have been updated many times over the last decades and gained popularity not only for linking climate and vegetation bailey 2009 but also for their simplicity wilcock 1968 in the early 1990s triantafyllou and tsonis 1994 used station data for the first time from the northern hemisphere to identify the kg climate types some studies investigated climate changes by creating kg maps from the outputs of climate models and compared them with the köppen s 1923 map gnanadesikan stouffer 2006 kalvová et al 2003 kleidon et al 2000 lohmann et al 1993 wang overland 2004 kottek et al 2006 adopted gridded data to update the world kg classification map between 1951 and 2000 while chen chen 2013 and peel et al 2007 adopted station based datasets with more than 30 years of data for each record a recent fine resolution of kg classification was derived by using climate model ensemble datasets and observations beck et al 2018 here we apply the kg classification as modified by peel et al 2007 by using seven global temperature and precipitation data products in order to quantify the uncertainty in classifying climate types global precipitation and temperature datasets have been widely used for different purposes including ecological and hydrological modelling validating climate models analyzing climate variation synthesizing extreme events characteristics and calibrating forecast models gleckler et al 2008 kidston et al 2010 kravtsov et al 2014 mackellar et al 2007 new et al 2000 these datasets were derived by combining different sources gauge based observations radars satellites and reanalysis models at various spatial from 0 1 to 5 and temporal resolutions from sub daily to monthly most of the global gridded products provide estimates of both precipitation and temperature at different spatial and temporal resolutions see e g the gauge based university of delaware udel the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep etc other products such as the global precipitation climatology center gpcc the climate prediction center cpc unified and the ncep ncar focus only on precipitation data these products often show notable differences due to different data sources and different processing methods costa foley 1998 dore 2005 folland et al 2001 hawkins et al 2017 rajulapati et al 2020 sun et al 2018 wong et al 2017 thus the climate type identified in a region since the kg classification uses temperature and precipitation measurements might differ depending on the dataset used the literature lacks information on how kg climate types vary given that different global precipitation and temperature products are used kg maps are typically used to identify the geographical distribution of climate types to do so kg maps have been developed using gridded 1 station based data chen chen 2013 de oliveira aparecido et al 2020 kottek et al 2006 peel et al 2007 rubel kottek 2010 triantafyllou tsonis 1994 2 climate models outputs fraedrich et al 2001 gnanadesikan stouffer 2006 guetter kutzbach 1990 kalvová et al 2003 kim et al 2008 lohmann et al 1993 and 3 ensembles of station based and climate models data beck et al 2018 another aim is to detect changes and shifts in climate types over time climate change and long term climate variations can affect the regional climate and the distribution of plants and thus the climate types elmendorf et al 2012 specifically changes in climate type have been investigated by comparing regions identified by climate subtypes chen chen 2013 diaz eischeid 2007 wang overland 2004 kim et al 2008 showed that between 1951 and 1970 and 1981 2000 northern china experienced shifts to drier conditions fraedrich et al 2001 showed substantial changes in the modified köppen climate zones in the late 20th century and statistically significant shifts over the deserts of southern africa and the tropics in east asia regional climate changes were investigated by calculating the frequency of occurrence of kg subtypes yoshino kazuko 1981 the kg classification has also been used to show projected kg world maps and future changes in climate types yun et al 2012 investigated the sub tropical area of the future climate in korea and showed an increase of 21 and 35 based on the trewartha and kg classifications respectively according to kalvová et al 2003 and lohmann et al 1993 regions with tropical and dry climate types will expand in the future while regions described by the rest of the climate types will shrink projected global kg maps were derived using different climate models and methods rubel and kottek 2010 presented the future global kg map resolution 0 5 from 2076 to 2100 using temperature and precipitation data from an ensemble of global climate model projections provided by the tyndall centre for climate change research tyn mitchell et al 2004 for four ipcc emission scenarios beck et al 2018 used an ensemble of climate projections 32 models rcp8 5 scenario from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cimip5 taylor et al 2012 to derive a fine resolution resolution 0 0083 global kg map for the 2071 2100 period they depicted the present day 1980 2016 and future 2071 2100 confidence maps of kg subtypes by calculating the fraction of the most common climate subtype and the ensemble size although kg climate maps have been updated and used many times the study of beck et al 2018 is one of the few studies that compared the similarity of kg climate subtypes between climate models and observations yet they did not show the uncertainty among the data products they used in this study we assess how different global datasets affect the kg classification we use seven gridded products of precipitation and temperature including reanalysis gauge based and satellite datasets covering the 1980 2017 period our objectives are to 1 develop kg classification maps using seven global datasets 2 assess the uncertainty in evaluating kg climate types and 3 create a kg map by combining all datasets 2 data there are many large scale climate data sets from in situ observations that can be used for climate studies however gauge measurements have several limitations such as incomplete areal coverage and deficiencies over sparsely populated areas sun et al 2018 satellite derived datasets can alleviate some of these constraints by providing spatially homogeneous coverage despite their short length record products merging satellite and gauge measurements can also improve the accuracy of climate variable measurements such as the global precipitation climatology project gpcp monthly precipitation analysis which merges gauge observations with low orbit satellite microwave data and geosynchronous orbit satellite infrared data reanalysis is a retrospective analysis which uses data assimilation to construct long term datasets reanalysis datasets are sequences of snapshots of atmospheric conditions produced by a numerical weather prediction model and a data assimilation method over past periods combined with the observed data available during those periods bengtsson shukla 1988 parker 2016 trenberth olson 1988 they are attractive and popular for climate studies since they provide complete time series over long time periods reanalysis datasets have been criticized by scientists based on parker 2016 the most important difference between observational and reanalysis datasets is that errors and uncertainties associated with reanalysis are often less well understood than those associated with observations uncertainty in reanalysis products originates from errors or limitations in the observations needed for data assimilation or uncertainties in the atmospheric models used to generate the forecast for data assimilation hofer et al 2012 here we used a variety of global datasets to alleviate their limitations specifically we used near surface 2 meter temperature and precipitation data from gauged based and reanalysis products and from products combining various sources of information e g satellites reanalysis gauges etc particularly we included two gauge based products that is 1 the university of delaware air temperature precipitation udel version 5 01 derived from station data such as the global historical climatology network ghcn2 and the global surface summary of day gsod willmott matsuura 1995 and 2 the climate research unit university of east anglia cru ts version 4 04 which offers land based data excluding antarctica by interpolating monthly climate anomalies from an extensive weather station network harris et al 2014 the four reanalysis products are 1 the national centers for environmental prediction ncep climate forecast system reanalysis ncep cfsr versions 1 and 2 a high resolution reanalysis product which couples ocean atmospheric sea ice and land surface data sources saha et al 2014 2 the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 a comprehensive reanalysis climate dataset covering more than half a century by applying the four dimensional variational analysis 4d var assimilation system kobayashi et al 2015 3 the fifth generation of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts era5 a reanalysis global dataset including records of land surface atmosphere and ocean waves hersbach et al 2020 and 4 and the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra version 2 a reanalysis atmospheric product using satellite data generated by nasa s global modeling and assimilation office gmao gelaro et al 2017 finally the multi source product we used is the wfdei meteorological forcing data a combined satellite and reanalysis data product created by applying the watch forcing data methodology and making use of the era interim reanalysis data weedon et al 2014 note that although reanalysis estimates are based on observations and model forecasts these estimates are not real observations e g bosilovich et al 2013 in practice reanalysis precipitation estimates use different gauge satellite based datasets combined with numerical weather prediction models and data assimilation methods to create the climate variables see supplementary table s1 specifically the ncep csfr is based on the cpc merged analysis of precipitation cmap the jra 55 uses the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc and the global precipitation climatology project gpcp the era5 is based on the global precipitation monitoring mission microwave imager gmi the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc and the global precipitation climatology project gpcp and the wfdei uses the cru ts3 101 gauge data and the ts3 21 for the period 2010 2012 the observational data used by merra2 vary for latitudes over 62 5 no observational data are used for mid to high latitudes between 42 5 and 62 5 and low to mid latitudes less than 42 5 except africa the cpc unified cpcu gauged based analysis of global daily precipitation xie et al 2010 gauge data is used and for africa and the oceans the noaa cpc merged analysis of prediction global precipitation climatology project version 2 1 gpco2 1 cmap2 satellite and gauge data adler et al 2003 xie et al 2007 is used table 1 summarizes information on these datasets such as their temporal and spatial resolution coverage period variables included and so forth there are several other datasets available yet datasets with a resolution close to 0 5 were considered to keep consistency between the datasets all datasets were regridded to 0 5 by using the bilinear interpolation method also to have a common temporal coverage in all datasets a common period is chosen that is from 1980 to 2017 monthly precipitation and temperature data were extracted from datasets with daily and sub daily temporal resolution finally the kg climate types were obtained for the cru udel merra2 jra 55 wfdei ncep cfsr and era5 products 3 köppen geiger climate classification the köppen geiger kg climate classification uses monthly and annual total precipitation and monthly near surface temperature to identify the climate type of a region the scheme groups terrestrial climates into five main types tropical a dry b temperate c snow d and polar e these major types are refined into subtypes based on precipitation represented by the second letter except for the e type and temperature criteria third letter the criteria used in the kg classification were initially defined by köppen 1936 and modified by peel et al 2007 peel et al 2007 altered the temperate c and cold d climate types by replacing the threshold of 3 c with 0 c as suggested by russell 1931 an additional check is also added by peel et al 2007 depending on the amount of precipitation occurring in winter w and summer s to subtypes within the c or d type where both cs and cw or ds and dw are satisfied if the summer precipitation was greater than the winter precipitation cw or dw is assigned otherwise cs or ds is assigned this additional check is required as cs and cw or ds and dw are not mutually exclusive the climate types bs and bw are modified by considering that 70 of precipitation falls in summer and winter respectively here we use the datasets in table 1 to construct global kg maps following the modification of peel et al 2007 similar to other studies beck et al 2018 kriticos et al 2012 the detailed criteria that identify a kg climate subtype are summarized in table 2 the letter combinations correspond to the description and corresponding criterion in the table for example climate type bwh corresponds to dry arid and hot desert csa corresponds to temperate dry and hot summer and so on 4 kg maps and discrepancies in climate types 4 1 kg maps of the seven global products we used monthly temperature and precipitation from seven gridded products to derive global kg climate maps over the 1980 2017 period fig 1 visual inspection of the kg maps fig 1 reveals differences in climate subtypes over regions such as alaska northern and western canada northeastern russia known as the russian far east the middle east the central eastern and southeast asia the northeastern and central africa and both the western and eastern part of united states in greenland cru shows differences in the polar frost ef and tundra et climate types fig 1a that is climate type et covers on average 0 3 less area compared to reanalysis products fig 1c d e f and 1 2 more area compared to the wfdei fig 1g in three maps derived from reanalysis products fig 1d e the cold climate subtype dfc dominates in most regions of alaska northern and western canada and northeastern russia however maps derived from observation datasets fig 1a b depict in these regions both polar tundra and dfc notable differences among the kg maps are spotted in central africa which is described by the tropical climate subtypes af and am these subtypes in observation based kg maps fig 1a b cover in general a smaller area compared to reanalysis based kg maps fig 1c d e f in the northwestern part of south america and southeast asia the tropical climate subtypes am af and aw show also different spatial patterns among the maps regions described by the dry climate subtypes bsk bsh and bwk differ in the western united states middle east australia and central asia most regions described by temperate climate subtypes coincide in europe and the eastern united states polar climate subtypes are defined solely on temperature criteria table 2 thus the different spatial patterns observed in the kg maps are explained by differences in temperature values among the datasets however both temperature and precipitation patterns should be analyzed to understand discrepancies in other climate subtypes next we provide a detailed comparison of the seven kg maps and investigate how differences in temperature and precipitation values among the products result in different kg climate subtypes 4 2 quantifying differences among the kg maps first we performed a pairwise comparison of the seven kg maps fig 1 by assessing the similarity of each pair here the similarity is defined as the percentage of grid points in a pair of maps that have the same climate type the results for the 21 different pairs are presented in fig 2 the lowest level of similarity 69 6 is observed between the gauge based cru and the reanalysis based ncep cfsr maps the highest level of similarity 90 4 is shown between the gauge based cru and multi source products wfdei maps because wfdei uses cru data in its data assimilation approach in general the percentage of similarity between pairs of reanalysis kg maps is high 82 86 5 with an average of 84 5 the similarity between pairs of gauge based maps is 78 4 pairs of gauge based and reanalysis show high variation in similarity 69 4 84 4 with an average of 77 3 pairs of gauge based kg maps show high variation in similarity 78 89 5 with an average of 84 wfdei and merra2 kg maps show more than 79 similarity to the other maps followed by the udel with approximately 78 similarity compared with the other maps cru and wfdei maps show the lowest and highest number of grid points with similar climate types at an average of 77 and 84 respectively these calculations indicate that there are terrestrial regions in the kg maps displaying different climate subtypes to determine the source of variation we analyzed grid points of each map in geographical zones based on specific latitudes ϕ north polar 66 5 ϕ 90 covering 4 1 of the earth s surface north temperate 23 5 ϕ 66 5 with 26 land coverage tropics 23 5 ϕ 23 5 with 39 8 land coverage south temperate 66 5 ϕ 23 5 with 26 land coverage south polar 90 ϕ 66 5 with 4 1 land coverage the similarity between all pairs of kg maps within geographical zones except for the south polar zone is presented in the heat maps in fig 3 over the north polar zone hereafter referred to as the polar zone we observed 10 distinct climate subtypes from the major kg groups of b c d and e including bsk hot steppe and arid cfc temperate cold summer without dry season dfc cold summer without dry season and ef polar frost the largest similarity of 94 is observed between pairs of gauge based and multi source kg maps wfdei and cru in addition 68 3 to 80 2 similarity is observed among gauge based udel cru vs reanalysis era5 jra 55 merra2 kg maps as latitudes decrease from polar to north temperate zones the diversity of detected climate subtypes increases 28 distinct kg climate subtypes including tropical rainforest af tropical monsoon am cold steppe and arid bsk hot desert and arid bwh temperate cold and warm summers without dry season cfc cfb cold summers without dry season dfb dfc and polar frost ef in this zone we observe a higher similarity in most pairs of kg maps except between pairs of reanalysis based kg maps for instance 68 3 89 4 similarity is shown in maps derived from reanalysis and gauge based products compared to polar zone maps similarity between pairs of reanalysis based maps can barely meet the 85 similarity notably we see a substantial increase in similarity between multi source and other kg maps except for wfdei vs cru over the tropics 17 different climate subtypes including af am bsk cfc ef and et are detected from all kg maps only kg maps derived from the wfdei and cru show more than 90 similarity fig 3 in general the highly similar maps in the north temperate and polar zones show less similarity in the tropics over the south temperate zone 24 kg subtypes are detected in all kg maps in this zone we observe the lowest level of similarity 73 on average compared to other zones the highest similarity 87 7 is observed between wfdei and cru kg maps a possible reason for this high similarity is that wfdei uses cru to assimilate precipitation and temperature we estimated the average similarity of a kg map with all the rest of the maps in different zones table 3 and the variability among different zones and datasets fig 4 the average similarity is shown in marks for example the merra2 map shows an 80 average similarity with other maps in the polar zone in the south temperate and tropics reanalysis maps show lower similarity than gauge based maps cru however the multi source kg map shows a larger similarity 77 with the other maps table 3 on the contrary in north temperate and polar zones gauge based maps and reanalysis maps have the least and largest average similarity with the other maps notably the jra 55 map has the lowest average similarity in the south temperate and tropic while it shows the largest similarity in the polar zones table 3 in general the multi source kg map shows a larger similarity with other maps except for the polar zones the highest variation of average similarity in the four zones as assessed by the range is observed for the jra 55 map with a range observed in 69 79 in general the variation in the four zones is much smaller for the other kg maps fig 4a rows in table 3 if we focus on the average similarity of all maps within each zone fig 4b columns in table 3 it seems that kg maps agree more for the north temperate zone although it is expected to observe the polar subtypes in high latitudes era5 and udel kg maps depicted ef regions over the tropics and south temperate zones additionally udel cru and wfdei kg maps show regions with a semi arid cold climate bsk in northern western canada which is not realistic as these regions have a cold climate and there are major differences among precipitation and temperature patterns in regions with arid vs cold climates to investigate these surprising findings and the low similarity among maps we investigated which climate subtypes account for these anomalies by assessing the variations in spatial patterns land coverage and density of each climate subtype fig 5 supplementary figure s1 and table s2 note that the percentage of land coved by a specific climate type is estimated as the ratio of the actual area described by this climate type over the global land area and not as the number of grids over the total number of grids also in cases where products have missing grid points the total land cover see fig 5f will not add to 100 the arid climate b has the highest and lowest land coverage for the merra2 and jra 55 maps respectively table 4 for the other major climates a c and d reanalysis product maps jra 55 merra2 and ncep cfsr show the highest land coverage while the udel map shows the lowest for climate e the gauge based cru map did not represent the subtypes in antarctica due to the lack of data in this region this resulted in lower land coverage percentages of ef and et in these maps fig 5e although the ncep cfsr map shows the largest area covered by the c climate 13 no regions are described by the climate subtype csc however the csc type exists in all the other maps covering small regions the largest variation in land coverage percentage in all seven maps is observed in the dfc subtype which in most maps represents the largest portion 9 of the d climate type the second largest variation is observed in the bwk type representing the b climate type s lowest land coverage fig 5 in 60 of the climate subtypes gauge based product maps show lower land coverage than the others however some climate subtypes are missing in the reanalysis maps for example dsd is missing from merra2 jra 55 ncep cfsr and era5 dwd is missing from jra 55 and merra2 dfd is missing from jra 55 table s2 to investigate the missing climate subtypes we focused on their kg climate classification criteria of temperature t c o l d and t h o t and precipitation p s d r y and p w w e t according to kg climate classification table 2 regions with t c o l d 38 c lead to climate subtypes that have d as the third letter including dwd dfd and dsd no regions show t c o l d 38 c in the jra 55 map as noted also in donat et al 2016 and pitman and perkins 2009 this explains why the jra 55 kg map does not include the dwd dfd and dsd types notably the reanalysis maps show warmer t c o l d than gauge based maps as highlighted by wang and zeng 2013 and kharyutkina et al 2012 one of the coldest places on earth is yakutia sakha located in north eastern russia 55 29 n to 76 46 n and 105 32 e to 162 55 e studies show that the average and minimum temperatures in the coldest month are below 40 c and 60 c respectively nazarova et al 2011 petrov et al 2011 however neither the merra2 nor the jra 55 t c o l d maps showed regions with t c o l d 40 c however over yakutia the range of t c o l d in the cru map is 54 1 38 c our findings indicate that reanalysis products jra 55 do not represent well minimum temperature patterns in this region although regions having t c o l d 38 c are spotted in the merra2 ncep cfsr and era5 the rest of the criteria defining the dsd climate subtype p s d r y 40 m m and p s d r y p w w e t 3 are not fulfilled none of the regions in the merra2 p w d r y map depicts t c o l d 38 c thus merra2 kg map does not include the dwd type refer to supplementary section s1 and figures s2 to s5 for a detailed explanation of why the climate subtypes are missing in reanalysis datasets clearly the temperature and precipitation products we use differ from each other since they use different sources and methods to estimate their values this can lead to different climate type assessments for the same grid point to measure the climate type uncertainty in the constructed kg maps we counted the number of different climate types observed in each grid among the seven kg maps the uncertainty in major climate types and subtypes fig 6 shows that globally 82 7 of grid points have the same major climate type yet 16 1 of grid points are described by two different major types or more generally 17 3 of grid points are described by more than one up to four major climate type fig 6a the variability of climate subtypes at grid points is even larger and results in coherent spatial patterns fig 6b specifically only 64 8 of grid points show the same climate subtype fig 6b with agreement observed in antarctica central russia greenland the northern part of africa and some regions in the eastern united states and brazil approximately 26 4 and 7 2 of the grid points are described by two and three different subtypes respectively these grid points are located for example in large regions of australia central and southern africa and the western united states regions having four climate subtypes 1 35 of grid points are southern africa western parts of south america north eastern russia and the mountainous regions north of india five climate subtypes 0 17 are spotted in western america eastern and southern africa eastern asia and eastern australia and six climate subtypes 0 01 are observed in a few grid points in tanzania mexico peru and bolivia the variability of climate subtypes in specific regions differs also in each product for example the subtypes of ef and et in greenland are uncertain due to the lack of gauge based data in that region over the tropics western america mexico central and southern parts of africa central asia and china the reanalysis products show more climate subtypes than the gauge based products however over the polar zone e g alaska western canada and central africa gauge based kg maps show more climate subtypes than the reanalysis maps overall compared with other regions uncertainty among climate subtypes in the middle east western america china and north eastern russia is high in these regions the low density of stations and the topographic complexity high elevations and mountainous regions may be the reason for higher uncertainty among climate subtypes this agrees also with the findings of beck et al 2018 the comparison among the datasets is not completely independent for example both era 5 and jra 55 use gpcc for assimilation and wfdei uses cru table s1 yet combining different sources of information leads to different precipitation estimates rajulapati et al 2020 sun et al 2018 though wfdei uses cru other sources reanalysis satellites are also considered similarly era 5 and jra 55 have different estimates from reanalysis this introduces uncertainty in the precipitation and temperature data and consequently in obtaining climate types which is the major goal of this manuscript to understand discrepancies in kg climate classification from different datasets we therefore used all sources of data that is seven products to obtain robust kg climate maps 5 development of robust kg maps the previous analysis showed that the seven kg maps have similarities and differences we developed two kg master maps by 1 merging the kg classes and 2 combining the precipitation and temperature data from the seven datasets in the first method at each grid point a climate subtype was obtained as the most frequently observed among the seven kg maps fig 7 a note that we discarded some grids in the reanalysis based maps where climate subtypes e g dfd dwd and dsd are lacking in some regions such as yakutia also if three or more climate types were observed in a grid for example in 0 01 of grids the bsk and bwk types are observed in three different kg maps each we performed a regional analysis to assign the climate subtype by assessing the highest frequency in that region particularly we studied 8 surrounding grids to determine the climate subtype of each ambiguous grid the second map combines temperature and precipitation data from the seven gridded products fig 7b several options including weighting methods objective analysis and statistical methods are available in the literature weighting methods such as bayesian moving average bma triantafyllopoulos and nason 2007 are not applicable because there are no independent station data to evaluate the weight from the many stations used in gauge based products e g cru in terms of the objective analysis methods the triple collocation method stoffelen 1998 is also not applicable for two reasons first it only accepts three input datasets while we use seven global products and second its input datasets must be independent whereas our gauge based products have many overlapping data we therefore used a statistical method that is we estimated the median of precipitation and temperature at each grid point for the seven products we obtained thus a single dataset of precipitation and temperature and used them to develop the second master kg map fig 7b the two master kg maps are 95 similar with most climate types showing less than a 0 5 difference in land coverage table 5 and table s3 this land coverage percentage agrees with the finding of chen and chen 2013 and rubel and kottek 2010 although kg maps derived from several products do not include the climate subtypes of dsd dwd dfb and csc these types are presented in the two master kg maps table 5 to assess which single product produces the most reliable kg map we compared the similarity of each of the seven kg maps with the two kg master maps fig 8 the wfdei jra 55 and era 5 shows approximately 88 similarity with both kg master maps whereas the wfdei map has a high similarity of over 88 reanalysis kg maps have in general more than 88 similarity except for ncep cfsr with the kg master map the gauge based kg maps show slightly less similarity 85 compared to the reanalysis if we assume the master map is more reliable than individual maps then both gauged based and reanalysis maps are performing equally well however wfdei could be an option as it covers the climate types missing in the merra2 and era5 maps table 5 and has the highest similarity with the master kg maps we do not observe any notable differences in the similarity of each dataset s kg map with the two master kg maps for every latitudinal zone supplementary figure s6 in the north temperate each dataset has an almost equal similarity percentage with the master kg maps around 85 2 owing to the abundance of gauge stations in the zone this leads to more robust data from the reanalysis datasets resembling the observational ones in the tropics the highest percentages of similarity are observed for the two observational and the one multi source datasets while most of the reanalysis datasets have lower similarity this grouping is owed to the uncertainty of convective rainfall modeling by reanalysis datasets in the tropics in the polar zone the opposite is observed due to the scarcity of observational data and the good performance of reanalysis data at high latitudes barrett et al 2020 krogh et al 2015 krogh pomeroy 2018 lindsay et al 2014 serreze et al 2005 in the south temperate zone the relatively high variability of the similarity percentages is again owed to data scarcity the two robust köppen geiger climate classification maps are available as background data in the online version of the current manuscript and as mendeley data at https data mendeley com datasets 6f7nrdnyrx 1 hobbi et al 2022 6 discussion and conclusions here we derived kg climate classification maps using seven gridded precipitation and temperature datasets including two gauge based four reanalyses and one multi source global products first we assessed the similarity of the seven kg maps through a pairwise comparison at global and zonal scales the similarity between the two maps is defined here as the percentage of grid points having the same kg climate subtype in general there are notable differences among the maps with the similarity between gauge based and reanalysis kg maps being lower than in other pairs e g between gauge based and multi source maps focusing on different geographical zones south temperate tropics north temperate and polar the analysis shows that in general the highest and lowest similarity among the maps is observed in the north and south temperate zones respectively in all kg maps the north temperate zone displayed the largest number of climate subtypes in a large percentage of grid points there is notable variability or uncertainty even in major climate types among the seven maps specifically the analysis shows that 82 7 of grid points among the seven maps have the same major climate type however 17 3 of grid points are described by more than one major climate type the analysis also reveals coherent spatial patterns of grids described with more than one major climate type investigation of the climate subtypes shows a stronger uncertainty with 64 8 of grids having the same subtype some notable regions where the maps agree are spotted in antarctica central russia greenland the northern part of africa and some regions in the eastern united states and brazil the 35 13 of the grids are described by more than one climate subtype up to six subtypes in some cases and very large regions all over the globe e g in south asia central and south africa west north and south america etc are marked as ambiguous in terms of their climate subtype the variability of climate subtypes in specific regions may be attributed to differences between the observational data used in their original form or used for the generation of reanalysis datasets the orography and finally the specific form of regional rainfall which introduces additional uncertainty in reanalysis data the state of the art review of sun et al 2018 can provide useful feedback on these discrepancies considering the observational data source cru ts and wfdei should present similarities since wfdei is based on cru ts observations see supplementary table s1 and so should jra 55 and era5 both based on the global precipitation climatology centre and the global precipitation climatology project indeed 90 4 of the grid points showed similar kg climate types between cru ts and wfdei and 86 5 between jra 55 and era5 which were the two highest similarity percentages in the comparisons of the datasets by two the differences between these pairs of datasets are owed to the different approaches used in developing each product overall in our analysis we notice higher disagreement among the datasets for the choice of climate sub type in regions with a low density of stations a simmons et al 2016 a j simmons et al 2017 e g northeastern russia southeastern china north canada and regions in africa and south america as also has been noted in other studies e g donat et al 2014 a j simmons et al 2017 although this makes the need for appropriate gauge observations imperative the number of gauges has been declining globally sun et al 2018 aggravating the production of reliable gridded products based on ground observations herrera et al 2019 we should note that over the polar zone e g alaska western canada and central africa where the lack of data is evident gauge based kg maps have higher uncertainty show more climate subtypes for the same region than the reanalysis maps other studies have also found that reanalysis products can produce credible precipitation fields when analyzing atmospheric and surface fields at high latitudes gauge based datasets are not reliable here due to the undercatch since a high percentage of precipitation falls as snow barrett et al 2020 krogh et al 2015 krogh pomeroy 2018 lindsay et al 2014 prein gobiet 2017 serreze et al 2005 the spatial pattern of the discrepancies among kg maps based on different datasets clearly resembles the global topographic map supplementary figure s7 with higher elevations having a higher degree of kg discrepancy e g henn et al 2018 based on the review of sun et al 2018 for south asia most data sets including gauge based estimates reanalysis systems and satellite retrievals have limitations in reproducing orographic rainfall as has been reported for the western ghats mountain range northeast india and the himalayan foothills hu et al 2016 palazzi et al 2013 prakash et al 2015a prakash et al 2015b sun et al 2018 it is in these areas that we also noticed the highest discrepancies among the datasets in our study western america also presents inconsistencies among datasets due to the mountain ranges along the west coasts in south america for example reanalysis products overestimated the amount of mountain rainfall compared with the observational datasets silva et al 2011 we also detected climate type differences in the mountainous regions of southern and western europe where reanalysis products are less consistent sun et al 2018 in europe orography also affects the accuracy of the satellite rainfall retrieval techniques stampoulis anagnostou 2012 the rainfall type may induce high uncertainty in creating reanalysis data huang et al 2016 kidd et al 2012 ma et al 2009 miao et al 2015 sun et al 2014 in the tropics the precipitation is mainly convective and the reanalysis datasets differ from the other products in terms of the spatial patterns of kg maps a reason for this difference is the parametrization of deep convection in the tropics kharin et al 2005 convective rainfall also increases uncertainty in gauge interpolation stampoulis anagnostou 2012 satellite based products also do not always provide reliable convective precipitation during monsoon season e g india south america and eastern africa compared to gauge based gridded precipitation data salio et al 2015 shah mishra 2014 sunilkumar et al 2015 thiemig et al 2012 due to the erroneous estimation of moisture content and therefore precipitable water shah mishra 2014 there is no single dataset that is considered the best to develop a kg map at the global scale given the uncertainty in the precipitation and temperature estimates from different datasets it is important to consider these discrepancies in developing a master kg map as kharin et al 2005 suggested in global dataset intercomparison studies no single model can be selected as the optimum and therefore it is crucial to include a multi model ensemble approach to exploit the information from the seven global datasets used here and reduce the uncertainty in characterizing the climate in different regions we implicitly and explicitly combined the datasets to create two robust kg maps the first kg master map assigns in each grid the most frequently observed climate subtype among the seven kg maps however individual datasets of a given type e g reanalysis might cluster together and outnumber the other datasets resulting in a biased climate type to alleviate any possible clustering we considered a second approach by combining temperature and precipitation data from the seven gridded products creating a unique set of temperature and precipitation which is then used to construct the master kg map the two master maps show more robust spatial patterns than the individual ones and the similarity between them is 95 also specific climate subtypes that were not found in some individual maps e g in some reanalysis maps are observed in the two master maps we also used the first master map to benchmark which one of the individual maps is the most reliable judging only by similarity the era5 and merra2 performed equally well yet since there are climate subtypes missing and the wfdei shows similar performance we deem the latter is a better choice finally we note that both master maps are equally good by including the uncertainty from different data sources of information as a future direction it is worth exploring different climate classifications and their variation in different products and the potential effects of downscaling methods for finer spatial resolution maps also we acknowledge that the true variability of the climate subtypes in each grid might be even larger than the one we present to improve the representation of this variability a promising option could be to use large ensemble probabilistic datasets e g tang et al 2021 that could help quantify more thoroughly the uncertainty although this research could be further expanded we believe it reveals the large uncertainty in climate classification and offers a robust kg map that might help researchers to better evaluate future climate shifts credit authorship contribution statement salma

3108,the growing interest in shallow geothermal resources is compromising geothermal energy availability and groundwater quality in urban areas this makes it necessary to search for new methodologies that facilitate urban geothermal resources management in this work a novel methodology based on polar coordinates to assess the geothermal impacts caused by shallow geothermal installations on urban aquifers is proposed and applied to a real case study this methodology facilitated the definition of three key parameters tmax tmin and anti annual net thermal impact for geothermal impact assessment and allowed classification of geothermal impacts on urban aquifers into five patterns seasonally balanced cooling heating dominated impact single cooling heating impact unrecovered cooling heating impact and upward downward linear impact it was possible to establish the most frequent impact patterns in temperate to hot climates where the use of the geothermal installations for cooling dominates by applying this methodology to the zaragoza city aquifer spain the holistic view of the urban aquifer showed an average delay of four to five months between the production peak of the geothermal installations and the peak of the triggered thermal impact on the aquifer the results showed that the increasing use of shallow geothermal energy is leading to an increase in temperature of aquifers which in the case of the zaragoza aquifer was quantified at 0 20 c yr in the past five years these results demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology to assess thermal impacts on urban aquifers and facilitate thermal management in cities keywords geothermal energy heat pump low enthalpy groundwater water resources renewable energy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac of buildings consume nearly half the eu s energy 546 mtoe in 2012 which makes developing an ambitious strategy for the efficiency and sustainability of heating and cooling systems essential in order to reach the goals set in the climate agreement cop21 2015 united nations climate change conference european commission 2016 currently 75 of the energy used for heating and cooling systems in buildings comes from fossil fuels making it necessary to accelerate the transition to cleaner and renewable energies to achieve the objectives set at cop21 it is here where shallow or low enthalpy geothermal energy emerges as one of the best options to definitively reduce the great dependence of cities on fossil fuels since this renewable energy is accessible to the vast majority of cities in the world boon et al 2019 hou et al 2018 lund 2003 lund and toth 2021 santamarta et al 2021 stegnar et al 2019 tissen et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 geothermal heat pumps use the shallow subsurface as a heat source sink for cooling and heating systems this technology relies on the fact that at approximately 15 m depth the earth has a relatively constant temperature warmer than the air in winter and cooler in summer thus configuring a shallow geothermal reservoir geothermal heat pumps are classified into two groups depending on the type of geothermal heat exchanger used to exploit the reservoir closed loop systems ground coupled heat pumps gchp and open loop system ground water heat pumps gwhp in gchp systems the heat carrier fluid used is not exchanged between the geothermal heat exchanger and the shallow geothermal reservoir while gwhp systems use groundwater directly as heat carrier fluid edenhofer et al 2012 lund 2003 the commitment to improve the energy efficiency of buildings and reduce co2 emissions is increasingly promoting the use of gwhp systems this is because gwhp systems are less expensive and more efficient than gchp systems due to the relative higher thermal conductivity of water than the antifreeze used in gchp systems however despite the fact that urban aquifers can be considered as massive energy reservoirs the intensive use of geothermal energy is leading to thermal overexploitation of urban aquifers bayer et al 2019 benz et al 2015 previati et al 2022 rivera et al 2017 visser et al 2020 zhu et al 2010 thermal interference between systems might comprise technical sustainability of the gwhp systems especially in urban environments where shallow geothermal systems are affected by and contribute to subsurface urban heat island suhi effects garcía gil et al 2020b 2019 menberg et al 2013 zhu et al 2010 therefore geothermal energy availability and water quality degradation in urban areas are becoming a major concern for authorities forcing the need for development of new tools and criteria to enhance subsurface energy policies that allow planning of their spatial distribution and limit their operation regimes alcaraz et al 2016b attard et al 2020 garcía gil et al 2020a haehnlein et al 2010 hähnlein et al 2013 tsagarakis et al 2020 numerical models at city scale have successfully simulated the propagation of heat plumes and thermal interference in urban environments which makes them a powerful decision support tool for the management of shallow geothermal resources abesser et al 2021 boon et al 2019 casasso and sethi 2015 epting et al 2017 garcía gil et al 2020b 2019 2014 muela maya et al 2018 mueller et al 2018 pophillat et al 2020 numerical modelling has demonstrated that shallow geothermal energy intensive exploitation has thermal impacts on urban aquifers with long response times even on the scale of years to decades epting et al 2017 garcía gil et al 2014 in addition to numerical models other criteria such as present thermal state versus potential natural state considering the memory effect of aquifers or the definition of a relaxation factor have contributed to this field epting et al 2017 2013 garcía gil et al 2015 however these approaches require either complex analytical solutions that are difficult to apply or advanced numerical models which in turn need greater computational power and dense monitoring networks for their calibration and validation which is not always available herrera et al 2022b herrera et al 2022a decisionmakers should have tools to perform a risk assessment of potential thermal interference affecting the sustainability of managed installations without the need to develop advanced numerical models of flow and heat transfer this is often difficult for managers due to the high degree of specialization required and its high computational cost decisionmakers should also have a scientifically based criteria to identify the times of the year in which the aquifer is most threatened in order to intensify surveillance actuations and minimize impacts the polar coordinate system is a widely used two dimensional coordinate system in which points are given by an angle and a distance from a central point known as the pole equivalent to the origin in the cartesian coordinate system the polar coordinate system is used in many fields including mathematics physics engineering medicine navigation and robotics biswas et al 2019 chwa 2004 hosny and darwish 2019 yassir et al 2019 it is especially useful in situations where the relationship between two points is most easily expressed in terms of angle and distance such as sinusoidal functions in this work we evaluate the potential of using the polar coordinates to establish easy going indexes that can be universally used to get an overview of the thermal impact on urban aquifers and to facilitate decisionmaking this idea is underpinned by the following 1 geothermal facilities trigger sinusoidal thermal impacts with annual periodicity as a consequence of dual use winter summer heating cooling and 2 the 365 days in a year are easily and intuitively adaptable to the 360 2π rad of the polar coordinate system the novel application of polar coordinates to the field of shallow geothermal energy is expected to contribute to the quantification of thermal impact with respect to the reference temperature of the aquifer natural mean temperature identification and classification of the main geothermal impact patterns and facilitation of identifying the moments of the year in which the aquifer is more vulnerable this is a key factor because the times in which geothermal facilities work at higher power do not have to correspond to the most critical times for the aquifer due to the advection dispersion and thermal diffusion processes in the subsoil alcaraz et al 2016a molina giraldo et al 2011a pophillat et al 2020 to reach these objectives and apply the polar coordinates based methodology the alluvial aquifer of the city of zaragoza ne spain where annual groundwater temperature changes higher than 10 k occur was chosen as an example this aquifer has been extensively studied and modelled in the last years garcía gil et al 2020b 2020a 2019 2016 2015 moreno et al 2008 muela maya et al 2018 and compared with other european aquifers epting et al 2017 this previous knowledge allows to have a great understanding of the impact that each geothermal installation exerts on each piezometer furthermore this aquifer has a large monitoring network covering the entire urban area with continuous temperature and level records for more than 10 years garrido et al 2017 garrido et al 2003 the aim of this paper is to evaluate a novel methodology based on polar coordinates to assess the geothermal impacts caused by shallow geothermal installations on urban aquifers and to test its applicability in a real case study 2 material and methods 2 1 polar coordinates based methodology to characterize geothermal impacts on urban aquifers polar coordinates r p specify the location of a point p in the plane by its distance r from the origin and the angle θ made between the line segment from the origin to p and the positive x axis unlike the cartesian coordinates x y that specify the location of a point p in the x y plane as r ranges from 0 to infinity and θ ranges from 0 to 2π rad 360 the point p specified by the polar coordinates r θ covers every point in the plane the same point is obtained by adding 2π to θ so if θ is allowed to range over an interval larger than 2π each point would have multiple polar coordinates hence θ is typically restricted to be in the range 0 θ 2π however even with this restriction there is still some non uniqueness of polar coordinates which occurs when r 0 and then the point p is at the origin independent of the value of θ the two polar coordinates r and θ can be converted to cartesian coordinates x and y by 1 x r cos θ 2 y r sin θ from the above two formulas r and θ can be defined in terms of and y 3 r x 2 y 2 4 θ arctan y x eq 4 has to be interpreted as the two argument inverse tangent which takes the signs of and y into account to determine in which quadrant θ lies it follows immediately that polar coordinates aren t inherently unique in particular r θ n2π will be exactly the same polar point as r θ for any integer n in addition it often allows negative values of r under the assumption that r θ is plotted identically to r θ π all these outstanding features make the polar coordinates a powerful tool to assess and quantify sinusoidal functions such as geothermal impacts on urban aquifers geothermal installations usually have a dual function over a year contributing to heating in winter and cooling in summer which triggers a seasonal sinusoidal oscillation of the temperature in aquifers as these sinusoidal time series represent the evolution of the temperature over the year and this is repeated every 365 days it can take advantage of the property of the polar coordinates that makes them not inherently unique as r θ n2π will be exactly the same polar point as r θ for any integer n to assess all years at the same time and in the same graph in addition the 365 days in one year which is very similar to the 360 of which the polar coordinate system is composed also facilitates visualization of time series with annual periodicity however beyond the raw temperature data generally collected by data loggers what is more interesting from a geothermal resource management point of view is the impact on the aquifer this can be calculated directly by subtracting the natural mean temperature of the aquifer it usually equals the local mean atmospheric temperature from the measured temperature data in this way the impact on the aquifer positive or negative caused by the geothermal installations can be quantified by plotting these thermal impact time series into a polar coordinate system a continuous representation of the thermal impact over the whole period of time considered always in cycles of one year is obtained fig 1 thus the basic principles of polar coordinates and sinusoidal functions can be applied to contribute to their interpretation every time the line representing the time series of thermal impacts passes through the origin it will inform that there is a sign change in the thermal impact going from a positive to a negative thermal anomaly or vice versa polar coordinates also allow evaluation of thermal impacts with respect to the mean temperature of the aquifer for both operations cooling and heating or in an absolute way taking advantage of the property that r θ is plotted identically to r θ π this facilitates identification and classification of thermal impact patterns as detailed below that can contribute to predicting the behavior of the aquifer in addition based on the polar coordinates approach we have defined three key parameters to globally assess and quantify the impacts of geothermal installations on urban aquifers and facilitate their sustainable management these three key parameters are fig 1 1 annual maximum temperature tmax 2 annual minimum temperature tmin and 3 annual net thermal impact anti index the maximum and minimum temperatures reached over the year are key in identifying the times in which the aquifer is more stressed over the year it is possible that more than one maximum or minimum is identified for the same year in complex installations the anti index is computed as the annual centre of mass with respect to the mean natural temperature of the aquifer and represents the net thermal impact on the aquifer after a complete heating cooling cycle it is a measure of the state of the aquifer for a specific year it can also be calculated for several years these indices allow us to observe an overview of the general state of the aquifer compare it with other urban aquifers carry out an annual assessment of the thermal impact on the aquifer and predict future evolution based on trends and patterns 2 2 site description this study investigates a shallow alluvial aquifer located in the central sector of the ebro basin ne spain beneath the city of zaragoza this aquifer is composed of a variable in thickness unit of early pleistocene fluvial alluvial and aeolian sediments deposited on top of an evaporite miocene basement due to the tectonic and karst processes affecting the basin soriano et al 2019 the thickness of the alluvial aquifer presents considerable spatial variability ranging between 5 and 60 m the water table depth ranges between 1 and 34 m below ground surface being minimal in proximity to the ebro river in addition the mean natural temperature of groundwater is 17 c slightly above the mean annual air temperature of 16 25 c as described in other parts of the world pouloupatis et al 2011 as illustrated in fig 2 there is one generalized groundwater flow pattern towards the ebro river one heading in a sw ne flow direction on the right and another with a nw se flow direction on the left margin according to this flow regime the ebro river acts as the dominating drainage system of the aquifer in addition to this general flow pattern secondary groundwater flow patterns are superimposed showing changing flow direction to some few degrees controlled by the transmissivity field found in the aquifer responding to both changes in saturated thickness and hydraulic permeability the groundwater extraction from the urban aquifer was estimated to be approximately 2 4 106 m3 per year of which 69 was not consumptive and related to geothermal exploitation by means of gwhps garrido et al 2012 garrido et al 2010 in the city of zaragoza a total of 105 geothermal wells reaching depths ranging from 20 to 60 m below ground surface have been catalogued 71 of them for injection purposes fig 2 the 71 gwhp systems identified in zaragoza present an installed cooling capacity of 110 mwt with 21 installations equipped with reverse cycle heat pumps conferring them a total heating capacity of 34 mwt garrido et al 2012 garrido et al 2010 using spectral and cluster analysis three exploitation regimes that can be attributed to a dominant use for heating i cooling ii or dual iii have recently been identified and used as reference for quantifying geothermal impact delays in the aquifer garcía gil et al 2020a fig 3 the geothermal monitoring network is composed of 43 monitoring points including 17 piezometers fully penetrating in the aquifer specifically constructed by the geological survey of spain in collaboration with the local authority ebro hydrographic confederation che of these piezometers 24 have installed data loggers with a temperature record that is long enough in time between 3 and 11 years to carry out this study si 1 the construction of these 24 piezometers was conducted in different steps the last eight piezometers being incorporated in 2017 fig 2 the groundwater and thermal regimes in the alluvial aquifer of zaragoza have been monitored from a geothermal monitoring network since 2009 and reproduced by means of numerical modelling of groundwater flow and heat transport garcía gil et al 2015 2014 fig 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 geothermal impact classification based on polar coordinates the proposed methodology for assessment of geothermal impacts on urban aquifers based on polar coordinates allowed us to define five patterns and nine sub patterns of geothermal impacts fig 4 i seasonally balanced sb impact ii cooling or heating dominated cd or hd impact iii single cooling or heating sc or sh impact iv unrecovered cooling or heating uc or uh impact and v upward or downward linear ul or dl impact these impact patterns and sub patterns were defined based on their seasonal balance and trend the sb impact is characterized by a fully compensated thermal balance over year which means that cooling discharge into the aquifer disturbs the natural temperature of the aquifer by the same quantity as heating fig 4a this type of impact can be considered the most sustainable and by this motive the anti indicates a null impact over a year however depending on the amplitude of the temperature oscillation unsustainable maximums and minimums can be reached in addition as fully symmetric operation of geothermal installations is rarely reached this type of pattern may also indicate the contribution of natural processes riverbank filtration or the seasonal thermal signal propagated from the surface can trigger thermal impacts represented by the sb pattern duque et al 2010 garcía gil et al 2014 molina giraldo et al 2011b the cd and hd impacts imply that there is a net thermal impact on the aquifer caused by a more intensive use of cooling cd or heating hd over the other fig 4b in this case the average impacted temperature of the aquifer is above cd or below hd of the mean natural temperature the risk of this impact depends on the amplitude of the seasonal oscillation and the displacement of the anti with respect to the mean natural temperature the sc and sh impacts are produced when the temperature of the aquifer is altered by a geothermal installation that only operates for cooling or heating respectively fig 4c in this case for an equal amplitude of oscillation as for the cd and hd impacts the anti goes farther from the origin of the polar coordinates the mean natural temperature is only reached punctually at the minimums sc or maximums sh once again amplitude of the perturbation together with the displacement of the anti with respect to the mean natural temperature are key in assessing its risk the uc and uh impacts unlike the three previous impacts are the first in which the mean natural temperature of the aquifer is never reached and therefore there is an anthropogenic thermal impact throughout the year fig 4d they are produced by an intensive non symmetric operation of the geothermal installation i e when an intensive use of the geothermal installation is carried out for cooling uc or heating uh and then an unrecovered rise or fall respectively in temperature is produced throughout the year the aquifer then does not have enough time to recover the natural temperature this type of impact has the greatest potential risk since although the displacement of the anti with respect to the origin of the polar coordinates null impact will mark its real risk it is possible to reach values very far from the mean natural temperature this type of pattern can also occur with moderate use not intensive but very prolonged in time as happens in hot or cold climates with little thermal variation throughout the year likewise an overlap of several thermal plumes can generate this type of pattern finally the ul and dl impacts represent a continuous linear rise or fall in temperature respectively fig 4e it is easily recognizable when the assessment is carried out using polar coordinates since the time series draws a spiral the antis also show a continuous increase or decrease over time with respect to the mean natural temperature this kind of impact can potentially strongly modify the mean natural temperature of the aquifer because from the first moment the impact on the temperature is not recoverable throughout the year and above it it increases ul and dl impacts are usually associated with long distance thermal front of heat plumes where thermal oscillation is damped garcía gil et al 2020b 2019 the addition of this pattern to one of the previous patterns may indicate the existence of a multiple impact caused by more than one geothermal installation an increase or decrease over time in the operating power of the installation can also generate this pattern this classification allows identification of the most typical patterns and sub patterns regulating the thermal impacts on urban aquifers however any combination between them is also possible especially in intensively exploited aquifers as shown below for the zaragoza city aquifer in addition observation wells can evolve through different impact patterns over time 3 2 thermal impact assessment of the zaragoza city aquifer applying a polar coordinates approach 3 2 1 identification of geothermal impact patterns the results of applying the polar coordinates based methodology for geothermal impact assessment to the geothermal monitoring network of the zaragoza city aquifer are shown in fig 5 for three selected piezometers gs 1 gs 3 and gs 8 together with their original temperature time series si 1 and in fig 6 for the rest of piezometers in addition table 1 provides a summary of the geothermal impact patterns identified in each piezometer the results obtained for the 24 piezometers studied showed a great diversity of geothermal impact patterns allowing the identification of each and every one of those defined in the previous section as well as a convergence of several of them at various observation points this is foreseeable as it is a city scale study with observation points located with relative randomness and affected by a large number of geothermal facilities whose impacts are frequently added together the sb impact pattern was rarely identified in the aquifer of zaragoza city only the piezometer gs 50 seemed to be represented close to sb impact the piezometer gs 3 was also represented by an sb impact pattern but in this case the seasonal oscillation of 5 c of amplitude 10 c for the total thermal oscillation was produced by riverbank filtration from the ebro river located 40 m away in the perpendicular direction see location in fig 2 the dominance of shallow geothermal energy for cooling versus heating in temperate to hot climates makes this type of pattern rare in the aquifer of zaragoza city this fact makes the cd impact more frequent than the sb impact being recognizable in piezometers gs 7 gs 8 since year 2016 gs 72 and gs 73 the hd pattern was only recognised during short time periods in piezometers gs 7 and gs 69 explained by the scarce use of geothermal energy for heating in this city piezometer gs 55 located close to geothermal installations operating only for cooling fig 2 was characterized by an sc impact with thermal oscillations of more than 7 c by contrast piezometer gs 60 showed an sh impact because of its proximity to a heating geothermal installation fig 2 however the most frequent and characterizing impact pattern in zaragoza city was the uc impact this pattern characterized the thermal oscillations of piezometers gs 1 gs 4 gs 5 gs 6 gs 48 gs 49 gs 51 gs 54 gs 63 gs 64 gs 67 gs 68 and gs 70 with thermal impacts with respect to the mean natural temperature greater than 4 c for gs 1 gs 4 gs 5 gs 6 gs 48 gs 54 and gs 63 and lower than 4 c for the remainder all of them were located inside the main geothermal plumes of zaragoza city fig 2 no piezometer showed a geothermal impact pattern represented by the uh pattern as is expected by the dominant cooling use finally the ul impact was identified in piezometers gs 2 and gs 9 by itself but it also contributed at some point to most of the previous piezometers see fig 6 and table 1 ul impacts usually were related to long distance thermal impact from the geothermal system more than 1 5 km in the case of gs 9 piezometer or a lateral impact due to transverse heat dispersion of a heat plume gs 2 see fig 2 ul impact below 2 c and with long term trends could be also interpreted as suhi effect luo and asproudi 2015 menberg et al 2013 previati et al 2022 where anthropic heat sources from the city affect the subsurface thermal regime piezometer gs 1 evolved from a close to sc impact pattern to a uc pattern as a consequence of the contribution of a ul impact in many cases adding the effect of several thermal plumes over time as happens in this case the piezometer experiences the slow pass through of the thermal front of a heat plume coming from a 230 m distance gwhp system also piezometers gs 4 gs 5 gs 6 and gs 51 showed a linear increase ul in temperature but in these cases all of them always belonged to a uc impact piezometer gs 48 suffered a dl impact although it always stayed as a uc impact in this case this is related to the ceasing of one gwhp system of a mall with a centre 350 m away from the piezometer a similar evolution followed piezometer gs 6 but in this case a ul impact was added at the beginning of the time series the geothermal exploitation by which this piezometer is affected initially operated with high temperatures and low flows evolving to high flows and low temperatures to reduce the impact piezometer gs 8 also suffered a slight reduction in its operation evolving from an sc impact pattern to a cd pattern through a linear decrease dl over time the application of this nomenclature allows us to understand the impact of different processes on the thermal regime of the zaragoza city although the thermal regime in the urban aquifer of zaragoza has been thoroughly investigated in other urban environments the application of this methodology would provide general information of the thermal regime of the aquifer it can indicate in general terms the influence of large distance interaction of thermal plumes cease of installations changes in exploitation patterns of the gwhp systems and give a holistic view of the aquifer thermal trends thus serving as useful indicators for the management of shallow geothermal resources 3 2 2 mismatch between the seasonality of geothermal installations and the impact on the aquifer in order to get the correct overview of the thermal impact produced on an urban aquifer as a consequence of geothermal exploitation it is key to assess the times of maximum stress tmax and tmin for the aquifer and second to quantify it in the aquifer of zaragoza city there is a delay of almost four months from august 1st until november 22nd between the time in which the hottest water coming from the geothermal installations is discharged into the aquifer cooling production peak and the time in which the annual peak in the temperature of the aquifer of zaragoza city is reached fig 7 a there is a delay of almost five months from january 1st until may 26th from the time in which the coldest water is discharged into the aquifer and the moment in which the minimum annual temperature is reached in the aquifer fig 7b therefore there is a slight asymmetry in the sinusoidal oscillation of the temperature throughout the year associated with the operation regime of the geothermal installations fig 7 these values vary from one point of the aquifer to another depending on the proximity to which the geothermal installation responsible for the impact is located its operating regime and power and even the thermal and hydraulic characteristics of the aquifer however these data are very valuable from a management view of hydraulic and ecosystem resources they provide resource managers with a holistic view at city scale of the critical times where maximum and minimum temperatures will be reached these times are critical for defining good status of groundwater body due to the direct relationship between the temperature of the water and its hydrochemical composition as other studies have demonstrated bonte et al 2013b 2013a garcía gil et al 2018 2016 garrido schneider et al 2016 this becomes even more important when it comes to urban aquifers that supply the city with water janža 2017 with respect to the magnitude of the impact the average maximum overheating suffered by the aquifer in november as a consequence of the cooling operation of the geothermal installations in summer is 4 22 c see red cross in fig 7a this impact is reduced to 2 41 c in may when the aquifer gets the effect of the heating operation of the geothermal installations carried out during winter or a stop in production of the geothermal installations that only work for cooling see red cross in fig 7b finally the average impact produced in the aquifer during the last decade as a consequence of geothermal exploitation was quantified at 3 26 c see red cross in fig 7c 3 2 3 thermal impact trend in cities with increasing use of geothermal energy although the average thermal impact on an aquifer for the last decade or any other long period of time can be useful as a big picture it is the annual evolution of this index that really provides information about the trend of the impact on the aquifer in the end a relevant indicator for decisionmaking is knowing the trend of the aquifer thermal regime i e to see an improvement if remediation measures have been taken the thermal regime is in equilibrium or worsening over time the annual evolution of thermal impact on the aquifer of zaragoza city showed a complex evolution in which a stability behaviour until 2016 led to a continuous increase in impact from 2017 to the present fig 8 until 2016 the anti was around 3 50 3 75 c however since the year 2016 the anti increased year by year without exception until reaching an average annual impact of 4 46 c in 2020 when only the existing piezometers since the beginning of the period were considered for analysis 2011 2020 it resulted in an anti increase of 0 20 c per year on the aquifer since 2016 in the city of zaragoza during the financial crisis of 2007 the number of new gwhp systems in the city was stabilised thus explaining the stabilisation of anti indexes in the following decade it is around 2013 when new gwhp systems start operations showing their effects from 2017 to present days for calculation of the 4 46 c value the time series of the piezometers added in 2017 to the monitoring network were not considered to avoid bias however when the thermal impact was estimated for these new piezometers fig 8 a similar increasing trend as for the other piezometers was obtained this was important because it means that when a city scale assessment is performed even monitoring networks with a limited number of observation points and arbitrary distribution can provide reliable information about the general state of the aquifer and the trend of the average thermal impact these results have demonstrated the great potential of this methodology to assess thermal impacts in cities with massive data availability without the need for a great scientific background decisionmakers can accurately visualize analyse and quantify the current state of the aquifer and the seasonal pattern and temporal evolution of geothermal impacts which is essential to correctly apply preventive and corrective measures in addition this methodology has also been shown to be very useful for quantifying the thermal recovery of aquifers after applying corrective measures and evaluating their effectiveness 4 conclusions in this work a novel methodology based on polar coordinates to assess the geothermal impacts on urban aquifers caused by shallow geothermal installations was proposed and applied to a real case study the polar coordinates approach facilitated the definition and assessment of three key parameters for geothermal impact assessment annual maximum and minimum temperatures tmax and tmin and annual net thermal impact anti in addition this methodology allowed us to classify the geothermal impacts into five patterns and nine sub patterns depending on their seasonal balance and trend seasonally balanced sd cooling or heating dominated cd or hd single cooling or heating sc or sh unrecovered cooling or heating uc or uh and upward or downward linear ul or dl impacts by applying this methodology to the aquifer of zaragoza city it was possible to establish uc ul and cd as the most frequent impact sub patterns in this temperate climate aquifer where the use of geothermal heat pump installations for cooling dominates the big picture of the urban aquifer showed an average delay of several months four to five months between the production peak of the geothermal installations and the peak of the triggered thermal impact on the aquifer the average tmax and tmin in the aquifer were reached in november and may respectively while the operation peaks for cooling and heating took place in july august and december january respectively results showed that the increase in use of shallow geothermal energy for air conditioning is leading to an increase in the temperature of urban aquifers in the case of the zaragoza aquifer this was quantified at 0 20 c per year in the past five years finally although large monitoring networks like that of the zaragoza city aquifer are always recommended the results of this work indicated that monitoring networks with a limited number of observation points and an arbitrary distribution can also provide useful information about the general state of the aquifer and the trend of thermal impact credit authorship contribution statement miguel ángel marazuela conceptualization methodology investigation writing original draft visualization formal analysis

3108,the growing interest in shallow geothermal resources is compromising geothermal energy availability and groundwater quality in urban areas this makes it necessary to search for new methodologies that facilitate urban geothermal resources management in this work a novel methodology based on polar coordinates to assess the geothermal impacts caused by shallow geothermal installations on urban aquifers is proposed and applied to a real case study this methodology facilitated the definition of three key parameters tmax tmin and anti annual net thermal impact for geothermal impact assessment and allowed classification of geothermal impacts on urban aquifers into five patterns seasonally balanced cooling heating dominated impact single cooling heating impact unrecovered cooling heating impact and upward downward linear impact it was possible to establish the most frequent impact patterns in temperate to hot climates where the use of the geothermal installations for cooling dominates by applying this methodology to the zaragoza city aquifer spain the holistic view of the urban aquifer showed an average delay of four to five months between the production peak of the geothermal installations and the peak of the triggered thermal impact on the aquifer the results showed that the increasing use of shallow geothermal energy is leading to an increase in temperature of aquifers which in the case of the zaragoza aquifer was quantified at 0 20 c yr in the past five years these results demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology to assess thermal impacts on urban aquifers and facilitate thermal management in cities keywords geothermal energy heat pump low enthalpy groundwater water resources renewable energy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac of buildings consume nearly half the eu s energy 546 mtoe in 2012 which makes developing an ambitious strategy for the efficiency and sustainability of heating and cooling systems essential in order to reach the goals set in the climate agreement cop21 2015 united nations climate change conference european commission 2016 currently 75 of the energy used for heating and cooling systems in buildings comes from fossil fuels making it necessary to accelerate the transition to cleaner and renewable energies to achieve the objectives set at cop21 it is here where shallow or low enthalpy geothermal energy emerges as one of the best options to definitively reduce the great dependence of cities on fossil fuels since this renewable energy is accessible to the vast majority of cities in the world boon et al 2019 hou et al 2018 lund 2003 lund and toth 2021 santamarta et al 2021 stegnar et al 2019 tissen et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 geothermal heat pumps use the shallow subsurface as a heat source sink for cooling and heating systems this technology relies on the fact that at approximately 15 m depth the earth has a relatively constant temperature warmer than the air in winter and cooler in summer thus configuring a shallow geothermal reservoir geothermal heat pumps are classified into two groups depending on the type of geothermal heat exchanger used to exploit the reservoir closed loop systems ground coupled heat pumps gchp and open loop system ground water heat pumps gwhp in gchp systems the heat carrier fluid used is not exchanged between the geothermal heat exchanger and the shallow geothermal reservoir while gwhp systems use groundwater directly as heat carrier fluid edenhofer et al 2012 lund 2003 the commitment to improve the energy efficiency of buildings and reduce co2 emissions is increasingly promoting the use of gwhp systems this is because gwhp systems are less expensive and more efficient than gchp systems due to the relative higher thermal conductivity of water than the antifreeze used in gchp systems however despite the fact that urban aquifers can be considered as massive energy reservoirs the intensive use of geothermal energy is leading to thermal overexploitation of urban aquifers bayer et al 2019 benz et al 2015 previati et al 2022 rivera et al 2017 visser et al 2020 zhu et al 2010 thermal interference between systems might comprise technical sustainability of the gwhp systems especially in urban environments where shallow geothermal systems are affected by and contribute to subsurface urban heat island suhi effects garcía gil et al 2020b 2019 menberg et al 2013 zhu et al 2010 therefore geothermal energy availability and water quality degradation in urban areas are becoming a major concern for authorities forcing the need for development of new tools and criteria to enhance subsurface energy policies that allow planning of their spatial distribution and limit their operation regimes alcaraz et al 2016b attard et al 2020 garcía gil et al 2020a haehnlein et al 2010 hähnlein et al 2013 tsagarakis et al 2020 numerical models at city scale have successfully simulated the propagation of heat plumes and thermal interference in urban environments which makes them a powerful decision support tool for the management of shallow geothermal resources abesser et al 2021 boon et al 2019 casasso and sethi 2015 epting et al 2017 garcía gil et al 2020b 2019 2014 muela maya et al 2018 mueller et al 2018 pophillat et al 2020 numerical modelling has demonstrated that shallow geothermal energy intensive exploitation has thermal impacts on urban aquifers with long response times even on the scale of years to decades epting et al 2017 garcía gil et al 2014 in addition to numerical models other criteria such as present thermal state versus potential natural state considering the memory effect of aquifers or the definition of a relaxation factor have contributed to this field epting et al 2017 2013 garcía gil et al 2015 however these approaches require either complex analytical solutions that are difficult to apply or advanced numerical models which in turn need greater computational power and dense monitoring networks for their calibration and validation which is not always available herrera et al 2022b herrera et al 2022a decisionmakers should have tools to perform a risk assessment of potential thermal interference affecting the sustainability of managed installations without the need to develop advanced numerical models of flow and heat transfer this is often difficult for managers due to the high degree of specialization required and its high computational cost decisionmakers should also have a scientifically based criteria to identify the times of the year in which the aquifer is most threatened in order to intensify surveillance actuations and minimize impacts the polar coordinate system is a widely used two dimensional coordinate system in which points are given by an angle and a distance from a central point known as the pole equivalent to the origin in the cartesian coordinate system the polar coordinate system is used in many fields including mathematics physics engineering medicine navigation and robotics biswas et al 2019 chwa 2004 hosny and darwish 2019 yassir et al 2019 it is especially useful in situations where the relationship between two points is most easily expressed in terms of angle and distance such as sinusoidal functions in this work we evaluate the potential of using the polar coordinates to establish easy going indexes that can be universally used to get an overview of the thermal impact on urban aquifers and to facilitate decisionmaking this idea is underpinned by the following 1 geothermal facilities trigger sinusoidal thermal impacts with annual periodicity as a consequence of dual use winter summer heating cooling and 2 the 365 days in a year are easily and intuitively adaptable to the 360 2π rad of the polar coordinate system the novel application of polar coordinates to the field of shallow geothermal energy is expected to contribute to the quantification of thermal impact with respect to the reference temperature of the aquifer natural mean temperature identification and classification of the main geothermal impact patterns and facilitation of identifying the moments of the year in which the aquifer is more vulnerable this is a key factor because the times in which geothermal facilities work at higher power do not have to correspond to the most critical times for the aquifer due to the advection dispersion and thermal diffusion processes in the subsoil alcaraz et al 2016a molina giraldo et al 2011a pophillat et al 2020 to reach these objectives and apply the polar coordinates based methodology the alluvial aquifer of the city of zaragoza ne spain where annual groundwater temperature changes higher than 10 k occur was chosen as an example this aquifer has been extensively studied and modelled in the last years garcía gil et al 2020b 2020a 2019 2016 2015 moreno et al 2008 muela maya et al 2018 and compared with other european aquifers epting et al 2017 this previous knowledge allows to have a great understanding of the impact that each geothermal installation exerts on each piezometer furthermore this aquifer has a large monitoring network covering the entire urban area with continuous temperature and level records for more than 10 years garrido et al 2017 garrido et al 2003 the aim of this paper is to evaluate a novel methodology based on polar coordinates to assess the geothermal impacts caused by shallow geothermal installations on urban aquifers and to test its applicability in a real case study 2 material and methods 2 1 polar coordinates based methodology to characterize geothermal impacts on urban aquifers polar coordinates r p specify the location of a point p in the plane by its distance r from the origin and the angle θ made between the line segment from the origin to p and the positive x axis unlike the cartesian coordinates x y that specify the location of a point p in the x y plane as r ranges from 0 to infinity and θ ranges from 0 to 2π rad 360 the point p specified by the polar coordinates r θ covers every point in the plane the same point is obtained by adding 2π to θ so if θ is allowed to range over an interval larger than 2π each point would have multiple polar coordinates hence θ is typically restricted to be in the range 0 θ 2π however even with this restriction there is still some non uniqueness of polar coordinates which occurs when r 0 and then the point p is at the origin independent of the value of θ the two polar coordinates r and θ can be converted to cartesian coordinates x and y by 1 x r cos θ 2 y r sin θ from the above two formulas r and θ can be defined in terms of and y 3 r x 2 y 2 4 θ arctan y x eq 4 has to be interpreted as the two argument inverse tangent which takes the signs of and y into account to determine in which quadrant θ lies it follows immediately that polar coordinates aren t inherently unique in particular r θ n2π will be exactly the same polar point as r θ for any integer n in addition it often allows negative values of r under the assumption that r θ is plotted identically to r θ π all these outstanding features make the polar coordinates a powerful tool to assess and quantify sinusoidal functions such as geothermal impacts on urban aquifers geothermal installations usually have a dual function over a year contributing to heating in winter and cooling in summer which triggers a seasonal sinusoidal oscillation of the temperature in aquifers as these sinusoidal time series represent the evolution of the temperature over the year and this is repeated every 365 days it can take advantage of the property of the polar coordinates that makes them not inherently unique as r θ n2π will be exactly the same polar point as r θ for any integer n to assess all years at the same time and in the same graph in addition the 365 days in one year which is very similar to the 360 of which the polar coordinate system is composed also facilitates visualization of time series with annual periodicity however beyond the raw temperature data generally collected by data loggers what is more interesting from a geothermal resource management point of view is the impact on the aquifer this can be calculated directly by subtracting the natural mean temperature of the aquifer it usually equals the local mean atmospheric temperature from the measured temperature data in this way the impact on the aquifer positive or negative caused by the geothermal installations can be quantified by plotting these thermal impact time series into a polar coordinate system a continuous representation of the thermal impact over the whole period of time considered always in cycles of one year is obtained fig 1 thus the basic principles of polar coordinates and sinusoidal functions can be applied to contribute to their interpretation every time the line representing the time series of thermal impacts passes through the origin it will inform that there is a sign change in the thermal impact going from a positive to a negative thermal anomaly or vice versa polar coordinates also allow evaluation of thermal impacts with respect to the mean temperature of the aquifer for both operations cooling and heating or in an absolute way taking advantage of the property that r θ is plotted identically to r θ π this facilitates identification and classification of thermal impact patterns as detailed below that can contribute to predicting the behavior of the aquifer in addition based on the polar coordinates approach we have defined three key parameters to globally assess and quantify the impacts of geothermal installations on urban aquifers and facilitate their sustainable management these three key parameters are fig 1 1 annual maximum temperature tmax 2 annual minimum temperature tmin and 3 annual net thermal impact anti index the maximum and minimum temperatures reached over the year are key in identifying the times in which the aquifer is more stressed over the year it is possible that more than one maximum or minimum is identified for the same year in complex installations the anti index is computed as the annual centre of mass with respect to the mean natural temperature of the aquifer and represents the net thermal impact on the aquifer after a complete heating cooling cycle it is a measure of the state of the aquifer for a specific year it can also be calculated for several years these indices allow us to observe an overview of the general state of the aquifer compare it with other urban aquifers carry out an annual assessment of the thermal impact on the aquifer and predict future evolution based on trends and patterns 2 2 site description this study investigates a shallow alluvial aquifer located in the central sector of the ebro basin ne spain beneath the city of zaragoza this aquifer is composed of a variable in thickness unit of early pleistocene fluvial alluvial and aeolian sediments deposited on top of an evaporite miocene basement due to the tectonic and karst processes affecting the basin soriano et al 2019 the thickness of the alluvial aquifer presents considerable spatial variability ranging between 5 and 60 m the water table depth ranges between 1 and 34 m below ground surface being minimal in proximity to the ebro river in addition the mean natural temperature of groundwater is 17 c slightly above the mean annual air temperature of 16 25 c as described in other parts of the world pouloupatis et al 2011 as illustrated in fig 2 there is one generalized groundwater flow pattern towards the ebro river one heading in a sw ne flow direction on the right and another with a nw se flow direction on the left margin according to this flow regime the ebro river acts as the dominating drainage system of the aquifer in addition to this general flow pattern secondary groundwater flow patterns are superimposed showing changing flow direction to some few degrees controlled by the transmissivity field found in the aquifer responding to both changes in saturated thickness and hydraulic permeability the groundwater extraction from the urban aquifer was estimated to be approximately 2 4 106 m3 per year of which 69 was not consumptive and related to geothermal exploitation by means of gwhps garrido et al 2012 garrido et al 2010 in the city of zaragoza a total of 105 geothermal wells reaching depths ranging from 20 to 60 m below ground surface have been catalogued 71 of them for injection purposes fig 2 the 71 gwhp systems identified in zaragoza present an installed cooling capacity of 110 mwt with 21 installations equipped with reverse cycle heat pumps conferring them a total heating capacity of 34 mwt garrido et al 2012 garrido et al 2010 using spectral and cluster analysis three exploitation regimes that can be attributed to a dominant use for heating i cooling ii or dual iii have recently been identified and used as reference for quantifying geothermal impact delays in the aquifer garcía gil et al 2020a fig 3 the geothermal monitoring network is composed of 43 monitoring points including 17 piezometers fully penetrating in the aquifer specifically constructed by the geological survey of spain in collaboration with the local authority ebro hydrographic confederation che of these piezometers 24 have installed data loggers with a temperature record that is long enough in time between 3 and 11 years to carry out this study si 1 the construction of these 24 piezometers was conducted in different steps the last eight piezometers being incorporated in 2017 fig 2 the groundwater and thermal regimes in the alluvial aquifer of zaragoza have been monitored from a geothermal monitoring network since 2009 and reproduced by means of numerical modelling of groundwater flow and heat transport garcía gil et al 2015 2014 fig 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 geothermal impact classification based on polar coordinates the proposed methodology for assessment of geothermal impacts on urban aquifers based on polar coordinates allowed us to define five patterns and nine sub patterns of geothermal impacts fig 4 i seasonally balanced sb impact ii cooling or heating dominated cd or hd impact iii single cooling or heating sc or sh impact iv unrecovered cooling or heating uc or uh impact and v upward or downward linear ul or dl impact these impact patterns and sub patterns were defined based on their seasonal balance and trend the sb impact is characterized by a fully compensated thermal balance over year which means that cooling discharge into the aquifer disturbs the natural temperature of the aquifer by the same quantity as heating fig 4a this type of impact can be considered the most sustainable and by this motive the anti indicates a null impact over a year however depending on the amplitude of the temperature oscillation unsustainable maximums and minimums can be reached in addition as fully symmetric operation of geothermal installations is rarely reached this type of pattern may also indicate the contribution of natural processes riverbank filtration or the seasonal thermal signal propagated from the surface can trigger thermal impacts represented by the sb pattern duque et al 2010 garcía gil et al 2014 molina giraldo et al 2011b the cd and hd impacts imply that there is a net thermal impact on the aquifer caused by a more intensive use of cooling cd or heating hd over the other fig 4b in this case the average impacted temperature of the aquifer is above cd or below hd of the mean natural temperature the risk of this impact depends on the amplitude of the seasonal oscillation and the displacement of the anti with respect to the mean natural temperature the sc and sh impacts are produced when the temperature of the aquifer is altered by a geothermal installation that only operates for cooling or heating respectively fig 4c in this case for an equal amplitude of oscillation as for the cd and hd impacts the anti goes farther from the origin of the polar coordinates the mean natural temperature is only reached punctually at the minimums sc or maximums sh once again amplitude of the perturbation together with the displacement of the anti with respect to the mean natural temperature are key in assessing its risk the uc and uh impacts unlike the three previous impacts are the first in which the mean natural temperature of the aquifer is never reached and therefore there is an anthropogenic thermal impact throughout the year fig 4d they are produced by an intensive non symmetric operation of the geothermal installation i e when an intensive use of the geothermal installation is carried out for cooling uc or heating uh and then an unrecovered rise or fall respectively in temperature is produced throughout the year the aquifer then does not have enough time to recover the natural temperature this type of impact has the greatest potential risk since although the displacement of the anti with respect to the origin of the polar coordinates null impact will mark its real risk it is possible to reach values very far from the mean natural temperature this type of pattern can also occur with moderate use not intensive but very prolonged in time as happens in hot or cold climates with little thermal variation throughout the year likewise an overlap of several thermal plumes can generate this type of pattern finally the ul and dl impacts represent a continuous linear rise or fall in temperature respectively fig 4e it is easily recognizable when the assessment is carried out using polar coordinates since the time series draws a spiral the antis also show a continuous increase or decrease over time with respect to the mean natural temperature this kind of impact can potentially strongly modify the mean natural temperature of the aquifer because from the first moment the impact on the temperature is not recoverable throughout the year and above it it increases ul and dl impacts are usually associated with long distance thermal front of heat plumes where thermal oscillation is damped garcía gil et al 2020b 2019 the addition of this pattern to one of the previous patterns may indicate the existence of a multiple impact caused by more than one geothermal installation an increase or decrease over time in the operating power of the installation can also generate this pattern this classification allows identification of the most typical patterns and sub patterns regulating the thermal impacts on urban aquifers however any combination between them is also possible especially in intensively exploited aquifers as shown below for the zaragoza city aquifer in addition observation wells can evolve through different impact patterns over time 3 2 thermal impact assessment of the zaragoza city aquifer applying a polar coordinates approach 3 2 1 identification of geothermal impact patterns the results of applying the polar coordinates based methodology for geothermal impact assessment to the geothermal monitoring network of the zaragoza city aquifer are shown in fig 5 for three selected piezometers gs 1 gs 3 and gs 8 together with their original temperature time series si 1 and in fig 6 for the rest of piezometers in addition table 1 provides a summary of the geothermal impact patterns identified in each piezometer the results obtained for the 24 piezometers studied showed a great diversity of geothermal impact patterns allowing the identification of each and every one of those defined in the previous section as well as a convergence of several of them at various observation points this is foreseeable as it is a city scale study with observation points located with relative randomness and affected by a large number of geothermal facilities whose impacts are frequently added together the sb impact pattern was rarely identified in the aquifer of zaragoza city only the piezometer gs 50 seemed to be represented close to sb impact the piezometer gs 3 was also represented by an sb impact pattern but in this case the seasonal oscillation of 5 c of amplitude 10 c for the total thermal oscillation was produced by riverbank filtration from the ebro river located 40 m away in the perpendicular direction see location in fig 2 the dominance of shallow geothermal energy for cooling versus heating in temperate to hot climates makes this type of pattern rare in the aquifer of zaragoza city this fact makes the cd impact more frequent than the sb impact being recognizable in piezometers gs 7 gs 8 since year 2016 gs 72 and gs 73 the hd pattern was only recognised during short time periods in piezometers gs 7 and gs 69 explained by the scarce use of geothermal energy for heating in this city piezometer gs 55 located close to geothermal installations operating only for cooling fig 2 was characterized by an sc impact with thermal oscillations of more than 7 c by contrast piezometer gs 60 showed an sh impact because of its proximity to a heating geothermal installation fig 2 however the most frequent and characterizing impact pattern in zaragoza city was the uc impact this pattern characterized the thermal oscillations of piezometers gs 1 gs 4 gs 5 gs 6 gs 48 gs 49 gs 51 gs 54 gs 63 gs 64 gs 67 gs 68 and gs 70 with thermal impacts with respect to the mean natural temperature greater than 4 c for gs 1 gs 4 gs 5 gs 6 gs 48 gs 54 and gs 63 and lower than 4 c for the remainder all of them were located inside the main geothermal plumes of zaragoza city fig 2 no piezometer showed a geothermal impact pattern represented by the uh pattern as is expected by the dominant cooling use finally the ul impact was identified in piezometers gs 2 and gs 9 by itself but it also contributed at some point to most of the previous piezometers see fig 6 and table 1 ul impacts usually were related to long distance thermal impact from the geothermal system more than 1 5 km in the case of gs 9 piezometer or a lateral impact due to transverse heat dispersion of a heat plume gs 2 see fig 2 ul impact below 2 c and with long term trends could be also interpreted as suhi effect luo and asproudi 2015 menberg et al 2013 previati et al 2022 where anthropic heat sources from the city affect the subsurface thermal regime piezometer gs 1 evolved from a close to sc impact pattern to a uc pattern as a consequence of the contribution of a ul impact in many cases adding the effect of several thermal plumes over time as happens in this case the piezometer experiences the slow pass through of the thermal front of a heat plume coming from a 230 m distance gwhp system also piezometers gs 4 gs 5 gs 6 and gs 51 showed a linear increase ul in temperature but in these cases all of them always belonged to a uc impact piezometer gs 48 suffered a dl impact although it always stayed as a uc impact in this case this is related to the ceasing of one gwhp system of a mall with a centre 350 m away from the piezometer a similar evolution followed piezometer gs 6 but in this case a ul impact was added at the beginning of the time series the geothermal exploitation by which this piezometer is affected initially operated with high temperatures and low flows evolving to high flows and low temperatures to reduce the impact piezometer gs 8 also suffered a slight reduction in its operation evolving from an sc impact pattern to a cd pattern through a linear decrease dl over time the application of this nomenclature allows us to understand the impact of different processes on the thermal regime of the zaragoza city although the thermal regime in the urban aquifer of zaragoza has been thoroughly investigated in other urban environments the application of this methodology would provide general information of the thermal regime of the aquifer it can indicate in general terms the influence of large distance interaction of thermal plumes cease of installations changes in exploitation patterns of the gwhp systems and give a holistic view of the aquifer thermal trends thus serving as useful indicators for the management of shallow geothermal resources 3 2 2 mismatch between the seasonality of geothermal installations and the impact on the aquifer in order to get the correct overview of the thermal impact produced on an urban aquifer as a consequence of geothermal exploitation it is key to assess the times of maximum stress tmax and tmin for the aquifer and second to quantify it in the aquifer of zaragoza city there is a delay of almost four months from august 1st until november 22nd between the time in which the hottest water coming from the geothermal installations is discharged into the aquifer cooling production peak and the time in which the annual peak in the temperature of the aquifer of zaragoza city is reached fig 7 a there is a delay of almost five months from january 1st until may 26th from the time in which the coldest water is discharged into the aquifer and the moment in which the minimum annual temperature is reached in the aquifer fig 7b therefore there is a slight asymmetry in the sinusoidal oscillation of the temperature throughout the year associated with the operation regime of the geothermal installations fig 7 these values vary from one point of the aquifer to another depending on the proximity to which the geothermal installation responsible for the impact is located its operating regime and power and even the thermal and hydraulic characteristics of the aquifer however these data are very valuable from a management view of hydraulic and ecosystem resources they provide resource managers with a holistic view at city scale of the critical times where maximum and minimum temperatures will be reached these times are critical for defining good status of groundwater body due to the direct relationship between the temperature of the water and its hydrochemical composition as other studies have demonstrated bonte et al 2013b 2013a garcía gil et al 2018 2016 garrido schneider et al 2016 this becomes even more important when it comes to urban aquifers that supply the city with water janža 2017 with respect to the magnitude of the impact the average maximum overheating suffered by the aquifer in november as a consequence of the cooling operation of the geothermal installations in summer is 4 22 c see red cross in fig 7a this impact is reduced to 2 41 c in may when the aquifer gets the effect of the heating operation of the geothermal installations carried out during winter or a stop in production of the geothermal installations that only work for cooling see red cross in fig 7b finally the average impact produced in the aquifer during the last decade as a consequence of geothermal exploitation was quantified at 3 26 c see red cross in fig 7c 3 2 3 thermal impact trend in cities with increasing use of geothermal energy although the average thermal impact on an aquifer for the last decade or any other long period of time can be useful as a big picture it is the annual evolution of this index that really provides information about the trend of the impact on the aquifer in the end a relevant indicator for decisionmaking is knowing the trend of the aquifer thermal regime i e to see an improvement if remediation measures have been taken the thermal regime is in equilibrium or worsening over time the annual evolution of thermal impact on the aquifer of zaragoza city showed a complex evolution in which a stability behaviour until 2016 led to a continuous increase in impact from 2017 to the present fig 8 until 2016 the anti was around 3 50 3 75 c however since the year 2016 the anti increased year by year without exception until reaching an average annual impact of 4 46 c in 2020 when only the existing piezometers since the beginning of the period were considered for analysis 2011 2020 it resulted in an anti increase of 0 20 c per year on the aquifer since 2016 in the city of zaragoza during the financial crisis of 2007 the number of new gwhp systems in the city was stabilised thus explaining the stabilisation of anti indexes in the following decade it is around 2013 when new gwhp systems start operations showing their effects from 2017 to present days for calculation of the 4 46 c value the time series of the piezometers added in 2017 to the monitoring network were not considered to avoid bias however when the thermal impact was estimated for these new piezometers fig 8 a similar increasing trend as for the other piezometers was obtained this was important because it means that when a city scale assessment is performed even monitoring networks with a limited number of observation points and arbitrary distribution can provide reliable information about the general state of the aquifer and the trend of the average thermal impact these results have demonstrated the great potential of this methodology to assess thermal impacts in cities with massive data availability without the need for a great scientific background decisionmakers can accurately visualize analyse and quantify the current state of the aquifer and the seasonal pattern and temporal evolution of geothermal impacts which is essential to correctly apply preventive and corrective measures in addition this methodology has also been shown to be very useful for quantifying the thermal recovery of aquifers after applying corrective measures and evaluating their effectiveness 4 conclusions in this work a novel methodology based on polar coordinates to assess the geothermal impacts on urban aquifers caused by shallow geothermal installations was proposed and applied to a real case study the polar coordinates approach facilitated the definition and assessment of three key parameters for geothermal impact assessment annual maximum and minimum temperatures tmax and tmin and annual net thermal impact anti in addition this methodology allowed us to classify the geothermal impacts into five patterns and nine sub patterns depending on their seasonal balance and trend seasonally balanced sd cooling or heating dominated cd or hd single cooling or heating sc or sh unrecovered cooling or heating uc or uh and upward or downward linear ul or dl impacts by applying this methodology to the aquifer of zaragoza city it was possible to establish uc ul and cd as the most frequent impact sub patterns in this temperate climate aquifer where the use of geothermal heat pump installations for cooling dominates the big picture of the urban aquifer showed an average delay of several months four to five months between the production peak of the geothermal installations and the peak of the triggered thermal impact on the aquifer the average tmax and tmin in the aquifer were reached in november and may respectively while the operation peaks for cooling and heating took place in july august and december january respectively results showed that the increase in use of shallow geothermal energy for air conditioning is leading to an increase in the temperature of urban aquifers in the case of the zaragoza aquifer this was quantified at 0 20 c per year in the past five years finally although large monitoring networks like that of the zaragoza city aquifer are always recommended the results of this work indicated that monitoring networks with a limited number of observation points and an arbitrary distribution can also provide useful information about the general state of the aquifer and the trend of thermal impact credit authorship contribution statement miguel ángel marazuela conceptualization methodology investigation writing original draft visualization formal analysis

3109,current global warming causes a change in atmospheric dynamics with consequent variations in the rainfall regimes understanding the relationship between global climate patterns global warming and rainfall regimes is crucial for the creation of future scenarios and for the relative modification of water management the aim of this study is to improve knowledge of the relationship between north atlantic oscillation nao east atlantic ea and western mediterranean oscillation wemo with the seasonal rainfalls in tuscany italy the study area occupies a strategic position since it lies in a transition zone between the wet area of northern europe and the dry area of the northern coast of africa this research based on a statistical correlation method and on linear models is designed to understand the relationship between seasonal rainfalls and climate patterns the results of this study demonstrate that the use of linear models can yield more information than traditional statistical correlations the results show a decrease in rainfall in the warm period of the year namely in the summer when its expression is most visible this phenomenon is ascribable to current global warming which causes an increase in sea surface temperatures an increase in the northern atlantic sea surface temperature and in the mediterranean sea surface temperature causes a reduction of the iceland low with an extension of the azores high moreover an increase in the genoa gulf sst induces a weakening of the genoa gulf low one of the main cyclogenetic systems of the mediterranean keywords climatic patterns current global warming east atlantic north atlantic oscillation western mediterranean oscillation rainfall trend tuscany 1 introduction current global warming causes effects at different scale levels including changes in the hydrological cycle allan 2011 bates et al 2008 the effects are visible in air temperature trends and more generally in rainfall in the form of frequency and intensity of extreme events and changes in soil moisture blöschl et al 2019 stagl et al 2014 xu et al 2011 with wide implications in terms of socio economic conditions and financial policy european environment agency 2019 the mediterranean region is an ideal research testbed for current climatic changes both for its location for its historico cultural importance and for having been considered a hot spot for future climatic changes giorgi 2006 the mediterranean located between the european humid domain and the north african arid belt provides alternating circulation regimes with large spatial and temporal variability dünkeloh and jacobeit 2003 in this context a correct characterization of rainfall regimes can improve the management of water resources tramblay et al 2020 and of extreme events cardoso pereira et al 2020 myhre et al 2019 several studies have identified a general decrease although with some exceptions in the annual rainfall amount in the area of the mediterranean basin bertola et al 2019 blöschl et al 2019 caloiero et al 2018 2011 colantoni et al 2015 deitch et al 2017 dünkeloh and jacobeit 2003 halifa marín et al 2021 longobardi and villani 2010 martin vide and lopez bustins 2006 philandras et al 2011 ríos cornejo et al 2015 and atmospheric patterns related to mesoscale circulation brandimarte et al 2011 caloiero et al 2011 halifa marín et al 2021 lopez bustins et al 2008 luppichini et al 2021 martinez artigas et al 2021 ríos cornejo et al 2015 trigo et al 2004 during the winter months one of the main drivers of rainfall variability in southern europe and in the mediterranean is the presence of different pressure fields over the northern atlantic ocean and their variability indicated as the north atlantic oscillation nao hurrell 1995 nao is defined by an index measured as a north southern dipole of pressure anomalies with one pole located at higher latitudes iceland low 80 n and the other at the central latitudes of the north atlantic between 35 n and 40 n azores high the east atlantic ea index is similar to that of nao but is displaced south eastward to the approximate nodal lines of the nao pattern the ea index is often interpreted as a downward shifted nao model but its strong subtropical link entails a different peculiarity the ea value is positive when a significant drop in pressure occurs in the atlantic ocean at the same time the subtropical oceanic anticyclone belt considerably rises in latitude and strengthens in response the african anticyclone gains energy and invasiveness over the mediterranean subjecting this area to frequent pulses of hot and dry saharan air in all seasons climate prediction center 2021 mellado cano et al 2019 the nao and ea indexes present interannual and annual variabilities with positive and negative phases the rainfall in the mediterranean can be associated with a negative phase of nao and or ea when we observe an expansion of the iceland low instead during a positive phase of nao and or ea northern europe is the rainiest area rousi et al 2020 both nao and ea are influenced by the sea surface temperature sst of the northern atlantic ocean nasst and of the mediterranean msst an increase in nasst and in msst is correlated to an expansion of the azores high and to a consecutive reduction of the iceland low which cause a formation of the nao and ea positive phases frankignoul et al 2003 robertson et al 2000 visbeck et al 2001 more recently nao has been correlated to the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo a representative index of the nasst trend knight et al 2005 amo changes the zonal position of the nao centre of action moving the cyclonic area closer to europe or to north america during a positive phase of amo the icelandic low moves further towards north america while the azores high moves further towards europe and vice versa for the negative phase of amo börgel et al 2020 the statistical correlation between the nao and the winter rainfalls in europe varies over time vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2008 and it is a function of nao and amo with a different role of the indices from northern europe to the mediterranean luppichini et al 2021 the western mediterranean oscillation wemo is an index often used to study variability in rainfall in alternative to nao in the mediterranean region the wemo index is the difference of atmospheric pressure in a dipole with the first pole located in padua 45 40 n 11 48 e in northern italy and the second one located in san fernando cádiz 36 28 n 6 12 w in southwestern spain climatic research unit 2021 specifically the former is located in the po plain an area with relatively high barometric variability due to the different influence of the central european anticyclone and of the genoa gulf low while the latter pole is located in the gulf of cádiz in the southwest of the iberian peninsula often subject to the influence of the azores anticyclone and episodically to the cut off of circumpolar lows or to its own cyclogenesis halifa marín et al 2021 lopez bustins et al 2020 martin vide and lopez bustins 2006 a positive phase of wemo is associated with a low pressure area in the ligurian sea and with an anticyclone in the gulf of cadiz instead a negative phase of the index determines a low in the gulf of cadiz and an anticyclone in central europe wemo is influenced by nasst and msst but also by the genoa gulf sea surface temperature ggsst with positive values correlating to low values of sst martín et al 2012 martin vide and lopez bustins 2006 current global warming causes a progressive increase in nasst msst and ggsst pastor et al 2020 wang and dong 2010 so that nao and ea are likely to be characterized by more positive phases and wemo by more negative phases the purpose of this study is to understand the rainfall seasonal trends of the last 70 years in tuscany central italy in relation to mesoscale circulation and to the indices defined above the rainfall dataset employed derives from several raingauges with high spatial density and temporal activity which allow us to investigate the rainfall trend in great detail and with direct measurements the rainfall trends are compared with the nao ea and wemo indices by means of mathematical and statistical methods so as to understand the climatic trends influencing the rainfall regime in the area we investigated the link between the different indices by using traditional statistical methods spearman 1904 many land dynamics e g drought floods solid transport coastal erosion are linked to the rainfall regime which can create management criticalities e g billi and fazzini 2017 bini et al 2021 piccarreta et al 2004 the study of variations in the amount of rainfall related to climatic indices allows to lay the foundations for future studies and land management the observations put forward in this work and the methods adopted could be extended to other mediterranean areas by increasing knowledge about these issues 2 methods 2 1 study area tuscany has a strategic location because it is located in the northern sector of the mediterranean in the proximity of the genoa gulf by far the most active cyclogenetic centre of the mediterranean trigo et al 2002 as expected the mean annual precipitation map in tuscany is influenced by morphology fig 1 a the rainiest areas are located at the highest altitudes apuan alps and northern apennines fig 1b in particular the apuan alps in north western tuscany show some of the highest rainfall amounts in italy giannecchini and d amato avanzi 2012 rapetti and vittorini 1994 often characterized by high intensity d amato avanzi et al 2004 giannecchini 2006 in tuscany map is in a range of 400 3000 mm year with a clear gradient from the northern to the southern and it is linked to the morphology fig 1a the main rainy season is autumn with a progressive decrease that generally starts in december the mean rainfall in the djf season is ca 300 mm ca 250 mm in mam ca 130 mm in jja and ca 350 mm in son 2 2 dataset 2 2 1 rainfall dataset and processing the raingauge dataset was provided by the tuscany region hydrologic service sir network and includes 1103 raingauges fig 1c the daily data were obtained by an automated download procedure through an http request in march 2021 the dataset is the best one available in this area and it is managed by the sir which validates and checks the data the dataset is used in several research works because it is referenced and managed by a public body in particular luppichini et al 2021 used this dataset to understand the relationship between nao and winter rainfall in this area the activity period of each raingauge is variable the older stations have been monitoring since the beginning of the last century even if a temporal continuity of the data is not always guaranteed for some stations sir provides the daily rainfall data for each raingauge in the operation period to obtain longer and more complete time series from this dataset we grouped the stations according to a stringent protocol this procedure is necessary to reconstruct the time series of the stations that have experienced minor changes in position or that have undergone an administrative variation e g a slight change in name or identification code the stations have consecutive intermittent activity times due to the decommissioning of one and the subsequent installation of a new one in these cases we merged the stations by assigning the same or part of the same name with a difference in altimetry less than 20 of the measurement and a maximum distance less than 2 km the geographic coordinates of the merged stations derived from a cartesian mean of the original coordinates of the origin stations by using the data available and following the procedure described above a total of 117 time series were obtained from 1950 to 2020 the rainfall data can also be useful for comparison with the results of the linear models which predict rainfall anomalies the rainfall values are expressed as percentage anomalies of rainfall par and are calculated as follows 1 pa r s i x s i x i x i 100 where x s i is the annual seasonal rainfall amount of the i th year and s th season x l is the annual rainfall amount mean of the period 1961 1990 the values of par are calculated for the four seasons winter djf december january and february spring mam march april and may summer jja june july and august autumn son september october and november mean average par mapar is a ten year mobile average of par calculated for each season and the values are associated with the central year we chose to use a ten year mobile average because this time range is within the standard 10 30 year time scale considered to be decadal variability meehl et al 2009 2 2 2 climatic dataset the nao dataset is provided by the climate analysis section of the us national center for atmospheric research ncar this dataset is based on the principal pc based index component of the nao which are the time series of the leading empirical orthogonal function eof of slp anomalies over the atlantic sector 20 80 n 90 w 40 e this index is used to measure the yearly nao by tracking the seasonal movements of the icelandic low and azores high the dataset has a monthly frequency from january 1889 to december 2020 pc based indices are more optimal representations of the full spatial patterns of the nao national center for atmospheric research staff eds 2021 the ea dataset used in this study is provided by the national weather service of noaa the frequency of the dataset is on a monthly basis from 1950 to 2020 the index is standardized by 1981 2010 climatology climate prediction center 2021 the wemo index is provided by the climatic research unit cru of the university of east anglia climatic research unit 2021 the time series started in 1821 and has a monthly frequency the trends of nasst msst and ggsst are calculated from the extended reconstructed sea surface temperature ersst dataset version 5 noaa 2021 and they are expressed using a 10 year mobile window of anomalies the anomalies are referred to the mean of the 1961 1990 period nasst is calculated in the area 0 n 65 n 80 w 0e msst in the area 38 n 49 n 0e 28e and ggsst in the area 42 8 n 44 8

this field an innovative approach which employs a linear model to understand the influence of each index on the rainfall prediction the combination of these different methods helped us to comprehend the accuracy and the advantages of the new method proposed we calculated the correlation coefficient to identify a possible relationship between atmospheric teleconnection and rainfall amount several authors use a statistical method of correlation to quantify the relationship between atmospheric indices and rainfalls brandimarte et al 2011 faust et al 2016 kalimeris et al 2017 kotsias et al 2020 koyama and stroeve 2019 lópez moreno et al 2011 vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2008 in particular some authors caloiero et al 2011 izquierdo et al 2014 luppichini et al 2021 nalley et al 2019 vergni et al 2016 use spearman s correlation coefficient scc spearman 1904 to understand the relationship between atmospheric index and rainfall amount this relationship is suitable for monotonically related variables even when their relationship is not linear the range of spearman s coefficients is between 1 and 1 positive values indicate a tendency of one variable to increase or decrease together with another variable whereas negative values indicate a trend in which the increase in the values of one variable is associated with the decrease in the values of the other variable and vice versa we have divided the time series into four seasons winter from december to february djf spring from march to may mam summer from june to august jja and autumn from september to november son we calculated the scc among the three atmospheric teleconnections and the rainfall for the four seasons using a 10 year moving time window from 1950 to 2020 we assigned the correlation result to the year halfway through each ten years however the trends in the time series can influence the scc arianos and carbone 2009 boris et al 2009 iqbal et al 2020 podobnik and stanley 2008 to exclude the influence of the trends on the results of this study we investigated further using the detrended cross correlation analysis dcca proposed by kristoufek 2014 in the framework developed by ide et al 2017 the dcca results are in perfect agreement with the scc results therefore we could exclude an influence of the trends on the use of scc in this study more information can be found in the supplementary material we can create linear models capable of predicting the rainfall amount by using the nao wemo and ea time series the equation of a linear model predicting the rainfall r p is the following 2 r p α n a o β w e m o γ e a δ we can analyse the best estimates of the model parameters α β γ to understand the role of each input in the prediction of rainfall if we want to obtain the best prediction models we should use models that are more complex than a simple linear model however the simplicity of the linear models allows to analyse the influence of the inputs since one of the tasks of this work is to show that more complex models for instance with the inclusion of synergies between the input data are not necessary to explain the rainfall observed we therefore created a linear model for each raingauge time series for each season the different range of the three atmospheric teleconnections could influence the information expressed by the parameters of models α β and δ for this reason we scaled the time series of nao wemo and ea in the range between 0 and 1 for the studied period 1950 2020 by applying the following equation 3 t ts t s m t s m t s m where t is the index time series in the 0 1 range t s m is the maximum value of the index and t s m is the minimum value of the index we fitted a linear model for each time series using the scipy library in python language and in more detail the curve fit method virtanen et al 2020 we validated the fits calculating the root mean square error rmse and the correlation coefficient r as follows 4 rmse 1 n i 0 n f i v i 2 0 5 5 r 1 n i 0 n f i v i 1 n i 0 n f i 2 0 5 1 n i 0 n v i 2 0 5 where f i are the forecast values v i are the observed values and n the number of years 3 results 3 1 rainfall trends fig 2 reports the values of par calculated for each time series used in this work and obtained from equation 1 the graphs indicate a small variability of par between each time series excluding the possibility of different influences on the linear model outcomes by the input stations and a significant variability in the study area the mapar of the study area is shown in figs 3 6 for the four seasons these variations of mapar over time are different in the four seasons from 1950 to 1985 the djf season was characterized by a slow rainfall reduction followed by a sudden decrease around the 90 s the first years of the 1990 s presented a mapar reduction of 40 starting from 2000 the djf mapar increased progressively until reaching the amount recorded before 1990 fig 3 until the 1990s the mam mapar was characterized by an oscillation from the 1990 s to the 2010 s mam mapar has the minimum values which are in the range between 10 and 20 mam mapar increased after 2008 fig 4 the jja mapar started to decrease in 1965 with minimum values of 30 around 2005 the last years were marked by a weakly increase of jja mapar fig 5 son mapar had a certain variability over an approximate 20 year period the maximum son mapar amount was recorded around 1965 and 1995 while the minimum values were those of the period 1970 1990 fig 6 3 2 atmospheric teleconnection trends in djf nao was characterized by an intensification of the positive phase the ea time series was characterized by an intensification of the positive phase starting from 1985 fig 3 and wemo was characterized by a positive phase with a decrease in the 1990 2010 period in mam nao and ea time series were characterized by a progressive increase with an intensification of the positive phase wemo has experienced a progressive decrease from a positive phase to a negative persistence phase since 2005 fig 4 in jja nao was characterized by a positive phase until 2005 whereas the index was characterized by a negative phase except for some years in this season ea started to increase progressively in 1995 while wemo had a progressive decrease with a persistence positive phase since 2005 fig 5 in son nao is variable with periods characterized by negative alternated with positive phases in this season ea had a higher index fluctuation with a negative phase until 1980 followed by a more positive ten year phase and then by a negative phase until 2000 from 2000 to 2020 ea increased reaching its maximum values wemo was characterized by two distinct positive phases around 1975 and 1995 but the overall trend has decreased with a negative phase since 2005 fig 6 3 3 sea surface temperature trends the variations of nasst msst and ggsst started to display a clear increasing trend in the 1980 s in all seasons such increase only started around the 2010 s for djf and ggsst while it started to increase in the 1980s in the other seasons the increase in sst was greater in the summer than in the other seasons figs 3 6 3 4 statistical correlation fig 7 reports the results obtained from scc and fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of the p values obtained in the djf season rainfall is correlated with wemo and anticorrelated with nao and ea rainfall increases during a negative phase of nao or ea and a positive phase of wemo during this period each atmospheric teleconnection has a similar effect on the rainfall amount in the mam season the strongest correlation is with wemo and even in this case a positive phase of the index corresponds to a rainfall increase in the study area nao and ea are weakly anticorrelated with the rainfall amount the strongest correlation is with ea in the jja season and a negative phase of this index indicates an increase in rainfall in the area while a positive phase of ea corresponds to reduced precipitation in summer nao and wemo are weakly correlated with rainfall but do not show a clear behaviour even in the son season the strongest correlation is with ea the correlation in this season is positive which indicates that a positive ea phase determines increased precipitation in the area the spatial correlation distribution is homogenous with no clear spatial pattern especially when the correlations are strong providing a precise indication of the relationship fig 7 3 5 linear models in fig 9 a d we report four examples of the mapar prediction by means of linear models referred to the djf mam jja and son seasons the cases shown represent the results of the lineal models because they have rmse values similar to the error medians calculated on the entire dataset fig 9e for the case shown in fig 9a α β and γ are respectively 96 56 42 53 and 4 85 for the case reported in fig 9b they are 21 39 15 54 and 15 76 for the case reported in fig 9c they are 30 71 56 10 and 1 34 for the case reported in fig 9c they are 48 05 7 54 and 6 71 fig 9e and 9d also report the rmse and r of the entire dataset son followed by mam which is the season with the highest average errors fig 10 shows the mean values of coefficients α β and γ for the linear models in each season blue circles we can observe a change in the values of the three coefficients from one season to another in fig 10 the red circles show the relative weights of each coefficient in the djf season the coefficient with the greatest weight is α with a mean value of about 55 followed by β and γ the coefficients indicate that nao has more influence on the rainfall trend than wemo and ea on djf in this season the coefficient values indicate that an increase in rainfall is linked to a negative phase of nao α is negative and a positive phase of wemo β is positive in the mam season β wemo has the highest weight in the results of the models followed by α nao and γ ea therefore the coefficients denote that the amount of rainfall is correlated with a positive phase of wemo and with a negative phase of nao also in this season ea has less influence on the model than the other two indices in the jja season ea is the index with the greatest coefficient γ in particular the coefficients suggest that the summer rainfall is linked to a negative phase of ea less important the coefficients indicate that the summer rainfall is linked to a negative phase of wemo in the son season nao has the greatest weight and is followed by wemo and ea which have less influence on the rainfall trend in this case the coefficients are all negative so that rainfall is correlated to a negative phase of these indices 4 discussion 4 1 mathematical and statistical relationship between atmospheric teleconnections and rainfall the statistical correlation calculated with spearman s method represents a first indication of the influence of climate patterns on the local rainfall trend in accordance with several studies caloiero et al 2011 deser et al 2017 ferrari et al 2013 george et al 2004 lópez moreno et al 2011 luppichini et al 2021 riaz et al 2017 vergni and chiaudani 2015 vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2008 west et al 2019 nao influence is predominant in winter with an anticorrelation between index and rainfall amount in agreement with the obtained scc an increase in the azores high and consequently a decrease in the iceland low determine reduced winter rainfall in the study area the correlation between nao and rainfall decreases during the successive seasons with a minimum correlation in summer in winter and in spring the correlation with wemo is strong and it is characterized by a positive sign this implies the formation of the genoa gulf low and its reinforcement increases the amount of rainfall in the study area this can be ascribed to the direction of the moist air masses coming from the atlantic ocean and directed to the north western coast of spain and to the mediterranean degeai et al 2020 martín et al 2012 martin vide and lopez bustins 2006 in this dynamic state the moist air masses can reach tuscany enhancing local cyclogenesis and rainfall the scc values indicate that the influence of the genoa gulf low decreases in summer and autumn the correlation between rainfall and ea is strong in winter and summer in summer the correlation with rainfall is mainly with ea in winter the link between ea and rainfall is the same for nao in summer the greater representativeness of ea than of nao on the azores high allows a better understanding of the link between rainfall and global climate in this season in detail the formation of the azores high and of the african high results in an increase in the ea index and this means that there is reduced precipitation in the study area in autumn the statistical correlations do not allow to create a link between large scale circulation and rainfall indeed we can observe a weak anticorrelation with nao a weak correlation with ea and no correlation with wemo this method seems unsuitable to represent the autumn season with its atmospheric dynamics the results of the linear models are conformant to the statistical correlation results for the djf mam and jja seasons while we observe some differences in son the strong correspondence between the two methods in djf mam and jja makes it possible to validate our linear model in autumn the analysis of the linear models identifies an important role of nao and therefore a link between northern atlantic atmospheric circulation and rainfall in the study area in autumn the coefficients of nao α are set negative and this means that an increase in the index is linked to a decrease in rainfall in the study area this mathematical result is more plausible than that obtained from the analysis of correlations based on the notions of atmospheric physics introduced previously the linear model based method has allowed us to refine our investigations and to improve our knowledge of the dynamics in the mediterranean over the seasons the use of our linear models offers the advantage of clarifying the role and influence of large scale atmospheric circulation on rainfall over the study region in different seasons and this may appear controversial when using only the statistical correlation these linear methods can also be useful for rainfall prediction although it is not the aim of this paper to produce the best model for predictions a more complex model may be better suited to reduce the overall model however it would have been difficult to understand the influence of each input parameter which is the main scope of this paper 4 2 long term rainfall trends and relation with climate patterns this study has identified a confused trend for the djf mam and son rainfall while the jja rainfall clearly tends to decrease these results agree with those of other studies based on different rainfall datasets caloiero et al 2018 deitch et al 2017 philandras et al 2011 more specifically deitch et al 2017 studied the seasonal trend of rainfall in the mediterranean area demonstrating a negative trend for summer rainfall and no trend for winter autumnal rainfall in tuscany the djf seasons are characterized by significantly decreased precipitation between 1984 and 2005 fig 3 this period is marked by a positive phase of nao and ea and a negative phase of wemo starting around 1984 the increase in nao and ea is due to an increase in nasst fig 3 an increase in nasst is correlated to an expansion of the azores high and a consecutive reduction of the iceland low resulting in the formation of the nao and ea positive phases börgel et al 2020 frankignoul et al 2003 robertson et al 2000 visbeck et al 2001 the successive increase in rainfall from 2005 to 2020 seems to have been caused by an increase in the wemo and therefore by an increase in the genoa gulf low persistence this could indicate a change of the main climatic driver with respect to the previous period fig 3 the mam season presents a decrease in the amount of rainfall in the period between 1985 and 2008 fig 4 the wemo constantly decreases with progressive intensification of the negative phase this indicates a gradual reduced intensity of the genoa gulf low the ggsst has progressively increased since 1985 furthermore nao and ea are in a persistent positive phase since 2008 there has been a weak increase in the precipitation trend the jja rainfall trends have the highest correlation with ea while nao and wemo have a lower influence figs 7 and 10 the increase in nasst msst and ggsst induces the nao and ea indices to a positive phase and wemo to a negative phase this process induces a progressive reduction of rainfall trends in this season son is characterized by rainfall trend variability with two wet periods and two dry periods fig 6 each dry period is marked by an increase in nao whereas the wet period results from an increase in wemo linked to a weak decrease in ggsst fig 6 the increase in sea surface temperature is greater in the warm periods of the year and it is caused by current global warming from these observations we can evince that the warm periods of the year are marked by a greater decrease in precipitation resulting in less water availability in the environmental system 5 conclusions this study helps to gain a better knowledge of the rainfall trends of the last 70 years in tuscany a key area of the mediterranean basin strongly influenced by the cyclogenetic activity related to the genoa gulf low these trends are analyzed on the basis of the trend of the main atmospheric drivers of the northern hemisphere the location of the study area allows to understand the influences of atlantic atmospheric circulation and of the mediterranean atmospheric circulation on rainfall along with spearman s traditional coefficient analysis this study proposes a new mathematical method to investigate the relationship between climate pattern and rainfall the method based on the use of linear models has resulted to be valid with similar results derived from a statistical correlation this new method has allowed for a more detailed comprehension of the link between climate patterns and precipitation in the study area in tuscany the rainfall amount is influenced by northern atlantic atmospheric circulation and by the genoa gulf low the influences of the two atmospheric systems vary during the year in winter rainfall is strongly correlated to the three indices in spring the main influence is represented by wemo indicating an important role played by the genoa gulf low in summer the main driver is ea which represents better than nao the influence of the azores high in this season in autumn the strongest correlation is with nao the amount of rainfall in the study area is influenced by the ssts which induce a variation in the northern atlantic and mediterranean atmospheric circulations börgel et al 2020 frankignoul et al 2003 robertson et al 2000 visbeck et al 2001 current global warming determines an increase in the ssts and this increase is higher in the warm seasons of the year james et al 2006 the results of this study show that in these seasons there is the greatest reduction of water availability on account of a direct decrease in precipitation for this reason current global warming could be responsible for less rainfall in this area and this occurs mainly in the warm seasons when temperature increase is highest these aspects can be deepened by future studies that can strengthen the relationships found and the considerations made in this work credit authorship contribution statement marco luppichini conceptualization methodology software investigation data

3109,current global warming causes a change in atmospheric dynamics with consequent variations in the rainfall regimes understanding the relationship between global climate patterns global warming and rainfall regimes is crucial for the creation of future scenarios and for the relative modification of water management the aim of this study is to improve knowledge of the relationship between north atlantic oscillation nao east atlantic ea and western mediterranean oscillation wemo with the seasonal rainfalls in tuscany italy the study area occupies a strategic position since it lies in a transition zone between the wet area of northern europe and the dry area of the northern coast of africa this research based on a statistical correlation method and on linear models is designed to understand the relationship between seasonal rainfalls and climate patterns the results of this study demonstrate that the use of linear models can yield more information than traditional statistical correlations the results show a decrease in rainfall in the warm period of the year namely in the summer when its expression is most visible this phenomenon is ascribable to current global warming which causes an increase in sea surface temperatures an increase in the northern atlantic sea surface temperature and in the mediterranean sea surface temperature causes a reduction of the iceland low with an extension of the azores high moreover an increase in the genoa gulf sst induces a weakening of the genoa gulf low one of the main cyclogenetic systems of the mediterranean keywords climatic patterns current global warming east atlantic north atlantic oscillation western mediterranean oscillation rainfall trend tuscany 1 introduction current global warming causes effects at different scale levels including changes in the hydrological cycle allan 2011 bates et al 2008 the effects are visible in air temperature trends and more generally in rainfall in the form of frequency and intensity of extreme events and changes in soil moisture blöschl et al 2019 stagl et al 2014 xu et al 2011 with wide implications in terms of socio economic conditions and financial policy european environment agency 2019 the mediterranean region is an ideal research testbed for current climatic changes both for its location for its historico cultural importance and for having been considered a hot spot for future climatic changes giorgi 2006 the mediterranean located between the european humid domain and the north african arid belt provides alternating circulation regimes with large spatial and temporal variability dünkeloh and jacobeit 2003 in this context a correct characterization of rainfall regimes can improve the management of water resources tramblay et al 2020 and of extreme events cardoso pereira et al 2020 myhre et al 2019 several studies have identified a general decrease although with some exceptions in the annual rainfall amount in the area of the mediterranean basin

lopez bustins 2006 philandras et al 2011 ríos cornejo et al 2015 and atmospheric patterns related to mesoscale circulation brandimarte et al 2011 caloiero et al 2011 halifa marín et al 2021 lopez bustins et al 2008 luppichini et al 2021 martinez artigas et al 2021 ríos cornejo et al 2015 trigo et al 2004 during the winter months one of the main drivers of rainfall variability in southern europe and in the mediterranean is the presence of different pressure fields over the northern atlantic ocean and their variability indicated as the north atlantic oscillation nao hurrell 1995 nao is defined by an index measured as a north southern dipole of pressure anomalies with one pole located at higher latitudes iceland low 80 n and the other at the central latitudes of the north atlantic between 35 n and 40 n azores high the east atlantic ea index is similar to that of nao but is displaced south eastward to the approximate nodal lines of the nao pattern the ea index is often interpreted as a downward shifted nao model but its strong subtropical link entails a different peculiarity the ea value is positive when a significant drop in pressure occurs in the atlantic ocean at the same time the subtropical oceanic anticyclone belt considerably rises in latitude and strengthens in response the african anticyclone gains energy and invasiveness over the mediterranean subjecting this area to frequent pulses of hot and dry saharan air in all seasons climate prediction center 2021 mellado cano et al 2019 the nao and ea indexes present interannual and annual variabilities with positive and negative phases the rainfall in the mediterranean can be associated with a negative phase of nao and or ea when we observe an expansion of the iceland low instead during a positive phase of nao and or ea northern europe is the rainiest area rousi et al 2020 both nao and ea are influenced by the sea surface temperature sst of the northern atlantic ocean nasst and of the mediterranean msst an increase in nasst and in msst is correlated to an expansion of the azores high and to a consecutive reduction of the iceland low which cause a formation of the nao and ea positive phases frankignoul et al 2003 robertson et al 2000 visbeck et al 2001 more recently nao has been correlated to the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo a representative index of the nasst trend knight et al 2005 amo changes the zonal position of the nao centre of action moving the cyclonic area closer to europe or to north america during a positive phase of amo the icelandic low moves further towards north america while the azores high moves further towards europe and vice versa for the negative phase of amo börgel et al 2020 the statistical correlation between the nao and the winter rainfalls in europe varies over time vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2008 and it is a function of nao and amo with a different role of the indices from northern europe to the mediterranean luppichini et al 2021 the western mediterranean oscillation wemo is an index often used to study variability in rainfall in alternative to nao in the mediterranean region the wemo index is the difference of atmospheric pressure in a dipole with the first pole located in padua 45 40 n 11 48 e in northern italy and the second one located in san fernando cádiz 36 28 n 6 12 w in southwestern spain climatic research unit 2021 specifically the former is located in the po plain an area with relatively high barometric variability due to the different influence of the central european anticyclone and of the genoa gulf low while the latter pole is located in the gulf of cádiz in the southwest of the iberian peninsula often subject to the influence of the azores anticyclone and episodically to the cut off of circumpolar lows or to its own cyclogenesis halifa marín et al 2021 lopez bustins et al 2020 martin vide and lopez bustins 2006 a positive phase of wemo is associated with a low pressure area in the ligurian sea and with an anticyclone in the gulf of cadiz instead a negative phase of the index determines a low in the gulf of cadiz and an anticyclone in central europe wemo is influenced by nasst and msst but also by the genoa gulf sea surface temperature ggsst with positive values correlating to low values of sst martín et al 2012 martin vide and lopez bustins 2006 current global warming causes a progressive increase in nasst msst and ggsst pastor et al 2020 wang and dong 2010 so that nao and ea are likely to be characterized by more positive phases and wemo by more negative phases the purpose of this study is to understand the rainfall seasonal trends of the last 70 years in tuscany central italy in relation to mesoscale circulation and to the indices defined above the rainfall dataset employed derives from several raingauges with high spatial density and temporal activity which allow us to investigate the rainfall trend in great detail and with direct measurements the rainfall trends are compared with the nao ea and wemo indices by means of mathematical and statistical methods so as to understand the climatic trends influencing the rainfall regime in the area we investigated the link between the different indices by using traditional statistical methods spearman 1904 many land dynamics e g drought floods solid transport coastal erosion are linked to the rainfall regime which can create management criticalities e g billi and fazzini 2017 bini et al 2021 piccarreta et al 2004 the study of variations in the amount of rainfall related to climatic indices allows to lay the foundations for future studies and land management the observations put forward in this work and the methods adopted could be extended to other mediterranean areas by increasing knowledge about these issues 2 methods 2 1 study area tuscany has a strategic location because it is located in the northern sector of the mediterranean in the proximity of the genoa gulf by far the most active cyclogenetic centre of the mediterranean trigo et al 2002 as expected the mean annual precipitation map in tuscany is influenced by morphology fig 1 a the rainiest areas are located at the highest altitudes apuan alps and northern apennines fig 1b in particular the apuan alps in north western tuscany show some of the highest rainfall amounts in italy giannecchini and d amato avanzi 2012 rapetti and vittorini 1994 often characterized by high intensity d amato avanzi et al 2004 giannecchini 2006 in tuscany map is in a range of 400 3000 mm year with a clear gradient from the northern to the southern and it is linked to the morphology fig 1a the main rainy season is autumn with a progressive decrease that generally starts in december the mean rainfall in the djf season is ca 300 mm ca 250 mm in mam ca 130 mm in jja and ca 350 mm in son 2 2 dataset 2 2 1 rainfall dataset and processing the raingauge dataset was provided by the tuscany region hydrologic service sir network and includes 1103 raingauges fig 1c the daily data were obtained by an automated download procedure through an http request in march 2021 the dataset is the best one available in this area and it is managed by the sir which validates and checks the data the dataset is used in several research works because it is referenced and managed by a public body in particular luppichini et al 2021 used this dataset to understand the relationship between nao and winter rainfall in this area the activity period of each raingauge is variable the older stations have been monitoring since the beginning of the last century even if a temporal continuity of the data is not always guaranteed for some stations sir provides the daily rainfall data for each raingauge in the operation period to obtain longer and more complete time series from this dataset we grouped the stations according to a stringent protocol this procedure is necessary to reconstruct the time series of the stations that have experienced minor changes in position or that have undergone an administrative variation e g a slight change in name or identification code the stations have consecutive intermittent activity times due to the decommissioning of one and the subsequent installation of a new one in these cases we merged the stations by assigning the same or part of the same name with a difference in altimetry less than 20 of the measurement and a maximum distance less than 2 km the geographic coordinates of the merged stations derived from a cartesian mean of the original coordinates of the origin stations by using the data available and following the procedure described above a total of 117 time series were obtained from 1950 to 2020 the rainfall data can also be useful for comparison with the results of the linear models which predict rainfall anomalies the rainfall values are expressed as percentage anomalies of rainfall par and are calculated as follows 1 pa r s i x s i x i x i 100 where x s i is the annual seasonal rainfall amount of the i th year and s th season x l is the annual rainfall amount mean of the period 1961 1990 the values of par are calculated for the four seasons winter djf december january and february spring mam march april and may summer jja june july and august autumn son september october and november mean average par mapar is a ten year mobile average of par calculated for each season and the values are associated with the central year we chose to use a ten year mobile average because this time range is within the standard 10 30 year time scale considered to be decadal variability meehl et al 2009 2 2 2 climatic dataset the nao dataset is provided by the climate analysis section of the us national center for atmospheric research ncar this dataset is based on the principal pc based index component of the nao which are the time series of the leading empirical orthogonal function eof of slp anomalies over the atlantic sector 20 80 n 90 w 40 e this index is used to measure the yearly nao by tracking the seasonal movements of the icelandic low and azores high the dataset has a monthly frequency from january 1889 to december 2020 pc based indices are more optimal representations of the full spatial patterns of the nao national center for atmospheric research staff eds 2021 the ea dataset used in this study is provided by the national weather service of noaa the frequency of the dataset is on a monthly basis from 1950 to 2020 the index is standardized by 1981 2010 climatology climate prediction center 2021 the wemo index is provided by the climatic research unit cru of the university of east anglia climatic research unit 2021 the time series started in 1821 and has a monthly frequency the trends of nasst msst and ggsst are calculated from the extended reconstructed sea surface temperature ersst dataset version 5 noaa 2021 and they are expressed using a 10 year mobile window of anomalies the anomalies are referred to the mean of the 1961 1990 period nasst is calculated in the area 0 n 65 n 80 w 0e msst in the area 38 n 49 n 0e 28e and ggsst in the area 42 8 n 44 8 n 7 6e 10 76e 2 3 statistical correlation and linear models we investigated the link between the different indices by using traditional statistical methods spearman 1904 but also by introducing in this field an innovative approach which employs a linear model to understand the influence of each index on the rainfall prediction the combination of these different methods helped us to comprehend the accuracy and the advantages of the new method proposed we calculated the correlation coefficient to identify a possible relationship between atmospheric teleconnection and rainfall amount several authors use a statistical method of correlation to quantify the relationship between atmospheric indices and rainfalls brandimarte et al 2011 faust et al 2016 kalimeris et al 2017 kotsias et al 2020 koyama and stroeve 2019 lópez moreno et al 2011 vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2008 in particular some authors caloiero et al 2011 izquierdo et al 2014 luppichini et al 2021 nalley et al 2019 vergni et al 2016 use spearman s correlation coefficient scc spearman 1904 to understand the relationship between atmospheric index and rainfall amount this relationship is suitable for monotonically related variables even when their relationship is not linear the range of spearman s coefficients is between 1 and 1 positive values indicate a tendency of one variable to increase or decrease together with another variable whereas negative values indicate a trend in which the increase in the values of one variable is associated with the decrease in the values of the other variable and vice versa we have divided the time series into four seasons winter from december to february djf spring from march to may mam summer from june to august jja and autumn from september to november son we calculated the scc among the three atmospheric teleconnections and the rainfall for the four seasons using a 10 year moving time window from 1950 to 2020 we assigned the correlation result to the year halfway through each ten years however the trends in the time series can influence the scc arianos and carbone 2009 boris et al 2009 iqbal et al 2020 podobnik and stanley 2008 to exclude the influence of the trends on the results of this study we investigated further using the detrended cross correlation analysis dcca proposed by kristoufek 2014 in the framework developed by ide et al 2017 the dcca results are in perfect agreement with the scc results therefore we could exclude an influence of the trends on the use of scc in this study more information can be found in the supplementary material we can create linear models capable of predicting the rainfall amount by using the nao wemo and ea time series the equation of a linear model predicting the rainfall r p is the following 2 r p α n a o β w e m o γ e a δ we can analyse the best estimates of the model parameters α β γ to understand the role of each input in the prediction of rainfall if we want to obtain the best prediction models we should use models that are more complex than a simple linear model however the simplicity of the linear models allows to analyse the influence of the inputs since one of the tasks of this work is to show that more complex models for instance with the inclusion of synergies between the input data are not necessary to explain the rainfall observed we therefore created a linear model for each raingauge time series for each season the different range of the three atmospheric teleconnections could influence the information expressed by the parameters of models α β and δ for this reason we scaled the time series of nao wemo and ea in the range between 0 and 1 for the studied period 1950 2020 by applying the following equation 3 t ts t s m t s m t s m where t is the index time series in the 0 1 range t s m is the maximum value of the index and t s m is the minimum value of the index we fitted a linear model for each time series using the scipy library in python language and in more detail the curve fit method virtanen et al 2020 we validated the fits calculating the root mean square error rmse and the correlation coefficient r as follows 4 rmse 1 n i 0 n f i v i 2 0 5 5 r 1 n i 0 n f i v i 1 n i 0 n f i 2 0 5 1 n i 0 n v i 2 0 5 where f i are the forecast values v i are the observed values and n the number of years 3 results 3 1 rainfall trends fig 2 reports the values of par calculated for each time series used in this work and obtained from equation 1 the graphs indicate a small variability of par between each time series excluding the possibility of different influences on the linear model outcomes by the input stations and a significant variability in the study area the mapar of the study area is shown in figs 3 6 for the four seasons these variations of mapar over time are different in the four seasons from 1950 to 1985 the djf season was characterized by a slow rainfall reduction followed by a sudden decrease around the 90 s the first years of the 1990 s presented a mapar reduction of 40 starting from 2000 the djf mapar increased progressively until reaching the amount recorded before 1990 fig 3 until the 1990s the mam mapar was characterized by an oscillation from the 1990 s to the 2010 s mam mapar has the minimum values which are in the range between 10 and 20 mam mapar increased after 2008 fig 4 the jja mapar started to decrease in 1965 with minimum values of 30 around 2005 the last years were marked by a weakly increase of jja mapar fig 5 son mapar had a certain variability over an approximate 20 year period the maximum son mapar amount was recorded around 1965 and 1995 while the minimum values were those of the period 1970 1990 fig 6 3 2 atmospheric teleconnection trends in djf nao was characterized by an intensification of the positive phase the ea time series was characterized by an intensification of the positive phase starting from 1985 fig 3 and wemo was characterized by a positive phase with a decrease in the 1990 2010 period in mam nao and ea time series were characterized by a progressive increase with an intensification of the positive phase wemo has experienced a progressive decrease from a positive phase to a negative persistence phase since 2005 fig 4 in jja nao was characterized by a positive phase until 2005 whereas the index was characterized by a negative phase except for some years in this season ea started to increase progressively in 1995 while wemo had a progressive decrease with a persistence positive phase since 2005 fig 5 in son nao is variable with periods characterized by negative alternated with positive phases in this season ea had a higher index fluctuation with a negative phase until 1980 followed by a more positive ten year phase and then by a negative phase until 2000 from 2000 to 2020 ea increased reaching its maximum values wemo was characterized by two distinct positive phases around 1975 and 1995 but the overall trend has decreased with a negative phase since 2005 fig 6 3 3 sea surface temperature trends the variations of nasst msst and ggsst started to display a clear increasing trend in the 1980 s in all seasons such increase only started around the 2010 s for djf and ggsst while it started to increase in the 1980s in the other seasons the increase in sst was greater in the summer than in the other seasons figs 3 6 3 4 statistical correlation fig 7 reports the results obtained from scc and fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of the p values obtained in the djf season rainfall is correlated with wemo and anticorrelated with nao and ea rainfall increases during a negative phase of nao or ea and a positive phase of wemo during this period each atmospheric teleconnection has a similar effect on the rainfall amount in the mam season the strongest correlation is with wemo and even in this case a positive phase of the index corresponds to a rainfall increase in the study area nao and ea are weakly anticorrelated with the rainfall amount the strongest correlation is with ea in the jja season and a negative phase of this index indicates an increase in rainfall in the area while a positive phase of ea corresponds to reduced precipitation in summer nao and wemo are weakly correlated with rainfall but do not show a clear behaviour even in the son season the strongest correlation is with ea the correlation in this season is positive which indicates that a positive ea phase determines increased precipitation in the area the spatial correlation distribution is homogenous with no clear spatial pattern especially when the correlations are strong providing a precise indication of the relationship fig 7 3 5 linear models in fig 9 a d we report four examples of the mapar prediction by means of linear models referred to the djf mam jja and son seasons the cases shown represent the results of the lineal models because they have rmse values similar to the error medians calculated on the entire dataset fig 9e for the case shown in fig 9a α β and γ are respectively 96 56 42 53 and 4 85 for the case reported in fig 9b they are 21 39 15 54 and 15 76 for the case reported in fig 9c they are 30 71 56 10 and 1 34 for the case reported in fig 9c they are 48 05 7 54 and 6 71 fig 9e and 9d also report the rmse and r of the entire dataset son followed by mam which is the season with the highest average errors fig 10 shows the mean values of coefficients α β and γ for the linear models in each season blue circles we can observe a change in the values of the three coefficients from one season to another in fig 10 the red circles show the relative weights of each coefficient in the djf season the coefficient with the greatest weight is α with a mean value of about 55 followed by β and γ the coefficients indicate that nao has more influence on the rainfall trend than wemo and ea on djf in this season the coefficient values indicate that an increase in rainfall is linked to a negative phase of nao α is negative and a positive phase of wemo β is positive in the mam season β wemo has the highest weight in the results of the models followed by α nao and γ ea therefore the coefficients denote that the amount of rainfall is correlated with a positive phase of wemo and with a negative phase of nao also in this season ea has less influence on the model than the other two indices in the jja season ea is the index with the greatest coefficient γ in particular the coefficients suggest that the summer rainfall is linked to a negative phase of ea less important the coefficients indicate that the summer rainfall is linked to a negative phase of wemo in the son season nao has the greatest weight and is followed by wemo and ea which have less influence on the rainfall trend in this case the coefficients are all negative so that rainfall is correlated to a negative phase of these indices 4 discussion 4 1 mathematical and statistical relationship between atmospheric teleconnections and rainfall the statistical correlation calculated with spearman s method represents a first indication of the influence of climate patterns on the local rainfall trend in accordance with several studies caloiero et al 2011 deser et al 2017 ferrari et al 2013 george et al 2004 lópez moreno et al 2011 luppichini et al 2021 riaz et al 2017 vergni and chiaudani 2015 vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2008 west et al 2019 nao influence is predominant in winter with an anticorrelation between index and rainfall amount in agreement with the obtained scc an increase in the azores high and consequently a decrease in the iceland low determine reduced winter rainfall in the study area the correlation between nao and rainfall decreases during the successive seasons with a minimum correlation in summer in winter and in spring the correlation with wemo is strong and it is characterized by a positive sign this implies the formation of the genoa gulf low and its reinforcement increases the amount of rainfall in the study area this can be ascribed to the direction of the moist air masses coming from the atlantic ocean and directed to the north western coast of spain and to the mediterranean degeai et al 2020 martín et al 2012 martin vide and lopez bustins 2006 in this dynamic state the moist air masses can reach tuscany enhancing local cyclogenesis and rainfall the scc values indicate that the influence of the genoa gulf low decreases in summer and autumn the correlation between rainfall and ea is strong in winter and summer in summer the correlation with rainfall is mainly with ea in winter the link between ea and rainfall is the same for nao in summer the greater representativeness of ea than of nao on the azores high allows a better understanding of the link between rainfall and global climate in this season in detail the formation of the azores high and of the african high results in an increase in the ea index and this means that there is reduced precipitation in the study area in autumn the statistical correlations do not allow to create a link between large scale circulation and rainfall indeed we can observe a weak anticorrelation with nao a weak correlation with ea and no correlation with wemo this method seems unsuitable to represent the autumn season with its atmospheric dynamics the results of the linear models are conformant to the statistical correlation results for the djf mam and jja seasons while we observe some differences in son the strong correspondence between the two methods in djf mam and jja makes it possible to validate our linear model in autumn the analysis of the linear models identifies an important role of nao and therefore a link between northern atlantic atmospheric circulation and rainfall in the study area in autumn the coefficients of nao α are set negative and this means that an increase in the index is linked to a decrease in rainfall in the study area this mathematical result is more plausible than that obtained from the analysis of correlations based on the notions of atmospheric physics introduced previously the linear model based method has allowed us to refine our investigations and to improve our knowledge of the dynamics in the mediterranean over the seasons the use of our linear models offers the advantage of clarifying the role and influence of large scale atmospheric circulation on rainfall over the study region in different seasons and this may appear controversial when using only the statistical correlation these linear methods can also be useful for rainfall prediction although it is not the aim of this paper to produce the best model for predictions a more complex model may be better suited to reduce the overall model however it would have been difficult to understand the influence of each input parameter which is the main scope of this paper 4 2 long term rainfall trends and relation with climate patterns this study has identified a confused trend for the djf mam and son rainfall while the jja rainfall clearly tends to decrease these results agree with those of other studies based on different rainfall datasets caloiero et al 2018 deitch et al 2017 philandras et al 2011 more specifically deitch et al 2017 studied the seasonal trend of rainfall in the mediterranean area demonstrating a negative trend for summer rainfall and no trend for winter autumnal rainfall in tuscany the djf seasons are characterized by significantly decreased precipitation between 1984 and 2005 fig 3 this period is marked by a positive phase of nao and ea and a negative phase of wemo starting around 1984 the increase in nao and ea is due to an increase in nasst fig 3 an increase in nasst is correlated to an expansion of the azores high and a consecutive reduction of the iceland low resulting in the formation of the nao and ea positive phases börgel et al 2020 frankignoul et al 2003 robertson et al 2000 visbeck et al 2001 the successive increase in rainfall from 2005 to 2020 seems to have been caused by an increase in the wemo and therefore by an increase in the genoa gulf low persistence this could indicate a change of the main climatic driver with respect to the previous period fig 3 the mam season presents a decrease in the amount of rainfall in the period between 1985 and 2008 fig 4 the wemo constantly decreases with progressive intensification of the negative phase this indicates a gradual reduced intensity of the genoa gulf low the ggsst has progressively increased since 1985 furthermore nao and ea are in a persistent positive phase since 2008 there has been a weak increase in the precipitation trend the jja rainfall trends have the highest correlation with ea while nao and wemo have a lower influence figs 7 and 10 the increase in nasst msst and ggsst induces the nao and ea indices to a positive phase and wemo to a negative phase this process induces a progressive reduction of rainfall trends in this season son is characterized by rainfall trend variability with two wet periods and two dry periods fig 6 each dry period is marked by an increase in nao whereas the wet period results from an increase in wemo linked to a weak decrease in ggsst fig 6 the increase in sea surface temperature is greater in the warm periods of the year and it is caused by current global warming from these observations we can evince that the warm periods of the year are marked by a greater decrease in precipitation resulting in less water availability in the environmental system 5 conclusions this study helps to gain a better knowledge of the rainfall trends of the last 70 years in tuscany a key area of the mediterranean basin strongly influenced by the cyclogenetic activity related to the genoa gulf low these trends are analyzed on the basis of the trend of the main atmospheric drivers of the northern hemisphere the location of the study area allows to understand the influences of atlantic atmospheric circulation and of the mediterranean atmospheric circulation on rainfall along with spearman s traditional coefficient analysis this study proposes a new mathematical method to investigate the relationship between climate pattern and rainfall the method based on the use of linear models has resulted to be valid with similar results derived from a statistical correlation this new method has allowed for a more detailed comprehension of the link between climate patterns and precipitation in the study area in tuscany the rainfall amount is influenced by northern atlantic atmospheric circulation and by the genoa gulf low the influences of the two atmospheric systems vary during the year in winter rainfall is strongly correlated to the three indices in spring the main influence is represented by wemo indicating an important role played by the genoa gulf low in summer the main driver is ea which represents better than nao the influence of the azores high in this season in autumn the strongest correlation is with nao the amount of rainfall in the study area is influenced by the ssts which induce a variation in the northern atlantic and mediterranean atmospheric circulations börgel et al 2020 frankignoul et al 2003 robertson et al 2000 visbeck et al 2001 current global warming determines an increase in the ssts and this increase is higher in the warm seasons of the year james et al 2006 the results of this study show that in these seasons there is the greatest reduction of water availability on account of a direct decrease in precipitation for this reason current global warming could be responsible for less rainfall in this area and this occurs mainly in the warm seasons when temperature increase is highest these aspects can be deepened by future studies that can strengthen the relationships found and the considerations made in this work credit authorship contribution statement marco luppichini conceptualization methodology software investigation data
