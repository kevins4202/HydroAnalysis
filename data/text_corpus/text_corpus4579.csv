duty ship and offshore structural vibrations owing to various ocean environmental loads reported by meylan et al 2015 and excitations of power systems investigated by murawski and charchalis 2014 become increasingly outstanding vibrations in ship and offshore structures may not only reduce platform productivity as well as serviceability and reliability of the structures but also have significantly adverse influences on the sound quality and comfort consequently how to effectively and efficiently control vibration and noise of ship and offshore structures and realize low noise design of structures appears extremely important in an attempt to control vibration and noise of ship and offshore structures a large number of studies have been carried out traditional vibration control strategies in ship and offshore structures are investigated and summarized by lin et al 2009 kandasamy et al 2016 and zhang et al 2017 they can generally be divided into three categories namely passive control method studied by patil and jangid 2005 wang et al 2013 and yue et al 2009 and semi active control method investigated by pinkaew and fujino 2001 wang and li 2013 and taghikhany et al 2013 as well as active control method performed by luo and zhu 2006 zhang et al 2016 and cinquemani and braghin 2017 passive methods are exemplified by the structural addition of typically viscoelastic damping layers where the hysteresis loop of the cyclic stress and strain of the damping layer dissipates vibration energy semi active control methods modify or control the mechanical properties of the damping element within the vibration control device this usually requires a small amount of external power for operation on the order of tens of watts an active control typically requires a large power source for the operation of electrohydraulic or electromechanical servo motor actuator which increases the structural damping or stiffness although the existing methods can be applied to control vibration and noise of ship and offshore structures in a reasonable degree they have some shortcomings including temperature sensitivity and aging characteristics of viscoelastic damping materials in passive control system complexity and narrow band characteristics of active control in addition to the above traditional vibration control methods a great deal of research has been conducted by mead 1996 achenbach 2012 and trainiti et al 2015 to explore the elastic wave propagation and attenuation properties in periodic structures over last few decades periodic structures can possess various unique physical properties in particular the existence of band gaps in which the propagation of vibrational waves is prohibited yu et al 2006 and xiao et al 2013 theoretically and experimentally studied the flexural wave propagation and vibration band gaps in one dimensional timoshenko beams with periodically attached local resonators they demonstrated that the flexural vibration in one dimensional beam structures can be suppressed significantly nobrega et al 2016 numerically and experimentally investigated the elastic wave propagation and band gaps in one dimensional elastic metamaterial rods with spatial periodic distribution and periodically attached local resonators results showed that significant longitudinal vibration attenuation in one dimensional periodic rods occurs richards and pines 2003 designed a one dimensional periodic shaft structure and showed that the proposed one dimensional periodic shaft can generate stop band and pass band regions in the frequency spectra which was efficiently used to reduce transmitted vibration generated by gear mesh contact dynamics li et al 2014 theoretically investigated the lamb wave propagation and band gaps in one dimensional radial periodic structures with periodic corrugation which was utilized to control the radial vibration and radiated noise of rotational machines zhou et al 2014 theoretically investigated the flexural wave propagation characteristics in one dimensional periodically stiffened thin plate by using the center finite difference method results showed that one dimensional periodically stiffened thin plate can yield complete band gaps and the structural vibration wave in the one dimensional periodically stiffened thin plate is forbidden cho et al 2016 presented free vibration numerical analysis of one dimensional stiffened panels with multiple lumped mass and stiffness attachments the mindlin s theory was applied for plate and timoshenko beam theory for stiffeners obviously current researches on periodic structures are mainly concentrated on the wave propagation and vibration band gap characteristics in one dimensional periodic structures such as periodic rods beams and shafts as well as one dimensional periodic plate structures only structural vibration along periodic direction can be significantly isolated whereas the structural vibration along non periodic direction is difficult to control consequently it is of considerable importance to investigate the elastic wave propagation and band gap properties in two dimensional periodic plate structures for the two dimensional structural vibration control in ship and offshore structures bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plates are basic constitutive members of ships and offshore structures which are widely used in deck and hull bottom as well as broadside structures to satisfy the requirement of structural safety and lightweight investigated by mace 1981 paik et al 2001 and chen and xie 2005 in this paper the flexural wave propagation and vibration attenuation characteristics in two dimensional periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plates are numerically and experimentally investigated results show that periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plates can yield complete flexural wave band gaps resulting in the significant flexural vibration suppression 2 physics model and calculation method the physics model of stiffened plate considered in this paper is constituted of bi directionally orthogonal stiffeners periodically deposited on the plate as illustrated in fig 1 the area surrounded by red dashed line in fig 1 is the unit cell of periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate the lattice constant of the proposed stiffened plate is defined as a 0 the infinite periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate can be obtained by periodically repeating the unit cell along length direction and breadth direction in this paper the proposed finite periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate is composed of 8 unit cells along the length direction and 4 unit cells along the breadth direction respectively the lattice constant a 0 of periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate is equal to 120 mm the overall dimensions of the proposed finite periodic stiffened plate are 960 mm 480 mm with plate thickness e 0 2 mm the stiffener height and thickness are defined as h 0 20 mm and b 0 2 mm in order to investigate the flexural wave propagation and vibration band gaps in the proposed periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate an efficient finite element method combination with bloch theory is applied to calculate the dispersion relations and transmission power spectra for the wave propagation in solid structures the governing equation is given as follows 1 j 1 3 x i λ u j x j x j μ u i x j u j x i ρ 2 u i t 2 i j x y z where u is the displacement vector ρ is the mass density t is the time λ and μ are the lame constants x y and z represent the coordinate variables in cartesian coordinate system respectively 2 λ e ν 1 ν 1 2 ν μ e 1 ν where e and ν represent the young s modulus and poisson s ratio respectively since the proposed bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate is typical thin wall structure the structural mechanics module with shell application mode in comsol multiphysics is utilized to calculate the wave equation the faces of the proposed stiffened plate are defined in the midplane the dependent variables are the displacements u v and w in the global x y and z directions and the rotations θ x θ y and θ z about the global coordinate axes the degrees of freedom defined by the shell element correspond to the values of the dependent variables in the three triangle vertices for the calculation of the dispersion relations of the infinite periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plates only the numerical calculation model of unit cell composed of bi directionally orthogonal stiffeners deposited on a squad plate as shown in fig 2 a should be considered since the infinite periodic system is in periodic distribution along the x direction length direction and y direction breadth direction simultaneously based on the translational periodicity and spatial symmetry of the proposed periodic bi directionally stiffened plates according to the lattice theory and energy band theory in solid state physics reported by birkhoff 1940 and papaconstantopoulos 1986 the lattice vectors r n 1 a 1 n 2 a 2 where n 1 and n 2 are integers a 1 and a 2 are coplanar vertical vectors the shell is described by its thickness and the material properties the thickness of periodic stiffened plate is defined as 2 mm the periodic stiffened plates are made of mild steel the young s modulus e is defined as 200 gpa the poisson s ratio ν is defined as 0 3 the mass density ρ is 7850 kg m3 and the damping effect is neglected in addition the element used for the shell application mode is defined as argyris shell proposed by argyris et al 1997 which is a simple but sophisticated 3 node shear deformable isotropic and composite flat shell element suitable for large scale linear and nonlinear engineering computations of thin and thick anisotropic plate and complex shell structures its stiffness matrix is based on 12 straining modes but essentially requires the computation of a sparse 9 by 9 matrix the transverse shear deformation is taken into account and the membrane and bending actions are uncoupled the membrane action is modeled by a constant strain triangle with true drilling rotations the bending action is modeled by the bending part of argyris shell element furthermore stress free boundary conditions are defined for free surfaces while periodic boundary conditions with the bloch theorem are applied at the boundaries as follows 3 u i x a y a u i x y e j k x a k y a i x y where x and y are the coordinate components of position vector k x and k y are the coordinate components of the bloch wave vector limited to the first brillouin zone in this analysis displacements are assumed to be time harmonic with an angular frequency ω a finite element discretization based on the typical cell in the standard generalized eigenvalue problem formulation 4 k ω 2 m u 0 where k and m are the assembled stiffness and mass matrices for the typical cell on the base of the direct spooles linear system solver the eigenfrequency analysis can be conducted taking into account the spatial translation symmetry and point group symmetry of the infinite periodic system only the bloch wave vector along the boundary of the irreducible brillouin zone as shown in fig 2 b needs to be considered the brillouin zone is defined by the reciprocal lattice vector g m 1 b 1 m 2 b 2 where m 1 and m 2 are integers for a 2d periodic structure in a square configuration the two base vectors are r 1 0 a and r 2 a 0 the corresponding reciprocal base vectors b 1 and b 2 can be expressed as b 1 2π a 0 and b 2 0 2π a the periodic constant a is the size of a typical unit cell with a given value of bloch wave vector a series of eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes can be obtained and the band structures of the proposed periodic stiffened plates can be obtained by repeating the eigenfrequency analysis for the calculation of the transmission spectrum of periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plates the finite array system composed of 8 unit cells along the length direction and 4 unit cells along the breadth direction is considered as shown in fig 2 c the acceleration excitation resource is defined as sine sweep excitation ranging from 0 to 2000 hz with frequency interval 2 hz the vibration direction of the acceleration excitation resource is along z direction and manifests as flexural vibration while the propagation direction of the flexural wave is along x direction the arrows of acceleration excitation resource in fig 2 c represent the vibration direction of the flexural wave the plane wave acceleration sine excitation source with single frequency incidents from the left side of the finite array propagate along the x direction the transmitted acceleration value is detected and recorded on the right side of the structure the transmission spectra are defined as the ratio of the transmitted power through the eight layered finite system to the incident power by varying the excitation frequency of the incident waves the transmission spectra can be obtained 3 results and discussions 3 1 the band gaps of periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate fig 3 a shows the calculated band structure of the proposed infinite periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate by using the unit cell based on the finite element method the left vertical axis is the wave frequency and the right vertical axis is the normalized frequency fa c t where f is the wave frequency and c t is the transversal wave speed of mild steel which is equal to 3140 m s the horizontal axis represents the reduced wave vector along the boundary of the irreducible brillouin zone since the radiated noise from ship and offshore structures is mainly attributed to the flexural vibration of plate structures the flexural wave propagation characteristics and vibration band gaps are our primary targets we can find that there exist five bands in the frequency range from 0 to 2000 hz including the traditional plate modes such as shear wave mode symmetric and antisymmetric lamb wave modes besides one complete flexural wave band gap 710 960 hz in cyan region as shown in fig 3 a and two directional flexural wave band gaps 960 1025 hz and 1510 1680 hz respectively in pink regions as shown fig 3 a along γx direction of the irreducible brillouin zone occur in the band structure actually the unit cell with periodic boundary is an ideal model which is applied to analyze the band gap characteristics whereas the actual structures which are used in objective world are finite structures in an attempt to validate the band structure of the infinite periodic stiffened plate and study the vibration attenuation performance in the frequency range of band gaps the transmission power spectrum of 4 8 unit cells periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate is carried out as shown in fig 3 b one can observe that there are two obvious attenuation zones in the frequency range from 0 to 2000 hz the location and width of the attenuation zones in the transmission power spectrum is consistent with the flexural wave band gaps in the dispersion relation it can be concluded that the flexural vibration wave propagation within specific frequency range is forbidden and dramatic flexural vibration wave attenuation could appear in the periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate resulting in the significant suppression of structural vibration in addition it can be also found that in other bands the periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate enhances the spectrum i e transmission 0 db this issue can be explained that we calculate the frequency response of the periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plates rather than the transmission spectrum and perfectly matched layers pmls are not applied at the two ends of the finite plate in the x direction to prevent the reflections in order to intuitively elaborate the formation mechanism of the flexural wave band gaps in the periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate the total displacement fields of the unit cell in the specific wave vectors marked in fig 3 a are conducted fig 4 a c respectively illustrate the lower and upper edge eigenmodes of the complete flexural wave band gap as well as the upper edge eigenmodes of the first directional flexural wave band gap it can be observed that the eigenmodes a and c are mainly embodied as the flexural wave propagation along x direction and flexural vibration of the four corners in the plate and the bi directionally orthogonal stiffeners remain stationary whereas the eigenmodes b is mainly attributed to the coupling between the flexural vibration of the plate and the torsional vibration of the bi directionally orthogonal stiffeners the eigenmodes d and f corresponding to the lower and upper edge of the second directional flexural wave band gap mainly manifest as the symmetric and antisymmetric flexural wave at the edge of plate along x direction although eigenmodes e is located between eigenmodes d and f the eigenmodes e is mainly embodied as the flexural wave at the edge of plate along y direction which has no effect on the second directional flexural wave band gap along x direction with the introduction of bi directionally orthogonal stiffeners the flexural wave and vibration energy is confined in the four corners of the plate owing to the scattering effect of the bi directionally orthogonal stiffeners in addition in order to intuitively illustrate the suppression effect of the band gaps on the flexural wave vibration propagation the wave propagation characteristics and the flexural vibration responses at specific frequencies for the finite periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate are calculated as shown in fig 4 g and h one can observe that the flexural wave vibration at 200 hz which corresponds to the specific frequency outside the band gap can successfully propagate along the finite periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate without significant attenuation on the contrary the flexural wave vibration at 970 hz which corresponds to the specific frequency inside the band gap can hardly propagate along the finite periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate which means that the periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate has a significant attenuation effect on the flexural wave vibration propagation 3 2 experimental validation to further demonstrate the existence of the flexural wave vibration band gaps in the periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate the flexural vibration transmission measuring experiments of the finite array system composed of 8 unit cells along the length direction and 4 unit cells along the breadth direction were conducted the manufactured structural model is shown in fig 5 a the plate and the stiffeners were cut out from the mild steel plate by laser cutting to guarantee the machining accuracy afterwards the plate and the stiffeners were connected by using superglue to guarantee the assembly accuracy and reduce initial deformation finally the geometrical parameters of the manufactured model were determined as follows the overall dimensions are 960 mm 480 mm the lattice constant is 120 mm and the stiffener height is 20 mm however it can be found from fig 5 a that the thickness of the manufactured stiffened plate is 2 4 mm which is different from that of the numerical model because of the limitation of the raw material in the flexural vibration transmission measuring tests the manufactured structural model was free hanging by using soft ropes to achieve the free vibration property m p test system with a power amplifier and vibration exciter as well as two acceleration transducers was employed the vibration exciter was utilized to perpendicularly stimulate the manufactured stiffened plate near one side the experimental measurement implementation and the test setup are shown in fig 5 b and c then the experimental measurements of the flexural wave attenuation and vibration suppression in the proposed stiffened plate were conducted a white noise random signal with bandwidth from 0 to 3000 hz generated by m p test system was applied to drive the exciter two b k accelerometers were placed at two ends of the plate respectively the one near the excitation point was used to detect the incident vibration wave signal while the other one was used to probe the transmitted vibration wave signal smart office software was applied to record experimental data and to obtain the experimental result of the transmission power spectrum in the blue curve on the basis of spectral analysis and signal processing as shown in fig 6 meanwhile we perform the numerical calculation of the transmission spectrum for the manufactured periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate with a 0 120 mm e 0 2 4 mm h 0 20 mm and b 0 2 4 mm in the red curve as shown in fig 6 one can observe from fig 6 that there are two significant vibration attenuation zones in the transmission spectrum by experimental test which is in good agreement with numerical calculation result the disagreement of the transmission value at high frequency between numerical simulation and experimental result is mainly attributed to the neglect of the superglue between the plate and the stiffeners as well as the material damping effects the effect of damping on the transmission spectrum is performed as shown in fig 6 three different damping loss factors η are considered it can be found that with the introduction of material damping significant attenuation of the transmission spectra at high frequency occur and the numerical results of the transmission spectra are consistent with the experimental result furthermore the band structure for the manufactured periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate with a 0 120 mm e 0 2 4 mm h 0 20 mm and b 0 2 4 mm is calculated as shown in fig 7 it can be observed that two flexural wave vibration band gaps 835 1198 hz and 1575 2008 hz respectively in pink regions along γx direction of the irreducible brillouin zone exist in the band structure of the manufactured structural model similarly the location and width of the attenuation zones in the transmission spectra is consistent with the flexural wave band gaps in the dispersion relation 3 3 parametric study 3 3 1 effect of lattice constant on the band gaps to investigate the effect of lattice constant on the flexural wave vibration band gaps the dispersion relations of the periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plates with different lattice constant values are performed during the calculation the material parameters of the stiffened plates and the geometrical parameters such as the plate thickness and stiffener thickness remain unchanged dimensionless lattice constant a dim a a 0 is defined to achieve dimensionless parameter study the gap maps of the proposed periodic stiffened plates as a function of the factor of dimensionless lattice constant is illustrated in fig 8 one can observe that the dimensionless lattice constant has significant influence on the band gaps with the increase of the dimensionless lattice constant from 0 5 to 3 0 the lower and upper edges of the band gaps shift to low frequency range this can be explained that the formation mechanism of the band gaps is mainly caused by the bragg scattering of periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffeners on the flexural wave in the plate according to the bragg scattering theory the wave lengths corresponding to the mid frequency of the band gaps in periodic structures is approximately two times of the lattice constant consequently the low frequency vibration control in ship and offshore structures can be effectively achieved by tuning the dimensionless lattice constant of the stiffened plates 3 3 2 effect of plate thickness on the band gaps keep the material parameters of the stiffened plates and the geometrical parameters such as the lattice constant and the thickness and height of stiffener the effect of plate thickness on the flexural wave vibration band gaps of the periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plates are conducted dimensionless plate thickness e dim e a 0 is defined to achieve dimensionless parameter study the gap maps of the proposed periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plates as a function of the factor of dimensionless plate thickness is obtained as shown in fig 9 it can be found that as the increase of the dimensionless plate thickness the lower and upper edges of the flexural vibration band gaps move up to high frequency region the bandwidth of the first band gap increases first and then remains at a certain level whereas the bandwidth of the second band gap enlarges continually this phenomenon is due to that the band gaps are resulted from the coupling effect between the flexural wave vibration of the plate and the bragg scattering of the bi directionally orthogonal stiffeners with the increase of the dimensionless plate thickness the bending stiffness of the stiffened plate enhances resulting in the increase of the eigenfrequencies 3 3 3 effect of stiffener thickness on the band gaps in order to investigate the effect of stiffener thickness on the flexural wave vibration band gaps the gap maps of the proposed periodic stiffened plates as a function of the factor of dimensionless stiffener thickness b dim is carried out as shown in fig 10 the dimensionless stiffener thickness b dim is defined as b a 0 it can be observed that as the dimensionless stiffener thickness increases the lower edge of the first and second band gaps goes up gradually and the upper edge of the band gap almost remains unchanged this phenomenon is due to that the eigenmodes of the band edges are embodied as the flexural vibration of the stiffened plate as the increase of the dimensionless stiffener thickness the bending stiffness of the stiffened plate enhances resulting in the increase of the eigenfrequencies 4 concluding remarks in this paper the flexural wave propagation and vibration suppression characteristics in periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plates are studied a standard finite element method in combination with bloch periodic boundary conditions is applied to solve the elastic wave equation and calculate the dispersion relations and the transmission spectra experimental measurement of the flexural vibration transmission spectrum for a finite periodic stiffened plate was conducted to validate the numerical calculation method results show that there exist complete and directional flexural wave band gaps of periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plates the flexural vibration wave propagation within specific frequency range is forbidden and dramatic flexural vibration wave attenuation could appear in the periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate resulting in the significant

by the reciprocal lattice vector g m 1 b 1 m 2 b 2 where m 1 and m 2 are integers for a 2d periodic structure in a square configuration the two base vectors are r 1 0 a and r 2 a 0 the corresponding reciprocal base vectors b 1 and b 2 can be expressed as b 1 2π a 0 and b 2 0 2π a the periodic constant a is the size of a typical unit cell with a given value of bloch wave vector a series of eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes can be obtained and the band structures of the proposed periodic stiffened plates can be obtained by repeating the eigenfrequency analysis for the calculation of the transmission spectrum of periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plates the finite array system composed of 8 unit cells along the length direction and 4 unit cells along the breadth direction is considered as shown in fig 2 c the acceleration excitation resource is defined as sine sweep excitation ranging from 0 to 2000 hz with frequency interval 2 hz the vibration direction of the acceleration excitation resource is along z direction and manifests as flexural vibration while the propagation direction of the flexural wave is along x direction the arrows of acceleration excitation resource in fig 2 c represent the vibration direction of the flexural wave the plane wave acceleration sine excitation source with single frequency incidents from the left side of the finite array propagate along the x direction the transmitted acceleration value is detected and recorded on the right side of the structure the transmission spectra are defined as the ratio of the transmitted power through the eight layered finite system to the incident power by varying the excitation frequency of the incident waves the transmission spectra can be obtained 3 results and discussions 3 1 the band gaps of periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate fig 3 a shows the calculated band structure of the proposed infinite periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate by using the unit cell based on the finite element method the left vertical axis is the wave frequency and the right vertical axis is the normalized frequency fa c t where f is the wave frequency and c t is the transversal wave speed of mild steel which is equal to 3140 m s the horizontal axis represents the reduced wave vector along the boundary of the irreducible brillouin zone since the radiated noise from ship and offshore structures is mainly attributed to the flexural vibration of plate structures the flexural wave propagation characteristics and vibration band gaps are our primary targets we can find that there exist five bands in the frequency range from 0 to 2000 hz including the traditional plate modes such as shear wave mode symmetric and antisymmetric lamb wave modes besides one complete flexural wave band gap 710 960 hz in cyan region as shown in fig 3 a and two directional flexural wave band gaps 960 1025 hz and 1510 1680 hz respectively in pink regions as shown fig 3 a along γx direction of the irreducible brillouin zone occur in the band structure actually the unit cell with periodic boundary is an ideal model which is applied to analyze the band gap characteristics whereas the actual structures which are used in objective world are finite structures in an attempt to validate the band structure of the infinite periodic stiffened plate and study the vibration attenuation performance in the frequency range of band gaps the transmission power spectrum of 4 8 unit cells periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate is carried out as shown in fig 3 b one can observe that there are two obvious attenuation zones in the frequency range from 0 to 2000 hz the location and width of the attenuation zones in the transmission power spectrum is consistent with the flexural wave band gaps in the dispersion relation it can be concluded that the flexural vibration wave propagation within specific frequency range is forbidden and dramatic flexural vibration wave attenuation could appear in the periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate resulting in the significant suppression of structural vibration in addition it can be also found that in other bands the periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate enhances the spectrum i e transmission 0 db this issue can be explained that we calculate the frequency response of the periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plates rather than the transmission spectrum and perfectly matched layers pmls are not applied at the two ends of the finite plate in the x direction to prevent the reflections in order to intuitively elaborate the formation mechanism of the flexural wave band gaps in the periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate the total displacement fields of the unit cell in the specific wave vectors marked in fig 3 a are conducted fig 4 a c respectively illustrate the lower and upper edge eigenmodes of the complete flexural wave band gap as well as the upper edge eigenmodes of the first directional flexural wave band gap it can be observed that the eigenmodes a and c are mainly embodied as the flexural wave propagation along x direction and flexural vibration of the four corners in the plate and the bi directionally orthogonal stiffeners remain stationary whereas the eigenmodes b is mainly attributed to the coupling between the flexural vibration of the plate and the torsional vibration of the bi directionally orthogonal stiffeners the eigenmodes d and f corresponding to the lower and upper edge of the second directional flexural wave band gap mainly manifest as the symmetric and antisymmetric flexural wave at the edge of plate along x direction although eigenmodes e is located between eigenmodes d and f the eigenmodes e is mainly embodied as the flexural wave at the edge of plate along y direction which has no effect on the second directional flexural wave band gap along x direction with the introduction of bi directionally orthogonal stiffeners the flexural wave and vibration energy is confined in the four corners of the plate owing to the scattering effect of the bi directionally orthogonal stiffeners in addition in order to intuitively illustrate the suppression effect of the band gaps on the flexural wave vibration propagation the wave propagation characteristics and the flexural vibration responses at specific frequencies for the finite periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate are calculated as shown in fig 4 g and h one can observe that the flexural wave vibration at 200 hz which corresponds to the specific frequency outside the band gap can successfully propagate along the finite periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate without significant attenuation on the contrary the flexural wave vibration at 970 hz which corresponds to the specific frequency inside the band gap can hardly propagate along the finite periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate which means that the periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate has a significant attenuation effect on the flexural wave vibration propagation 3 2 experimental validation to further demonstrate the existence of the flexural wave vibration band gaps in the periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate the flexural vibration transmission measuring experiments of the finite array system composed of 8 unit cells along the length direction and 4 unit cells along the breadth direction were conducted the manufactured structural model is shown in fig 5 a the plate and the stiffeners were cut out from the mild steel plate by laser cutting to guarantee the machining accuracy afterwards the plate and the stiffeners were connected by using superglue to guarantee the assembly accuracy and reduce initial deformation finally the geometrical parameters of the manufactured model were determined as follows the overall dimensions are 960 mm 480 mm the lattice constant is 120 mm and the stiffener height is 20 mm however it can be found from fig 5 a that the thickness of the manufactured stiffened plate is 2 4 mm which is different from that of the numerical model because of the limitation of the raw material in the flexural vibration transmission measuring tests the manufactured structural model was free hanging by using soft ropes to achieve the free vibration property m p test system with a power amplifier and vibration exciter as well as two acceleration transducers was employed the vibration exciter was utilized to perpendicularly stimulate the manufactured stiffened plate near one side the experimental measurement implementation and the test setup are shown in fig 5 b and c then the experimental measurements of the flexural wave attenuation and vibration suppression in the proposed stiffened plate were conducted a white noise random signal with bandwidth from 0 to 3000 hz generated by m p test system was applied to drive the exciter two b k accelerometers were placed at two ends of the plate respectively the one near the excitation point was used to detect the incident vibration wave signal while the other one was used to probe the transmitted vibration wave signal smart office software was applied to record experimental data and to obtain the experimental result of the transmission power spectrum in the blue curve on the basis of spectral analysis and signal processing as shown in fig 6 meanwhile we perform the numerical calculation of the transmission spectrum for the manufactured periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate with a 0 120 mm e 0 2 4 mm h 0 20 mm and b 0 2 4 mm in the red curve as shown in fig 6 one can observe from fig 6 that there are two significant vibration attenuation zones in the transmission spectrum by experimental test which is in good agreement with numerical calculation result the disagreement of the transmission value at high frequency between numerical simulation and experimental result is mainly attributed to the neglect of the superglue between the plate and the stiffeners as well as the material damping effects the effect of damping on the transmission spectrum is performed as shown in fig 6 three different damping loss factors η are considered it can be found that with the introduction of material damping significant attenuation of the transmission spectra at high frequency occur and the numerical results of the transmission spectra are consistent with the experimental result furthermore the band structure for the manufactured periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate with a 0 120 mm e 0 2 4 mm h 0 20 mm and b 0 2 4 mm is calculated as shown in fig 7 it can be observed that two flexural wave vibration band gaps 835 1198 hz and 1575 2008 hz respectively in pink regions along γx direction of the irreducible brillouin zone exist in the band structure of the manufactured structural model similarly the location and width of the attenuation zones in the transmission spectra is consistent with the flexural wave band gaps in the dispersion relation 3 3 parametric study 3 3 1 effect of lattice constant on the band gaps to investigate the effect of lattice constant on the flexural wave vibration band gaps the dispersion relations of the periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plates with different lattice constant values are performed during the calculation the material parameters of the stiffened plates and the geometrical parameters such as the plate thickness and stiffener thickness remain unchanged dimensionless lattice constant a dim a a 0 is defined to achieve dimensionless parameter study the gap maps of the proposed periodic stiffened plates as a function of the factor of dimensionless lattice constant is illustrated in fig 8 one can observe that the dimensionless lattice constant has significant influence on the band gaps with the increase of the dimensionless lattice constant from 0 5 to 3 0 the lower and upper edges of the band gaps shift to low frequency range this can be explained that the formation mechanism of the band gaps is mainly caused by the bragg scattering of periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffeners on the flexural wave in the plate according to the bragg scattering theory the wave lengths corresponding to the mid frequency of the band gaps in periodic structures is approximately two times of the lattice constant consequently the low frequency vibration control in ship and offshore structures can be effectively achieved by tuning the dimensionless lattice constant of the stiffened plates 3 3 2 effect of plate thickness on the band gaps keep the material parameters of the stiffened plates and the geometrical parameters such as the lattice constant and the thickness and height of stiffener the effect of plate thickness on the flexural wave vibration band gaps of the periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plates are conducted dimensionless plate thickness e dim e a 0 is defined to achieve dimensionless parameter study the gap maps of the proposed periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plates as a function of the factor of dimensionless plate thickness is obtained as shown in fig 9 it can be found that as the increase of the dimensionless plate thickness the lower and upper edges of the flexural vibration band gaps move up to high frequency region the bandwidth of the first band gap increases first and then remains at a certain level whereas the bandwidth of the second band gap enlarges continually this phenomenon is due to that the band gaps are resulted from the coupling effect between the flexural wave vibration of the plate and the bragg scattering of the bi directionally orthogonal stiffeners with the increase of the dimensionless plate thickness the bending stiffness of the stiffened plate enhances resulting in the increase of the eigenfrequencies 3 3 3 effect of stiffener thickness on the band gaps in order to investigate the effect of stiffener thickness on the flexural wave vibration band gaps the gap maps of the proposed periodic stiffened plates as a function of the factor of dimensionless stiffener thickness b dim is carried out as shown in fig 10 the dimensionless stiffener thickness b dim is defined as b a 0 it can be observed that as the dimensionless stiffener thickness increases the lower edge of the first and second band gaps goes up gradually and the upper edge of the band gap almost remains unchanged this phenomenon is due to that the eigenmodes of the band edges are embodied as the flexural vibration of the stiffened plate as the increase of the dimensionless stiffener thickness the bending stiffness of the stiffened plate enhances resulting in the increase of the eigenfrequencies 4 concluding remarks in this paper the flexural wave propagation and vibration suppression characteristics in periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plates are studied a standard finite element method in combination with bloch periodic boundary conditions is applied to solve the elastic wave equation and calculate the dispersion relations and the transmission spectra experimental measurement of the flexural vibration transmission spectrum for a finite periodic stiffened plate was conducted to validate the numerical calculation method results show that there exist complete and directional flexural wave band gaps of periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plates the flexural vibration wave propagation within specific frequency range is forbidden and dramatic flexural vibration wave attenuation could appear in the periodic bi directionally orthogonal stiffened plate resulting in the significant suppression of structural vibration furthermore the flexural wave vibration band gaps can be artificially modulated and optimized by tuning the geometrical parameters acknowledgements the authors

regulation of energy efficiency design index by international maritime organization international maritime organization 2011 recent merchant ships have strictly been required to achieve certain rate of energy saving in hydrodynamic point of view one of the solutions is to equip energy saving devices esds in the vicinity of ships stern fig 1 describes the schematic zones to place esds according to carlton 2012 carlton 2007 devices placed in zone i is so called pre swirl type most of the devices placed in zone ii especially right behind the propeller as well as the devices placed in zone iii are categorized as post swirl type pre swirl type devices modify the flow upstream of the propeller so that it yields better propeller hull interaction and or improves inflow velocity to the propeller to achieve energy saving post swirl type devices recover the rotational energy mostly originated from the propeller during design exploration of such esds by experiment and or computation it is rather inefficient to find best match between esds and a hull via brute force or ad hoc searching the first priority at their early design stage is to clarify the working principle of each esds together with a hull and a propeller to achieve this complementary use of experiment and numerical simulation represented by viscous computational fluid dynamics cfd is desirable viscous cfd validated with available experimental data will provide detail and useful information in both integral and local variables which contributes to understand working principle of esds several candidate geometries of esds designed throughout viscous cfd simulations will be subjected to model experiment to make final decision for esds to be equipped on an actual ship viscous cfd simulation in full scale is sometimes helpful to make corrections for design parameters of esds determined by model scale investigation inukai et al 2011 recent european union project grip carried out extensive studies of pre swirl stator fins pssf ducts placed upstream of the propeller rudder bulb and fins on propeller boss cap to investigate their working principle among these devices the pssf was likely to be most promising according to their preliminary studies it was designed and retrofitted on the bulk carrier bc which yielded more than 6 of energy saving effect according to the sea trial streckwall and yan 2017 sophie and marcos 2017 schuiling and van terwisga 2017 this project is one of the most successful examples of design exploration in esds throughout the complementary use of viscous cfd and model full scale experiments other than grip project several studies can be found in investigating designs and functions of pre and post swirl type esds by viscous cfd simulations mewis and guiard 2011 mewis and guiard 2011 made use of viscous cfd simulation to design mewis duct for very large crude carriers vlcc and bcs hydrodynamic forces acting on the duct were evaluated by viscous cfd in order to evaluate its effect of increasing hull resistance in the meantime nominal and total wake in the stern vicinity were utilized to determine the design parameters of the duct and its fins kim et al 2013 kim et al 2013 optimized the geometry of pre swirl stator pss for aframax product carrier by viscous cfd and towing tank experiments the computational results of energy saving rate among different pss configuration agreed quite well with the experimental data which indicates that the cfd is capable of designing and even ranking the most energy efficient pss configuration lee et al 2014 lee et al 2014 made use of viscous cfd to design energy recovering turbine behind a propeller they visualized the local flow behind the turbine blades by viscous cfd to confirm whether the turbine generated counter rotating flow relative to the rotational flow originated from a propeller sakamoto et al 2014 sakamoto et al 2014a and park et al 2015 park et al 2015 carried out viscous cfd simulations of bc with energy saving duct and vlcc with pss respectively in full scale to investigate the scale effect of esds to the local flow the former revealed that the duct design based on the flow field of full scale could be quite different to that of model scale since the angle of inflow to the duct showed opposite sign between model and full scale the latter proposed modification formula of scaling up effective wake fraction originally suggested by international towing tank conference ittc the specialist committee 1999 international towing tank conference 2011 based on their full scale viscous cfd results hai long et al 2016 hai long et al 2016 quantified energy saving rate of rudder bulb with fins in model and full scale by viscous cfd yet the working principle of the esds could still be physically investigated further based on their computational results kawamura et al 2012 kawamura et al 2012 and mizzi et al 2017 mizzi et al 2017 carried out viscous cfd simulations for propeller boss cap fins pbcf the former investigated the scale effect of pbcf equipped on propellers for pure car carrier pcc and bc by decomposing pressure and frictional component of thrust and torque acting on a propeller boss propeller blades and pbcf respectively the latter optimized the geometry of pbcf equipped on benchmark propeller geometry although the experimental validation was not shown optimized pbcf increases propeller open water efficiency by 1 3 than that of without pbcf although these investigations present the promising feature of viscous cfd simulation to evaluate hydrodynamic performance of esds it is still rare to demonstrate comprehensiveness of the numerical method that is each study have focused on one esd equipped on one ship to demonstrate the comprehensive validity of viscous cfd in evaluating hydrodynamic performance of esds as well as in understanding their working principle the present study analyzes three different type of hull forms e g bc container ship and coastal tanker with three different esds e g duct in front of the propeller twisted rudder with bulb and pre swirl stator fins using the same computational method with the same pre and post processes standard procedures of model testing e g propeller open water test resistance and self propulsion tests as well as local flow measurements are totally replaced by the viscous cfd simulations termed numerical towing tank procedure although the importance of scale effects in esds are apparent and the theme to be overcome most of the present study still focuses on simulations in model scale since the rigorous validation of local flow is one of the aims two criteria e g standard self propulsion analysis and kinetic energy analysis of local flow are adopted to study the effect of the esds to the propulsion performance of the hulls according to one of the lessons learnt from grip project streckwall and yan 2017 sophie and marcos 2017 schuiling and van terwisga 2017 the present computational method successfully quantifies the effect of the esds to propulsion parameters for all the configurations working principles of these esds are investigated throughout detail analysis of the computational and experimental results in the meantime design modifications and key design parameters in some of the esds are proposed following this introduction

computational results are obtained using general purpose commercial cfd package star ccm ver11 04 double precision version cd adapco 2016 the governing equations are the continuity and unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations in dimensional forms and are solved by finite volume method among several turbulence models on the solver k omega shear stress transport model without wall

water simulations moving reference frame mrf approach is adopted for mrf approach computational domain is separated into mrf region and the outside of mrf region the governing equations solved inside the mrf region take the effect of centrifugal and coriolis force due to angular velocity into consideration as body force terms in momentum equations while they are not in the outside of mrf region the fluxes between mrf region and the outside region is weakly exchanged through cell faces with appropriate coordinate transformations in the present study the mrf region is rotator and the outside region is stator which will be explained in the next section for unsteady self propulsion simulations dynamic overset grid is adopted which will also be described in the next section as the two phase

message passing interface and ran in distributed memory type machine with typically 72 80 cpus 2 2 dynamic overset grid in the present study dynamic overset grid approach is adopted to simulate discretized rotating propeller behind the hull fig 2 a b and 2c present the example of overset grid assembly utilized for the present computation the computational domain is divided into two regions e g a stator and a rotator the stator region includes a ship hull equipped with esds and a rudder at stern the rotator region includes a propeller boss propeller blades and a boss cap the stator and rotator are assembled as shown in fig 2a as an overset assemble process cells in each region are flagged as 1 donor 2 receptor 3 active and 4 inactive hole cutting is also one of the important processes in overset grid assembly during the process the rotator cells inside the esds and the stator cells inside the propeller are all blanked out fig 2b and c shows the flags which show the status of overset cells in stator and rotator respectively the cells colored by light green are active cells where governing equations are solved the cells colored by red are inactive cells where governing equations are not solved the cells colored by blue are donor or receptor the donor cells around the receptor are searched using linear scheme with shape function of spanning tetrahedron cd adapco 2016 which means that one receptor has 4 donor stencils the donor cells in stator provide flux variables to receptor cells in rotator and vice versa the flux variables φ are interpolated from donor cells to receptor cells as 1 ϕ r e c e p t o r i α i ϕ i d o n o r where i is the cell id and αi is the interpolation coefficients for flux variables of donor cell i for unsteady simulations receptor donor

from both experiment and computation an energy saving duct categorized as pre swirl esd is equipped on jbc duisburg test case dtc is the 14 000teu post panamax container ship designed by the institute of ship technology ocean engineering and transport systems in the university of duisburg essen el moctar et al 2012 dtc has also widely utilized as one of the benchmark geometries see for instance shopera project papanikolaou et al 2016 twisted rudder with costa bulb categorized as post swirl esds termed twist rud bulb hereafter are equipped on dtc in the present study the rudder without twist

simulations with esds these grids are generated utilizing the same meshing parameters e g target cell sizes stretching ratio thickness of the prism layer and so on the stator grid is common among pot simulation and self propulsion simulation most of the computational domain are discretized using hexahedra cells while prism cells are generated in the region where hexahedra cells cannot be prepared due to geometrical constraint nondimensional viscous length y is close to 1 on wall boundaries in order to meet the requirement for the present turbulence model 3 3 flow condition table 3 summarizes

jbc and cot are set according to the experimental condition for each case for dtc the experimental value of np in pot is not listed in the reference el moctar et al 2012 therefore it is assumed as 35 0 rps to achieve rnk 6 0e 05 to minimize the effect of the transition of boundary layer according to the recommendation by the ittc international towing tank conference 2008 the rn for resistance self propulsion simulations for all the cases are the same as their experimental conditions for jbc the fn is non zero for both resistance and self propulsion simulations while it is zero for self propulsion simulations for dtc and cot to save computational expense the effect of wave making resistance to the propeller load for these two cases is considered by modifying the towing force

is the towing force measured at self propulsion configuration attention should be paid on the treatment of rs p specifically for dtc and cot as mentioned in section 3 3 self propulsion simulations for dtc and cot are carried out without free surface which means that the component of wave making resistance is missing in rs p in such cases following assumption is made as 5 r s p r s p d m r w where rs p dm n is the total resistance acting on the hull rudder and esds at self propulsion condition without free surface and rw n is the wave making resistance evaluated by resistance configuration with free surface substitution of eq 5 into eq 4 yields 6 r s p d m t s p f d r w equation 6 is utilized to achieve self propulsion point in dtc and cot all the fd and rw values for the present study are

present study focused on the axial and transverse kinetic energy fluxes although the rest of three components should have been quantified and analyzed in terms of scientific completeness nondimensional forms dang et al 2012 of axial and transverse kinetic energy flux are defined on a cs located inside the computational domain as 11 k t o t k a x k t r 12 k a x 1 s ω u x u 0 1 u x u 0 2 d s 13 k t r 1 s ω u x u 0 u θ u 0 2 u r u 0 2 d s where ktot kax and ktr are the total axial and transverse tangential plus radial kinetic energy flux respectively sω m2 is the area of the cs ux m s uθ m s and ur m s are axial tangential and radial component of local velocity respectively defined on the cs fig 8 describes the location of the cs for three cases it is at x lpp 0 993 cs1 for jbc x lpp 0 989 cs1 and 1 021 cs2 for dtc x lpp 0 971 cs1 and 0 985 cs2 for cot respectively when kax and ktr are both zero on cs1 for jbc the propeller perfectly recovers the kinetic energy flux produced by the hull and duct when kax and ktr are smaller on cs2 than those on cs1 for dtc the twist rud bulb recovers the kinetic energy flux produced by the hull and propeller when kax and ktr are smaller on cs2 than those on cs1 for cot the propeller recovers the kinetic energy flux produced by the hull and pssf the cs is circular disk which has diameter of 2dp for jbc and dtc while it is dp for cot due to the presence of the shoe piece three dimensional vortical structure is visualized by the 2nd invariant of the rate of velocity gradient tensor q 1 s2 hunt et al 1988 the rate of strain tensor s and the vorticity tensor ω are defined as 14 s 1 2 u u t ω 1 2 u u t then the q is defined as 15 q 1 2 ω 2 s 2 if q is positive the euclidean norm of vorticity tensor dominates the rate of strain which evidences the rotation of the flow specifically for cot the flow direction α is evaluated at x lpp 0 964 right in front of the leading edge of pssf since the setting angle of the fins are determined according to α it is defined by 16 α tan 1 u θ u x 4 results 4 1 fundamental validation for jbc dtc and cot 4 1 1 poc fig 9 a b and 9c summarize the experimental and the computational results of poc for jbc dtc and cot respectively for jbc the computational results generally agree well with the experimental results yet the simulation tends to underestimate kt by 4 5 exp kq by 2 exp and ηo by 2 5 exp at propeller working point j 0 4 these are the possible sources of errors in j va 1 wtm ηo and ηr from the point of poc when the thrust identity method utilizes the computational results of this poc to estimate self propulsion coefficients from cfd simulations computations with fine grid 9m cells for which its number of cells is twice as large as that of the present grid 4m cells have been tested yet they do not improve pocs therefore the present underestimation is not likely due to grid dependency it is conjectured that laminar turbulent transition model may contribute to resolve this problem according to kawamura and omori 2009 kawamura and omori 2009 and krasilnikov 2016 krasilnikov 2016 at low j region circumferential velocity to the leading edge of the propeller blade is small and thus the boundary layer at the location may be laminar in the experiment as long as no leading edge roughness is considered resolving laminar boundary layer will result in the decrease of frictional resistance in consequence the kt will be increased in comparison to the kt with fully developed turbulent boundary layer for dtc the computational results show excellent agreement to the experimental data up until j 0 7 the differences between the experiment and the computation are approximately 1 3 exp in kt 0 1 exp in 10kq and 1 3 exp in ηo respectively since the computational results are obtained without any transition modeling the experiment was likely to be carried out with enough turbulent stimulation at the leading edge of the propeller blades and or the inflow may contain free stream turbulence intensity which is strong enough to enhance the onset of transition of boundary layer from laminar to turbulent on the propeller blades the estimated poc is unlikely to yield error in j va and resultant 1 wtm since the working point of this propeller is around 0 6 j 0 62 for cot the working point of the propeller lies on 0 4 j 0 5 according to the experiment among this range the differences between the experiment and the computation are approximately 2 exp in kt 1 exp in kq and 2 exp in ηo respectively these differences are in practice allowable and thus the simulated poc can be utilized for cfd self propulsion analysis similar to the propeller for jbc these differences may be improved by introducing transition modeling in turbulence 4 1 2 resistance and self propulsion coefficients experimental and computational results for resistance quantities under towed condition are summarized in table 5 and fig 10 jbc fig 12 dtc and table 6 cot respectively for jbc present simulation estimates ctm very well within 2 of difference relative to the experiment the presence of the duct does not provide adverse impact on ctm at towed condition since the drag force acting on the duct and strut is only 1 3 of total resistance fig 10 describes the cross comparison in the comparison error of ctm for jbc without with duct in resistance configuration over submission cases at cfd workshop tokyo 2015 national maritime research institute 2015 in terms of dependencies in grid and turbulence model although the solutions are from several different solvers please notice that the original version of fig 10 was prepared by the designated session chair the results of the present simulation are quite comparable to the other submission cases due to the limited computational expense systematic verification and validation v v are not carried out for the present study employing statistical n version v v proposed by stern et al 2017 stern et al 2017 may able to carry out uncertainty quantification throughout the data in fig 10 yet such investigation will be left as a future work for dtc ctm is well predicted within the difference of 1 5 relative to the experimental data up until fn 0 192 at 0 2 fn 0 209 present cfd simulation fails to capture hump and hollow originated from wave making resistance additional simulation with refined resolution near the free surface has been tested yet no improvement can be achieved the underprediction of ctm for dtc may not be due to lacking in free surface resolution rather it may arise from excluding the effect of dynamic sinkage and trim in the simulation as reported by shivachev et al 2017 shivachev et al 2017 with similar container ship and its ship speed the computational results of cfm constantly show lower values by 8 than those of estimated by ittc1957 friction line for which the reason has not yet been identified the rudder resistance coefficient relative to ctm is approximately 1 8 for both original and normal rudders which indicates that twist angle and bulb are harmless in resistance under towed condition for cot the computational result underestimates the 1 k by 9 which is similar to sakamoto et al 2014 sakamoto et al 2014b one possible reason for this is the difference in methodology to compute 1 k e g prohaska s method is utilized in the experiment while it is estimated by single run data at lowest rn in the present cfd simulation among several design candidates in pssf shown in fig 4 the increase in 1 k is at most 1 3 original according to the present computation equipment of the present pssf to cot does not increase resistance in towed condition table 7 shows the computational results of resistance coefficients of duct and strut in towed and self propulsion conditions for jbc table 8 summarizes the experimental and computational results of self propulsion coefficients and other propulsion parameters for jbc due to propeller duct interaction resistance acting on the duct for which its 90 is due to pressure becomes twice as that of towed condition the drag force acting on duct with propeller effect is approximately 2 8 of total resistance it indicates that the duct for jbc is relatively compatible design to the hull even with propeller interaction it is quite encouraging that the present computation perfectly captures the effect of the duct to the propulsion characteristics of jbc within the difference of 1 relative to the experiment although the comparison in raw data sometimes show differences more than 5 exp in 1 t 1 wtm ηd and va in 1 t most of the error comes from propeller thrust since the difference in rtm and t is 1 3 1 8 and 9 5 10 5 respectively relative to the experiment although the difference in np can be one reason to cause difference in t further diagnostics would be necessary in the computational accuracy of time history of blade pressure distribution for which such experimental data can be found for instance in ukon et al 1989 ukon et al 1989 in 1 wtm and va the error may arise from lack of accuracy in estimating nominal wake components e g uθ for w o duct and ux for with duct respectively as will be discussed in clause 4 2 1 in ηd the difference in 1 t 1 wtm ηr and ηo all affect to its computational accuracy e g small difference in each component yields large difference in the end fig 11 describes the cross comparison in the comparison error of kt kq and np for jbc without with duct in resistance configuration over submission cases at cfd workshop tokyo 2015 national maritime research institute 2015 in terms of grid dependency although the solutions are from several different solvers please notice that the original version of fig 11 was prepared by the designated session chair the results of the present simulation are quite comparable to the other submission cases as well as for fig 10 n version v v stern et al 2017 may quantify the statistical uncertainty throughout the data in fig 11 yet such investigation will be left as a future work instead table 9 summarizes solution change in ctm cfm cvp ctm cfm kt and kq under self propulsion configuration depending on grid density these data are extracted from one available submission case at cfd workshop tokyo 2015 national maritime research institute 2015 utilizing the same cfd solver as the present study to investigate the trend of grid convergence in table 9 the index hi h1 indicates the ratio of solutions from ith grid with respect to the solution from finest grid h1 it is difficult to conclude from the results shown in table 9 that the grid convergence was achieved e g kt and kq are likely to be converge while resistance quantities are not validation in terms of local flow and investigation in working principle of the esd will be made in section 4 2 fig 13 presents experimental and computational results of self propulsion coefficients and relevant efficiencies for dtc for twist rud bulb cases computational results agree quite well with the experiment within the difference of 2 exp with the exception in 1 t at fn 0 209 due to inaccurate estimation of wave making resistance at this ship speed for normal rudder cases all variables are almost identical to those of twist rud bulb cases which implies that the present post swirl esds are not effective enough to improve propulsive performance investigation of this physics will be made in section 4 3 fig 14 summarizes the validation results in self propulsion coefficients and nondimensional propeller rotation speed n np lpp u0 for cot the index bare describes the ship without pssf the values in vertical axis are shown as the ratio relative to bare due to non disclosure agreement between nmri and the collaborator the present simulation almost captures the deterioration of 1 t due to the presence of pssf the improvement of 1 wtm due to different configuration of pssf is perfectly simulated by the present cfd the reason of deterioration improvement in 1 t and 1 wtm will be investigated in section 4 4 agreement in ηr and n between the experiment and cfd is acceptable 4 2 analysis for jbc 4 2 1 local flow validation figs 15 and 16 compare the experimental and computational results of nominal wake distribution with cross flow vector on the propeller plane x lpp 0 9843 without and with the esd respectively the nondimensional nominal wake is decomposed into axial ux radial ur and tangential uθ components and they are plotted as a function of circumferential position θ for which it is zero at 12 o clock and increases clockwise observing from stern the ux u0 averaged over θ is plotted as a function of radial location r r in figs 15d and 16d specifically in fig 15 two computational results are presented the index baseline is the solution from the grid whose properties are shown in table 2 the index local ref c c is the additional solution for which two criteria are introduced in the resistance simulation aiming to improve the resolution of bilge vortex i e 1 isotropic local refinement edge length of a cell is 4 5e 04 m from x 6 0 m to aft perpendicular 0 5 m longer in fore direction in comparison to the baseline grid and 2 curvature correction for the present turbulence model arolla and durbin 2013 for w o duct the computational result with baseline grid shows overprediction in ux by 6 6 exp in average discrepancy between the experimental and the computational results in uθ is pronounced at r r 0 3 to 0 8 where the bilge vortices exist among all the components asymmetricity can be found inside the propeller plane although the solution reaches steady state in resistance the local flow in the stern vicinity is slightly unsteady due to flow separation from aft part of the hull and this might be the reason to cause such asymmetricity with both side configuration the computational results with local ref c c reduce the level of overprediction in ux by 4 4 exp in average for which the computational accuracy is improved specifically at r r 0 6 to 1 0 yet the treatment does not contribute to improve the discrepancy in uθ in consequence local ref c c successfully capture the flow separation from the bilge which contributes to reproduce axial momentum defect better than baseline grid individual applications of local refinement or curvature correction do not yield the result shown in fig 15 in other words these two should be utilized simultaneously it is conjectured that the addition of the present local refinement adequately computes the rotation and strain tensors so that the curvature correction factor properly controls the production of turbulent kinetic energy asymmetric axial wake does not appear to the solution from local ref c c grid since the computation is carried out with half side configuration for which y symmetric boundary condition is applied on the ship centerline although local ref c c works better than baseline in terms of ux prediction further computations in the present study still utilize baseline grid total number of cells for local ref c c is more than 9m for half side with double model configuration which is computationally expensive to carry out self propulsion simulations with rotating propeller and free surface for with duct quantitative comparison shown in fig 16 reveals local discrepancy in ux specifically at r r 0 6 and 0 7 among 90 d e g θ 270 d e g the computational results show much lower value than that of the experiment at r r 0 6 specifically at r r 0 7 ux is negative among the θ region in the computational result which means that the present simulation resolves pseudo reversed flow while no such phenomenon exists in the experiment in terms of cross flow components they are less apparent for with duct than w o duct because the duct intersects the bilge vortex which will be discusses in clause 4 2 2 computational results of ur and uθ generally agree well with the experimental data in summary the present simulation for jbc successfully captures the difference in nominal wake due to the presence of the duct in comparison to the experimental data yet there are still two issues to be improved 1 w o duct case is lacking in its computational accuracy in uθ which is originated from the resolution of cross flow due to bilge vortices and 2 with duct case is lacking in its computational accuracy in ux which is originated from the resolution of decelerated flow outside of the duct cowling these two discrepancies may affect to the computational accuracy of self propulsion coefficients discussed in clause 4 1 2 figs 17 20 present experimental and computational results of instantaneous total wake distribution at x lpp 0 9843 and 1 0 for jbc without with duct at θ 0deg respectively the θ describes the position of the key blade for which 0deg is identical to 12 o clock position and its rotation direction is clockwise positive observing from the face side of the propeller it is common among figs 17 20 that the present computation predicts decelerated accelerated region of all the flow components at two different cross sections very well relative to the experimental data compared to the results of nominal wake it is difficult to visualize the effect of the esd in u u0 since propeller induced velocity is added to the local flow which masks the difference for v u0 and w u0 at x lpp 1 0 they become slightly smaller for the case with duct than those of without duct for which the reason will be explained in clause 4 2 2 although the results are not presented the validations are carried out at θ 24deg and 48deg the agreement between the experimental and the computational results is quite similar to the results at θ 0deg 4 2 2 analysis of kinetic energy flux table 10 summarizes the computational analysis of kinetic energy flux for jbc without and with the esd fig 21 shows the computational results of three dimensional vortical structure for jbc w o with duct at self propulsion θ 0deg depicted by q 50 1 s2 iso surface according to figs 17 20 cross flow components for with duct become smaller compared to without duct and the vortical structure shown in fig 21 explains the reason for without duct the developed bilge vortex is transported downstream by the propeller suction and comes into cs1 for with duct the developed bilge vortex is fragmented by the duct and thus rotational flow at cs1 is more homogenized than that of without duct this is quantified in ktr that it is approximately 11 smaller for with duct than that of without duct change in kax is less than 1 between w o duct and with duct behind the propeller ktot for with duct is 5 smaller than that of w o duct due to decrease in ktr 4 2 3 effect of the duct to the propeller fig 22 summarizes the effect of duct to the propeller in terms of dimensional thrust torque and blade efficiency acting on total blades and a key blade respectively according to schuiling and van terwisga 2017 schuiling and van terwisga 2017 the blade efficiency is defined as 17 b l a d e e f f i c i e n c y t d p q the average difference in thrust between w o duct and with duct over one propeller rotation is only 0 4 w o duct while it is 2 5 w o duct in torque in other words the propeller with duct produces almost the same thrust as the propeller w o duct with less torque and smaller np see table 8 which is apparently energy saving resultant blade efficiency averaged over one propeller rotation for with duct is 3 4 higher than that of w o duct the improvement of blade efficiency occurs at 45deg θ 315deg where the axial momentum defect is apparent due to flow separation from the duct see fig 15 in consequence the duct of jbc in model scale has two functions for energy saving i e 1 decelerate the va which contributes to improve 1 wtm and blade efficiency of the propeller and 2 fragment the bilge vortex which contributes to recover the rotational energy at propeller downstream wake 4 3 analysis for dtc 4 3 1 rudder force coefficients to investigate the effect of twist rudder equipped on dtc fig 23 compares the changes in the pressure component of rudder force coefficients in resistance and self propulsion between twist rud bulb and normal rudder at the model ship speed equivalent to fn 0 209 twist rudder is expected to show wider region of low pressure at suction side of the rudder depending on the twist direction than that of normal rudder yet the results in fig 23 do not show such trend it is conjectured that the present twist angle configuration can be improved further for better design of the twist rudder for which possible suggestion will be made on clause 4 3 3 4 3 2 analysis of kinetic energy flux table 11 summarizes the computational analysis of kinetic energy flux for dtc with twist rud bulb and normal rudder at two different control surfaces fig 24 shows the computational results of three dimensional vortical structure for dtc with normal rudder and twist rud bulb at self propulsion mode ship speed equivalent to fn 0 209 θ 0deg depicted by q 300 1 s2 iso surface fragmentation of hub vortex due to bulb is apparent at starboard side while it is not at port side kax and ktr do not decrease at cs2 for twist rud bulb in comparison to normal rudder because the fragmentation of hub vortex due to the present bulb is likely not enough to recover ktr this is consistent to the physics reported to clause 4 1 2 that the self propulsion coefficients and relevant efficiencies are almost identical between twist rud bulb and normal rudder see fig 13 it is conjectured that the present configuration of the rudder bulb can be improved further for which possible suggestion will be made on clause 4 3 3 4 3 3 suggested design modification for the esds fig 25 a shows computational result of vertical distribution in relative angle of attack αrel to the leading edge of dtc s twisted rudder which is defined as 18 α rel tan 1 v u 5 0 where u and v is the cartesian components of axial and horizontal direction respectively at fn 0 209 positive direction of αrel is defined from port to starboard three different longitudinal sections are selected to evaluate αrel and x 5 92 m is the location right in front of the leading edge of the rudder on upper part of the rudder the αrel is always larger than zero at x 5 92 m while it is not at the rest of two sections in addition αrel is constantly abt 15deg on propeller slip stream only at x 5 92 m according to the reference goett and bullivant 1939 this is reasonable angle of attack for naca0018 the wing section for the present twisted rudder to produce enough lift in turbulent flow in model scale these indicate that the present design of upper part of the rudder is appropriate at current rudder position on lower part of the rudder it is common among three sections that the distribution of αrel constantly decreases from shaft centerline to rudder bottom in view of lift generation on the lower rudder surface such distribution is not ideal setting the target αrel as 15deg and 15deg for upper and lower part of rudder respectively the ideal vertical distribution of twist angle is estimated based on the local flow of self propulsion simulation and plotted in fig 25b although the angle is excessive at top and bottom of the rudder according to fig 25a and b two suggestions can be made to improve the design of lower part of the present twist rudder 1 constant twist angle 5deg is at least not necessary at the lower part of the rudder so that αrel becomes constantly larger by 5deg 2 in view of lift generation αrel can be linearly quadratically distributed from zero to 20deg from shaft center to rudder bottom yet taking the risks of increasing rudder drag rudder cavitation maneuverability and difficulty in production into consideration the suggestion 2 may not be practical for the rudder bulb two suggestions can be made to improve its hydrodynamic design by evaluating existing rudder bulbs e g mipb fujii et al 1995 rbs f yamano et al 1995 and promas grunditz 2005 1 the distance of the dtc s bulb nose to propeller boss tail is about 0 53dp which is too large compared to the existing rudder bulbs the clearance must be set at most 0 1dp or smaller otherwise the hub vortex will be generated and thus rotational energy will be wasted this is evidenced by the fact that the mipb increases its effect by 1 when the boss and bulb is integrated fujii et al 1995 i e the distance between bulb nose and the boss tail is zero 2 the geometry of boss cap should not be a convergent type rather it should be a divergent type fujii et al 1995 yamano et al 1995 grunditz 2005 so that the generation of hub vortex is suppressed to some extent once a boss cap becomes divergent type the maximum diameter of the bulb must be designed according to the reference fujii et al 1995 its diameter ratio to the hub tail diameter is up to 1 9 4 4 analysis for cot 4 4 1 local flow analysis in model and full scale fig 26 describes computational results bare and case 1 are selected for the analysis of ux u0 and uθ u0 of nominal wake as a function of θ at 0 3 r r 1 0 on the propeller plane in model and full scale in ux the flow is accelerated and decelerated at suction side and pressure side of the pssfs respectively which yields asymmetricity between port and starboard up to r r 0 6 in both model and full scale in uθ the pssfs amplify its magnitude at 0deg θ 180deg port side in the meantime decrease its magnitude at 180deg r r 360deg starboard side up to r r 0 5 for both model and full scale in consequence the pssf for the present ship enhances bilge vortex at portside and weakens it at starboard side to provide counter rotating flow relative to the propeller rotation direction which contributes to improve 1 wtm this also results in the non uniformity of uθ which contributes to improve ηr according to ikehata et al 1981 ikehata et al 1981 which is proven by the present results shown in fig 14 fig 27 presents the computational results of radial distribution of flow direction evaluated at the longitudinal cross section where the leading edge of typical pssf is to be located in model and full scale without with propeller induced velocity in bare configuration for both model and full scale propeller induced velocity yields changes in flow direction 2deg 5deg it would be designers decision to make use of such difference to determine twist angle of pssf sign of flow direction is opposite between model and full scale which is quite interesting feature the twist angle of pssf should in principle be determined according to the flow direction in full scale including the effect of propeller induced velocity 4 4 2 effect of the pssf to 1 t fig 28 a and b show the raw data of deterioration in 1 t e g δ 1 t defined by bare case1 4 and ctfin total force coefficient acting on the fins at resistance and self propulsion in model scale respectively two features can be found from the results 1 ctfin is almost doubled for all the configurations at self propulsion in comparison to those at resistance 2 there is an apparent correlation between δ 1 t and ctfin that is configuration with large ctfin tends to show large δ 1 t these phenomena indicate that pssf for the present ship does not produce thrust in the meantime ctfin causes the deterioration in 1 t to identify the criminal fin which causes 1 t deterioration ctfin for each fin is analyzed in fig 29 it is found that the pressure component in s2 fin mostly dominates the increase of fin resistance and resultant deterioration in 1 t in case 1 case 3 and case 4 the span of p1 and s1 fins are almost twice as short as those of p2 and s2 respectively however in case 3 and case 4 ctfin acting on p1 and s1 is almost the same order of magnitude or even larger than those of p2 and s2 respectively this is caused by changing twist angle for which its value of p1 is doubled in case 3 and case 4 in comparison to case 1 and case 2 this yields massive flow separation at suction side of p1 fin as shown in fig 30 depicted by q 50 1 s2 iso surface 4 4 3 effect of the pssf to 1 wtm fig 31 a and b quantify the kinetic energy flux at cs1 and cs2 respectively fig 32 a and b present the relationship between recovery rate of kinetic energy flux and the raw data of improvement in 1 wtm δ 1 wtm defined by bare case1 4 at cs1 pssf locally accelerates the axial velocity which yields decrease in kax relative to bare as discussed in clause 4 4 1 the pssf successfully generates counterclockwise flow relative to the propeller rotating direction which increases ktr relative to bare at cs2 propeller adds axial momentum and thus kax becomes smaller than that of cs1 rotational flow induced by the propeller is obviously stronger than that of originated from pssf therefore ktr at cs2 is larger than that of cs1 as shown in fig 32a and b recovery rate as a percentage of bare in ktr shows apparent correlation to δ 1 wtm in other words changes in axial flow due to pssf does nothing on δ 1 wtm for the present ship 5 concluding remarks unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes computations are carried out for three different merchant ships with three different energy saving devices by numerical towing tank procedure that is propeller open water resistance and self propulsion tests are totally replaced by viscous cfd simulations the purpose of the present study is to investigate the working principle of three energy saving devices for the target ships in terms of both self propulsion and local flow analyses in the meantime to demonstrate comprehensive validity of viscous cfd in evaluating hydrodynamic performance of esds prior to the investigation rigorous validation studies are made in the computational results of propeller open water characteristics total resistance coefficients self propulsion coefficients and relevant propulsion parameters utilizing the available experimental data for propeller open water characteristics the present computational results agree well with the experimental data around working point of the propellers adoption of transition turbulence model could be one option for further improvement in estimating propeller open water characteristics by viscous cfd for resistance the present computational result shows excellent agreement to the experimental data for jbc and low froude number region for dtc specifically for medium froude number cases of dtc running attitude of the ship should be considered to capture hump and hollow profiles of wave making resistance for self propulsion coefficients and relevant propulsion parameters the present computational results quantitatively capture the effect of energy saving devices to these parameters for jbc computational results of nominal total wake distribution on the propeller plane capture the general trend of local flow characteristics compared to the experimental data yet the resolution of bilge vortices as well as decelerated flow outside of the duct cowling are the issues to be improved in the future diagnostics of the balance of axial and tangential kinetic energy fluxes vortical structure and propeller loads clarify the working principle of the present duct for dtc the present computations find out that vertical distribution of the twist angle and the distance between propeller boss cap and the rudder bulb should be modified and possible ideas for their modifications are discussed for cot the scale effect becomes apparent in axial and tangential components of nominal and total wake by the present computations the reason of deterioration in 1 t and improvement in 1 wtm by the pre swirl stator fins are clearly identified by associating resistance self propulsion coefficients and local flow characteristics the present study shows comprehensive validity of viscous cfd to evaluate hydrodynamic performance of hull with energy saving devices as well as to earn useful information for design exploration of these geometries due to the limitations of computational cost and time uncertainty assessment is not carried out for the present study systematic coarsening refining of grid resolution and time step will made it possible to carry out deterministic verification and validation proposed by ittc 2008 ittc recommended procedures and guidelines 2008 to quantify grid and time step uncertainties 
22896,due to the eedi regulation recent merchant ships have strictly been required to achieve certain rate of energy saving and thus equipment of energy saving devices esds has been quite popular the purpose of this study is to investigate the working principle of pre and post swirl type esds via complementary use of experiment and viscous computational fluid dynamics cfd three different hull forms japan bulk carrier jbc duisburg test case container ship dtc and coastal tanker cot with three different esds are of the interest propeller open water resistance and self propulsion tests are totally replaced by viscous cfd simulations termed numerical towing tank procedure for jbc detailed investigations of self propulsion parameters balance of kinetic energy flux local flow and propeller loads clarify the working principle of its stern duct for dtc the present computations find out that vertical distribution of the twist angle of its rudder and the distance between propeller boss cap and the rudder bulb should be modified for cot the scale effect in axial and tangential components of its nominal and total wake are studied in the meantime the reason of deterioration improvement in self propulsion coefficients by the pre swirl stator fins are identified keywords viscous cfd energy saving device working principle self propulsion local flow analysis 1 introduction due to the regulation of energy efficiency design index by international maritime organization international maritime organization 2011 recent merchant ships have strictly been required to achieve certain rate of energy saving in hydrodynamic point of view one of the solutions is to equip energy saving devices esds in the vicinity of ships stern fig 1 describes the schematic zones to place esds according to carlton 2012 carlton 2007 devices placed in zone i is so called pre swirl type most of the devices placed in zone ii especially right behind the propeller as well as the devices placed in zone iii are categorized as post swirl type pre swirl type devices modify the flow upstream of the propeller so that it yields better propeller hull interaction and or improves inflow velocity to the propeller to achieve energy saving post swirl type devices recover the rotational energy mostly originated from the propeller during design exploration of such esds by experiment and or computation it is rather inefficient to find best match between esds and a hull via brute force or ad hoc searching the first priority at their early design stage is to clarify the working principle of each esds together with a hull and a propeller to achieve this complementary use of experiment and numerical simulation represented by viscous computational fluid dynamics cfd is desirable viscous cfd validated with available experimental data will provide detail and useful information in both integral and local variables which contributes to understand working principle of esds several candidate geometries of esds designed throughout viscous cfd simulations will be subjected to model experiment to make final decision for esds to be equipped on an actual ship viscous cfd simulation in full scale is sometimes helpful to make corrections for design parameters of esds determined by model scale investigation inukai et al 2011 recent european union project grip carried out extensive studies of pre swirl stator fins pssf ducts placed upstream of the propeller rudder bulb and fins on propeller boss cap to investigate their working principle among these devices the pssf was likely to be most promising according to their preliminary studies it was designed and retrofitted on the bulk carrier bc which yielded more than 6 of energy saving effect according to the sea trial streckwall and yan 2017 sophie and marcos 2017 schuiling and van terwisga 2017 this project is one of the most successful examples of design exploration in esds throughout the complementary use of viscous cfd and model full scale experiments other than grip project several studies can be found in investigating designs and functions of pre and post swirl type esds by viscous cfd simulations mewis and guiard 2011 mewis and guiard 2011 made use of viscous cfd simulation to design mewis duct for very large crude carriers vlcc and bcs hydrodynamic forces acting on the duct were evaluated by viscous cfd in order to evaluate its effect of increasing hull resistance in the meantime nominal and total wake in the stern vicinity were utilized to determine the design parameters of the duct and its fins kim et al 2013 kim et al 2013 optimized the geometry of pre swirl stator pss for aframax product carrier by viscous cfd and towing tank experiments the computational results of energy saving rate among different pss configuration agreed quite well with the experimental data which indicates that the cfd is capable of designing and even ranking the most energy efficient pss configuration lee et al 2014 lee et al 2014 made use of viscous cfd to design energy recovering turbine behind a propeller they visualized the local flow behind the turbine blades by viscous cfd to confirm whether the turbine generated counter rotating flow relative to the rotational flow originated from a propeller sakamoto et al 2014 sakamoto et al 2014a and park et al 2015 park et al 2015 carried out viscous cfd simulations of bc with energy saving duct and vlcc with pss respectively in full scale to investigate the scale effect of esds to the local flow the former revealed that the duct design based on the flow field of full scale could be quite different to that of model scale since the angle of inflow to the duct showed opposite sign between model and full scale the latter proposed modification formula of scaling up effective wake fraction originally suggested by international towing tank conference ittc the specialist committee 1999 international towing tank conference 2011 based on their full scale viscous cfd results hai long et al 2016 hai long et al 2016 quantified energy saving rate of rudder bulb with fins in model and full scale by viscous cfd yet the working principle of the esds could still be physically investigated further based on their computational results kawamura et al 2012 kawamura et al 2012 and mizzi et al 2017 mizzi et al 2017 carried out viscous cfd simulations for propeller boss cap fins pbcf the former investigated the scale effect of pbcf equipped on propellers for pure car carrier pcc and bc by decomposing pressure and frictional component of thrust and torque acting on a propeller boss propeller blades and pbcf respectively the latter optimized the geometry of pbcf equipped on benchmark propeller geometry although the experimental validation was not shown optimized pbcf increases propeller open water efficiency by 1 3 than that of without pbcf although these investigations present the promising feature of viscous cfd simulation to evaluate hydrodynamic performance of esds it is still rare to demonstrate comprehensiveness of the numerical method that is each study have focused on one esd equipped on one ship to demonstrate the comprehensive validity of viscous cfd in evaluating hydrodynamic performance of esds as well as in understanding their working principle the present study analyzes three different type of hull forms e g bc container ship and coastal tanker with three different esds e g duct in front of the propeller twisted rudder with bulb and pre swirl stator fins using the same computational method with the same pre and post processes standard procedures of model testing e g propeller open water test resistance and self propulsion tests as well as local flow measurements are totally replaced by the viscous cfd simulations termed numerical towing tank procedure although the importance of scale effects in esds are apparent and the theme to be overcome most of the present study still focuses on simulations in model scale since the rigorous validation of local flow is one of the aims two criteria e g standard self propulsion analysis and kinetic energy analysis of local flow are adopted to study the effect of the esds to the propulsion performance of the hulls according to one of the lessons learnt from grip project streckwall and yan 2017 sophie and marcos 2017 schuiling and van terwisga 2017 the present computational method successfully quantifies the effect of the esds to propulsion parameters for all the configurations working principles of these esds are investigated throughout detail analysis of the computational and experimental results in the meantime design modifications and key design parameters in some of the esds are proposed following this introduction chapter 2 briefly describes the computational method for the present study chapter 3 presents description of target geometries simulation design and physical quantities subjected to the analysis chapter 4 shows detailed investigations in the hydrodynamic performance of the esds chapter 5 summarizes conclusion and future works 2 computational method 2 1 overview of the cfd solver the computational results are obtained using general purpose commercial cfd package star ccm ver11 04 double precision version cd adapco 2016 the governing equations are the continuity and unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations in dimensional forms and are solved by finite volume method among several turbulence models on the solver k omega shear stress transport model without wall function is selected the effect of boundary layer transition is not taken into consideration in the present study to model rotation of a propeller two methods are utilized for steady propeller open water simulations moving reference frame mrf approach is adopted for mrf approach computational domain is separated into mrf region and the outside of mrf region the governing equations solved inside the mrf region take the effect of centrifugal and coriolis force due to angular velocity into consideration as body force terms in momentum equations while they are not in the outside of mrf region the fluxes between mrf region and the outside region is weakly exchanged through cell faces with appropriate coordinate transformations in the present study the mrf region is rotator and the outside region is stator which will be explained in the next section for unsteady self propulsion simulations dynamic overset grid is adopted which will also be described in the next section as the two phase flow modeling for free surface volume of fluid method with high resolution interface capturing scheme is utilized divergence free condition is satisfied by solving pressure poisson equation iteratively using semi implicit method for pressure linked equation algorithm the order of accuracy is second in space while first order implicit scheme is adopted in time the code is parallelized by message passing interface and ran in distributed memory type machine with typically 72 80 cpus 2 2 dynamic overset grid in the present study dynamic overset grid approach is adopted to simulate discretized rotating propeller behind the hull fig 2 a b and 2c present the example of overset grid assembly utilized for the present computation the computational domain is divided into two regions e g a stator and a rotator the stator region includes a ship hull equipped with esds and a rudder at stern the rotator region includes a propeller boss propeller blades and a boss cap the stator and rotator are assembled as shown in fig 2a as an overset assemble process cells in each region are flagged as 1 donor 2 receptor 3 active and 4 inactive hole cutting is also one of the important processes in overset grid assembly during the process the rotator cells inside the esds and the stator cells inside the propeller are all blanked out fig 2b and c shows the flags which show the status of overset cells in stator and rotator respectively the cells colored by light green are active cells where governing equations are solved the cells colored by red are inactive cells where governing equations are not solved the cells colored by blue are donor or receptor the donor cells around the receptor are searched using linear scheme with shape function of spanning tetrahedron cd adapco 2016 which means that one receptor has 4 donor stencils the donor cells in stator provide flux variables to receptor cells in rotator and vice versa the flux variables φ are interpolated from donor cells to receptor cells as 1 ϕ r e c e p t o r i α i ϕ i d o n o r where i is the cell id and αi is the interpolation coefficients for flux variables of donor cell i for unsteady simulations receptor donor relationship as well as α i are updated at every physical time advancement 3 simulation design 3 1 overview of the geometries fig 3 describes the overview of three geometries under the design water

workshop tokyo2015 by national maritime research institute nmri yokohama national university and shipbuilding research center of japan hino et al 2016 the rudder of jbc has intentionally been removed from both experiment and computation an energy saving duct categorized as pre swirl esd is equipped on jbc duisburg test case dtc is the 14 000teu post panamax container ship designed by the institute of ship technology ocean engineering and transport systems in the university of duisburg essen el moctar et al 2012 dtc has also widely utilized as one of the benchmark geometries see for instance shopera project papanikolaou et al 2016 twisted rudder with costa bulb categorized as post swirl esds termed twist rud bulb hereafter are equipped on dtc in the present study the rudder without twist angle and costa bulb termed normal rudder hereafter is designed maintaining the same section profile and aspect ratio relative to the original rudder for comparison purpose although the experimental data for dtc with normal rudder do not exist the coastal tanker cot is the geometry utilized in a contract work between nmri and the collaborator the collaborator s original pssf fluid techno co ltd 2009 is equipped on cot four candidate geometries of the pssf proposed at initial design stage shown in fig 4 are subjected to the present analysis yet please notice that none of them has become the final geometry although the details of geometrical configuration of the pssf are not presented in this manuscript three design parameters are varied among these pssf i e circumferential position twist

propulsion simulations respectively for pot simulation the coordinate origin is identical to the boss center while it is located at the cross point of the still water line and the forward perpendicular of a hull for resistance self propulsion simulation positive directions in x y and z are from fore to aft from port to starboard and keel to deck respectively for all the cases fig 6 summarizes the overview of the computational grids for the three target geometries in their stern vicinity table 2 summarizes the total number of cells in stator and rotator for self propulsion simulations with esds these grids are generated utilizing the same meshing parameters e g target cell sizes stretching ratio thickness of the prism layer and so on the stator grid is common among pot simulation and self propulsion simulation most of the computational domain are discretized using hexahedra cells while prism cells are generated in the region where hexahedra cells cannot be prepared due to geometrical constraint nondimensional viscous length y is close to 1 on wall boundaries in order to meet the requirement for the present turbulence model 3 3 flow condition table 3 summarizes the nondimensional parameters to represent flow conditions for the present study for pot simulations either the reynolds number based on dp rnd or the reynolds number of kempf rnk are defined as 2 rnd

number and the froude number based on lpp rn and fn respectively are defined as 3 rn u 0 l p p ν fn u 0 g l p p where u0 m s is the ship speed and g m s2 is the gravitational acceleration the rnd for jbc and cot are set according to the experimental condition for each case for dtc the experimental value of np in pot is not listed in the reference el moctar et al 2012 therefore it is assumed as 35 0 rps to achieve rnk 6 0e 05 to minimize the effect of the transition of boundary layer according to the recommendation by the ittc international towing tank conference 2008 the rn for resistance self propulsion simulations for all the cases are the same as their experimental conditions for jbc the fn is non zero for both resistance and self propulsion simulations while it is zero for self propulsion simulations for dtc and cot to save computational expense the effect of wave making resistance to the propeller load for these two cases is considered by modifying the towing force described in the next section 3 4 computational procedure for pot simulations constant np is set while the va is changed depending on the advance coefficient j and steady simulations are carried out typically 3 000 iterations provide statistically converged solutions e g the amplitudes of fluctuation in thrust coefficient kt and torque coefficient kq are less than 0 5 of their mean values in the present cases for resistance simulations constant u0 is given at the inlet boundary depending on rn and unsteady simulations are carried out the time step is set in such a way that the ship advances 0 01 dimensional flow time lpp u0 per physical time advancement with 5 sub iterations typically 10 to 15 dimensional flow time is enough to obtain steady state solution for which the amplitude of fluctuation in total resistance coefficient ctm is less than 0 5 of its mean value running attitude of the ship is static even keel condition for both resistance and self propulsion simulations for self propulsion simulations constant u0 is given at the inlet boundary depending on rn and unsteady simulations are carried out the converged volume solution of resistance simulation is utilizes as an initial condition for self propulsion simulation the time step is set in such a way that the propeller rotates 3 0deg every physical time advancement with 20 sub iterations in the present cases 15 to 20 rotations of propeller provide periodic signals in ctm kt and kq the self propulsion point is set as ship point for which the balance of the total hydrodynamic forces acting on the hull rudder esds and the propeller thrust is expressed as 4 r s p t s p f d where rs p n is the total resistance acting on the hull rudder and esds at self propulsion condition ts p n is the propeller thrust and fd n is the towing force measured at self propulsion configuration attention should be paid on the treatment of rs p specifically for dtc and cot as mentioned in section 3 3 self propulsion simulations for dtc and cot are carried out without free surface which means that the component of wave making resistance is missing in rs p in such cases following assumption is made as 5 r s p r s p d m r w where rs p dm n is the total resistance acting on the hull rudder and esds at self propulsion condition without free surface and rw n is the wave making resistance evaluated by resistance configuration with free surface substitution of eq 5 into eq 4 yields 6 r s p d m t s p f d r w equation 6 is utilized to achieve self propulsion point in dtc and cot all the fd and rw values for the present study are taken from the experiments to detect the np to achieve self propulsion in ship point 2 3 simulations with different np typically 3 5 of initial np are carried out as shown in fig 7 the cross point of left hand side lhs of eqs 4 or 6 and rhs of eqs 4 or 6 as a function of np detects the computational self propulsion point 3 5 variables subjected to the analysis table 4 summarizes the available experimental data which can be utilized to validate the present computational results the experimental data of jbc is the most extensive including propeller open water characteristics poc resistance and self propulsion quantities as well as mean and phase locked local velocity field measured by stereo particle image velocimetry at multiple longitudinal sections national maritime research institute 2015 these data are utilized to confirm overall accuracy for the present computational method at the beginning of the investigation validation for dtc and cot are made in terms of resistance and self propulsion quantities the poc is defined as 7 k t t ρ n p 2 d p 4 k q q ρ n p 2 d p 5 η o j 2 π k t k q where ρ kg m3 is the density of the fluid t n is the propeller thrust q n m is the propeller torque and ηo is the open water efficiency the ctm is defined as 8 c t m r t m 0 5 ρ u 0 2 s where rtm n is the total force acting on the hull rudder and esds and s m2 is the wetted surface area bare and appended configurations for jbc bare for dtc and cot at still water condition with design draught the form factor 1 k is defined as 9 1 k c t m c f 0 m where cf0m is estimated either by

friction correction kq behind is the torque coefficient with ship and kq open is the torque coefficient in open water identified by thrust identity method with poc to quantify the energy saving rate in terms of local flow energy balance analysis is utilized proposed by terwisga 2013 terwisga 2013 and andersson et al 2018a 2018b as described in the reference andersson et al 2018a energy flux across certain control surface cs can be decomposed into 1 axial kinetic energy flux 2 transverse kinetic energy flux 3 pressure work 4 internal energy flux and 5 turbulent kinetic energy flux the present study focused on the axial and transverse kinetic energy fluxes although the rest of three components should have been quantified and analyzed in terms of scientific completeness nondimensional forms dang et al 2012 of axial and transverse kinetic energy flux are defined on a cs located inside the computational domain as 11 k t o t k a x k t r 12 k a x 1 s ω u x u 0 1 u x u 0 2 d s 13 k t r 1 s ω u x u 0 u θ u 0 2 u r u 0 2 d s where ktot kax and ktr are the total axial and transverse tangential plus radial kinetic energy flux respectively sω m2 is the area of the cs ux m s uθ m s and ur m s are axial tangential and radial component of local velocity respectively defined on the cs fig 8 describes the location of the cs for three cases it is at x lpp 0 993 cs1 for jbc x lpp 0 989 cs1 and 1 021 cs2 for dtc x lpp 0 971 cs1 and 0 985 cs2 for cot respectively when kax and ktr are both zero on cs1 for jbc the propeller perfectly recovers the kinetic energy flux produced by the hull and duct when kax and ktr are smaller on cs2 than those on cs1 for dtc the twist rud bulb recovers the kinetic energy flux produced by the hull and propeller when kax and ktr are smaller on cs2 than those on cs1 for cot the propeller recovers the kinetic energy flux produced by the hull and pssf the cs is circular disk which has diameter of 2dp for jbc and dtc while it is dp for cot due to the presence of the shoe piece three dimensional vortical structure is visualized by the 2nd invariant of the rate of velocity gradient tensor q 1 s2 hunt et al 1988 the rate of strain tensor s and the vorticity tensor ω are defined as 14 s 1 2 u u t ω 1 2 u u t then the q is defined as 15 q 1 2 ω 2 s 2 if q is positive the euclidean norm of vorticity tensor dominates the rate of strain which evidences the rotation of the flow specifically for cot the flow direction α is evaluated at x lpp 0 964 right in front of the leading edge of pssf since the setting angle of the fins are determined according to α it is defined by 16 α tan 1 u θ u x 4 results 4 1 fundamental validation for jbc dtc and cot 4 1 1 poc fig 9 a b and 9c summarize the experimental and the computational results of poc for jbc dtc and cot respectively for jbc the computational results generally agree well with the experimental results yet the simulation tends to underestimate kt by 4 5 exp kq by 2 exp and ηo by 2 5 exp at propeller working point j 0 4 these are the possible sources of errors in j va 1 wtm ηo and ηr from the point of poc when the thrust identity method utilizes the computational results of this poc to estimate self propulsion coefficients from cfd simulations computations with fine grid 9m cells for which its number of cells is twice as large as that of the present grid 4m cells have been tested yet they do not improve pocs therefore the present underestimation is not likely due to grid dependency it is conjectured that laminar turbulent transition model may contribute to resolve this problem according to kawamura and omori 2009 kawamura and omori 2009 and krasilnikov 2016 krasilnikov 2016 at low j region circumferential velocity to the leading edge of the propeller blade is small and thus the boundary layer at the location may be laminar in the experiment as long as no leading edge roughness is considered resolving laminar boundary layer will result in the decrease of frictional resistance in consequence the kt will be increased in comparison to the kt with fully developed turbulent boundary layer for dtc the computational results show excellent agreement to the experimental data up until j 0 7 the differences between the experiment and the computation are approximately 1 3 exp in kt 0 1 exp in 10kq and 1 3 exp in ηo respectively since the computational results are obtained without any transition modeling the experiment was likely to be carried out with enough turbulent stimulation at the leading edge of the propeller blades and or the inflow may contain free stream turbulence intensity which is strong enough to enhance the onset of transition of boundary layer from laminar to turbulent on the propeller blades the estimated poc is unlikely to yield error in j va and resultant 1 wtm since the working point of this propeller is around 0 6 j 0 62 for cot the working point of the propeller lies on 0 4 j 0 5 according to the experiment among this range the differences between the experiment and the computation are approximately 2 exp in kt 1 exp in kq and 2 exp in ηo respectively these differences are in practice allowable and thus the simulated poc can be utilized for cfd self propulsion analysis similar to the propeller for jbc these differences may be improved by introducing transition modeling in turbulence 4 1 2 resistance and self propulsion coefficients experimental and computational results for resistance quantities under towed condition are summarized in table 5 and fig 10 jbc fig 12 dtc and table 6 cot respectively for jbc present simulation estimates ctm very well within 2 of difference relative to the experiment the presence of the duct does not provide adverse impact on ctm at towed condition since the drag force acting on the duct and strut is only 1 3 of total resistance fig 10 describes the cross comparison in the comparison error of ctm for jbc without with duct in resistance configuration over submission cases at cfd workshop tokyo 2015 national maritime research institute 2015 in terms of dependencies in grid and turbulence model although the solutions are from several different solvers please notice that the original version of fig 10 was prepared by the designated session chair the results of the present simulation are quite comparable to the other submission cases due to the limited computational expense systematic verification and validation v v are not carried out for the present study employing statistical n version v v proposed by stern et al 2017 stern et al 2017 may able to carry out uncertainty quantification throughout the data in fig 10 yet such investigation will be left as a future work for dtc ctm is well predicted within the difference of 1 5 relative to the experimental data up until fn 0 192 at 0 2 fn 0 209 present cfd simulation fails to capture hump and hollow originated from wave making resistance additional simulation with refined resolution near the free surface has been tested yet no improvement can be achieved the underprediction of ctm for dtc may not be due to lacking in free surface resolution rather it may arise from excluding the effect of dynamic sinkage and trim in the simulation as reported by shivachev et al 2017 shivachev et al 2017 with similar container ship and its ship speed the computational results of cfm constantly show lower values by 8 than those of estimated by ittc1957 friction line for which the reason has not yet been identified the rudder resistance coefficient relative to ctm is approximately 1 8 for both original and normal rudders which indicates that twist angle and bulb are harmless in resistance under towed condition for cot the computational result underestimates the 1 k by 9 which is similar to sakamoto et al 2014 sakamoto et al 2014b one possible reason for this is the difference in methodology to compute 1 k e g prohaska s method is utilized in the experiment while it is estimated by single run data at lowest rn in the present cfd simulation among several design candidates in pssf shown in fig 4 the increase in 1 k is at most 1 3 original according to the present computation equipment of the present pssf to cot does not increase resistance in towed condition table 7 shows the computational results of resistance coefficients of duct and strut in towed and self propulsion conditions for jbc table 8 summarizes the experimental and computational results of self propulsion coefficients and other propulsion parameters for jbc due to propeller duct interaction resistance acting on the duct for which its 90 is due to pressure becomes twice as that of towed condition the drag force acting on duct with propeller effect is approximately 2 8 of total resistance it indicates that the duct for jbc is relatively compatible design to the hull even with propeller interaction it is quite encouraging that the present computation perfectly captures the effect of the duct to the propulsion characteristics of jbc within the difference of 1 relative to the experiment although the comparison in raw data sometimes show differences more than 5 exp in 1 t 1 wtm ηd and va in 1 t most of the error comes from propeller thrust since the difference in rtm and t is 1 3 1 8 and 9 5 10 5 respectively relative to the experiment although the difference in np can be one reason to cause difference in t further diagnostics would be necessary in the computational accuracy of time history of blade pressure distribution for which such experimental data can be found for instance in ukon et al 1989 ukon et al 1989 in 1 wtm and va the error may arise from lack of accuracy in estimating nominal wake components e g uθ for w o duct and ux for with duct respectively as will be discussed in clause 4 2 1 in ηd the difference in 1 t 1 wtm ηr and ηo all affect to its computational accuracy e g small difference in each component yields large difference in the end fig 11 describes the cross comparison in the comparison error of kt kq and np for jbc without with duct in resistance configuration over submission cases at cfd workshop tokyo 2015 national maritime research institute 2015 in terms of grid dependency although the solutions are from several different solvers please notice that the original version of fig 11 was prepared by the designated session chair the results of the present simulation are quite comparable to the other submission cases as well as for fig 10 n version v v stern et al 2017 may quantify the statistical uncertainty throughout the data in fig 11 yet such investigation will be left as a future work instead table 9 summarizes solution change in ctm cfm cvp ctm cfm kt and kq under self propulsion configuration depending on grid density these data are extracted from one available submission case at cfd workshop tokyo 2015 national maritime research institute 2015 utilizing the same cfd solver as the present study to investigate the trend of grid convergence in table 9 the index hi h1 indicates the ratio of solutions from ith grid with respect to the solution from finest grid h1 it is difficult to conclude from the results shown in table 9 that the grid convergence was achieved e g kt and kq are likely to be converge while resistance quantities are not validation in terms of local flow and investigation in working principle of the esd will be made in section 4 2 fig 13 presents experimental and computational results of self propulsion coefficients and relevant efficiencies for dtc for twist rud bulb cases computational results agree quite well with the experiment within the difference of 2 exp with the exception in 1 t at fn 0 209 due to inaccurate estimation of wave making resistance at this ship speed for normal rudder cases all variables are almost identical to those of twist rud bulb cases which implies that the present post swirl esds are not effective enough to improve propulsive performance investigation of this physics will be made in section 4 3 fig 14 summarizes the validation results in self propulsion coefficients and nondimensional propeller rotation speed n np lpp u0 for cot the index bare describes the ship without pssf the values in vertical axis are shown as the ratio relative to bare due to non disclosure agreement between nmri and the collaborator the present simulation almost captures the deterioration of 1 t due to the presence of pssf the improvement of 1 wtm due to different configuration of pssf is perfectly simulated by the present cfd the reason of deterioration improvement in 1 t and 1 wtm will be investigated in section 4 4 agreement in ηr and n between the experiment and cfd is acceptable 4 2 analysis for jbc 4 2 1 local flow validation figs 15 and 16 compare the experimental and computational results of nominal wake distribution with cross flow vector on the propeller plane x lpp 0 9843 without and with the esd respectively the nondimensional nominal wake is decomposed into axial ux radial ur and tangential uθ components and they are plotted as a function of circumferential position θ for which it is zero at 12 o clock and increases clockwise observing from stern the ux u0 averaged over θ is plotted as a function of radial location r r in figs 15d and 16d specifically in fig 15 two computational results are presented the index baseline is the solution from the grid whose properties are shown in table 2 the index local ref c c is the additional solution for which two criteria are introduced in the resistance simulation aiming to improve the resolution of bilge vortex i e 1 isotropic local refinement edge length of a cell is 4 5e 04 m from x 6 0 m to aft perpendicular 0 5 m longer in fore direction in comparison to the baseline grid and 2 curvature correction for the present turbulence model arolla and durbin 2013 for w o duct the computational result with baseline grid shows overprediction in ux by 6 6 exp in average discrepancy between the experimental and the computational results in uθ is pronounced at r r 0 3 to 0 8 where the bilge vortices exist among all the components asymmetricity can be found inside the propeller plane although the solution reaches steady state in resistance the local flow in the stern vicinity is slightly unsteady due to flow separation from aft part of the hull and this might be the reason to cause such asymmetricity with both side configuration the computational results with local ref c c reduce the level of overprediction in ux by 4 4 exp in average for which the computational accuracy is improved specifically at r r 0 6 to 1 0 yet the treatment does not contribute to improve the discrepancy in uθ in consequence local ref c c successfully capture the flow separation from the bilge which contributes to reproduce axial momentum defect better than baseline grid individual applications of local refinement or curvature correction do not yield the result shown in fig 15 in other words these two should be utilized simultaneously it is conjectured that the addition of the present local refinement adequately computes the rotation and strain tensors so that the curvature correction factor properly controls the production of turbulent kinetic energy asymmetric axial wake does not appear to the solution from local ref c c grid since the computation is carried out with half side configuration for which y symmetric boundary condition is applied on the ship centerline although local ref c c works better than baseline in terms of ux prediction further computations in the present study still utilize baseline grid total number of cells for local ref c c is more than 9m for half side with double model configuration which is computationally expensive to carry out self propulsion simulations with rotating propeller and free surface for with duct quantitative comparison shown in fig 16 reveals local discrepancy in ux specifically at r r 0 6 and 0 7 among 90 d e g θ 270 d e g the computational results show much lower value than that of the experiment at r r 0 6 specifically at r r 0 7 ux is negative among the θ region in the computational result which means that the present simulation resolves pseudo reversed flow while no such phenomenon exists in the experiment in terms of cross flow components they are less apparent for with duct than w o duct because the duct intersects the bilge vortex which will be discusses in clause 4 2 2 computational results of ur and uθ generally agree well with the experimental data in summary the present simulation for jbc successfully captures the difference in nominal wake due to the presence of the duct in comparison to the experimental data yet there are still two issues to be improved 1 w o duct case is lacking in its computational accuracy in uθ which is originated from the resolution of cross flow due to bilge vortices and 2 with duct case is lacking in its computational accuracy in ux which is originated from the resolution of decelerated flow outside of the duct cowling these two discrepancies may affect to the computational accuracy of self propulsion coefficients discussed in clause 4 1 2 figs 17 20 present experimental and computational results of instantaneous total wake distribution at x lpp 0 9843 and 1 0 for jbc without with duct at θ 0deg respectively the θ describes the position of the key blade for which 0deg is identical to 12 o clock position and its rotation direction is clockwise positive observing from the face side of the propeller it is common among figs 17 20 that the present computation predicts decelerated accelerated region of all the flow components at two different cross sections very well relative to the experimental data compared to the results of nominal wake it is difficult to visualize the effect of the esd in u u0 since propeller induced velocity is added to the local flow which masks the difference for v u0 and w u0 at x lpp 1 0 they become slightly smaller for the case with duct than those of without duct for which the reason will be explained in clause 4 2 2 although the results are not presented the validations are carried out at θ 24deg and 48deg the agreement between the experimental and the computational results is quite similar to the results at θ 0deg 4 2 2 analysis of kinetic energy flux table 10 summarizes the computational analysis of kinetic energy flux for jbc without and with the esd fig 21 shows the computational results of three dimensional vortical structure for jbc w o with duct at self propulsion θ 0deg depicted by q 50 1 s2 iso surface according to figs 17 20 cross flow components for with duct become smaller compared to without duct and the vortical structure shown in fig 21 explains the reason for without duct the developed bilge vortex is transported downstream by the propeller suction and comes into cs1 for with duct the developed bilge vortex is fragmented by the duct and thus rotational flow at cs1 is more homogenized than that of without duct this is quantified in ktr that it is approximately 11 smaller for with duct than that of without duct change in kax is less than 1 between w o duct and with duct behind the propeller ktot for with duct is 5 smaller than that of w o duct due to decrease in ktr 4 2 3 effect of the duct to the propeller fig 22 summarizes the effect of duct to the propeller in terms of dimensional thrust torque and blade efficiency acting on total blades and a key blade respectively according to schuiling and van terwisga 2017 schuiling and van terwisga 2017 the blade efficiency is defined as 17 b l a d e e f f i c i e n c y t d p q the average difference in thrust between w o duct and with duct over one propeller rotation is only 0 4 w o duct while it is 2 5 w o duct in torque in other words the propeller with duct produces almost the same thrust as the propeller w o duct with less torque and smaller np see table 8 which is apparently energy saving resultant blade efficiency averaged over one propeller rotation for with duct is 3 4 higher than that of w o duct the improvement of blade efficiency occurs at 45deg θ 315deg where the axial momentum defect is apparent due to flow separation from the duct see fig 15 in consequence the duct of jbc in model scale has two functions for energy saving i e 1 decelerate the va which contributes to improve 1 wtm and blade efficiency of the propeller and 2 fragment the bilge vortex which contributes to recover the rotational energy at propeller downstream wake 4 3 analysis for dtc 4 3 1 rudder force coefficients to investigate the effect of twist rudder equipped on dtc fig 23 compares the changes in the pressure component of rudder force coefficients in resistance and self propulsion between twist rud bulb and normal rudder at the model ship speed equivalent to fn 0 209 twist rudder is expected to show wider region of low pressure at suction side of the rudder depending on the twist direction than that of normal rudder yet the results in fig 23 do not show such trend it is conjectured that the present twist angle configuration can be improved further for better design of the twist rudder for which possible suggestion will be made on clause 4 3 3 4 3 2 analysis of kinetic energy flux table 11 summarizes the computational analysis of kinetic energy flux for dtc with twist rud bulb and normal rudder at two different control surfaces fig 24 shows the computational results of three dimensional vortical structure for dtc with normal rudder and twist rud bulb at self propulsion mode ship speed equivalent to fn 0 209 θ 0deg depicted by q 300 1 s2 iso surface fragmentation of hub vortex due to bulb is apparent at starboard side while it is not at port side kax and ktr do not decrease at cs2 for twist rud bulb in comparison to normal rudder because the fragmentation of hub vortex due to the present bulb is likely not enough to recover ktr this is consistent to the physics reported to clause 4 1 2 that the self propulsion coefficients and relevant efficiencies are almost identical between twist rud bulb and normal rudder see fig 13 it is conjectured that the present configuration of the rudder bulb can be improved further for which possible suggestion will be made on clause 4 3 3 4 3 3 suggested design modification for the esds fig 25 a shows computational result of vertical distribution in relative angle of attack αrel to the leading edge of dtc s twisted rudder which is defined as 18 α rel tan 1 v u 5 0 where u and v is the cartesian components of axial and horizontal direction respectively at fn 0 209 positive direction of αrel is defined from port to starboard three different longitudinal sections are selected to evaluate αrel and x 5 92 m is the location right in front of the leading edge of the rudder on upper part of the rudder the αrel is always larger than zero at x 5 92 m while it is not at the rest of two sections in addition αrel is constantly abt 15deg on propeller slip stream only at x 5 92 m according to the reference goett and bullivant 1939 this is reasonable angle of attack for naca0018 the wing section for the present twisted rudder to produce enough lift in turbulent flow in model scale these indicate that the present design of upper part of the rudder is appropriate at current rudder position on lower part of the rudder it is common among three sections that the distribution of αrel constantly decreases from shaft centerline to rudder bottom in view of lift generation on the lower rudder surface such distribution is not ideal setting the target αrel as 15deg and 15deg for upper and lower part of rudder respectively the ideal vertical distribution of twist angle is estimated based on the local flow of self propulsion simulation and plotted in fig 25b although the angle is excessive at top and bottom of the rudder according to fig 25a and b two suggestions can be made to improve the design of lower part of the present twist rudder 1 constant twist angle 5deg is at least not necessary at the lower part of the rudder so that αrel becomes constantly larger by 5deg 2 in view of lift generation αrel can be linearly quadratically distributed from zero to 20deg from shaft center to rudder bottom yet taking the risks of increasing rudder drag rudder cavitation maneuverability and difficulty in production into consideration the suggestion 2 may not be practical for the rudder bulb two suggestions can be made to improve its hydrodynamic design by evaluating existing rudder bulbs e g mipb fujii et al 1995 rbs f yamano et al 1995 and promas grunditz 2005 1 the distance of the dtc s bulb nose to propeller boss tail is about 0 53dp which is too large compared to the existing rudder bulbs the clearance must be set at most 0 1dp or smaller otherwise the hub vortex will be generated and thus rotational energy will be wasted this is evidenced by the fact that the mipb increases its effect by 1 when the boss and bulb is integrated fujii et al 1995 i e the distance between bulb nose and the boss tail is zero 2 the geometry of boss cap should not be a convergent type rather it should be a divergent type fujii et al 1995 yamano et al 1995 grunditz 2005 so that the generation of hub vortex is suppressed to some extent once a boss cap becomes divergent type the maximum diameter of the bulb must be designed according to the reference fujii et al 1995 its diameter ratio to the hub tail diameter is up to 1 9 4 4 analysis for cot 4 4 1 local flow analysis in model and full scale fig 26 describes computational results bare and case 1 are selected for the analysis of ux u0 and uθ u0 of nominal wake as a function of θ at 0 3 r r 1 0 on the propeller plane in model and full scale in ux the flow is accelerated and decelerated at suction side and pressure side of the pssfs respectively which yields asymmetricity between port and starboard up to r r 0 6 in both model and full scale in uθ the pssfs amplify its magnitude at 0deg θ 180deg port side in the meantime decrease its magnitude at 180deg r r 360deg starboard side up to r r 0 5 for both model and full scale in consequence the pssf for the present ship enhances bilge vortex at portside and weakens it at starboard side to provide counter rotating flow relative to the propeller rotation direction which contributes to improve 1 wtm this also results in the non uniformity of uθ which contributes to improve ηr according to ikehata et al 1981 ikehata et al 1981 which is proven by the present results shown in fig 14 fig 27 presents the computational results of radial distribution of flow direction evaluated at the longitudinal cross section where the leading edge of typical pssf is to be located in model and full scale without with propeller induced velocity in bare configuration for both model and full scale propeller induced velocity yields changes in flow direction 2deg 5deg it would be designers decision to make use of such difference to determine twist angle of pssf sign of flow direction is opposite between model and full scale which is quite interesting feature the twist angle of pssf should in principle be determined according to the flow direction in full scale including the effect of propeller induced velocity 4 4 2 effect of the pssf to 1 t fig 28 a and b show the raw data of deterioration in 1 t e g δ 1 t defined by bare case1 4 and ctfin total force coefficient acting on the fins at resistance and self propulsion in model scale respectively two features can be found from the results 1 ctfin is almost doubled for all the configurations at self propulsion in comparison to those at resistance 2 there is an apparent correlation between δ 1 t and ctfin that is configuration with large ctfin tends to show large δ 1 t these phenomena indicate that pssf for the present ship does not produce thrust in the meantime ctfin causes the deterioration in 1 t to identify the criminal fin which causes 1 t deterioration ctfin for each fin is analyzed in fig 29 it is found that the pressure component in s2 fin mostly dominates the increase of fin resistance and resultant deterioration in 1 t in case 1 case 3 and case 4 the span of p1 and s1 fins are almost twice as short as those of p2 and s2 respectively however in case 3 and case 4 ctfin acting on p1 and s1 is almost the same order of magnitude or even larger than those of p2 and s2 respectively this is caused by changing twist angle for which its value of p1 is doubled in case 3 and case 4 in comparison to case 1 and case 2 this yields massive flow separation at suction side of p1 fin as shown in fig 30 depicted by q 50 1 s2 iso surface 4 4 3 effect of the pssf to 1 wtm fig 31 a and b quantify the kinetic energy flux at cs1 and cs2 respectively fig 32 a and b present the relationship between recovery rate of kinetic energy flux and the raw data of improvement in 1 wtm δ 1 wtm defined by bare case1 4 at cs1 pssf locally accelerates the axial velocity which yields decrease in kax relative to bare as discussed in clause 4 4 1 the pssf successfully generates counterclockwise flow relative to the propeller rotating direction which increases ktr relative to bare at cs2 propeller adds axial momentum and thus kax becomes smaller than that of cs1 rotational flow induced by the propeller is obviously stronger than that of originated from pssf therefore ktr at cs2 is larger than that of cs1 as shown in fig 32a and b recovery rate as a percentage of bare in ktr shows apparent correlation to δ 1 wtm in other words changes in axial flow due to pssf does nothing on δ 1 wtm for the present ship 5 concluding remarks unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes computations are carried out for three different merchant ships with three different energy saving devices by numerical towing tank procedure that is propeller open water resistance and self propulsion tests are totally replaced by viscous cfd simulations the purpose of the present study is to investigate the working principle of three energy saving devices for the target ships in terms of both self propulsion and local flow analyses in the meantime to demonstrate comprehensive validity of viscous cfd in evaluating hydrodynamic performance of esds prior to the investigation rigorous validation studies are made in the computational results of propeller open water characteristics total resistance coefficients self propulsion coefficients and relevant propulsion parameters utilizing the available experimental data for propeller open water characteristics the present computational results agree well with the experimental data around working point of the propellers adoption of transition turbulence model could be one option for further improvement in estimating propeller open water characteristics by viscous cfd for resistance the present computational result shows excellent agreement to the experimental data for jbc and low froude number region for dtc specifically for medium froude number cases of dtc running attitude of the ship should be considered to capture hump and hollow profiles of wave making resistance for self propulsion coefficients and relevant propulsion parameters the present computational results quantitatively capture the effect of energy saving devices to these parameters for jbc computational results of nominal total wake distribution on the propeller plane capture the general trend of local flow characteristics compared to the experimental data yet the resolution of bilge vortices as well as decelerated flow outside of the duct cowling are the issues to be improved in the future diagnostics of the balance of axial and tangential kinetic energy fluxes vortical structure and propeller loads clarify the working principle of the present duct for dtc the present computations find out that vertical distribution of the twist angle and the distance between propeller boss cap and the rudder bulb should be modified and possible ideas for their modifications are discussed for cot the scale effect becomes apparent in axial and tangential components of nominal and total wake by the present computations the reason of deterioration in 1 t and improvement in 1 wtm by the pre swirl stator fins are clearly identified by associating resistance self propulsion coefficients and local flow characteristics the present study shows comprehensive validity of viscous cfd to evaluate hydrodynamic performance of hull with energy saving devices as well as to earn useful information for design exploration of these geometries due to the limitations of computational cost and time uncertainty assessment is not carried out for the present study systematic coarsening refining of grid resolution and time step will made it possible to carry out deterministic verification and validation proposed by ittc 2008 ittc recommended procedures and guidelines 2008 to quantify grid and time step uncertainties 
22897,the three dimensional flow around a floating cylinder during the sinking process is influenced by the free surface the free end and the riverbed or seabed which result in complicated current forces on the floating cylinder the physical experiments were carried out to investigate the drag forces transverse forces vertical forces and as well as frequencies of the transverse and vertical forces during the sinking process the aspect ratio ar of the submerged depth to the diameter of the model cylinder varies from 0 25 to 1 5 and the reynolds number re ranges from 2 104 1 2 105 results show that drag coefficients root mean square coefficients of drag and transverse forces generally increase with ar and increase significantly at the instant when the free end touches the seabed which should receive extra attention during the sinking process of cylinder the vertical force ratio decreases with ar fluctuation frequency of the transverse force increases with ar but fluctuation frequency of vertical force is basically not affected by ar also the pressure distributions on the front rear and bottom surfaces of the cylinder were measured and further analyzed to provide a better understanding of the variation of current forces with ar and re keywords physical experiment floating cylinder current force free surface free end water bottom effect 1 introduction floating caisson which plays a role of discharging water and providing a dry construction environment is an important measure to ensure the safety and quality of deep water bridge foundation construction as summarized by krishna et al 2004 the construction and installation of caisson generally consist of the flowing stage i e a being constructed at the dockside before being towed to site it is the first stage b being towed to site c installation of mooring system d caisson construction as construction progressed the draft of the caisson increases continuously until touchdown e touchdown and submergence the touchdown sequence is carefully orchestrated to ensure that the caisson is landed at the target location in the caisson construction process the rate of sinking process is slow as compared to the flow velocity therefore the dynamic sinking process can be simulated by a series of quasi static states with different draft the current force on floating caisson is extremely large because of its gigantic dimension and large current velocity at the construction site the cross section size of the floating caisson is as larger as tens of meters and the current velocity can reach 3 m s in ocean and may reach 10 m s in the river in mountainous area during flood season more importantly the current force of the floating caisson changing with the immersion depth during the sinking process not only introduces significant deviation from the target position but also causes intensive vibration and the potential risk of fatigue fracture of mooring system similar situations occur on other ocean structures such as floating foundations of offshore wind turbines cylinders of jacket platform cylinders of spar platform etc therefore it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive study on the characteristics of hydrodynamic forces on the floating caisson in the sinking process flow around the floating caisson has the following characteristics in the sinking process 1 the aspect ratio ar h d h and d are respectively the immerged depth and diameter of a floating caisson is very small and changes continuously in the sinking process the transverse section size of floating caisson is tens of meters or even close to 100 m while the water depth of bridge site varies from several meters to tens of meters 2 the influence of free surface cannot be ignored because the top of the floating caisson is higher than the free surface in the sinking process 3 the influence of the free end of floating caisson cannot be ignored 4 the effect of the riverbed or seabed on flow field and hydrodynamic forces must be considered when the free end approaches to the riverbed or seabed in the sinking process 5 reynolds number r e u d ρ μ ρ u and μ are the density of water incoming velocity and water dynamic viscosity respectively is extremely large and the wake is highly turbulent the classical problems of flow around a circular cylinder have been extensively studied in ocean engineering hydraulic engineering and aerospace engineering etc in these studies the flows around the cylinders with relatively larger aspect ratios can be assumed as flows around the cylinders with infinite submerged depth in which the influencing factors including the free surface the free end and the bottom boundary e g riverbed or seabed can be ignored experiments on flows around infinite cylinders have been carried out by graf and yulistiyanto 1998 roshko 1961 sabersky and acosta 1964 schewe 1983 sumer and fredsøe 1997 tritton 1959 numerical studies on the subject have been carried out by breuer 2000 catalano et al 2003 grigoriadis et al 2010 liang and papadakis 2007 lysenko et al 2013 pattenden et al 2005 perković et al 2013 travin et al 2000 the relationship between the mean drag coefficient and reynolds number and the flow field characteristics under different reynolds numbers are the foci in those studies one or two of the above influencing factors namely the free surface the free end and the bottom boundary are already taken into consideration in part of the present published articles the free surface influence is the key factor in the studies on the flow around interface piercing cylinder kawamura et al 2002 investigated the wave wake interaction about a surface piercing circular cylinder using large eddy simulation les based on a smagorinsky sub grid scale sgs model at re 27 000 with three different froude numbers fr 0 2 0 5 0 8 f r u g d g is the gravitational acceleration the study shows that as the froude number decreases the influence of the deformation of the free surface decreases and the value of mean drag coefficient approaches to the experimental value 1 2 obtained by szepessy and bearman 1992 for an infinite cylinder yu et al 2008 used les based on a smagorinsky sgs model and a volume of fluid vof method to investigate the flow past an interface piercing cylinder at different reynolds numbers up to r e 1 1 10 5 and different froude numbers up to fr 3 the study shows that the free surface attenuates the organized vortex shedding at the interface and the mean drag coefficient increases as re increases but decreases with increasing fr and there are similar numerical studies by kawamura et al 2002 suh et al 2011 yu et al 2008 koo et al 2014 xiao et al 2017 inoue et al 1993 conducted a towing tank experiment to investigate the characteristics of free surface turbulence for the cases with fr 0 8 re 2700 and fr 1 re 29000 results show that the periodic vortex shedding occurs in the deep flow while this periodic vortex shedding is attenuated and higher frequency fluctuations are more prominent near the interface chaplin and teigen 2003 carried out an experimental study of a free surface piercing cylinder with constant ratio of reynolds number to froude number re fr 2 79 10 5 their studies show that the total resistance coefficient reaches a maximum at fr 1 the above studies numerically and experimentally demonstrate that the periodic vortex shedding is suppressed by the free surface and the mean drag coefficient of free surface piercing cylinder is smaller than that of the infinite cylinder flow around cylinder with free end will form a three dimensional flow structure behind the cylinder and the presence of free end will significantly change the wake downstream and eventually alters the pressure filed and the hydrodynamic force on the cylinder fröhlich and rodi 2004 presented the work used large eddy simulation of the flow around a surface mounted circular cylinder with the aspect ratio ar 2 5 at re 43000 the results reveal the complicated vortex dynamics resulted from the interaction between the vortices separating from the side walls and the free end of the cylinder in addition an arch type vortex behind the cylinder is observed the studies by fröhlich and rodi 2004 pattenden et al 2007 taehunlee et al 2007 presented decreased mean drag coefficients of finite cylinders as compared to infinite length cylinders more numerical studies of flow around a finite cylinder with free end can be referred to krajnovi 2011 majumdar and rodi 1989 palau salvador et al 2010 okamoto and sunabashiri 1992 found that the flow pattern changes rapidly above aspect ratio ar 4 with vortex shedding changing from symmetric arch type to antisymmetric karman type kawamura et al 2008 s research found that the vortex shedding of karman vortex is related to the aspect ratio of cylinder and there is no periodic vortex shedding when the aspect ratio is small enough experimental studies by iungo et al 2012 okamoto and sunabashiri 1992 okamoto and yagita 1973 sakamoto and oiwake 1984 show that mean drag coefficients decrease with the reduction of aspect ratio investigations on the combined effects of the free surface and free end on finite cylinders have been given far less attention although the related structures exist widely in many engineering applications such as spar platform offshore floating wind turbine etc gonçalves et al 2015 presented thorough experimental results for varying aspect ratios ar 0 1 2 and varying reynolds numbers re 10000 50000 the results show the decreased drag force coefficient with decreasing aspect ratio as well as the decreased strouhal number s ty s ty f y d u f y is the frequency of transverse force with decreasing aspect ratio however the strouhal number s tx s tx f x d u f x is the frequency of streamwise force is dependent on reynolds number but not influenced by aspect ratio ar the effect of free end is dominant in the range of ar 0 5 even without karman street main characteristics around the cylinder in addition for cylinders with ar 0 2 alternating forces are not observed in the transverse direction fukuoka et al 2016 discussed in detail the influence of reynolds number aspect ratio and froude number on the hydrodynamic forces of circular cylinders the results show that the root mean square coefficients of streamwise and transverse forces decrease with decreasing reynolds number froude number and aspect ratio and the drag coefficient increases with increasing froude number and aspect ratio these conclusions are in agreement with gonçalves et al 2015 benitz et al 2016 investigated the flow around cylinder with more larger aspect ratio ar 1 19 on the base work of gonçalves et al 2015 their results show that drag coefficient decreases with decreasing aspect ratio and the free surface is dominant when aspect ratio is lower than 3 recently gonçalves et al 2018 carried out experiments regarding vortex induced vibration viv on floating circular cylinders with low aspect ratio based on the work by gonçalves et al 2015 which focused on the flow around a stationary cylinder with very low aspect ratio the results further verified the decrease in s ty as well as for drag and transverse forces with decreasing aspect ratio however to the best of our knowledge the study of the combination influence of free surface free end and the bottom boundary on current forces of cylinder with small aspect ratio is few for example in gonçalves et al 2015 s work the distance between the cylinder free end and the channel bottom is larger than 3 5d and the influence of the bottom boundary is considered to be ignorable however the riverbed or seabed influence cannot be ignored in real practice taking the sinking process of floating caisson for example the distance between the bottom of the floating caisson and the riverbed or seabed gradually approaches to zero and finally the floating caisson cuts into the riverbed or seabed therefore the influence of the riverbed or seabed cannot be ignored the formulas for calculating the hydraulic coefficients of simple cylindrical floating body structures in shallow water have been provided by drobyshevski 2004 sabuncu and calisal 1980 although the distance between the free end and the bottom has already been taken into accounted in these formulas they are still unable to accurately calculate the cylindrical hydrodynamic forces under complex conditions due to the excessive assumptions in their deduction process therefore the present work aims to study the characteristics of current forces on floating caisson with low aspect ratios and different reynolds numbers in the sinking process experimentally in which the combined influence of the free surface free end and bottom boundary riverbed or seabed will be considered 2 experiment setup as the sinking process of the floating caisson is one of the typical applications of the floating cylinder it was selected as the prototype of the experimental model in this study the determination of the scale ratio the size of the model cylinder the current velocity in experiments were based on a representative of floating caisson and the ranges of available experimental instruments in real practice the cross section dimension of floating caisson is tens of meters or even close to 100 m the maximum current velocity at the construction site can reach 3 m s in ocean and can reach 10 m s in the rivers in mountainous areas during the flood season as a representative a circular floating caisson with diameter 60 m maximum current velocity 10 m s was selected as the prototype experiments were carried out in the water flume of the deep water long span bridge laboratory in southwest jiaotong university in china the flume has a size of 60 m length 2 m width and 2 m depth the block effect will significantly influence the current forces on the structure and the critical block ratio of 0 2 was suggested by griffith et al 2011 in order to further minimize the block effect in our study a block ratio of 0 1 was chosen which then determined the diameter of the model of the floating caisson namely d 2 0 1 0 2 m therefore the length scale ratio λ l between the model and prototype was determined and calculated as λ l 0 2 60 1 300 accordingly the velocity scale ratio λ u can be calculated as λ u λ l 1 300 i e the maximum current velocity in our study was around 0 6 m s in addition the smaller current velocity generates the smaller current forces which cannot be precisely measured by the load cell also the velocity itself cannot be precisely measured by the velocimeter so the minimum current velocity was set as 0 1 m s the model of circular floating caisson was made of acrylic and had an outer diameter of 0 2 m and a height of 0 4 m it was fixed in the middle of the testing zone of the flume which is about 30 m away from the water inlet and the flow in the testing zone is stable shown in fig 1 a the bottom of the water flume is no slip boundary and it is not smooth enough to avoid the generation of the shear flow near the bottom here the influence of the shear flow on the current forces was not involved in this study therefore an acrylic plate with a wedge leading edge was installed above the flume bottom to minimize the influence of the shear flow the dimensions and installation position of the bottom plate are shown in fig 1 b in which the model cylinder was attached to the load cell hanging above the bottom plate the submerged depth is h and the gap between the free end of the cylinder and the bottom plate is e in experiments the aspect ratio ar was changed by ascending or descending the cylinder to change the submerged depth h but the submerged depth of the bottom plate was kept constant as h 0 3 m in order to characterize the boundary layer thickness above the bottom plate the velocities at the measuring positions of different depth right above the bottom plate were measured and are shown in fig 2 note that the velocity at each position is nondimensionalized by the velocity at the position of 0 5h results show that the velocity distribution profiles along the water depth under three different incoming velocities namely u 1 u 2 and u 3 agree with each other well the boundary layer thickness δ is about 4 5 cm and relative boundary layer thicknesses δ h and δ d are 0 15 and 0 22 respectively in which h and d are submerged depth of the bottom plate and cylinder diameter respectively a six degree of freedom load cell ati gamma si 32 2 5 the resolution is 1 160 n and the sensing range is 32 n the sampling frequency is set as 50 hz was used to acquire the current forces an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv the resolution is 0 5 mm s and the measuring range is 0 4 m s the sampling frequency is set as 50 hz was used to measure incoming velocity several tiny holes were drilled at the front surface at the rear surface and as well as at the bottom face of the cylinder to hold the pressure probes digital pressure sensor cy200 the resolution is 1 the upper limit of range is 50 kpa and the sampling frequency is set as 50 hz which are capable of monitoring the surface pressure on the cylinder shown in fig 3 in the experiment the current velocity u varies from 0 1 m s to 0 6 m s with the interval 0 1 m s and accordingly the reynolds number re changes from 2 104 to 1 2 105 which lies in the subcritical region and the froude number fr changes from 0 071 to 0 43 which is smaller than 1 the ratio of re to fr is equal to 2 8 10 5 the aspect ratio ar changes from 0 25 to 1 5 with the increment 0 25 and an additional case ar 1 4 is also involved altogether 48 cases were conducted in the experiment and the cases are named as case ar u in which ar and u are aspect ratio and current velocity respectively 3 analysis of the experimental results as representatives the time histories of the drag force f x t lift force or transverse force f y t and vertical force f z t for the case case 1 0 0 3 are demonstrated in fig 4 note that the gravity and the buoyance of the cylinder was zeroed out before the water being accelerated therefore the vertical force f z t measured by the load cell is the fluctuation of the vertical force periodic fluctuations with periods on the order of second to tens of seconds could be observed in the current force f y t and f z t it s believed that the fluctuations are introduced by the fluctuation of incoming velocity and the shedding of different type vortices also it can be observed that f x t f y t and f z t are of the same order therefore the current force components in x y z directions should be considered and require further investigations drag coefficient c d root square coefficient of the drag force c drms root square coefficient of the transverse force c lrms and root square coefficient of vertical force c zrms are respectively defined as 1 c d 2 f x ρ a u 2 2 c d r m s 2 f x f x t 2 1 2 ρ a u 2 3 c l r m s 2 f y f y t 2 1 2 ρ a u 2 4 c z r m s 2 f z f z t 2 1 2 ρ a u 2 in which f x f y and f z are mean values of f x t f y t and f z t respectively a is the frontal area of cylinder below still water level ρ is the density of water u is the free stream velocity strouhal numbers based on frequencies of transverse force and vertical force are defined as 5 s t y f y d u 6 s t z f z d u where f y and f z are the frequencies of transverse force and vertical force respectively pressure coefficient is defined as 7 c p p p 0 0 5 ρ u 2 in which p is the mean value of pressure p t at a monitoring point and p 0 is the pressure at the same monitoring point in still water 3 1 analysis of drag forces the relationship between drag coefficient c d and reynolds number re at different aspect ratios is shown in fig 5 drag coefficient is not only influenced by aspect ratio but also by reynolds number when ar is relatively smaller namely 0 25 a r 1 c d 0 8 is less affected by re increasing slightly as re increases when ar is relatively larger namely 1 a r 1 5 c d decreases significantly with increasing re especially in the range of smaller reynolds numbers and demonstrates a plateau at higher reynolds numbers results show the dependency of c d on re varies with aspect ratio which agrees with the conclusion obtained by fukuoka et al 2016 in their study c d increases with increasing re at small aspect ratio ar 0 25 but decreases with increasing re at large aspect ratio ar 1 25 fukuoka et al 2016 proposed a hypothesis to explain this phenomenon when the aspect ratio is small the effect of the free end is dominant and the reduction of pressure recovery from the recirculation behind the cylinder decreases the pressure on the rear surface of the cylinder and eventually increases the drag force as re increases the free end is slightly dominant when the aspect ratio is larger but the flow around the free end brings to vertical disturbances which cause the seperation of the boundary layer when re is smaller than its critical value in other words it causes reduction of c d when re increases it should be noted that the curves of ar 0 75 and ar 1 match well with each other in the range of 2 10 4 r e 1 2 10 5 and as well as the curves of ar 1 25 and ar 1 4 indicating that drag coefficients are not affected by ar in these narrow ranges of aspect ratio in other words the drag forces are proportional to the immerged depth of cylinder in addition three distinct increments between the c d curves can be observed when reynolds number is smaller for example at re 2 104 c d 0 5 for ar 0 5 and c d 0 6 for ar 0 75 the increment of c d is about 20 c d 0 6 for ar 1 and c d 1 for ar 1 25 the increment is about 67 c d 1 for ar 1 4 and c d 1 2 for ar 1 5 the increment is about 20 generally c d increases with the ar nonlinearly when ar 1 5 e d 0 indicating the bottom face of the cylinder touches the bottom plate and the free end disappears c d increases significantly in real practice the drag force on floating caisson gets larger and larger during the sinking process not only just because of the increase of the submerged depth but also because of the increase of the drag force coefficient at the instant when the caisson bottom cuts into the riverbed or seabed the drag force increases intensively and may cause some unexpected incidents which should receive extra attentions in order to further explore the reason why the drag coefficient increases with increasing aspect ratio the pressure distributions the monitoring points are shown in fig 3 along submerged depth on the front stagnation line θ 0 and rear θ 180 surface of the cylinder are compared with the results by achenbach 1968 and shown in fig 6 in achenbach 1968 s study the aspect ratio is large enough and the flow around the cylinder can be treated as the 2d case the pressure coefficients on the front stagnation line and the rear of the cylinder are 1 0 and 1 21 respectively however the flow filed is influenced by the free surface free end and the bottom plate simultaneously in this study accordingly the pressure on the cylinder surface is different generally the pressure coefficients at the rear of the cylinder are less than 0 and their absolute values are smaller than that of the 2d case namely 1 21 the pressure coefficients on the front stagnation line are equal to or slightly less than that of the 2d case namely 1 0 the obvious increase of the pressure coefficients negative behind the cylinder and slight decrease of the pressure coefficients positive on the front stagnation line eventually result in decreased drag coefficients when the aspect ratio is smaller i e ar 0 5 the absolute values of pressure coefficients behind the cylinder increase with increasing re as shown in fig 6 a note that only three pressure probes were submerged when ar 0 5 so in fig 6 a the data of the middle pressure probe were selected as representatives for comparison however the absolute values of pressure coefficients behind the cylinder decrease with increasing re when the aspect ratio is larger i e a r 1 as shown in fig 6 b d the pressure coefficients in the front of cylinder vary less intensively with reynolds number than the pressure coefficients at the rear of the cylinder the characteristics of pressure distribution justify the characteristics of drag coefficients namely the drag force coefficients increase with increasing reynolds number when ar is smaller but decrease with reynolds number when ar is larger to certain degree the pressure distribution verifies the conjecture proposed by fukuoka et al 2016 that the decrease in drag coefficients when ar is small is mainly due to smaller pressure coefficients absolute value behind the cylinder namely the pressure recovery behind the cylinder at small ar is weaken by the influence of the free end however in this study when ar is larger i e ar is close to 1 5 the bottom plate attenuates the free end effect i e the recirculation zone behind the cylinder is weakened or prevented by the bottom plate the amplitudes of the negative pressures behind the cylinder near the free end are larger than those with smaller ar due to the weakened recovery of the pressure caused by recirculation zone shown by comparison between fig 6 c and fig 6 d further the negative pressures behind the cylinder are almost uniformly distributed along the water depth direction around the free end shown in fig 6 d demonstrating the free end effect is almost completely prevented by the bottom plate the pressure coefficients near free surface in the front of the cylinder are larger than that of the 2d case this is due to the run up of free surface in the front of the cylinder an appreciable decrease of the pressure coefficients toward the free end is observed in the front of the cylinder shown in fig 6 a c it is caused by the downward accelerated fluid at the front surface near the free end of cylinder however the bottom of the cylinder touches the bottom plate and the free end effect disappears when ar 1 5 the lower velocity in the boundary layer shown in fig 2 is another reason for the pressure coefficient decrease around the free end in the front of the cylinder shown in fig 6 d the averaged drag coefficient c d is obtained by averaging the drag coefficients c d with the same aspect ratio at different reynolds numbers c d is compared with the previous studies conducted by benitz et al 2016 fukuoka et al 2016 gonçalves et al 2015 shown in fig 7 comparison shows c d has the same trend as the previous studies namely increases with increasing ar the discrepancies between previous studies and the present work are likely due to the fact that previous studies are not influenced by the bottom boundary and as well as the difference in reynolds number different froude number different turbulence intensity and profile of incoming flow velocity the root mean square coefficients of drag force c drms varying with reynolds number are shown in fig 8 a generally c drms decreases with increasing re when the free end effect disappears i e ar 1 5 but when 0 25 a r 1 5 c drms shows less regular changes and tends to 0 045 with the increase of re the averaged root mean square coefficients of the drag force c d r m s varying with aspect ratio are shown in fig 8 b c d r m s decreases with increasing ar when 0 25 a r 0 75 but increases with increasing ar when 0 75 a r 1 5 and c d r m s increases significantly when the free end touches the bottom plate i e ar 1 5 the fluctuation of drag force is mainly due to the alternating vortex shedding from two sides of the cylinder suh et al 2011 showed that free surface attenuates the vortex shedding near the free surface and this effect can make a decrease in c d r m s in addtion accordting to the studies by benitz et al 2016 the flow around the free end will form a recirculation zone behind the cylinder resulting in attenuation of karman vortex street near the free end which will also lead to the reduction of c d r m s in the present work when 0 25 a r 0 75 e d 0 75 the combined effects of the free surface and the free end are believed to be dominant because the free end of the cylinder is far from the bottom plate with the increase of ar the influence of free end increases and eventually causes decrease in c d r m s which is consistent with fukuoka et al 2016 as the ar further increases namely when 0 75 a r 1 5 0 e d 0 75 the gap between the free end and the bottom plate becomes smaller and accordingly the free end effects on vortex shedding become weaker at the same time even if the bottom plate is absent the effect of the free end will decrease with increasing ar these reasons are beneficial for a better development of vortex shedding and a better development of karman vortex street formation therefore are responsible for the increase of c d r m s when ar increases especially when ar 1 5 the free end effect disappears and c d r m s increases intensively which should be treated seriously in real practice 3 2 analysis of transverse forces the relationship between c lrms and re for each aspect ratio is demonstrated in fig 9 a it can be observed that 1 when ar 0 25 c lrms decreases with increasing re which is in agreement with fukuoka et al 2016 2 c lrms increases firstly then decreases with increasing re when 0 25 ar 1 4 3 when ar 1 5 e d 0 c lrms 0 4 at small re and decreases sharply with increasing re compared with the case ar 1 4 e d 0 1 c lrms of the case ar 1 5 e d 0 increases dramatically at small re i e re 2 10 4 which indicates that the vertical recirculation behind the cylinder generated by the free end significantly suppress the vortex shedding from the cylinder the averaged root mean coefficients of transverse forces c l r m s of each aspect ratio are compared with the results by gonçalves et al 2015 and shown in fig 9 b gonçalves et al 2015 s study shows c l r m s 0 06 when 0 75 a r 2 the variation trend of c l r m s obtained in the present work is in agreement with gonçalves et al 2015 when a r 1 but the specific values are different due to the difference in reynolds numbers and froude numbers it should be noted that the both values of c l r m s in present study and in gonçalves et al 2015 s study are slightly larger when ar 0 5 than the their nearby ar values respectively the fluctuation of transverse force is mainly introduced by the alternating vortex shedding from the two sides of the cylinder when ar 1 c l r m s increases sharply with ar which is due to the gradually full development of the karman vortex because the weakening of the free end effects the remarkable increase of transverse force should receive high attention in the sinking process of floating caisson especially at the instant when the caisson cuts into the riverbed or seabed 3 3 analysis of vertical forces the ratio of root mean square of vertical force f zstd to the buoyant force in still water f f is defined as β namely β f zstd f f values of β at each aspect ratio varying with reynolds number are shown in fig 10 β increases with increasing re indicating that the flow around the free end becomes more intensive at larger reynolds number it should be noted that β rises up to 14 when ar 0 25 at re 1 2 105 implying that the fluctuation amplitude can reach 14 of the buoyant force when the submerged depth is 1 4 of the diameter of the caisson at a larger current velocity which may introduce a risk of trim to caisson in the floating process fundamentally the fluctuation of vertical force is due to the fluctuating pressure on the free end surface and the fluctuating pressure is related to the flow filed around the free end which requires further investigation flows around the cylinders with small aspect ratios are supposed to have similar vortex structures the time averaged streamlines obtained by gonçalves et al 2015 for ar 0 3 at re 43000 is reproduced in fig 11 the relative positions to the center of the cylinder of the monitoring points 17 16 and 15 defined in fig 3 are calculated and marked on the free end surface of the cylinder used in the experiments conducted by gonçalves et al 2015 shown in fig 11 there are two main recirculation regions one is below the free end and another is in the near wake behind the cylinder point 17 is near the leading edge point 16 is at the center of free end face and point 15 is near the position of reattachment the mean pressures at the three points are different primarily because the relative locations of the three points to the vortex center are different moreover the mean pressures of the three points change with the aspect ratio and incoming velocity primarily because the vortex center and the vortex intensity change with the aspect ratio and incoming velocity or reynolds number the pressure coefficients defined in eq 7 of the measuring points 17 16 15 at each incoming velocity or reynolds number varying with aspect ratio are shown in fig 12 it can be observed that the pressure coefficients of point 17 are almost negative for all the cases in fig 12 a and the absolute values of pressure coefficients increase with increasing ar but basically not change with re except for ar 0 25 this phenomenon can be explained by the greater flow acceleration right below the free end as ar increases which causes a smaller pressure the pressure coefficients of the point 16 are negative and there is no monotonous change trend with increasing ar as shown in fig 12 b the pressure at point 16 is mainly influenced by the vortex position and vortex intensity as it is very close to the center of the vortex the pressure coefficients of the point 15 decrease with increasing ar shown in fig 12 c the pressure coefficients are positive when the aspect ratio is smaller i e ar 0 25 and are negative when ar 0 25 the positive pressure coefficients is believed to be the reattachment of fluids on the surface of free end for large aspect ratio the pressure coefficients almost not affected by reynolds number the average pressure coefficient c p is obtained by averaging the pressure coefficients c p with the same aspect ratio at different reynolds numbers shown in fig 13 when the aspect ratio is smaller i e ar 0 25 the averaged pressure coefficients of the points 16 and 17 are approximately the same and smaller than that of the point 15 when the aspect ratio is larger i e a r 1 25 the averaged coefficients of the points 16 and 15 are approximately the same and larger than that the point 17 it could be deduced that the vortex right under the free end moves upstream with the increase of ar then the point 17 gradually gets closer to the vortex center and the points 16 and 15 gradually get closer to or already locate in the flow reattachment area generally the pressure distribution on the free end face is not uniform the pressure coefficients of the point 15 is larger than that of 16 and both of them are larger than that of 17 which indicating that an overturn moment around y axis in xz plane defined in fig 1 is generated therefore the potential risk of the overturn of the floating caisson should not be ignored in the real practice 3 4 analysis of frequencies the widely used fast fourier transformation fft method was employed to compute the frequency of current force to be exactly the function fft in matlab software was used and the detailed codes and calculation procedures are omitted here for brevity strouhal numbers sty based on the frequency of transverse force of each aspect ratio varying with reynolds number are shown in fig 14 in which s ty decreases slightly with the increase of re the averaged strouhal numbers s t y obtained by averaging the strouhal number s ty with the same aspect ratio at different reynolds are compared with the results of gonçalves et al 2015 shown in fig 15 comparison shows both the present results and the results by gonçalves et al 2015 increase with ar but the specific values are different when a r 0 5 the fluctuation of transverse force is dominant by low frequency and the present results are slightly smaller than those by gonçalves et al 2015 the reason is believed to be the difference in reynolds numbers in above two experiments when 0 5 a r 1 5 with the increase of ar the present results increase more rapidly and become much larger than those by gonçalves et al 2015 as mentioned earlier when the free end approaches to the bottom plate the effect of free end decreases and the development of karman vortex street improves quickly which makes the s t y increase more rapidly the increased fluctuation frequency of transverse force is noteworthy in the sinking process of caisson strouhal numbers s tz based on the frequency of the vertical force of each aspect ratio varying with reynolds number are shown in fig 16 in which s tz varies from 0 02 to 0 1 approximately and as compared with the typical value s ty 0 2 for an infinite cylinder the fluctuation of vertical force is dominated by low frequency component iungo et al 2012 reported that s tz 0 07 0 08 for the pressure measured at the free end of the cylinder it can be observed that s tz is almost not influenced by aspect ratio but decreases with increasing reynolds number further the frequency of vertical force of each aspect ratio i e f z varying with reynolds number is shown in fig 17 which indicates that f z is not affected by both the aspect ratio and reynolds number 4 conclusions physical experiments were carried out to investigate the characteristics of current forces of floating caisson model the combined effects of the free surface free end and the riverbed or seabed were considered simultaneously the drag force transverse and vertical forces and surface pressures on cylinder were measured at reynolds number re 2 104 1 2 105 for cylinder with aspect ratio ar 0 25 1 5 the main conclusions are summarized as 1 drag coefficient c d increases with ar increases and increases abruptly at the instant when the free end touches the bottom plate c d increases slightly with increasing re when 0 25 ar 1 but decreases to a plateau when 1 ar 1 5 ar 2 the pressure coefficients right behind the cylinder are basically negative and their absolute values are smaller than that of 2d cylinder the pressure coefficients in the front of the cylinder are equal to or less than that of 2d cylinder the pressure coefficients near free surface in the front of cylinder are larger than 2d cylinder because of run up and the pressure coefficients near the free end are less than 1 because of the free end effect when the free end disappears the pressure coefficients near the bottom of cylinder are less than 1 because of the lower flow velocity in the boundary layer the main reason for the smaller drag coefficient in this study is the pressure recovery at the rear of the cylinder from the recirculation behind the cylinder before the free end touches the bottom plate 3 the averaged root square coefficient of drag force c d r m s decreases slightly with increasing ar when 0 25 ar 0 75 and increases with increasing ar when 0 75 ar 1 5 and suddenly increases when the free end touches bottom plate generally c d r m s increases as re increases 4 the root square coefficient of transverse force c lrms decreases slightly with increasing re when ar 0 25 c lrms first increases and then decreases with increasing ar when 0 25 ar 1 4 and it decreases significantly with increasing re when ar 1 5 c l r m s has a relatively larger value when ar 0 5 it increases with increasing ar when 1 ar 1 5 and it has the largest value when the free end touches the bottom plate 5 the ratio of root mean square of vertical force to the buoyant force in still water decreases with increasing ar and increases with re its value can reach up to 14 when ar 0 25 at re 1 2 105 which may cause trim of floating caisson on the cylinder free end surface the pressure coefficient near the leading edge is smaller than that of trailing edge the incoming velocity and the aspect ratio affect the vortex location and intensity which eventually causes nonuniformity of pressure distribution on the free end surface 6 the frequency of the transverse force increases with ar and slightly decreases with re and is dominated by low frequency component when ar is small the frequency of the vertical forces is not affected by both the aspect ratio and reynolds number and is dominated by low frequency component too 7 when ar gets much close to 1 5 i e the cylinder almost touches the bottom plate the bottom plate changes the flow field and current forces greatly a the bottom plate generates the boundary layer in which the incoming velocity is lowered and causes smaller pressure coefficients in the front of the cylinder more importantly the bottom plate weakens the recirculation zone behind the cylinder caused by the free end and generates a larger negative pressure behind the cylinder which makes the drag coefficient c d increase significantly especially for the cases with smaller re b c d decreases obviously with the increase of re c the weakening of the recirculation zone behind the cylinder caused by the bottom plate also provides advantages of better or fully development for the vortex shedding which makes the c d r m s and c l r m s increase sharply and also makes the vortex shedding frequency increase remarkably d the approaching to the bottom plate increases the current velocity passing through the gap between the free end and the bottom plate which results in the upstream movement of the vortex center and finally increases the absolute values of the pressure negative at the positions near the leading and tailing edges on the free end surface therefore at the instant when the floating cylinder touches the bottom the remarkable changes of flow filed and current force should receive extra attention during the sinking process in real practice the results of the present work are beneficial for understanding changes of the current forces on floating cylinder during the sinking process although the floating caisson was chosen as the prototype the results can also provide references for the similar ocean structures such as cofferdams in bridge engineering floating foundations of offshore wind turbines cylinders of jacket platform cylinders of spar platform etc based on cfd simulation flow field analysis of the sinking process of floating cylinder is capable of providing more sufficient information for fully

22897,the three dimensional flow around a floating cylinder during the sinking process is influenced by the free surface the free end and the riverbed or seabed which result in complicated current forces on the floating cylinder the physical experiments were carried out to investigate the drag forces transverse forces vertical forces and as well as frequencies of the transverse and vertical forces during the sinking process the aspect ratio ar of the submerged depth to the diameter of the model cylinder varies from 0 25 to 1 5 and the reynolds number re ranges from 2 104 1 2 105 results show that drag coefficients root mean square coefficients of drag and transverse forces generally increase with ar and increase significantly at the instant when the free end touches the seabed which should receive extra attention during the sinking process of cylinder the vertical force ratio decreases with ar fluctuation frequency of the transverse force increases with ar but fluctuation frequency of vertical force is basically not affected by ar also the pressure distributions on the front rear and bottom surfaces of the cylinder were measured and further analyzed to provide a better understanding of the variation of current forces with ar and re keywords physical experiment floating cylinder current force free surface free end water bottom effect 1 introduction floating caisson which plays a role of discharging water and providing a dry construction environment is an important measure to ensure the safety and quality of deep water bridge foundation construction as summarized by krishna et al 2004 the construction and installation of caisson generally consist of the flowing stage i e a being constructed at the dockside before being towed to site it is the first stage b being towed to site c installation of mooring system d caisson construction as construction progressed the draft of the caisson increases continuously until touchdown e touchdown and submergence the touchdown sequence is carefully orchestrated to ensure that the caisson is landed at the target location in the caisson construction process the rate of sinking process is slow as compared to the flow velocity therefore the dynamic sinking process can be simulated by a series of quasi static states with different draft the current force on floating caisson is extremely large because of its gigantic dimension and large current velocity at the construction site the cross section size of the floating caisson is as larger as tens of meters and the current velocity can reach 3 m s in ocean and may reach 10 m s in the river in mountainous area during flood season more importantly the current force of the floating caisson changing with the immersion depth during the sinking process not only introduces significant deviation from the target position but also causes intensive vibration and the potential risk of fatigue fracture of mooring system similar situations occur on other ocean structures such as floating foundations of offshore wind turbines cylinders of jacket platform cylinders of spar platform etc therefore it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive study on the characteristics of hydrodynamic forces on the floating caisson in the sinking process flow around the floating caisson has the following characteristics in the sinking process 1 the aspect ratio ar h d h and d are respectively the immerged depth and diameter of a floating caisson is very small and changes continuously in the sinking process the transverse section size of floating caisson is tens of meters or even close to 100 m while the water depth of bridge site varies from several meters to tens of meters 2 the influence of free surface cannot be ignored because the top of the floating caisson is higher than the free surface in the sinking process 3 the influence of the free end of floating caisson cannot be ignored 4 the effect of the riverbed or seabed on flow field and hydrodynamic forces must be considered when the free end approaches to the riverbed or seabed in the sinking process 5 reynolds number r e u d ρ μ ρ u and μ are the density of water incoming velocity and water dynamic viscosity respectively is extremely large and the wake is highly turbulent the classical problems of flow around a circular cylinder have been extensively studied in ocean engineering hydraulic engineering and aerospace engineering etc in these studies the flows around the cylinders with relatively larger aspect ratios can be assumed as flows around the cylinders with infinite submerged depth in which the influencing factors including the free surface the free end and the bottom boundary e g riverbed or seabed can be ignored experiments on flows around infinite cylinders have been carried out by graf and yulistiyanto 1998 roshko 1961 sabersky and acosta 1964 schewe 1983 sumer and fredsøe 1997 tritton 1959 numerical studies on the subject have been carried out by breuer 2000 catalano et al 2003 grigoriadis et al 2010 liang and papadakis 2007 lysenko et al 2013 pattenden et al 2005 perković et al 2013 travin et al 2000 the relationship between the mean drag coefficient and reynolds number and the flow field characteristics under different reynolds numbers are the foci in those studies one or two of the above influencing factors namely the free surface the free end and the bottom boundary are already taken into consideration in part of the present published articles the free surface influence is the key factor in the studies on the flow around interface piercing cylinder kawamura et al 2002 investigated the wave wake interaction about a surface piercing circular cylinder using large eddy simulation les based on a smagorinsky sub grid scale sgs model at re 27 000 with three different froude numbers fr 0 2 0 5 0 8 f r u g d g is the gravitational acceleration the study shows that as the froude number decreases the influence of the deformation of the free surface decreases and the value of mean drag coefficient approaches to the experimental value 1 2 obtained by szepessy and bearman 1992 for an infinite cylinder yu et al 2008 used les based on a smagorinsky sgs model and a volume of fluid vof method to investigate the flow past an interface piercing cylinder at different reynolds numbers up to r e 1 1 10 5 and different froude numbers up to fr 3 the study shows that the free surface attenuates the organized vortex shedding at the interface and the mean drag coefficient increases as re increases but decreases with increasing fr and there are similar numerical studies by kawamura et al 2002 suh et al 2011 yu et al 2008 koo et al 2014 xiao et al 2017 inoue et al 1993 conducted a towing tank experiment to investigate the characteristics of free surface turbulence for the cases with fr 0 8 re 2700 and fr 1 re 29000 results show that the periodic vortex shedding occurs in the deep flow while this periodic vortex shedding is attenuated and higher frequency fluctuations are more prominent near the interface chaplin and teigen 2003 carried out an experimental study of a free surface piercing cylinder with constant ratio of reynolds number to froude number re fr 2 79 10 5 their studies show that the total resistance coefficient reaches a maximum at fr 1 the above studies numerically and experimentally demonstrate that the periodic vortex shedding is suppressed by the free surface and the mean drag coefficient of free surface piercing cylinder is smaller than that of the infinite cylinder flow around cylinder with free end will form a three dimensional flow structure behind the cylinder and the presence of free end will significantly change the wake downstream and eventually alters the pressure filed and the hydrodynamic force on the cylinder fröhlich and rodi 2004 presented the work used large eddy simulation of the flow around a surface mounted circular cylinder with the aspect ratio ar 2 5 at re 43000 the results reveal the complicated vortex dynamics resulted from the interaction between the vortices separating from the side walls and the free end of the cylinder in addition an arch type vortex behind the cylinder is observed the studies by fröhlich and rodi 2004 pattenden et al 2007 taehunlee et al 2007 presented decreased mean drag coefficients of finite cylinders as compared to infinite length cylinders more numerical studies of flow around a finite cylinder with free end can be referred to krajnovi 2011 majumdar and rodi 1989 palau salvador et al 2010 okamoto and sunabashiri 1992 found that the flow pattern changes rapidly above aspect ratio ar 4 with vortex shedding changing from symmetric arch type to antisymmetric karman type kawamura et al 2008 s research found that the vortex shedding of karman vortex is related to the aspect ratio of cylinder and there is no periodic vortex shedding when the aspect ratio is small enough experimental studies by iungo et al 2012 okamoto and sunabashiri 1992 okamoto and yagita 1973 sakamoto and oiwake 1984 show that mean drag coefficients decrease with the reduction of aspect ratio investigations on the combined effects of the free surface and free end on finite cylinders have been given far less attention although the related structures exist widely in many engineering applications such as spar platform offshore floating wind turbine etc gonçalves et al 2015 presented thorough experimental results for varying aspect ratios ar 0 1 2 and varying reynolds numbers re 10000 50000 the results show the decreased drag force coefficient with decreasing aspect ratio as well as the decreased strouhal number s ty s ty f y d u f y is the frequency of transverse force with decreasing aspect ratio however the strouhal number s tx s tx f x d u f x is the frequency of streamwise force is dependent on reynolds number but not influenced by aspect ratio ar the effect of free end is dominant in the range of ar 0 5 even without karman street main characteristics around the cylinder in addition for cylinders with ar 0 2 alternating forces are not observed in the transverse direction fukuoka et al 2016 discussed in detail the influence of reynolds number aspect ratio and froude number on the hydrodynamic forces of circular cylinders the results show that the root mean square coefficients of streamwise and transverse forces decrease with decreasing reynolds number froude number and aspect ratio and the drag coefficient increases with increasing froude number and aspect ratio these conclusions are in agreement with gonçalves et al 2015 benitz et al 2016 investigated the flow around cylinder with more larger aspect ratio ar 1 19 on the base work of gonçalves et al 2015 their results show that drag coefficient decreases with decreasing aspect ratio and the free surface is dominant when aspect ratio is lower than 3 recently gonçalves et al 2018 carried out experiments regarding vortex induced vibration viv on floating circular cylinders with low aspect ratio based on the work by gonçalves et al 2015 which focused on the flow around a stationary cylinder with very low aspect ratio the results further verified the decrease in s ty as well as for drag and transverse forces with decreasing aspect ratio however to the best of our knowledge the study of the combination influence of free surface free end and the bottom boundary on current forces of cylinder with small aspect ratio is few for example in gonçalves et al 2015 s work the distance between the cylinder free end and the channel bottom is larger than 3 5d and the influence of the bottom boundary is considered to be ignorable however the riverbed or seabed influence cannot be ignored in real practice taking the sinking process of floating caisson for example the distance between the bottom of the floating caisson and the riverbed or seabed gradually approaches to zero and finally the floating caisson cuts into the riverbed or seabed therefore the influence of the riverbed or seabed cannot be ignored the formulas for calculating the hydraulic coefficients of simple cylindrical floating body structures in shallow water have been provided by drobyshevski 2004 sabuncu and calisal 1980 although the distance between the free end and the bottom has already been taken into accounted in these formulas they are still unable to accurately calculate the cylindrical hydrodynamic forces under complex conditions due to the excessive assumptions in their deduction process therefore the present work aims to study the characteristics of current forces on floating caisson with low aspect ratios and different reynolds numbers in the sinking process experimentally in which the combined influence of the free surface free end and bottom boundary riverbed or seabed will be considered 2 experiment setup as the sinking process of the floating caisson is one of the typical applications of the floating cylinder it was selected as the prototype of the experimental model in this study the determination of the scale ratio the size of the model cylinder the current velocity in experiments were based on a representative of floating caisson and the ranges of available experimental instruments in real practice the cross section dimension of floating caisson is tens of meters or even close to 100 m the maximum current velocity at the construction site can reach 3 m s in ocean and can reach 10 m s in the rivers in mountainous areas during the flood season as a representative a circular floating caisson with diameter 60 m maximum current velocity 10 m s was selected as the prototype experiments were carried out in the water flume of the deep water long span bridge laboratory in southwest jiaotong university in china the flume has a size of 60 m length 2 m width and 2 m depth the block effect will significantly influence the current forces on the structure and the critical block ratio of 0 2 was suggested by griffith et al 2011 in order to further minimize the block effect in our study a block ratio of 0 1 was chosen which then determined the diameter of the model of the floating caisson namely d 2 0 1 0 2 m therefore the length scale ratio λ l between the model and prototype was determined and calculated as λ l 0 2 60 1 300 accordingly the velocity scale ratio λ u can be calculated as λ u λ l 1 300 i e the maximum current velocity in our study was around 0 6 m s in addition the smaller current velocity generates the smaller current forces which cannot be precisely measured by the load cell also the velocity itself cannot be precisely measured by the velocimeter so the minimum current velocity was set as 0 1 m s the model of circular floating caisson was made of acrylic and had an outer diameter of 0 2 m and a height of 0 4 m it was fixed in the middle of the testing zone of the flume which is about 30 m away from the water inlet and the flow in the testing zone is stable shown in fig 1 a the bottom of the water flume is no slip boundary and it is not smooth enough to avoid the generation of the shear flow near the bottom here the influence of the shear flow on the current forces was not involved in this study therefore an acrylic plate with a wedge leading edge was installed above the flume bottom to minimize the influence of the shear flow the dimensions and installation position of the bottom plate are shown in fig 1 b in which the model cylinder was attached to the load cell hanging above the bottom plate the submerged depth is h and the gap between the free end of the cylinder and the bottom plate is e in experiments the aspect ratio ar was changed by ascending or descending the cylinder to change the submerged depth h but the submerged depth of the bottom plate was kept constant as h 0 3 m in order to characterize the boundary layer thickness above the bottom plate the velocities at the measuring positions of different depth right above the bottom plate were measured and are shown in fig 2 note that the velocity at each position is nondimensionalized by the velocity at the position of 0 5h results show that the velocity distribution profiles along the water depth under three different incoming velocities namely u 1 u 2 and u 3 agree with each other well the boundary layer thickness δ is about 4 5 cm and relative boundary layer thicknesses δ h and δ d are 0 15 and 0 22 respectively in which h and d are submerged depth of the bottom plate and cylinder diameter respectively a six degree of freedom load cell ati gamma si 32 2 5 the resolution is 1 160 n and the sensing range is 32 n the sampling frequency is set as 50 hz was used to acquire the current forces an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv the resolution is 0 5 mm s and the measuring range is 0 4 m s the sampling frequency is set as 50 hz was used to measure incoming velocity several tiny holes were drilled at the front surface at the rear surface and as well as at the bottom face of the cylinder to hold the pressure probes digital pressure sensor cy200 the resolution is 1 the upper limit of range is 50 kpa and the sampling frequency is set as 50 hz which are capable of monitoring the surface pressure on the cylinder shown in fig 3 in the experiment the current velocity u varies from 0 1 m s to 0 6 m s with the interval 0 1 m s and accordingly the reynolds number re changes from 2 104 to 1 2 105 which lies in the subcritical region and the froude number fr changes from 0 071 to 0 43 which is smaller than 1 the ratio of re to fr is equal to 2 8 10 5 the aspect ratio ar changes from 0 25 to 1 5 with the increment 0 25 and an additional case ar 1 4 is also involved altogether 48 cases were conducted in the experiment and the cases are named as case ar u in which ar and u are aspect ratio and current velocity respectively 3 analysis of the experimental results as representatives the time histories of the drag force f x t lift force or transverse force f y t and vertical force f z t for the case case 1 0 0 3 are demonstrated in fig 4 note that the gravity and the buoyance of the cylinder was zeroed out before the water being accelerated therefore the vertical force f z t measured by the load cell is the fluctuation of the vertical force periodic fluctuations with periods on the order of second to tens of seconds could be observed in the current force f y t and f z t it s believed that the fluctuations are introduced by the fluctuation of incoming velocity and the shedding of different type vortices also it can be observed that f x t f y t and f z t are of the same order therefore the current force components in x y z directions should be considered and require further investigations drag coefficient c d root square coefficient of the drag force c drms root square coefficient of the transverse force c lrms and root square coefficient of vertical force c zrms are respectively defined as 1 c d 2 f x ρ a u 2 2 c d r m s 2 f x f x t 2 1 2 ρ a u 2 3 c l r m s 2 f y f y t 2 1 2 ρ a u 2 4 c z r m s 2 f z f z t 2 1 2 ρ a u 2 in which f x f y and f z are mean values of f x t f y t and f z t respectively a is the frontal area of cylinder below still water level ρ is the density of water u is the free stream velocity strouhal numbers based on frequencies of transverse force and vertical force are defined as 5 s t y f y d u 6 s t z f z d u where f y and f z are the frequencies of transverse force and vertical force respectively pressure coefficient is defined as 7 c p p p 0 0 5 ρ u 2 in which p is the mean value of pressure p t at a monitoring point and p 0 is the pressure at the same monitoring point in still water 3 1 analysis of drag forces the relationship between drag coefficient c d and reynolds number re at different aspect ratios is shown in fig 5 drag coefficient is not only influenced by aspect ratio but also by reynolds number when ar is relatively smaller namely 0 25 a r 1 c d 0 8 is less affected by re increasing slightly as re increases when ar is relatively larger namely 1 a r 1 5 c d decreases significantly with increasing re especially in the range of smaller reynolds numbers and demonstrates a plateau at higher reynolds numbers results show the dependency of c d on re varies with aspect ratio which agrees with the conclusion obtained by fukuoka et al 2016 in their study c d increases with increasing re at small aspect ratio ar 0 25 but decreases with increasing re at large aspect ratio ar 1 25 fukuoka et al 2016 proposed a hypothesis to explain this phenomenon when the aspect ratio is small the effect of the free end is dominant and the reduction of pressure recovery from the recirculation behind the cylinder decreases the pressure on the rear surface of the cylinder and eventually increases the drag force as re increases the free end is slightly dominant when the aspect ratio is larger but the flow around the free end brings to vertical disturbances which cause the seperation of the boundary layer when re is smaller than its critical value in other words it causes reduction of c d when re increases it should be noted that the curves of ar 0 75 and ar 1 match well with each other in the range of 2 10 4 r e 1 2 10 5 and as well as the curves of ar 1 25 and ar 1 4 indicating that drag coefficients are not affected by ar in these narrow ranges of aspect ratio in other words the drag forces are proportional to the immerged depth of cylinder in addition three distinct increments between the c d curves can be observed when reynolds number is smaller for example at re 2 104 c d 0 5 for ar 0 5 and c d 0 6 for ar 0 75 the increment of c d is about 20 c d 0 6 for ar 1 and c d 1 for ar 1 25 the increment is about 67 c d 1 for ar 1 4 and c d 1 2 for ar 1 5 the increment is about 20 generally c d increases with the ar nonlinearly when ar 1 5 e d 0 indicating the bottom face of the cylinder touches the bottom plate and the free end disappears c d increases significantly in real practice the drag force on floating caisson gets larger and larger during the sinking process not only just because of the increase of the submerged depth but also because of the increase of the drag force coefficient at the instant when the caisson bottom cuts into the riverbed or seabed the drag force increases intensively and may cause some unexpected incidents which should receive extra attentions in order to further explore the reason why the drag coefficient increases with increasing aspect ratio the pressure distributions the monitoring points are shown in fig 3 along submerged depth on the front stagnation line θ 0 and rear θ 180 surface of the cylinder are compared with the results by achenbach 1968 and shown in fig 6 in achenbach 1968 s study the aspect ratio is large enough and the flow around the cylinder can be treated as the 2d case the pressure coefficients on the front stagnation line and the rear of the cylinder are 1 0 and 1 21 respectively however the flow filed is influenced by the free surface free end and the bottom plate simultaneously in this study accordingly the pressure on the cylinder surface is different generally the pressure coefficients at the rear of the cylinder are less than 0 and their absolute values are smaller than that of the 2d case namely 1 21 the pressure coefficients on the front stagnation line are equal to or slightly less than that of the 2d case namely 1 0 the obvious increase of the pressure coefficients negative behind the cylinder and slight decrease of the pressure coefficients positive on the front stagnation line eventually result in decreased drag coefficients when the aspect ratio is smaller i e ar 0 5 the absolute values of pressure coefficients behind the cylinder increase with increasing re as shown in fig 6 a note that only three pressure probes were submerged when ar 0 5 so in fig 6 a the data of the middle pressure probe were selected as representatives for comparison however the absolute values of pressure coefficients behind the cylinder decrease with increasing re when the aspect ratio is larger i e a r 1 as shown in fig 6 b d the pressure coefficients in the front of cylinder vary less intensively with reynolds number than the pressure coefficients at the rear of the cylinder the characteristics of pressure distribution justify the characteristics of drag coefficients namely the drag force coefficients increase with increasing reynolds number when ar is smaller but decrease with reynolds number when ar is larger to certain degree the pressure distribution verifies the conjecture proposed by fukuoka et al 2016 that the decrease in drag coefficients when ar is small is mainly due to smaller pressure coefficients absolute value behind the cylinder namely the pressure recovery behind the cylinder at small ar is weaken by the influence of the free end however in this study when ar is larger i e ar is close to 1 5 the bottom plate attenuates the free end effect i e the recirculation zone behind the cylinder is weakened or prevented by the bottom plate the amplitudes of the negative pressures behind the cylinder near the free end are larger than those with smaller ar due to the weakened recovery of the pressure caused by recirculation zone shown by comparison between fig 6 c and fig 6 d further the negative pressures behind the cylinder are almost uniformly distributed along the water depth direction around the free end shown in fig 6 d demonstrating the free end effect is almost completely prevented by the bottom plate the pressure coefficients near free surface in the front of the cylinder are larger than that of the 2d case this is due to the run up of free surface in the front of the cylinder an appreciable decrease of the pressure coefficients toward the free end is observed in the front of the cylinder shown in fig 6 a c it is caused by the downward accelerated fluid at the front surface near the free end of cylinder however the bottom of the cylinder touches the bottom plate and the free end effect disappears when ar 1 5 the lower velocity in the boundary layer shown in fig 2 is another reason for the pressure coefficient decrease around the free end in the front of the cylinder shown in fig 6 d the averaged drag coefficient c d is obtained by averaging the drag coefficients c d with the same aspect ratio at different reynolds numbers c d is compared with the previous studies conducted by benitz et al 2016 fukuoka et al 2016 gonçalves et al 2015 shown in fig 7 comparison shows c d has the same trend as the previous studies namely increases with increasing ar the discrepancies between previous studies and the present work are likely due to the fact that previous studies are not influenced by the bottom boundary and as well as the difference in reynolds number different froude number different turbulence intensity and profile of incoming flow velocity the root mean square coefficients of drag force c drms varying with reynolds number are shown in fig 8 a generally c drms decreases with increasing re when the free end effect disappears i e ar 1 5 but when 0 25 a r 1 5 c drms shows less regular changes and tends to 0 045 with the increase of re the averaged root mean square coefficients of the drag force c d r m s varying with aspect ratio are shown in fig 8 b c d r m s decreases with increasing ar when 0 25 a r 0 75 but increases with increasing ar when 0 75 a r 1 5 and c d r m s increases significantly when the free end touches the bottom plate i e ar 1 5 the fluctuation of drag force is mainly due to the alternating vortex shedding from two sides of the cylinder suh et al 2011 showed that free surface attenuates the vortex shedding near the free surface and this effect can make a decrease in c d r m s in addtion accordting to the studies by benitz et al 2016 the flow around the free end will form a recirculation zone behind the cylinder resulting in attenuation of karman vortex street near the free end which will also lead to the reduction of c d r m s in the present work when 0 25 a r 0 75 e d 0 75 the combined effects of the free surface and the free end are believed to be dominant because the free end of the cylinder is far from the bottom plate with the increase of ar the influence of free end increases and eventually causes decrease in c d r m s which is consistent with fukuoka et al 2016 as the ar further increases namely when 0 75 a r 1 5 0 e d 0 75 the gap between the free end and the bottom plate becomes smaller and accordingly the free end effects on vortex shedding become weaker at the same time even if the bottom plate is absent the effect of the free end will decrease with increasing ar these reasons are beneficial for a better development of vortex shedding and a better development of karman vortex street formation therefore are responsible for the increase of c d r m s when ar increases especially when ar 1 5 the free end effect disappears and c d r m s increases intensively which should be treated seriously in real practice 3 2 analysis of transverse forces the relationship between c lrms and re for each aspect ratio is demonstrated in fig 9 a it can be observed that 1 when ar 0 25 c lrms decreases with increasing re which is in agreement with fukuoka et al 2016 2 c lrms increases firstly then decreases with increasing re when 0 25 ar 1 4 3 when ar 1 5 e d 0 c lrms 0 4 at small re and decreases sharply with increasing re compared with the case ar 1 4 e d 0 1 c lrms of the case ar 1 5 e d 0 increases dramatically at small re i e re 2 10 4 which indicates that the vertical recirculation behind the cylinder generated by the free end significantly suppress the vortex shedding from the cylinder the averaged root mean coefficients of transverse forces c l r m s of each aspect ratio are compared with the results by gonçalves et al 2015 and shown in fig 9 b gonçalves et al 2015 s study shows c l r m s 0 06 when 0 75 a r 2 the variation trend of c l r m s obtained in the present work is in agreement with gonçalves et al 2015 when a r 1 but the specific values are different due to the difference in reynolds numbers and froude numbers it should be noted that the both values of c l r m s in present study and in gonçalves et al 2015 s study are slightly larger when ar 0 5 than the their nearby ar values respectively the fluctuation of transverse force is mainly introduced by the alternating vortex shedding from the two sides of the cylinder when ar 1 c l r m s increases sharply with ar which is due to the gradually full development of the karman vortex because the weakening of the free end effects the remarkable increase of transverse force should receive high attention in the sinking process of floating caisson especially at the instant when the caisson cuts into the riverbed or seabed 3 3 analysis of vertical forces the ratio of root mean square of vertical force f zstd to the buoyant force in still water f f is defined as β namely β f zstd f f values of β at each aspect ratio varying with reynolds number are shown in fig 10 β increases with increasing re indicating that the flow around the free end becomes more intensive at larger reynolds number it should be noted that β rises up to 14 when ar 0 25 at re 1 2 105 implying that the fluctuation amplitude can reach 14 of the buoyant force when the submerged depth is 1 4 of the diameter of the caisson at a larger current velocity which may introduce a risk of trim to caisson in the floating process fundamentally the fluctuation of vertical force is due to the fluctuating pressure on the free end surface and the fluctuating pressure is related to the flow filed around the free end which requires further investigation flows around the cylinders with small aspect ratios are supposed to have similar vortex structures the time averaged streamlines obtained by gonçalves et al 2015 for ar 0 3 at re 43000 is reproduced in fig 11 the relative positions to the center of the cylinder of the monitoring points 17 16 and 15 defined in fig 3 are calculated and marked on the free end surface of the cylinder used in the experiments conducted by gonçalves et al 2015 shown in fig 11 there are two main recirculation regions one is below the free end and another is in the near wake behind the cylinder point 17 is near the leading edge point 16 is at the center of free end face and point 15 is near the position of reattachment the mean pressures at the three points are different primarily because the relative locations of the three points to the vortex center are different moreover the mean pressures of the three points change with the aspect ratio and incoming velocity primarily because the vortex center and the vortex intensity change with the aspect ratio and incoming velocity or reynolds number the pressure coefficients defined in eq 7 of the measuring points 17 16 15 at each incoming velocity or reynolds number varying with aspect ratio are shown in fig 12 it can be observed that the pressure coefficients of point 17 are almost negative for all the cases in fig 12 a and the absolute values of pressure coefficients increase with increasing ar but basically not change with re except for ar 0 25 this phenomenon can be explained by the greater flow acceleration right below the free end as ar increases which causes a smaller pressure the pressure coefficients of the point 16 are negative and there is no monotonous change trend with increasing ar as shown in fig 12 b the pressure at point 16 is mainly influenced by the vortex position and vortex intensity as it is very close to the center of the vortex the pressure coefficients of the point 15 decrease with increasing ar shown in fig 12 c the pressure coefficients are positive when the aspect ratio is smaller i e ar 0 25 and are negative when ar 0 25 the positive pressure coefficients is believed to be the reattachment of fluids on the surface of free end for large aspect ratio the pressure coefficients almost not affected by reynolds number the average pressure coefficient c p is obtained by averaging the pressure coefficients c p with the same aspect ratio at different reynolds numbers shown in fig 13 when the aspect ratio is smaller i e ar 0 25 the averaged pressure coefficients of the points 16 and 17 are approximately the same and smaller than that of the point 15 when the aspect ratio is larger i e a r 1 25 the averaged coefficients of the points 16 and 15 are approximately the same and larger than that the point 17 it could be deduced that the vortex right under the free end moves upstream with the increase of ar then the point 17 gradually gets closer to the vortex center and the points 16 and 15 gradually get closer to or already locate in the flow reattachment area generally the pressure distribution on the free end face is not uniform the pressure coefficients of the point 15 is larger than that of 16 and both of them are larger than that of 17 which indicating that an overturn moment around y axis in xz plane defined in fig 1 is generated therefore the potential risk of the overturn of the floating caisson should not be ignored in the real practice 3 4 analysis of frequencies the widely used fast fourier transformation fft method was employed to compute the frequency of current force to be exactly the function fft in matlab software was used and the detailed codes and calculation procedures are omitted here for brevity strouhal numbers sty based on the frequency of transverse force of each aspect ratio varying with reynolds number are shown in fig 14 in which s ty decreases slightly with the increase of re the averaged strouhal numbers s t y obtained by averaging the strouhal number s ty with the same aspect ratio at different reynolds are compared with the results of gonçalves et al 2015 shown in fig 15 comparison shows both the present results and the results by gonçalves et al 2015 increase with ar but the specific values are different when a r 0 5 the fluctuation of transverse force is dominant by low frequency and the present results are slightly smaller than those by gonçalves et al 2015 the reason is believed to be the difference in reynolds numbers in above two experiments when 0 5 a r 1 5 with the increase of ar the present results increase more rapidly and become much larger than those by gonçalves et al 2015 as mentioned earlier when the free end approaches to the bottom plate the effect of free end decreases and the development of karman vortex street improves quickly which makes the s t y increase more rapidly the increased fluctuation frequency of transverse force is noteworthy in the sinking process of caisson strouhal numbers s tz based on the frequency of the vertical force of each aspect ratio varying with reynolds number are shown in fig 16 in which s tz varies from 0 02 to 0 1 approximately and as compared with the typical value s ty 0 2 for an infinite cylinder the fluctuation of vertical force is dominated by low frequency component iungo et al 2012 reported that s tz 0 07 0 08 for the pressure measured at the free end of the cylinder it can be observed that s tz is almost not influenced by aspect ratio but decreases with increasing reynolds number further the frequency of vertical force of each aspect ratio i e f z varying with reynolds number is shown in fig 17 which indicates that f z is not affected by both the aspect ratio and reynolds number 4 conclusions physical experiments were carried out to investigate the characteristics of current forces of floating caisson model the combined effects of the free surface free end and the riverbed or seabed were considered simultaneously the drag force transverse and vertical forces and surface pressures on cylinder were measured at reynolds number re 2 104 1 2 105 for cylinder with aspect ratio ar 0 25 1 5 the main conclusions are summarized as 1 drag coefficient c d increases with ar increases and increases abruptly at the instant when the free end touches the bottom plate c d increases slightly with increasing re when 0 25 ar 1 but decreases to a plateau when 1 ar 1 5 ar 2 the pressure coefficients right behind the cylinder are basically negative and their absolute values are smaller than that of 2d cylinder the pressure coefficients in the front of the cylinder are equal to or less than that of 2d cylinder the pressure coefficients near free surface in the front of cylinder are larger than 2d cylinder because of run up and the pressure coefficients near the free end are less than 1 because of the free end effect when the free end disappears the pressure coefficients near the bottom of cylinder are less than 1 because of the lower flow velocity in the boundary layer the main reason for the smaller drag coefficient in this study is the pressure recovery at the rear of the cylinder from the recirculation behind the cylinder before the free end touches the bottom plate 3 the averaged root square coefficient of drag force c d r m s decreases slightly with increasing ar when 0 25 ar 0 75 and increases with increasing ar when 0 75 ar 1 5 and suddenly increases when the free end touches bottom plate generally c d r m s increases as re increases 4 the root square coefficient of transverse force c lrms decreases slightly with increasing re when ar 0 25 c lrms first increases and then decreases with increasing ar when 0 25 ar 1 4 and it decreases significantly with increasing re when ar 1 5 c l r m s has a relatively larger value when ar 0 5 it increases with increasing ar when 1 ar 1 5 and it has the largest value when the free end touches the bottom plate 5 the ratio of root mean square of vertical force to the buoyant force in still water decreases with increasing ar and increases with re its value can reach up to 14 when ar 0 25 at re 1 2 105 which may cause trim of floating caisson on the cylinder free end surface the pressure coefficient near the leading edge is smaller than that of trailing edge the incoming velocity and the aspect ratio affect the vortex location and intensity which eventually causes nonuniformity of pressure distribution on the free end surface 6 the frequency of the transverse force increases with ar and slightly decreases with re and is dominated by low frequency component when ar is small the frequency of the vertical forces is not affected by both the aspect ratio and reynolds number and is dominated by low frequency component too 7 when ar gets much close to 1 5 i e the cylinder almost touches the bottom plate the bottom plate changes the flow field and current forces greatly a the bottom plate generates the boundary layer in which the incoming velocity is lowered and causes smaller pressure coefficients in the front of the cylinder more importantly the bottom plate weakens the recirculation zone behind the cylinder caused by the free end and generates a larger negative pressure behind the cylinder which makes the drag coefficient c d increase significantly especially for the cases with smaller re b c d decreases obviously with the increase of re c the weakening of the recirculation zone behind the cylinder caused by the bottom plate also provides advantages of better or fully development for the vortex shedding which makes the c d r m s and c l r m s increase sharply and also makes the vortex shedding frequency increase remarkably d the approaching to the bottom plate increases the current velocity passing through the gap between the free end and the bottom plate which results in the upstream movement of the vortex center and finally increases the absolute values of the pressure negative at the positions near the leading and tailing edges on the free end surface therefore at the instant when the floating cylinder touches the bottom the remarkable changes of flow filed and current force should receive extra attention during the sinking process in real practice the results of the present work are beneficial for understanding changes of the current forces on floating cylinder during the sinking process although the floating caisson was chosen as the prototype the results can also provide references for the similar ocean structures such as cofferdams in bridge engineering floating foundations of offshore wind turbines cylinders of jacket platform cylinders of spar platform etc based on cfd simulation flow field analysis of the sinking process of floating cylinder is capable of providing more sufficient information for fully

22898,accidental leak in subsea pipelines poses a severe threat to human life environment assets and corporate reputation quantitative risk assessment of such events is consistently a challenging task due to data scarcity in this paper a new methodology comprising of hierarchical bayesian analysis hba implemented with the bayesian network bn is proposed to assess the risk of subsea pipelines leak this methodology capture both data and model uncertainty hba is utilized to handle the uncertainty among failure data from different sources bn is used to capture the dependencies among primary events and safety barriers failure probabilities from hba approach are used as prior beliefs and the occurrence probabilities of different scenarios are derived from bn reasoning in uncertain conditions furthermore the proposed methodology makes use of a concept of fuzzy loss ratio to evaluate the consequence of different scenarios integrating probability with consequence gives a reasonable risk assessment result as new observation data becomes available the assessed risk can be updated to generate a dynamic risk profile an industrial case study demonstrates the application of the methodology this methodology can serve as a helpful tool to risk management of subsea pipelines keywords precursor data dynamic risk assessment subsea pipelines leak hierarchical bayesian analysis bayesian network 1 introduction accidental leak in subsea pipelines may be caused due to some unavoidable factors e g corrosion fatigue and third party damage kawsar et al 2015 aljaroudi et al 2015 leakage of subsea pipelines may escalate into the oil spill fire or explosion accidents inducing catastrophic consequences li et al 2017a since subsea pipelines are located in the ocean it is challenging to implement maintenance and consequence disposal and the corresponding cost is also unaffordable li et al 2017b yang et al 2017 proactive risk analysis is an efficient tool to reduce the accident risk and develop preventive measures li et al 2016 however pipeline leak accidents with disastrous consequences are rare and insufficient data are available for probability estimation of such an event yang et al 2013 in general available data are gathered from different sources to address insufficient data this process introduces data uncertainty in risk analysis apostolakis 1982 siu and kelly 1998 on the other hand conventional methods would induce a biased result in probability estimation of the rare event with insufficient data many attempts have been made on addressing the uncertainty among aggregated data from different sources kaplan 1983 proposed a two stage bayesian method for the failure data from three sources indicating that it was a useful method to cope with data uncertainty due to different sources siu and kelly 1998 in the hba framework a multi stage prior is developed for the parameter of interest and an informative prior distribution is obtained using generic data given new data a case specific posterior distribution can be obtained by updating this informative prior distribution hba has been widely applied to deal with source to source uncertainty to cope with data scarcity precursor data are identified as an alternative in probability estimation of rare events a precursor is an event that is moderate in severity somewhere between significant accidents and minor failures that may occur more frequently which could evolve to accidents due to further failures of safety barriers eckle and burgherr 2013 in general near misses and incidents are treated as precursors and an accident can also be considered as its own precursor meel and seider 2006 precursors can be considered as reasonable indicators of rare events and used to develop likelihood functions in bayesian approaches yang et al 2015 the usefulness of precursor data in probability estimation of the rare event was recognized by khakzad et al 2014a as a result the precursor based approach has effectively been applied to risk analysis of rare events in chemical process or offshore oil and gas industry previous studies incorporated precursors data into hba framework to estimate probabilities of rare events e g blowout or oil spill yang et al 2013 2015 khakzad et al 2014a 2014b el gheriani et al 2017 yu et al 2017 and these studies indicate that combining precursors and hba is a robust approach to probability estimation of rare events the conventional risk analysis methods including fault tree ft event tree et and bow tie bt were widely adopted in the previous studies these methods are known as static and fail to capture the variation of risk as change occurs in operation and environment abimbola et al 2014 in addition conventional methods are unable to account for the various states of a variable common cause failures and conditional dependency among contributing events of an accident yuan et al 2015 li et al 2016 khakzad et al 2013a these limitations introduce certain uncertainty in results which is so called model uncertainty the joint or multivariate likelihood function was developed for different contributing factors in the model to take into account their interdependence khakzad et al 2014a yu et al 2017 however the joint or multivariate likelihood function is difficult to establish and solve in technical perspective for the accident scenario with many basic events and safety barriers bn was proven to be useful to overcome the limitations of conventional methods and handle the model uncertainty in risk analysis li et al 2018 the conditional dependency among various variables can be considered through directed arcs and conditional probability tables cpts applying bayes theorem bn can update initial beliefs when the new information about the system is available most of the previous studies focused on probability analysis of rare events but consequence assessment was seldom mentioned this may reduce the value of quantitative risk analysis in the real world it is necessary to know the severity of an accident during risk analysis rausand 2013 however these are usually not the criteria to measure the severity of an accident the fuzzy loss ratio is an available approach to address this issue tan et al 2013 introduced the fuzzy loss ratio in their work to assess the consequent loss of major accidents also the review of literature indicates that integrating hba with bn in a dynamic risk assessment framework was not reported in dynamic risk analysis the comparison of risk at a different time can show the risk variation trend of an accident the purpose of this study is to propose a precursor based methodology for dynamic risk assessment of subsea pipelines leak considering data and model uncertainty the uniqueness of this paper is the integration of probability and consequence of rare events to cope with insufficient data the precursor data related to subsea pipelines leak is introduced into risk analysis and hba is used to overcome the uncertainty among aggregated data from different sources to handle the model uncertainty from conventional static methods bn is employed to establish the accident scenario of a subsea pipelines leak the concept of fuzzy loss ratio is used to assess consequence severity of subsea pipelines leak given the newly available information the assessed risk can be updated to obtain a dynamic risk profile the rest of paper is organized as follows section 2 gives a brief description of methods used in the present study including hba bn and the concept of fuzzy loss ratio the proposed methodology and its main steps are discussed in section 3 a case study is shown in section 4 to demonstrate the application of the proposed methodology section 5 gives the conclusions of this work 2 an overview of modelling methods 2 1 hierarchical bayesian analysis hba hba is commonly used to consider the uncertainty induced by data collected from different sources in general a multi stage prior distribution is utilized in hba framework which is very complicated to be solved numerically and has large computational requirements however the availability of markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling technique facilitates the application of hba kelly and smith 2009 the main advantages of hba are as follows 1 hba can address the population variability of the data from different sources and 2 make full use of scarce data and borrow strength from other indirect but relevant data yang et al 2013 in the hba framework the data from different sources are used to establish an informative prior distribution for the parameter of interest θ to build an informative prior distribution θ is considered to follow a generic distribution with its own parameters α and β hyper parameters i e p θ α β this is the first stage prior representing the uncertainty in θ the hyper parameters are also uncertain and usually considered to follow diffusive or non informative distributions such as uniform distribution and jeffreys priors khakzad et al 2014a yang et al 2015 this is the second stage prior representing the uncertainty in α and β the second stage prior can be updated given generic data d the posterior distribution of hyper parameters p α β d can be written as follows yu et al 2017 1 p α β d p α β l d α β p α β l d α β d α d β where p α β d is the posterior distribution of hyper parameters the likelihood function of hyper parameters i e l d α β is shown as follows 2 l d α β l d θ p θ α β d θ there are a lot of methods to build l d α β using precursor data after obtaining the posterior distribution of hyper parameters the first stage prior can be updated to get an informative prior distribution for the parameter of interest θ by averaging over values of hyper parameters as follows 3 p θ d p θ α β p α β d d α d β this informative prior distribution represents the source to source uncertainty in θ given more case specific data d p θ d can be further updated as follows kelly and smith 2009 4 p θ d d p θ d l d θ p θ d l d θ d θ where p θ d d is the case specific posterior distribution of the parameter of interest the complete hba procedure for obtaining the case specific posterior distribution of parameter of interest θ is illustrated in fig 1 2 2 bayesian network bn bn is a probabilistic graphical based network that is represented as a directed acyclic graph mainly for describing knowledge uncertainty ping et al 2018 he et al 2018 a typical bn includes nodes arcs and cpts nodes represent random variables and arcs represent the conditional dependencies among linked nodes cpts describe the type and strength of these dependencies among nodes fig 2 presents a simple example of bn comprising random variables x1 x4 based on the conditional dependencies of variables the joint probability distribution p u of variables u a 1 a n can be represented as 5 p u i 1 n p a i p a a i where pa a i is the parent set of variables a i based on bayes theorem and new observation or evidence e the prior probabilities of variables are updated to be the posterior probabilities 6 p u e p u e p e p u e u p u e 2 3 consequence assessment using fuzzy loss ratio the consequence is an essential aspect of risk as per the review of previous literature limited work has been done on the integration of probability estimation and consequence of rare events such as subsea pipelines leak the reason is that there are not a consistent evaluation and judgment criteria for consequence loss in previous literature absolute loss value of consequence i e actual monetary value is usually utilized to evaluate the consequence level abimbola et al 2014 however the absolute loss of accident consequence may vary with different regions and field projects which is not able to be applied for general scenarios the concept of the loss ratio of consequence is defined as the ratio of monetary loss value induced by accident including casualties direct assets loss environment pollution and delay in project period and the total investment of the project shown as eq 7 tan et al 2013 zhou 2009 7 t i w i w where w is the total investment w i is the total monetary loss of accident consequence i the loss ratio intervals are shown in table 1 there are totally 5 grades for accident consequence loss note that the loss ratio t i may exceed 1 for some specific accident such as bp deepwater horizon accident in such case the loss ratio can be taken as 1 the median values of intervals in table 1 can be expressed by a vector as follows 8 r c v 0 5 0 05 0 005 0 0005 0 00005 actually the same accident scenario may result in different grades of consequence loss there is a certain likelihood for consequence loss ratio locating in a specific interval a loss ratio probability vector q i shown as eq 9 is used to show the likelihood of consequence loss ratio at different intervals 9 q i q i 1 q i 2 q i 3 q i 4 q i 5 where i is the type of accident consequence q i1 is the probability that loss ratio of consequence i reaches the grade 1 in table 1 q i2 q i3 q i4 q i5 can be reasoned and so on statistical data or expert opinion is often used to determine the loss ratio probability vector regarding a specific accident consequence i its loss grade can be presented using the fuzzy loss ratio which is a concept that integrating the loss ratio with its probability as shown in eq 10 10 c i q i r c v t where c i is the fuzzy loss ratio of consequence type i q i is the likelihood of loss ratio at different intervals r c v t is the transposed form of r cv 3 the methodology fig 3 presents the flowchart of the proposed methodology for risk assessment of subsea pipelines leak the main steps of the methodology include i accident scenario modelling ii information collection iii probability estimation of basic events and safety barriers iv dynamic risk assessment of subsea pipelines leak 3 1 accident scenario modelling regarding subsea pipelines leak developing accident scenario is the basic but essential step for risk assessment there are a series of accident scenario modelling methods including conventional and advanced methods bt is a synthesis of ft and et which is a graphical method representing an accident from causes to consequences this paper uses bt method to identify the potential causes safety barriers and consequences the subsequent scenario evolution process of accidental leakage of subsea pipelines is obtained however bt is known to be static failing to capture the variation of risk as changes in operation or environmental condition takes place also primary events and safety barriers in bt model are assumed to be independent which is not consistent with reality and introduces certain uncertainty into results abimbola et al 2014 li et al 2016 to relax the limitations of bt and address the model uncertainty previous researchers usually couple bt with bayes theorem or map bt into bn ale et al 2009 khakzad et al 2013a in the present study the developed bt mode is transformed into bn to perform a quantitative analysis 3 2 information collection the purpose of this stage is to collect the direct or indirect but relevant data of basic events safety barriers and consequences in the accident scenario model collecting information about them is vital to conduct a quantitative risk assessment the information needs to be collected are 1 occurrence number within specific time intervals 2 direct probabilities for some events which is usually from literature or failure database e g oreda participants 2002 3 loss caused by each consequence type once accident happens and total investment of a project during information collection failure data of basic events and safety barriers can be found from literature report of historical statistics furthermore experts opinion is also an important approach to obtain the expected failure data which is helpful for the events that have no direct or indirect relevant data when direct data are not sufficient failure data can be collected from different sources including different regions operational conditions and different industries if data relevant to subsea pipelines leak are scarce in the oog sector secondary data can be collected from the nuclear chemical and mining sectors which is mainly due to 1 within each sector installation equipment and procedures are similar and 2 each sector has a rich operational data history yang et al 2013 3 3 nodes probabilities estimation for the events or safety barriers with enough direct relevant data their probabilities can be determined by the statistical method for the events or safety barriers with limited even scarce direct or indirect relevant data their probabilities can be derived from hba modelling this stage focuses on clarifying the application of hba in probabilities estimation of nodes in accident scenario model conjugate pairs are commonly used in hba framework in the present study the poisson likelihood gamma prior pair is employed to predict the occurrence number of events in the next time interval the binomial likelihood beta prior is utilized to estimate the probabilities of nodes that could be defined as rare events the aggregated data from different source are the basis of constructing likelihood functions in hba safety expert s feedback or plant specific data are used to determine the parameters of hyper priors once the hba model is established the posterior probability distribution of parameters of interest can be obtained to solve the model equations based on aggregated data the data uncertainty due to different sources is considered in this distribution as can be seen given the new data this distribution can also be used as an informative prior distribution fig 4 depicts the application of hba to establish a case specific posterior distribution for the nodes in the bn model 3 4 dynamic risk assessment through the above procedures the probability of nodes in bn model are determined thus the risk assessment of subsea pipelines leak could be achieved in bn framework the occurrences probabilities of all consequence types induced by subsea pipelines leak are derived by forward inference in addition the probability updating and adapting can also be performed in bn introducing a new observation the probability updating is conducted by backward inference to find the most probable causes and evolution paths of consequence type of interest probability adapting could use precursor data including near accident data and accident data to get the probabilities of basic events and safety barriers at the different time the dynamic failure probability of the system over time can be obtained from probability adapting approach the concept of fuzzy loss ratio is utilized to assess the severity of each consequence type induced by subsea pipelines leak as depicted in section 2 3 the fuzzy loss ratio of specific consequence is determined by loss ratio probability vector and median values vector of loss ratio intervals in general loss ratio probability vector is usually determined by experts opinion and statistic data eventually the risk assessment of a major accident is achieved by integrating probabilities with fuzzy loss ratio of consequences a risk decision making can be made based on assessed results furthermore some prevention and control measures can be developed for the specific accident whose risk exceeds the acceptable level in the oog sector 4 case study 4 1 scenario development this section presents a case study to demonstrate the proposed methodology subsea pipelines leak incidents are rare but can induce major consequences such as fatalities capital losses and irreversible damage to the environment a bt model for subsea pipelines leak is shown in fig 5 including potential causes and consequences due to subsequent failure of safety barriers the causes of subsea pipelines leak include external and internal factors external factors involve corrosion natural disaster external loads and spanning vibration whereas internal factors comprise welding seam and material defects as well as attachments failure detailed bottom factors are presented in tables 2 and 3 these are some safety barriers to prevent leak escalating into more severe consequences including leakage detection emergency shutdown manual shutdown repair and sealing ignition prevention since the subsequent failure of safety barrier the initial leakage incident can induce a series of severe consequences and even develop into a major accident such as fire explosion or oil spill in the large area the end states in fig 5 consists of four conditions c1 near miss c2 a small vapor cloud and environmental pollution c3 a small fire and environment pollution c4 a huge vapor cloud and environmental pollution in this paper bt is only utilized to develop the initial accident scenario as discussed in previous sections bt is known as a static method that induces certain uncertainty into results to relax its limitations bt is transformed into a bn fig 6 as can be seen the conditional dependencies between safety barriers s2 and s3 as well as s4 and s5 are considered also the uncertainties among father and child nodes are also through an amending cpt where a set of uncertain values e g 0 99 or 0 01 are used the expert experience is used to determine the use of these uncertain values in cpts 4 2 nodes probabilities estimation in reality direct data on failure probabilities of basic events and safety barriers are limited and insufficient therefore the root nodes in bn model are divided into two types the first type includes the nodes have the directly available failure probabilities that can be found in literature or other sources whereas the other type embodies the nodes without the available probabilities table 2 presents the basic events with directly available probabilities table 3 shows the basic events that have no direct probabilities and the probabilities of these events can be derived from the hba method available indirect but relevant data pooled from different sources can be incorporated into the hba framework to estimate the probabilities of basic events in table 3 for the illustrative purpose table 4 gives the hypothetical precursor data of basic events and consequence states it is assumed that these data are observed over the course of 10 years and collected from 170 pipelines based on these data the precursor data of safety barriers can be reasoned from the logic structure of event tree model the occurrence number of leak incident can also be obtained which is the sum of the occurrence number of all consequence states using the precursor data in table 4 the hierarchical bayesian model described in section 2 1 and 3 3 can be utilized to predict the number of leakage and different consequences hba is executed using openbugs which is a freely available bayesian inference software openbugs the dataset of pipeline leak and consequences can be modelled from data in table 4 the occurrence number of pipeline leak and consequence states can be modelled using a poisson distribution with the parameter of interest λ λ is the occurrence rate and is considered to follow the conjugate prior gamma distribution with hyperparameters α β α and β follow the independent diffusive distribution fig 7 gives the predictive distribution for the occurrence rate of a pipeline leak likewise fig 8 presents the posterior predictive distributions for the occurrence number of different consequence states these posterior predictive distributions can be employed to predict the occurrence number of leakage incident and the corresponding consequence states in next interval that is 11th year in this paper table 5 presents the expected values of these posterior predictive distributions shown in figs 7 and 8 they are the predicted occurrence number of leak incident and consequence state in next time interval the 97 5 confidence interval represents the uncertainty in predicted values furthermore the occurrence rate of leak and different consequences is also estimated by merely taking the ten years averages the results in table 5 demonstrate the difference between the two estimators as for the leak c2 c3 and c4 the occurrence rates estimated by hba is higher than the ones that obtained from taking averages while the occurrence rate of c1 from hba approach is lower than the one derived from taking the average the reason is that the sensitivity of average to data points introduces certain bias in results in addition to the prediction of occurrence rate the other important application of hba is to calculate the probabilities of basic events and safety barriers with insufficient data as for the basic events without direct available probabilities data their failure probabilities can be derived from the hba approach using relevant precursor data shown in table 4 a binomial distribution with parameter p is assigned to each basic event to model their failures number per time interval in which p is considered to follow the beta distribution with hyperparameters a and b an independent diffusive distribution is assigned to hyperparameters a and b fig 9 presents the predictive distributions for failure probabilities of basic events whereas table 3 gives the expected values with 97 5 confidence interval the precursor data of safety barriers are reasoned from event tree structure and precursor data of different consequence states the same hba procedure is utilized to calculate the failure probabilities of safety barriers fig 10 presents the posterior predictive distributions for failure probabilities of safety barriers the expected values of these distributions and 97 5 confidence intervals are summarized in table 6 the 97 5 confidence intervals show the uncertainties among estimated failure probabilities of safety barriers by hba approach the uncertainty among precursor data from different sources has been addressed 4 3 probability updating based on the probabilities in tables 2 3 and 6 the occurrence probabilities of pipeline leak and consequence states are estimated via forward inference the probability of pipeline leak is estimated to be 6 87e 02 table 7 shows the occurrence probabilities of different consequence states the occurrence probabilities of four consequence states from high to low are c1 c2 c4 and c3 respectively c1 near miss is the most probable consequence state the severities of them increase from c1 to c4 c4 huge vapor cloud and environment pollution is the most dangerous consequence state which may induce catastrophic impact on corporation reputation and environment in the present study c4 is chosen as the target incident to mitigate in safety management of subsea pipelines and used for the subsequent analysis the main advantage of bn is that it could perform a probability updating given a evidence this makes bn be superior to conventional risk analysis methods such as bt probability updating can help to find the most probable events contributing to the occurrence of evidence li et al 2018 this study uses consequence state c4 as a new evidence to obtain the updated probabilities of basic events i e p xi consequence c4 fig 11 presents the comparison of prior probabilities and updated probabilities of basic events as can be seen the updated probabilities of some basic events increase significantly meaning their critical role in causing a disastrous consequence these basic events include x2 without adding corrosion inhibitor x4 anticorrosive coating failure x6 dropped objects x7 anchoring work x8 fishing gear interaction x9 oil stolen by drilling hole x10 offshore engineering construction x16 subsea earthquake x17 seabed movement x18 typhoon and x23 attachments aging indicating their critical role in causing occurrences of leakage and c4 according to updated probability these basis events should be paid enough attention to reduce their failure probability or strengthen protective measures fig 12 shows the comparison of prior and updated failure probabilities of safety barriers it could be found that the updated probabilities of s1 leak detection and s2 emergency shutdown increase this could indicate that s1 and s2 are critical factors for the occurrence of c4 mainly s1 is the most critical safety barrier to prevent the escalation of leakage incident when leak incident is not perceived by the scada system or patrol workers successfully the occurrence of c4 will be caused directly also although the leakage is detected successfully the oil and gas will still release out of control if the emergency shutdown does not be performed in time therefore the reliability of s1 and s2 is required to improve safety management for reducing the risk of leakage escalating into a major accident 4 4 probability adapting probability adapting is also known as sequential learning or experience learning kjaerullf and madsen 2008 yuan et al 2015 it is an important application of bn in risk analysis field and particularly suitable for dynamic risk modelling of the system probability adapting is able to utilize new information that were recorded over time to revise the failure probability of the system thus failure probability of the system could be adapted to be more case specific and reflect the system characteristics khakzad et al 2013a b li et al 2016 in general these new information involve the observations of near misses mishaps incidents and root events during the life cycle of the system the form of the cumulative number of the observations is utilized to develop likelihood function then the prior probabilities of nodes in bn can be updated over time by bayes theorem shown as eq 11 propagating new information through the bn the probability of accident its consequences and safety barriers will change over time 11 p n d a t a p n l d a t a n p n l d a t a n where p n is the nodes prior probabilities l n data is the likelihood function that is constructed using precursor data p n data is the nodes updated probabilities after adapting based on the precursor data in table 4 the probabilities of critical basic events and safety barriers identified in probability updating are updated over time the dynamic probabilities of them can be propagated in bn thus dynamic probabilities of different consequence states are produced fig 13 presents the probability adapting results for the top event subsea pipelines leak in the figure year 0 denotes the priors as can be seen given the appearance of precursor data the occurrence probability of pipeline leak is increasing over a ten year period which indicates that the likelihood of subsea pipelines leak is increasing over time fig 14 depicts the dynamic failure probabilities of safety barriers in the appearance of precursor data as can be seen the failure probabilities of all safety barriers in general are increasing over time which are in agreement with the probability of the top event however the failure probabilities of s1 s2 s4 and s5 stand at a steady value or have a slight drop from the sixth year this is due to the infrequency of precursor data relating to these safety barriers dynamic failure probabilities of safety barriers could help to identify the weak links in the safety system of subsea pipelines and give useful guidance for further improvement of the safety system fig 15 presents the probability adapting results for different consequence states as can be seen the probabilities of consequence states c2 c3 and c4 are increasing over time the reason for this ascending trend can be explained as the increase in both occurrence probability of pipeline leak and failure probabilities of safety barriers c1 near miss can be regarded as a safety state which is the opposite of consequences states c2 c3 and c4 therefore it is easy to understand that the occurrence probability of c1 shows a descending trend with time as illustrated in fig 15 sequential precursors based probability adapting indicates that additional safety measures are necessary for reducing the occurrence probabilities of significant consequence states integrating precursor data with probability adapting of bn could revise generic prior probabilities of basic events safety barriers and consequence states to be more case specific updated probabilities such dynamic probabilities of consequence states can be used to predict the development trend of the consequence of interest and render more practical guidance for risk prevention and control 4 5 risk assessment based on the definition of risk the consequence is the other important aspect of risk in this paper the consequence severity of subsea pipelines leak is measured by the concept of the fuzzy loss ratio according to the description in section 2 3 the loss ratio probability vector q i for consequence state i must be estimated before determining the fuzzy loss ratio experts judgment is employed to obtain the loss ratio probability vector and the weighted average method is used to aggregate m experts knowledge the nth element in q i from the aggregation of m experts judgment is shown as eq 12 ferdous et al 2012 12 q i n j 1 m w j q i n j j 1 m w j where q in j is the nth element in vector q i elicited from expert j m is the number of experts w j is the weighting factor of expert j q i n is the aggregated value of q in j after obtaining the loss ratio probability vector q i the fuzzy loss ratio of consequence state i can be determining by eq 10 estimated loss ratio probability vectors and fuzzy loss ratios for all consequences states are summarized in table 8 in terms of subsea pipelines leak there are four potential consequences states c1 c2 c3 and c4 therefore the risk of subsea pipelines leak is the sum of risk value for all consequences states shown as eq 13 tan et al 2013 13 r i 1 4 c i p c i c 1 p c 1 c 2 p c 2 c 3 p c 3 c 4 p c 4 where r is the risk value of all consequence states c i is the fuzzy loss ratio of consequence state i p ci is the occurrence probability of consequence state i fig 16 presents the dynamic risk profile of subsea pipelines leak indicating that the total risk of subsea pipelines leak is increasing over time based on the result presented here the oil corporation managers can know the overall risk trend of subsea pipelines leak and conduct risk decision making given some critical risk limits in general the definition of critical risk limits varies in different oil corporations depending on their production scale management level safety culture and risk tolerance etc using the critical risk values the risk early warning can be implemented to prevent and control unexpected incidents and the managers can also make a decision on the further expenses to reduce the risk also the dynamic risk profile can be used to predict the future risk status of subsea pipelines leak 5 summary and conclusions this paper develops a precursor based approach for dynamic risk assessment of subsea pipelines leaks by integrating hba with bn both data and model uncertainty are considered accident scenario of subsea pipelines leak is developed using bn method considering the uncertainties among conditional dependencies of nodes also a hierarchical bayesian model is developed to estimate the probabilities of basic events and safety barriers with insufficient data which are presented in the form of some informative prior distributions hba approach well addresses the uncertainty among precursor data from different sources in addition to probability estimation hba is also employed to predict the occurrence number of parameter of interest based on observed information over time bn can address the model uncertainty induced by the static characteristic of conventional risk analysis methods the estimated probabilities of basic events and safety barriers are used as inputs and the occurrence probabilities of different consequence states are reasoned two important applications of bn in this paper is probability updating and adapting given new evidence the probability updating is carried out to find the critical factors contributing to the occurrence of evidence this could help to identify the weaknesses of the system based on the observed precursor data probability adapting is conducted to produce dynamic probabilities for pipeline leak safety barriers and different consequence states which are more case specific probabilities reflecting the system characteristics furthermore this study also accounts for consequence assessment the concept of fuzzy loss ratio is utilized to measure the severity of different consequence states eventually the total risk of subsea pipelines leak is obtained by integrating the risk of all consequence states the proposed methodology has been efficiently applied to a case study which indicates that it is a useful approach to dynamic risk assessment of subsea pipelines leak under uncertain conditions the source to source data uncertainty and static model uncertainty are addressed in the proposed methodology framework also this methodology can utilize newly observed data to update the present risk values producing real time results in essence the proposed methodology could contribute to risk assessment and management of subsea pipelines leak during the probability adapting this paper focuses on analyzing risk evolution process and the probabilities of basic events and safety barriers used for the inputs of bn model are the mean values derived from

22898,accidental leak in subsea pipelines poses a severe threat to human life environment assets and corporate reputation quantitative risk assessment of such events is consistently a challenging task due to data scarcity in this paper a new methodology comprising of hierarchical bayesian analysis hba implemented with the bayesian network bn is proposed to assess the risk of subsea pipelines leak this methodology capture both data and model uncertainty hba is utilized to handle the uncertainty among failure data from different sources bn is used to capture the dependencies among primary events and safety barriers failure probabilities from hba approach are used as prior beliefs and the occurrence probabilities of different scenarios are derived from bn reasoning in uncertain conditions furthermore the proposed methodology makes use of a concept of fuzzy loss ratio to evaluate the consequence of different scenarios integrating probability with consequence gives a reasonable risk assessment result as new observation data becomes available the assessed risk can be updated to generate a dynamic risk profile an industrial case study demonstrates the application of the methodology this methodology can serve as a helpful tool to risk management of subsea pipelines keywords precursor data dynamic risk assessment subsea pipelines leak hierarchical bayesian analysis bayesian network 1 introduction accidental leak in subsea pipelines may be caused due to some unavoidable factors e g corrosion fatigue and third party damage kawsar et al 2015 aljaroudi et al 2015 leakage of subsea pipelines may escalate into the oil spill fire or explosion accidents inducing catastrophic consequences li et al 2017a since subsea pipelines are located in the ocean it is challenging to implement maintenance and consequence disposal and the corresponding cost is also unaffordable li et al 2017b yang et al 2017 proactive risk analysis is an efficient tool to reduce the accident risk and develop preventive measures li et al 2016 however pipeline leak accidents with disastrous consequences are rare and insufficient data are available for probability estimation of such an event yang et al 2013 in general available data are gathered from different sources to address insufficient data this process introduces data uncertainty in risk analysis apostolakis 1982 siu and kelly 1998 on the other hand conventional methods would induce a biased result in probability estimation of the rare event with insufficient data many attempts have been made on addressing the uncertainty among aggregated data from different sources kaplan 1983 proposed a two stage bayesian method for the failure data from three sources indicating that it was a useful method to cope with data uncertainty due to different sources siu and kelly 1998 in the hba framework a multi stage prior is developed for the parameter of interest and an informative prior distribution is obtained using generic data given new data a case specific posterior distribution can be obtained by updating this informative prior distribution hba has been widely applied to deal with source to source uncertainty to cope with data scarcity precursor data are identified as an alternative in probability estimation of rare events a precursor is an event that is moderate in severity somewhere between significant accidents and minor failures that may occur more frequently which could evolve to accidents due to further failures of safety barriers eckle and burgherr 2013 in general near misses and incidents are treated as precursors and an accident can also be considered as its own precursor meel and seider 2006 precursors can be considered as reasonable indicators of rare events and used to develop likelihood functions in bayesian approaches yang et al 2015 the usefulness of precursor data in probability estimation of the rare event was recognized by khakzad et al 2014a as a result the precursor based approach has effectively been applied to risk analysis of rare events in chemical process or offshore oil and gas industry previous studies incorporated precursors data into hba framework to estimate probabilities of rare events e g blowout or oil spill yang et al 2013 2015 khakzad et al 2014a 2014b el gheriani et al 2017 yu et al 2017 and these studies indicate that combining precursors and hba is a robust approach to probability estimation of rare events the conventional risk analysis methods including fault tree ft event tree et and bow tie bt were widely adopted in the previous studies these methods are known as static and fail to capture the variation of risk as change occurs in operation and environment abimbola et al 2014 in addition conventional methods are unable to account for the various states of a variable common cause failures and conditional dependency among contributing events of an accident yuan et al 2015 li et al 2016 khakzad et al 2013a these limitations introduce certain uncertainty in results which is so called model uncertainty the joint or multivariate likelihood function was developed for different contributing factors in the model to take into account their interdependence khakzad et al 2014a yu et al 2017 however the joint or multivariate likelihood function is difficult to establish and solve in technical perspective for the accident scenario with many basic events and safety barriers bn was proven to be useful to overcome the limitations of conventional methods and handle the model uncertainty in risk analysis li et al 2018 the conditional dependency among various variables can be considered through directed arcs and conditional probability tables cpts applying bayes theorem bn can update initial beliefs when the new information about the system is available most of the previous studies focused on probability analysis of rare events but consequence assessment was seldom mentioned this may reduce the value of quantitative risk analysis in the real world it is necessary to know the severity of an accident during risk analysis rausand 2013 however these are usually not the criteria to measure the severity of an accident the fuzzy loss ratio is an available approach to address this issue tan et al 2013 introduced the fuzzy loss ratio in their work to assess the consequent loss of major accidents also the review of literature indicates that integrating hba with bn in a dynamic risk assessment framework was not reported in dynamic risk analysis the comparison of risk at a different time can show the risk variation trend of an accident the purpose of this study is to propose a precursor based methodology for dynamic risk assessment of subsea pipelines leak considering data and model uncertainty the uniqueness of this paper is the integration of probability and consequence of rare events to cope with insufficient data the precursor data related to subsea pipelines leak is introduced into risk analysis and hba is used to overcome the uncertainty among aggregated data from different sources to handle the model uncertainty from conventional static methods bn is employed to establish the accident scenario of a subsea pipelines leak the concept of fuzzy loss ratio is used to assess consequence severity of subsea pipelines leak given the newly available information the assessed risk can be updated to obtain a dynamic risk profile the rest of paper is organized as follows section 2 gives a brief description of methods used in the present study including hba bn and the concept of fuzzy loss ratio the proposed methodology and its main steps are discussed in section 3 a case study is shown in section 4 to demonstrate the application of the proposed methodology section 5 gives the conclusions of this work 2 an overview of modelling methods 2 1 hierarchical bayesian analysis hba hba is commonly used to consider the uncertainty induced by data collected from different sources in general a multi stage prior distribution is utilized in hba framework which is very complicated to be solved numerically and has large computational requirements however the availability of markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling technique facilitates the application of hba kelly and smith 2009 the main advantages of hba are as follows 1 hba can address the population variability of the data from different sources and 2 make full use of scarce data and borrow strength from other indirect but relevant data yang et al 2013 in the hba framework the data from different sources are used to establish an informative prior distribution for the parameter of interest θ to build an informative prior distribution θ is considered to follow a generic distribution with its own parameters α and β hyper parameters i e p θ α β this is the first stage prior representing the uncertainty in θ the hyper parameters are also uncertain and usually considered to follow diffusive or non informative distributions such as uniform distribution and jeffreys priors khakzad et al 2014a yang et al 2015 this is the second stage prior representing the uncertainty in α and β the second stage prior can be updated given generic data d the posterior distribution of hyper parameters p α β d can be written as follows yu et al 2017 1 p α β d p α β l d α β p α β l d α β d α d β where p α β d is the posterior distribution of hyper parameters the likelihood function of hyper parameters i e l d α β is shown as follows 2 l d α β l d θ p θ α β d θ there are a lot of methods to build l d α β using precursor data after obtaining the posterior distribution of hyper parameters the first stage prior can be updated to get an informative prior distribution for the parameter of interest θ by averaging over values of hyper parameters as follows 3 p θ d p θ α β p α β d d α d β this informative prior distribution represents the source to source uncertainty in θ given more case specific data d p θ d can be further updated as follows kelly and smith 2009 4 p θ d d p θ d l d θ p θ d l d θ d θ where p θ d d is the case specific posterior distribution of the parameter of interest the complete hba procedure for obtaining the case specific posterior distribution of parameter of interest θ is illustrated in fig 1 2 2 bayesian network bn bn is a probabilistic graphical based network that is represented as a directed acyclic graph mainly for describing knowledge uncertainty ping et al 2018 he et al 2018 a typical bn includes nodes arcs and cpts nodes represent random variables and arcs represent the conditional dependencies among linked nodes cpts describe the type and strength of these dependencies among nodes fig 2 presents a simple example of bn comprising random variables x1 x4 based on the

using fuzzy loss ratio the consequence is an essential aspect of risk as per the review of previous literature limited work has been done on the integration of probability estimation and consequence of rare events such as subsea pipelines leak the reason is that there are not a consistent evaluation and judgment criteria for consequence loss in previous literature absolute loss value of consequence i e actual monetary value is usually utilized to evaluate the consequence level abimbola et al 2014 however the absolute loss of accident consequence may vary with different regions and field projects which is not able to be applied for general scenarios the concept of the loss ratio of consequence is defined as the ratio of monetary loss value induced by accident including casualties direct assets loss environment pollution and delay in project period and the total investment of the project shown as eq 7 tan et al 2013 zhou 2009 7 t i w i w where w is the total investment w i is the total monetary loss of accident consequence i the loss ratio intervals are shown in table 1 there are totally 5 grades for accident consequence loss note that the loss ratio t i may exceed 1 for some specific accident such as bp deepwater horizon accident in such case the loss ratio can be taken as 1 the median values of intervals in table 1 can be expressed by a vector as follows 8 r c v 0 5 0 05 0 005 0 0005 0 00005 actually the same accident scenario may result in different grades of consequence loss there is a certain likelihood for consequence loss ratio locating in a specific interval a loss ratio probability vector q i shown as eq 9 is used to show the likelihood of consequence loss ratio at different intervals 9 q i q i 1 q i 2 q i 3 q i 4 q i 5 where i is the type of accident consequence q i1 is the probability that loss ratio of consequence i reaches the grade 1 in table 1 q i2 q i3 q i4 q i5 can be reasoned and so on statistical data or expert opinion is often used to determine the loss ratio probability vector regarding a specific accident consequence i its loss grade can be presented using the fuzzy loss ratio which is a concept that integrating the loss ratio with its probability as shown in eq 10 10 c i q i r c v t where c i is the fuzzy loss ratio of consequence type i q i is the likelihood of loss ratio at different intervals r c v t is the transposed form of r cv 3 the methodology fig 3 presents the flowchart of the proposed methodology for risk assessment of subsea pipelines leak the main steps of the methodology include i accident scenario modelling ii information collection iii probability estimation of basic events and safety barriers iv dynamic risk assessment of subsea pipelines leak 3 1 accident scenario modelling regarding subsea pipelines leak developing accident scenario is the basic but essential step for risk assessment there are a series of accident scenario modelling methods including conventional and advanced methods bt is a synthesis of ft and et which is a graphical method representing an accident from causes to consequences this paper uses bt method to identify the potential causes safety barriers and consequences the subsequent scenario evolution process of accidental leakage of subsea pipelines is obtained however bt is known to be static failing to capture the variation of risk as changes in operation or environmental condition takes place also primary events and safety barriers in bt model are assumed to be independent which is not consistent with reality and introduces certain uncertainty into results abimbola et al 2014 li et al 2016 to relax the limitations of bt and address the model uncertainty previous researchers usually couple bt with bayes theorem or map bt into bn ale et al 2009 khakzad et al 2013a in the present study the developed bt mode is transformed into bn to perform a quantitative analysis 3 2 information collection the purpose of this stage is to collect the direct or indirect but relevant data of basic events safety barriers and consequences in the accident scenario model collecting information about them is vital to conduct a quantitative risk assessment the information needs to be collected are 1 occurrence number within specific time intervals 2 direct probabilities for some events which is usually from literature or failure database e g oreda participants 2002 3 loss caused by each consequence type once accident happens and total investment of a project during information collection failure data of basic events and safety barriers can be found from literature report of historical statistics furthermore experts opinion is also an important approach to obtain the expected failure data which is helpful for the events that have no direct or indirect relevant data when direct data are not sufficient failure data can be collected from different sources including different regions operational conditions and different industries if data relevant to subsea pipelines leak are scarce in the oog sector secondary data can be collected from the nuclear chemical and mining sectors which is mainly due to 1 within each sector installation equipment and procedures are similar and 2 each sector has a rich operational data history yang et al 2013 3 3 nodes probabilities estimation for the events or safety barriers with enough direct relevant data their probabilities can be determined by the statistical method for the events or safety barriers with limited even scarce direct or indirect relevant data their probabilities can be derived from hba modelling this stage focuses on clarifying the application of hba in probabilities estimation of nodes in accident scenario model conjugate pairs are commonly used in hba framework in the present study the poisson likelihood gamma prior pair is employed to predict the occurrence number of events in the next time interval the binomial likelihood beta prior is utilized to estimate the probabilities of nodes that could be defined as rare events the aggregated data from different source are the basis of constructing likelihood functions in hba safety expert s feedback or plant specific data are used to determine the parameters of hyper priors once the hba model is established the posterior probability distribution of parameters of interest can be obtained to solve the model equations based on aggregated data the data uncertainty due to different sources is considered in this distribution as can be seen given the new data this distribution can also be used as an informative prior distribution fig 4 depicts the application of hba to establish a case specific posterior distribution for the nodes in the bn model 3 4 dynamic risk assessment through the above procedures the probability of nodes in bn model are determined thus the risk assessment of subsea pipelines leak could be achieved in bn framework the occurrences probabilities of all consequence types induced by subsea pipelines leak are derived by forward inference in addition the probability updating and adapting can also be performed in bn introducing a new observation the probability updating is conducted by backward inference to find the most probable causes and evolution paths of consequence type of interest probability adapting could use precursor data including near accident data and accident data to get the probabilities of basic events and safety barriers at the different time the dynamic failure probability of the system over time can be obtained from probability adapting approach the concept of fuzzy loss ratio is utilized to assess the severity of each consequence type induced by subsea pipelines leak as depicted in section 2 3 the fuzzy loss ratio of specific consequence is determined by loss ratio probability vector and median values vector of loss ratio intervals in general loss ratio probability vector is usually determined by experts opinion and statistic data eventually the risk assessment of a major accident is achieved by integrating probabilities with fuzzy loss ratio of consequences a risk decision making can be made based on assessed results furthermore some prevention and control measures can be developed for the specific accident whose risk exceeds the acceptable level in the oog sector 4 case study 4 1 scenario development this section presents a case study to demonstrate the proposed methodology subsea pipelines leak incidents are rare but can induce major consequences such as fatalities capital losses and irreversible damage to the environment a bt model for subsea pipelines leak is shown in fig 5 including potential causes and consequences due to subsequent failure of safety barriers the causes of subsea pipelines leak include external and internal factors external factors involve corrosion natural disaster external loads and spanning vibration whereas internal factors comprise welding seam and material defects as well as attachments failure detailed bottom factors are presented in tables 2 and 3 these are some safety barriers to prevent leak escalating into more severe consequences including leakage detection emergency shutdown manual shutdown repair and sealing ignition prevention since the subsequent failure of safety barrier the initial leakage incident can induce a series of severe consequences and even develop into a major accident such as fire explosion or oil spill in the large area the end states in fig 5 consists of four conditions c1 near miss c2 a small vapor cloud and environmental pollution c3 a small fire and environment pollution c4 a huge vapor cloud and environmental pollution in this paper bt is only utilized to develop the initial accident scenario as discussed in previous sections bt is known as a static method that induces certain uncertainty into results to relax its limitations bt is transformed into a bn fig 6 as can be seen the conditional dependencies between safety barriers s2 and s3 as well as s4 and s5 are considered also the uncertainties among father and child nodes are also through an amending cpt where a set of uncertain values e g 0 99 or 0 01 are used the expert experience is used to determine the use of these uncertain values in cpts 4 2 nodes probabilities estimation in reality direct data on failure probabilities of basic events and safety barriers are limited and insufficient therefore the root nodes in bn model are divided into two types the first type includes the nodes have the directly available failure probabilities that can be found in literature or other sources whereas the other type embodies the nodes without the available probabilities table 2 presents the basic events with directly available probabilities table 3 shows the basic events that have no direct probabilities and the probabilities of these events can be derived from the hba method available indirect but relevant data pooled from different sources can be incorporated into the hba framework to estimate the probabilities of basic events in table 3 for the illustrative purpose table 4 gives the hypothetical precursor data of basic events and consequence states it is assumed that these data are observed over the course of 10 years and collected from 170 pipelines based on these data the precursor data of safety barriers can be reasoned from the logic structure of event tree model the occurrence number of leak incident can also be obtained which is the sum of the occurrence number of all consequence states using the precursor data in table 4 the hierarchical bayesian model described in section 2 1 and 3 3 can be utilized to predict the number of leakage and different consequences hba is executed using openbugs which is a freely available bayesian inference software openbugs the dataset of pipeline leak and consequences can be modelled from data in table 4 the occurrence number of pipeline leak and consequence states can be modelled using a poisson distribution with the parameter of interest λ λ is the occurrence rate and is considered to follow the conjugate prior gamma distribution with hyperparameters α β α and β follow the independent diffusive distribution fig 7 gives the predictive distribution for the occurrence rate of a pipeline leak likewise fig 8 presents the posterior predictive distributions for the occurrence number of different consequence states these posterior predictive distributions can be employed to predict the occurrence number of leakage incident and the corresponding consequence states in next interval that is 11th year in this paper table 5 presents the expected values of these posterior predictive distributions shown in figs 7 and 8 they are the predicted occurrence number of leak incident and consequence state in next time interval the 97 5 confidence interval represents the uncertainty in predicted values furthermore the occurrence rate of leak and different consequences is also estimated by merely taking the ten years averages the results in table 5 demonstrate the difference between the two estimators as for the leak c2 c3 and c4 the occurrence rates estimated by hba is higher than the ones that obtained from taking averages while the occurrence rate of c1 from hba approach is lower than the one derived from taking the average the reason is that the sensitivity of average to data points introduces certain bias in results in addition to the prediction of occurrence rate the other important application of hba is to calculate the probabilities of basic events and safety barriers with insufficient data as for the basic events without direct available probabilities data their failure probabilities can be derived from the hba approach using relevant precursor data shown in table 4 a binomial distribution with parameter p is assigned to each basic event to model their failures number per time interval in which p is considered to follow the beta distribution with hyperparameters a and b an independent diffusive distribution is assigned to hyperparameters a and b fig 9 presents the predictive distributions for failure probabilities of basic events whereas table 3 gives the expected values with 97 5 confidence interval the precursor data of safety barriers are reasoned from event tree structure and precursor data of different consequence states the same hba procedure is utilized to calculate the failure probabilities of safety barriers fig 10 presents the posterior predictive distributions for failure probabilities of safety barriers the expected values of these distributions and 97 5 confidence intervals are summarized in table 6 the 97 5 confidence intervals show the uncertainties among estimated failure probabilities of safety barriers by hba approach the uncertainty among precursor data from different sources has been addressed 4 3 probability updating based on the probabilities in tables 2 3 and 6 the occurrence probabilities of pipeline leak and consequence states are estimated via forward inference the probability of pipeline leak is estimated to be 6 87e 02 table 7 shows the occurrence probabilities of different consequence states the occurrence probabilities of four consequence states from high to low are c1 c2 c4 and c3 respectively c1 near miss is the most probable consequence state the severities of them increase from c1 to c4 c4 huge vapor cloud and environment pollution is the most dangerous consequence state which may induce catastrophic impact on corporation reputation and environment in the present study c4 is chosen as the target incident to mitigate in safety management of subsea pipelines and used for the subsequent analysis the main advantage of bn is that it could perform a probability updating given a evidence this makes bn be superior to conventional risk analysis methods such as bt probability updating can help to find the most probable events contributing to the occurrence of evidence li et al 2018 this study uses consequence state c4 as a new evidence to obtain the updated probabilities of basic events i e p xi consequence c4 fig 11 presents the comparison of prior probabilities and updated probabilities of basic events as can be seen the updated probabilities of some basic events increase significantly meaning their critical role in causing a disastrous consequence these basic events include x2 without adding corrosion inhibitor x4 anticorrosive coating failure x6 dropped objects x7 anchoring work x8 fishing gear interaction x9 oil stolen by drilling hole x10 offshore engineering construction x16 subsea earthquake x17 seabed movement x18 typhoon and x23 attachments aging indicating their critical role in causing occurrences of leakage and c4 according to updated probability these basis events should be paid enough attention to reduce their failure probability or strengthen protective measures fig 12 shows the comparison of prior and updated failure probabilities of safety barriers it could be found that the updated probabilities of s1 leak detection and s2 emergency shutdown increase this could indicate that s1 and s2 are critical factors for the occurrence of c4 mainly s1 is the most critical safety barrier to prevent the escalation of leakage incident when leak incident is not perceived by the scada system or patrol workers successfully the occurrence of c4 will be caused directly also although the leakage is detected successfully the oil and gas will still release out of control if the emergency shutdown does not be performed in time therefore the reliability of s1 and s2 is required to improve safety management for reducing the risk of leakage escalating into a major accident 4 4 probability adapting probability adapting is also known as sequential learning or experience learning kjaerullf and madsen 2008 yuan et al 2015 it is an important application of bn in risk analysis field and particularly suitable for dynamic risk modelling of the system probability adapting is able to utilize new information that were recorded over time to revise the failure probability of the system thus failure probability of the system could be adapted to be more case specific and reflect the system characteristics khakzad et al 2013a b li et al 2016 in general these new information involve the observations of near misses mishaps incidents and root events during the life cycle of the system the form of the cumulative number of the observations is utilized to develop likelihood function then the prior probabilities of nodes in bn can be updated over time by bayes theorem shown as eq 11 propagating new information through the bn the probability of accident its consequences and safety barriers will change over time 11 p n d a t a p n l d a t a n p n l d a t a n where p n is the nodes prior probabilities l n data is the likelihood function that is constructed using precursor data p n data is the nodes updated probabilities after adapting based on the precursor data in table 4 the probabilities of critical basic events and safety barriers identified in probability updating are updated over time the dynamic probabilities of them can be propagated in bn thus dynamic probabilities of different consequence states are produced fig 13 presents the probability adapting results for the top event subsea pipelines leak in the figure year 0 denotes the priors as can be seen given the appearance of precursor data the occurrence probability of pipeline leak is increasing over a ten year period which indicates that the likelihood of subsea pipelines leak is increasing over time fig 14 depicts the dynamic failure probabilities of safety barriers in the appearance of precursor data as can be seen the failure probabilities of all safety barriers in general are increasing over time which are in agreement with the probability of the top event however the failure probabilities of s1 s2 s4 and s5 stand at a steady value or have a slight drop from the sixth year this is due to the infrequency of precursor data relating to these safety barriers dynamic failure probabilities of safety barriers could help to identify the weak links in the safety system of subsea pipelines and give useful guidance for further improvement of the safety system fig 15 presents the probability adapting results for different consequence states as can be seen the probabilities of consequence states c2 c3 and c4 are increasing over time the reason for this ascending trend can be explained as the increase in both occurrence probability of pipeline leak and failure probabilities of safety barriers c1 near miss can be regarded as a safety state which is the opposite of consequences states c2 c3 and c4 therefore it is easy to understand that the occurrence probability of c1 shows a descending trend with time as illustrated in fig 15 sequential precursors based probability adapting indicates that additional safety measures are necessary for reducing the occurrence probabilities of significant consequence states integrating precursor data with probability adapting of bn could revise generic prior probabilities of basic events safety barriers and consequence states to be more case specific updated probabilities such dynamic probabilities of consequence states can be used to predict the development trend of the consequence of interest and render more practical guidance for risk prevention and control 4 5 risk assessment based on the definition of risk the consequence is the other important aspect of risk in this paper the consequence severity of subsea pipelines leak is measured by the concept of the fuzzy loss ratio according to the description in section 2 3 the loss ratio probability vector q i for consequence state i must be estimated before determining the fuzzy loss ratio experts judgment is employed to obtain the loss ratio probability vector and the weighted average method is used to aggregate m experts knowledge the nth element in q i from the aggregation of m experts judgment is shown as eq 12 ferdous et al 2012 12 q i n j 1 m w j q i n j j 1 m w j where q in j is the nth element in vector q i elicited from expert j m is the number of experts w j is the weighting factor of expert j q i n is the aggregated value of q in j after obtaining the loss ratio probability vector q i the fuzzy loss ratio of consequence state i can be determining by eq 10 estimated loss ratio probability vectors and fuzzy loss ratios for all consequences states are summarized in table 8 in terms of subsea pipelines leak there are four potential consequences states c1 c2 c3 and c4 therefore the risk of subsea pipelines leak is the sum of risk value for all consequences states shown as eq 13 tan et al 2013 13 r i 1 4 c i p c i c 1 p c 1 c 2 p c 2 c 3 p c 3 c 4 p c 4 where r is the risk value of all consequence states c i is the fuzzy loss ratio of consequence state i p ci is the occurrence probability of consequence state i fig 16 presents the dynamic risk profile of subsea pipelines leak indicating that the total risk of subsea pipelines leak is increasing over time based on the result presented here the oil corporation managers can know the overall risk trend of subsea pipelines leak and conduct risk decision making given some critical risk limits in general the definition of critical risk limits varies in different oil corporations depending on their production scale management level safety culture and risk tolerance etc using the critical risk values the risk early warning can be implemented to prevent and control unexpected incidents and the managers can also make a decision on the further expenses to reduce the risk also the dynamic risk profile can be used to predict the future risk status of subsea pipelines leak 5 summary and conclusions this paper develops a precursor based approach for dynamic risk assessment of subsea pipelines leaks by integrating hba with bn both data and model uncertainty are considered accident scenario of subsea pipelines leak is developed using bn method considering the uncertainties among conditional dependencies of nodes also a hierarchical bayesian model is developed to estimate the probabilities of basic events and safety barriers with insufficient data which are presented in the form of some informative prior distributions hba approach well addresses the uncertainty among precursor data from different sources in addition to probability estimation hba is also employed to predict the occurrence number of parameter of interest based on observed information over time bn can address the model uncertainty induced by the static characteristic of conventional risk analysis methods the estimated probabilities of basic events and safety barriers are used as inputs and the occurrence probabilities of different consequence states are reasoned two important applications of bn in this paper is probability updating and adapting given new evidence the probability updating is carried out to find the critical factors contributing to the occurrence of evidence this could help to identify the weaknesses of the system based on the observed precursor data probability adapting is conducted to produce dynamic probabilities for pipeline leak safety barriers and different consequence states which are more case specific probabilities reflecting the system characteristics furthermore this study also accounts for consequence assessment the concept of fuzzy loss ratio is utilized to measure the severity of different consequence states eventually the total risk of subsea pipelines leak is obtained by integrating the risk of all consequence states the proposed methodology has been efficiently applied to a case study which indicates that it is a useful approach to dynamic risk assessment of subsea pipelines leak under uncertain conditions the source to source data uncertainty and static model uncertainty are addressed in the proposed methodology framework also this methodology can utilize newly observed data to update the present risk values producing real time results in essence the proposed methodology could contribute to risk assessment and management of subsea pipelines leak during the probability adapting this paper focuses on analyzing risk evolution process and the probabilities of basic events and safety barriers used for the inputs of bn model are the mean values derived from hba method future work is planned to study the uncertainty propagation from probabilities of basic events and safety barriers to results acknowledgement the authors gratefully acknowledge the

22899,multiple flexible cylindrical structures arranged in tandem are commonly used in various fields of engineering up to now limited information is available about the flow induced vibrations fivs of more than two tandem flexible cylinders although some fiv characteristics of multiple tandem flexible cylinders can be studied by considering a tandem flexible cylinder pair there are other characteristics remain unrevealed which require further investigations this paper presents an experimental study on the fivs of three and four flexible cylinders in tandem arrangement the flexible cylinder models are identical with a mass ratio of 1 9 and a length to diameter ratio of 350 the centre to centre spacings between the cylinders are kept constant as 6 d the towing speed ranges from 0 05 m s to 1 m s and the corresponding reynolds number lies in the range of 800 16 000 it is found that the presence and vibrations of the downstream cylinders have almost negligible effects on the responses of the most upstream cylinder wake induced vibration wiv type responses are observed at high reduced velocities for the downstream cylinders due to the shielding effects of the upstream cylinder cylinders and the influence of the second wiv regime the transitions between adjacent frequency synchronisation regions and neighbouring vibration modes of the downstream cylinders are delayed to higher reduced velocities most of the cylinder responses are dual resonant except for the most downstream cylinder in the three cylinder system which has identical dominant frequencies in the in line and cross flow directions combined standing wave and travelling wave responses and standing wave dominated responses are identified for three and four tandem flexible cylinders undergoing fivs keywords flow induced vibrations fivs multi mode response multiple flexible cylinders tandem arrangement 1 introduction multiple cylindrical structures arranged in tandem are encountered in many engineering applications such as overhead electric power transmission lines and clustered offshore risers flow induced vibrations fivs can occur when the cylinders are flexible or flexibly mounted and subject to a cross flow these vibrations may lead to severe structural damages due to fatigue the practical significance and the associated complex fluid dynamics of such fluid structure interaction fsi phenomena have stimulated enormous research efforts the interested readers are referred to the review articles by chen 1986 zdravkovich 1988 païdoussis and price 1988 moretti 1993 and bearman 2011 among the existing publications on the fivs of multiple tandem cylinders in the literature the simplest configuration with two cylinders arranged in line has received the most study when two stationary cylinders are in tandem arrangement depending on the longitudinal centre to centre spacing s x between these cylinders the flow patterns can be classified into three basic types zdravkovich 1987 xu and zhou 2004 zhou and yiu 2006 the extended body regime the reattachment regime and the co shedding regime the extended body regime takes place when the two cylinders are sufficiently close to each other and they behave as if a single structure at intermediate s x the separated free shear layers from the upstream cylinder reattach onto the surface of the downstream cylinder this is often referred to as the reattachment regime for even larger s x kármán vortex shedding occurs behind both cylinders which is called the co shedding regime recently alam et al 2018 numerically investigated the forces and phase lags between the vortex sheddings from three stationary cylinders in tandem arrangement at r e v d ν 200 where v is the freestream velocity d is the diameter of the cylinder and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid for spacing ratios s x 1 d 3 5 5 25 and s x 2 d 3 6 5 5 where s x 1 was the centre to centre spacing between the upstream and middle cylinders and s x 2 was that between the middle and downstream cylinders it was found that the flow around the cylinders was more sensitive to s x 1 d than to s x 2 d moreover both phase lags ϕ 1 between vortex sheddings of upstream and middle cylinders and ϕ 2 between vortex sheddings of middle and downstream cylinders had greater impact on the upstream cylinder than on the other two cylinders there have been research efforts in the attempt to enrich our understanding of the fivs of a pair of cylinders in tandem arrangement in order to study the effect of the upstream cylinder wake on the flow induced vibration fiv of a downstream rigid cylinder hover and triantafyllou 2001 and assi et al 2010 2013 conducted experimental studies with the upstream cylinder fixed and the downstream cylinder elastically supported and free to vibrate in the cross flow cf direction in hover and triantafyllou 2001 a constant spacing ratio of s x d 4 75 was considered and the reynolds number was r e 3 10 4 it was found that the downstream cylinder underwent a large amplitude galloping response and the frequency lock in extended to a reduced velocity v r of at least 17 the phase change typically associated with the frequency lock in was delayed to higher v r while the motions of the downstream cylinder had a negligible effect on the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder assi et al 2010 investigated the excitation mechanism of the wake induced vibration wiv a fluid elastic mechanism able to excite a bluff body immersed in the wake generated from another body positioned upstream into oscillatory motion of the downstream cylinder r e in their experiments was up to 3 10 4 they suggested that the wiv of the downstream cylinder was excited by the unsteady vortex structure interaction between the body and the upstream wake assi et al 2013 subsequently studied how the downstream cylinder responded to the vortex structure interaction excitation by introducing the concept of wake stiffness the results indicated that it was the wake stiffness phenomenon that defined the character of the wiv response assi 2014 further examined the wiv of a downstream cylinder with two degrees of freedom 2dof for r e between 2000 and 25 000 the upstream cylinder was kept static and the streamwise separation was fixed to 4 diameters in his study the evidence of a type of wake stiffness concept was also observed to occur for 2dof wiv in the tandem arrangement especially for higher v r besides the aforementioned experiments numerical simulations have been performed as well to investigate the fiv of a downstream rigid cylinder in the wake of an upstream stationary cylinder carmo et al 2011 numerically investigated the fiv of a downstream cylinder subject to the upstream cylinder wake at a low reynolds number of r e 150 the upstream cylinder was fixed and the downstream cylinder was elastically mounted and free to oscillate in the transverse direction the s x d range they considered was from 1 5 to 8 the downstream cylinder exhibited larger maximum amplitudes and wider lock in ranges than an isolated cylinder significant vibration amplitudes were observed for v r beyond the lock in range later on carmo et al 2013 simulated the cf only fiv of a completely free i e without any spring or damper attached to it downstream cylinder immersed in the wake of an identical stationary cylinder a fixed spacing ratio of s x d 4 was considered and r e was varied from 100 to 645 in their study three different regimes were identified a monotonically decreasing amplitude with increasing r e was observed in the first regime 90 r e 165 the second regime ranging from r e 180 to r e 360 was characterised by a significant scatter in the vibration amplitudes the second regime gradually transited to the third regime when 360 r e 405 whereas in the third regime which extended up to the highest r e the amplitude was found to grow monotonically as r e was increased the case where the upstream cylinder is fixed and the downstream cylinder is flexible has also been considered brika and laneville 1997 1999 investigated the response of the flexible downstream cylinder exposed to the wake of an identical stationary cylinder s x d between the two cylinder ranged from 7 to 25 and r e ranged from 5000 to 27 000 it was found that the response of the flexible cylinder was no longer hysteretic but showed a single branch with a wider synchronisation region the width of the synchronisation region decreased with the increase in the spacing between the two cylinders compared to the case of an isolated cylinder the onset of the synchronisation shifted to higher v r more recently huera huarte et al 2016 performed experiments with a flexible circular cylinder towed behind a stationary circular cylinder at s x d 2 6 the amplitude response of the downstream cylinder was found to be dominated by the lock in regions in the v r axis at different structural modes the amplitude responses were considerably higher than those of an isolated cylinder at the same reduced velocities and the response was more multi modal with large amplitude contributions from several adjacent modes if both cylinders are allowed to vibrate the resultant fivs will become much more intricate compared to the case where upstream cylinder is fixed and only the downstream cylinder can vibrate freely kim et al 2009 presented some experimental results of the fiv characteristics of a tandem cylinder pair both free to vibrate in the cf direction at r e 4365 74 200 five different response regimes were identified in their study depending on s x d papaioannou et al 2008 studied the effect of spacing on the fivs of two rigid cylinders in tandem arrangement the computations were carried out for three spacing ratios s x d 2 5 3 5 and 5 at r e 160 it was observed that as s x d was decreased the range of the response region of the upstream cylinder became wider the synchronisation curve shifted on the v r axis depending on s x d when the two cylinders were brought to the spacing corresponding to the reattachment regime in the stationary system the maximum vibration amplitude of the downstream cylinder increased prasanth and mittal 2009 numerically investigated the fivs of two tandem circular cylinders with s x d 5 5 at r e 100 v r ranged from 2 to 15 large amplitude vibrations in both the in line il and cf directions were observed for the downstream cylinder while lock in and hysteresis were found to exist for both the upstream and downstream cylinders the phase difference between the cf displacement and the lift force went through a 180 jump in the middle of the synchronisation regimes of both cylinders and the flow regime was divided into five sub regimes based on the phase difference and the flow patterns bao et al 2012 examined the 2dof fivs of two tandem cylinders with varying natural frequency ratios at r e 150 a constant spacing ratio of s x d 5 was considered in their numerical simulations they found that the il response of the downstream cylinder was more sensitive to the natural frequency ratio than that in the cf direction when dual resonance was excited the upstream cylinder vortex shedding might show a p s pattern a pair of vortices and a single vortex were shed alternatively in a vibration cycle which would strongly suppress the vortex shedding from the downstream cylinder as for the more practical scenario where the two cylinder are flexible huera huarte and bearman 2011 and huera huarte and gharib 2011 experimentally studied the vortex and wake induced vibrations of two tandem flexible cylinders with near and far wake interferences in a r e range up to 12 000 it was found that the responses of both cylinders showed classical vortex induced vibration viv resonance when v r was close to the typical lock in reduced velocities for small s x d the maximum vibration amplitude of the upstream cylinder was higher than that of the downstream cylinder and the maximum vibration amplitude of the upstream cylinder increased with the decrease in s x d for a large s x d the response of the downstream cylinder exhibited non classical viv resonance with large amplitudes at high v r xu et al 2018b conducted towing tank tests of the fivs of two tandem long flexible cylinders in a r e range of 800 16 000 five centre to centre spacing ratios i e s x d 4 6 8 10 and 16 were considered in their experiments to investigate the effect of s x d on the multi mode fiv behaviours of the two flexible cylinders the fiv response of the upstream cylinder was found to be similar to that of an isolated flexible cylinder within the s x d range considered in contrast as the result of the wake shielding effects generated by the upstream cylinder the response of the downstream cylinder was distinctly different from that of the upstream cylinder chen et al 2013 simulated the fivs of two vertical risers in tandem arrangement at r e 8400 and found that when the two vertical risers were arranged in tandem suppression of the vortex street in between the risers took place and the shear layers from the upstream riser reattached onto the downstream one at s x d 3 vortex shedding was initiated in the gap between the two risers as s x d was increased to 4 the computed vortex patterns and dynamic responses of the risers were in good agreement with the experimental data wang et al 2017 numerically studied the effect of spacing on the fivs of two tandem flexible cylinders the results showed that the responses of the two flexible cylinders were similar to the classical viv responses at small s x d once s x d was large enough for the vortices to become detached from the upstream cylinder the upstream cylinder response still resembled the classical viv response while the downstream cylinder was subject to wiv compared to the popularity of research on the fivs of two in line cylinders investigations of the fivs of more than two cylinders in tandem arrangement are more scarce yu et al 2016 numerically explored the 2dof fivs of three elastically mounted circular cylinders placed in an in line configuration a constant s x d 4 was considered and v r was varied from 2 to 13 at r e 100 and 150 it was observed that the maximum cf vibration amplitude increased by about 25 with a very large il oscillation amplitude comparable to that in the transverse direction furthermore the free oscillations of the three cylinders in tandem arrangement seemed to approach a chaotic response even at such low r e chen et al 2018 used an immersed boundary method to investigate the cf fivs of three tandem cylinders with an identical mass ratio of m m s ρ π d 2 4 2 where m s is the mass per unit length and ρ is the fluid density at r e 100 and v r 3 80 six spacing ratios ranging from 1 2 to 5 were considered it was found that large amplitude vibrations of the cylinders were excited at small s x d because of the strong wake cylinder interference for large s x d a vibration response similar to that of an isolated cylinder was observed for the upstream cylinder indicating that as the spacing was increased the effects of the presence and vibrations of the downstream cylinder on the upstream cylinder gradually vanished as a result of the asymmetric vibration of the cylinders and the transverse dislocation of the equilibrium positions a t s vortex shedding mode a triplet of vortices and a single vortex were shed alternatively in a vibration cycle was identified with increasing s x d two different vibration patterns were observed i e wake induced galloping wg for the small s x d case s x d 1 2 and viv for moderate to large s x d cases s x d 1 5 5 multiple slender flexible cylindrical structures arranged in tandem are prone to fivs these vibrations are the main cause of fatigue failures and together with wake interactions they might result in the collisions of the structures therefore it is of practical relevance and importance to study the fiv response characteristics of multiple flexible cylinders in tandem arrangement the existing studies on the fivs of more than two cylinders indicate that it is inappropriate to predict the oscillation behaviours of multiple in line cylinders by extrapolating from those of the simpler freely oscillating tandem cylinder pair however to the authors knowledge there is no published experimental investigations on the fivs of more than two flexible cylinders in tandem arrangement therefore the present study is aimed at elucidating the fiv response characteristics of three and four tandem flexible cylinders the outline of the rest of this paper is as follows a brief description of the experimental setup is provided in section 2 section 3 introduces the methods for the processing of the measured strain signals and the reconstruction of the displacement responses in section 4 the experimental results are presented alongside with detailed discussions finally this paper is concluded in section 5 2 experimental setup the fivs of three and four cylinder arrays in tandem arrangement as shown in fig 1 were experimentally investigated the uniform incoming flow condition was realised by towing the flexible cylinder models along a towing tank 137 m long 7 m wide and 3 3 m deep at the state key laboratory of hydraulic engineering simulation and safety in tianjin university the towing velocity ranged from 0 05 m s to 1 0 m s with an increment of 0 05 m s the corresponding r e was approximately in the range of 800 16 000 in order to eliminate the free surface effect the cylinder models were immersed 1 m below the still water free surface the cylinder models were placed nearly 2 m away from the bottom of the towing tank to avoid the boundary condition effect caused by the tank bottom the flexible cylinder models in the present study were identical in terms of their sizes properties and axial pretensions the key parameters of the cylinder models are tabulated in table 1 each cylinder model was made of a long copper pipe covered with a smooth silicon tube with an outer diameter of d 0 016 m and a length of l 5 6 m the corresponding length to diameter ratio l d was 350 the same flexible cylinder models have also been used in our previous experimental studies on the multi mode fivs of two flexible cylinders in side by side and tandem arrangements xu et al 2018a b the mass per unit length of the cylinder models was m s 0 3821 kg m resulting in a mass ratio of m 1 9 the axial tensions of the cylinders were initially set to t 450 n the damping ratios of the flexible cylinder models were determined from free decay tests and calculated by 1 ζ ln y i y i j 2 j π where y i and y i j are the strain response amplitudes of the i th and the i j th cycles respectively eq 1 has been widely used by huera huarte 2006 gao et al 2015b and han et al 2017 for estimating the damping ratios in flexible cylinder viv experiments in the present experimental tests the damping ratios of the flexible cylinder models in water are quantitatively similar with an average value of 0 034 the apparatus used in the experiment is shown in fig 2 as shown in the figure guide plates were used to eliminate the disturbed flow caused by the supporting plates and ensure the two dimensionality of the incoming flow the cylinder models were hinged by universal joints on the one end and connected to steel wires on the other end the steel wires passed through the guide and supporting plates and were connected to springs via pulleys the springs allowed the tensioners to adjust the axial tensions on the cylinder models gradually the variations of the axial tensions were monitored by the load cells rotatable circular disks were implemented on both the supporting and guide plates to realise the different configurations of the multiple flexible cylinders including tandem side by side and staggered arrangements in this paper the experimental study on the fivs of multiple flexible cylinders in tandem arrangement is presented the tandem spacings between the flexible cylinders play an important role in the fivs and wake flow fields of these cylinders zdravkovich 1988 papaioannou et al 2008 wang et al 2017 the present research is devoted to investigating the fiv response characteristics of the two specific multi cylinder configurations with three and four flexible cylinders arranged in tandem a detailed analysis of the effect of the spacing ratios between the flexible cylinders on their fivs is beyond the scope of this paper consequently the spacing ratios between the cylinder models were fixed at s x d 6 throughout the tests according to zdravkovich 1988 for two stationary cylinders in tandem arrangement s x d 6 belonged to the co shedding regime in our previous experimental study about the effect of the spacing on the fivs of two tandem flexible cylinders xu et al 2018b five centre to centre spacing ratios s x d 4 6 8 10 and 16 were considered evident wake interference was observed up to s x d 16 moreover the selection of s x d 6 makes it easier to compare the present results with those of the two tandem flexible cylinder system in xu et al 2018b for each flexible cylinder model in the present experimental campaign the il and cf bending strains were directly measured by the two pairs of strain gauges installed around the internal copper pipe as shown in fig 3 a and a total of fourteen pairs of strain gauges were mounted on the seven measurement locations g1 g7 uniformly distributed along the cylinder span as illustrated in fig 3 b the sampling frequency of the measuring instruments was 100 hz which was sufficient to avoid the aliasing problems the sampling duration of each test run was 50 s after the towing carriage reached a steady towing speed the waiting time between two consecutive towing runs was 15 min for the tank to settle 3 data analysis as mentioned in the previous section the structural strains were directly measured by using the strain gauges at the measurement locations g1 g7 along the cylinders in the experiments the cf strain can be divided into two parts the tensile strain caused by the axial pretension and the bending strain due to the fivs according to the assumption that the time average of the bending strain is zero and that of the initial strain is independent of time the strain caused by the fivs in the cf direction can be obtained the il strain at the each measurement location is similar to the cf strain but contains an additional mean bending strain component as a result of the mean drag force the il strain was processed in the same manner as the cf one a filter was applied to the bending strain in the frequency domain to remove the undesired frequency components these strain signals were high pass filtered with a cutoff of 1 hz to eliminate the low frequency effect caused by the motion of the carriage and the vibrations of the supporting structures and low pass filtered with a cutoff of 40 hz to remove the inevitable high frequency noise a modal approach which has been widely used in the flexible cylinder viv experiments chaplin et al 2005 trim et al 2005 lie and kaasen 2006 song et al 2011 gao et al 2015a b xu et al 2018a b c was employed in the present study to reconstruct the displacement responses of the flexible cylinders from the measured strain signals for each cylinder a cartesian coordinate system with the origin at the left end of the cylinder as shown in fig 3 b was adopted the positive x axis was pointing against the direction of the incoming flow the y axis was perpendicular to the incoming flow with the upright direction being positive and the z axis extended along the axis of the cylinder the vibrations of the flexible cylinders could be assumed to be approximately linear and the time varying responses of the cylinder models could be viewed as the sum of a series of mode shapes herein the cf displacement is taken as an example to briefly introduce the reconstruction process the response displacement can be expressed as 2 y z t n 1 ϕ n z w n t where y z t is the cf displacement z is the coordinate along the axis of the cylinder t is the time n is the mode number ϕ n z is the mode shape w n t is the modal weight the pretensioned cylinders used in the tests can be simplified as euler bernoulli beams with both ends pinned hence the mode shape of the nth mode is given by 3 ϕ n z sin n π z l the displacement is then reconstructed based on the relationship between the curvature and the strain 4 ε z t r n 1 n π l 2 sin n π z l w n t where ε z t is the strain data and r is the outer radius of the copper pipe in eq 4 w n t is the only unknown variable which can be calculated using the filtered fiv bending strain signals the reconstruction of the il displacement followed the same process more details about the modal approach used in the reconstruction of the displacement responses could be found in trim et al 2005 and lie and kaasen 2006 4 results and discussions towing tank tests were performed to investigate the fivs of three and four flexible circular cylinders in tandem arrangement as described in section 2 in this section the experimental results are presented and important fiv response characteristics such as the displacement amplitudes the dominant frequencies and the dominant mode numbers are analysed in detail sections 4 1 and 4 2 are focused on the three and four cylinder systems respectively 4 1 three cylinder system the coordinates of a point on a cylinder model are identified as x z t y z t overall indications of the magnitudes of the il and cf displacements at a certain spanwise location z are provided by the root mean square rms values x r m s z and y r m s z with respect to time these are defined by 5 x r m s z 1 t 0 t x z t 2 d t y r m s z 1 t 0 t y z t 2 d t where x z t and y z t are the oscillating il and cf displacements at the location z and the time instant t the integration with respect to time is carried out over an interval t with constant towing speed v which was usually taken as the time range of 20 40 s for the 50 s sampling duration of each test run the maximum displacements of flexible cylindrical structures are the prime focus in practical engineering applications in the present study the maximum dimensionless rms displacement amplitudes in the il and cf directions max x r m s d and max y r m s d are used to represent the magnitudes of the fiv responses fig 4 shows the variations of the maximum values of the rms dimensionless displacements of the three cylinder system with v r in the il and cf directions the results for the viv of an isolated single flexible cylinder are also included for comparison here v r is expressed as 6 v r v f 1 d where f 1 is the fundamental natural frequency of each flexible cylinder in still water which in theory can be approximately calculated by 7 f 1 1 2 l t m π l 2 e i m it should be noted that m is the total mass per unit length including the structural mass m s and the added mass m a ρ π d 2 4 free decay tests were conducted for the flexible cylinder models in still water to estimate their fundamental natural frequencies it was found that although there existed slight differences between the theoretical and measured values of the fundamental natural frequencies those two values were generally in reasonable agreement as the flexible cylinder models in the present study were assumed to be identical v r was calculated based on the theoretical fundamental natural frequency the same strategy has been adopted to calculate v r in our recent studies on the fivs of two tandem flexible cylinders xu et al 2018b and three and four flexible cylinders in side by side arrangement xu et al 2018d it can be seen from fig 4 a that the il amplitude response curve of cylinder 1 generally follows that of an isolated single cylinder when v r 11 27 however some discrepancies between the two curves are observed in the v r range of 12 52 25 05 which indicates that for the identical spacing ratios s x d 6 between the cylinders the presence and vibrations of cylinders 2 and 3 have stronger effects on the il amplitude response of cylinder 1 at high v r the variations of the rms il displacement amplitudes of cylinders 2 and 3 with v r share similar trends at low v r distinct humps corresponding to local vortex resonance responses of different vibration modes are observed however for high v r the il response amplitudes of the two cylinders increase with increasing v r this type of phenomenon has been reported by hover and triantafyllou 2001 and assi et al 2010 2013 for the one degree of freedom 1dof wiv and by assi 2014 for the 2dof wiv of the downstream cylinder in a pair of rigid cylinders in tandem arrangement similar wiv responses have also been reported by huera huarte and bearman 2011 for two tandem flexible cylinders with spacing ratios of s x d 3 5 and 4 and by huera huarte and gharib 2011 for spacing ratios between the two flexible cylinders in the range of 4 s x d 8 as concluded in the previous papers wiv is caused by the existence of vortex shedding between the cylinders and the influence of the shedding on the rear models fig 4 b depicts the dimensionless rms cf displacement amplitudes as a function of v r for the three cylinder system as shown in the figure the rms cf displacement amplitude of cylinder 1 varies similarly to that of an isolated single cylinder indicating that at s x d 6 between the cylinders the two downstream cylinders cylinders 2 and 3 do not significantly change the cf amplitude response of the upstream cylinder cylinder 1 which is consistent with the results of huera huarte and bearman 2011 huera huarte and gharib 2011 and our previous results in xu et al 2018b with the same s x d 6 for two tandem flexible cylinders the cf amplitude responses of cylinders 2 and 3 exhibit analogous variation trends with v r to the il ones the local vortex resonance responses of different vibration modes appear at low v r and when v r is high their cf response amplitudes build up gradually as v r is increased another distinct feature in fig 4 is that the rms il and cf displacement amplitudes of cylinder 2 are generally smaller than those of the other two cylinders in the three cylinder system and an isolated single cylinder it is speculated that both the shielding effect of cylinder 1 and the presence and vibrations of cylinder 3 contribute to the reductions in the fluctuating hydrodynamic forces on cylinder 2 and the subsequent decreases in the vibration amplitudes the variations of the dimensionless il and cf dominant frequencies f x f 1 and f y f 1 with v r for the three cylinder system are plotted in fig 5 the fast fourier transform fft is employed to determine the dominant frequencies from the steady state displacement time histories here the il and cf dominant frequencies are normalised with f 1 the diagonal grey dash lines in fig 5 a and b represent respectively twice the strouhal frequency and the strouhal frequency in the il and cf directions for an isolated single cylinder the corresponding values are derived from our previous experiment xu et al 2017 and the horizontal grey dash lines are f x 2 f 1 and f y f 1 in the il and cf directions respectively it is obvious that the il and cf dominant frequencies of cylinder 1 and their counterparts of an isolated single cylinder are very much alike by following the strouhal lines which reveals that cylinders 2 and 3 have almost negligible effects on the frequency response of cylinder 1 however the frequency responses of cylinders 2 and 3 are distinctly different from those of cylinder 1 and an isolated single cylinder for the two downstream cylinders at low v r their il and cf dominant frequencies climb along the strouhal lines with the increase in v r there exist evident synchronisations between the dominant frequencies of the two downstream cylinders and their natural frequencies of different vibration modes assi et al 2013 classified the wiv response of an elastically mounted downstream cylinder into three regimes i before the vortex shedding frequency f v the natural frequency of the cylinder f n when strouhal frequency is approaching f n the amplitude response resembles the typical viv response and the oscillation frequency f o follows the strouhal line up to the resonance peak ii the second regime between f v f n and the equivalent natural frequency of the wake stiffness f w f n is marked by a steep slope in the amplitude response curve f o remains rather close to f n iii the third regime beyond the second resonance f w f n is characterised by changes of slopes in both the amplitude and frequency response curves fig 5 suggests that the frequency responses of cylinders 2 and 3 are similar to the first two wiv regimes of an elastically mounted downstream cylinder as described by assi et al 2013 this observation also agrees with the conclusion by wang et al 2017 that only the first two wiv regimes can appear if the downstream cylinder is flexible the reason why the third wiv regime cannot be achieved for a flexible downstream cylinder is that a flexible cylinder has an infinite number of natural frequencies and the vortex shedding frequency will reach the natural frequency of the next vibration mode before the equivalent natural frequency of the wake stiffness approaches the natural frequency of the current vibration mode it can also be seen from fig 5 that as the locations of the cylinders get more downstream the nondimensional il and cf dominant frequencies of the cylinders become lower demonstrating that in the current three cylinder system with identical spacing ratios s x d 6 between the cylinders the shielding effects grow as the number of upstream cylinders is increased in addition the transitions from one frequency synchronisation region to the next shift to higher v r despite the shielding effects of the upstream cylinder cylinders the extensions of the synchronous regions as a feature of the second wiv regime also contribute to the late transitions fig 6 is the il to cf dominant frequency ratios f x f y against v r for the three cylinder system according to the figure for cylinders 1 and 2 f x f y 2 in most of the cases indicating the occurrence of dual resonance dahl et al 2010 song et al 2011 wu et al 2012 huera huarte et al 2014 zhu et al 2016 xu et al 2017 in those cases however f x f y 1 is mainly observed for cylinder 3 the possible reasons will be explained later the il and cf dominant mode numbers versus v r for the three cylinder system are presented in fig 7 as illustrated in the figure the variations of the il and cf dominant mode numbers with v r of cylinder 1 are analogous to those of an isolated single cylinder which proves that the presence and vibrations of cylinders 2 and 3 have little influence on the il and cf dominant mode numbers of cylinder 1 as for the second cylinder the highest attainable vibration modes are the same as those of the first cylinder i e the 5th and 3rd modes in the il and cf directions respectively compared to cylinders 1 and 2 the dominant mode numbers of cylinder 3 are significantly lower with the highest attainable dominant modes in both the il and cf directions being the 2nd mode for cylinders 2 and 3 the mode transitions between two adjacent vibration modes are delayed to higher v r as mentioned previously in the paper the reason for the late mode transitions of the two downstream cylinders is twofold due to the shielding effects of the upstream cylinder cylinders the true in flow velocities to cylinders 2 and 3 are lower than the freestream velocity and the fact that the second wiv regime extends the synchronisation region of each vibration mode as it is shown in fig 7 that for both the il and cf dominant mode numbers there are some abrupt jumps during their variations with v r these abrupt jumps usually take place in the mode transition regions it is deduced that they are probably related to the instabilities in the mode transition regions this might also be the reason for the sudden changes in the dominant frequency curves in fig 5 and in the f x f y curves in fig 6 by analysing figs 6 and 7 together it is clear that for all the three flexible cylinders in the tandem configuration f x f y 1 usually takes place when the cylinders are vibrating at low mode numbers the 1st and 2nd modes therefore it is believed that the aforementioned identical dominant frequencies in the il and cf directions of cylinder 3 are related to its low mode number vibrations caused by the strong shielding effects of cylinders 1 and 2 in order to investigate the typical fiv characteristics of three tandem flexible cylinders subject to uniform flow the il and cf responses of the three cylinders at v r 20 04 are analysed fig 8 presents the spanwise distributions of the dimensionless rms il and cf displacements and the spatial temporal plots of the nondimensional il and cf displacements for the three cylinder system the three subplots have the same configuration the first column illustrates the spanwise distribution of the dimensionless rms il displacement the second column is the spatial temporal plot of the nondimensional il displacement within the time interval from 25 s to 26 s the third and fourth columns are the two corresponding plots for the cf direction it can be seen from fig 8 that for cylinders 1 and 2 the vibrations of the two cylinders are dominated by the 5th and the 3rd modes in the il and cf directions respectively in contrast both the il and cf vibrations of cylinder 3 are dominated by the 2nd mode compared with cylinders 1 and 3 the il and cf displacements of cylinder 2 are smaller which agrees with the observation in fig 4 it is clear that for the il and cf responses of cylinder 1 and the il response of cylinder 2 the spanwise distributions of the dimensionless rms displacements are not close to zero and their spatial temporal plots of the nondimensional displacements exhibit combined standing wave and travelling wave behaviours nevertheless the cf vibration of cylinder 2 and the il and cf oscillations of cylinder 3 are mainly dominated by standing wave responses with the minimum dimensionless rms displacements close to zero and the spatial distributions of the rms displacements along the cylinder spans nearly symmetric the il and cf displacement time histories power spectral density plots and orbital trajectories at the seven measurement locations for the three cylinder system are provided in fig 9 each row in the subplots of fig 9 represents a measurement location g1 g7 from top to bottom and the five columns stand for the il displacement time histories for the time range of 20 s 40 s the power spectral density psd plots for the il displacements the cf displacement time histories for the same time range the psd plots for the cf displacements and the orbital trajectories respectively it is observed that the il and cf displacement amplitudes of the three cylinders vary along the cylinders the measurement locations with larger amplitudes are close to the positions of mode antinodes while the smaller amplitudes are associated with the nodes of the dominant modes the psd plots for the il and cf displacements demonstrate that the fiv responses of the three cylinders consist of one strong frequency with the highest power and multiple weaker frequencies with lower power contents according to the psd plots the il dominant frequencies of cylinders 1 and 2 are approximately twice of the cf dominant frequencies reflecting that the fivs of the two cylinders at v r 20 04 are dual resonant this conclusion is supported by the orbital trajectories most of the orbital trajectories are of a figure eight shape although they are not repeatable because the vibrations are multi amplitude and multi frequency in terms of cylinder 3 the il and cf dominant frequencies are identical leading to the outlines of the trajectories similar to the d shape trajectories as detailed in kang and jia 2013 kang et al 2016 and negri et al 2018 it is worth noting that at some measurement locations on cylinder 3 the il vibrations also have frequency components around 2 f y which together with the multi amplitude nature contributes to the nonrepeatability of the orbital trajectories of cylinder 3 4 2 four cylinder system in this section we present the results of the fiv responses of four flexible cylinders in tandem arrangement followed by the detailed discussions the same format as section 4 1 is adopted here for easy comparisons of the experimental data the maximum dimensionless rms il and cf amplitudes as a function of v r for the four cylinder system are plotted in fig 10 it can be seen that the il amplitude response of cylinder 1 in the four cylinder system almost matches that of an isolated single cylinder for v r 11 27 disparities between the two curves are observed from v r 12 52 up to the highest v r considered in the present study similar phenomena have also appeared for cylinder 1 of the three cylinder system this means that when the spacing ratios between the cylinders are identical with the values of s x d 6 the influence of the presence and vibrations of the three downstream cylinders cylinders 2 3 and 4 on the il amplitude response of cylinder 1 is stronger at high v r when v r is low there exist synchronous regions of different vibration modes in the il amplitude response curves of cylinders 2 3 and 4 furthermore similar to the two downstream cylinders in the three cylinder system the wiv type responses with increasing amplitudes as v r is increased are also observed for cylinders 2 3 and 4 in the four cylinder system at high v r as shown in fig 10 b there is good agreement in the cf amplitude responses between cylinder 1 of the four cylinder system and an isolated single cylinder it indicates that the presence and vibrations of cylinders 2 3 and 4 have little impact on the cf response amplitudes of cylinder 1 with the spacing ratios between the cylinders being s x d 6 in the present experiments the humps in the cf amplitude responses of cylinders 2 3 and 4 correspond to the local vortex resonance responses of different vibration modes the cf amplitude responses of the three downstream cylinders also exhibit some increasing trends with the increase in v r at high v r especially for cylinders 3 and 4 the combined actions of the shielding effects of the upstream cylinder cylinders and the presence and vibrations of the downstream cylinder cylinders lead to the il and cf response amplitudes of the two middle cylinders cylinder 2 and 3 in the four cylinder system being smaller than those of cylinder 1 and an isolated single cylinder in certain v r ranges these actions are more pronounced in the il amplitude responses than the cf ones as the v r range corresponding to the two middle cylinders having smaller response amplitudes than cylinder 1 and an isolated single cylinder shrinks from nearly the whole v r range considered in the present experiment for the il direction to v r 18 79 for the cf direction in terms of cylinder 4 both the il and cf response amplitudes are smaller than those of cylinder 1 and an isolated single cylinder previous studies by klamo et al 2005 govardhan and williamson 2006 and swithenbank et al 2008 showed a clear trend of increasing amplitude with increasing r e therefore the possible reason for the smaller response amplitudes of cylinder 4 might be that the shielding effects of the three upstream cylinders cylinders 1 2 and 3 cause the local in flow velocity and r e being lower than the freestream ones it is noted from figs 4 b and 10 b that the peak values of the maximum rms cf displacement amplitudes for both the three and four cylinder systems are around 1 5 d which is considerably higher than the maximum amplitude of around 1 d obtained in previous works by chaplin et al 2005 huera huarte 2006 and huera huarte and bearman 2009 on the viv of a single flexible cylinder such large cf response amplitudes have been reported by song et al 2011 and huera huarte et al 2014 in their experiments on the viv of a single flexible cylinder with low mass ratio it is presumed that the large cf response amplitudes in the viv resonance regions in the present study can be attributed to the low mass ratios of the flexible cylinder models according to huera huarte et al 2014 the effect of having a very low mass ratio for the flexible cylinders should be similar to that observed by jauvtis and williamson 2004 for elastically mounted rigid cylinders unfortunately there is no particle image velocimetry piv equipped in the present experiment consequently it is not able to verify whether the large amplitude vibrations in the present study are also associated with the 2t two triplets of vortices were shed alternatively in a vibration cycle vortex shedding mode as for the downstream cylinders the wiv also contributes to their large vibration amplitudes as the wiv response is typically characterised by a build up of amplitudes with increasing v r fig 11 presents the dimensionless il and cf dominant frequencies against v r for the four cylinder system as shown in the figure the variation trends of the nondimensional il and cf dominant frequencies with v r of cylinder 1 are similar to those of an isolated single cylinder they both approximately follow the strouhal lines revealing that at the current spacing ratios of s x d 6 between the cylinders the effects of the presence and vibrations of cylinders 2 3 and 4 on the frequency response of cylinder 1 are insignificant this conclusion agrees with the one derived in section 4 1 for the three cylinder system with regard to the frequency responses of cylinders 2 3 and 4 the dominant frequencies follow the strouhal lines at low v r and obviously lock on to the natural frequencies of different vibration modes of these cylinders with increasing v r because of the first two wiv regimes for the downstream flexible cylinders as discussed in wang et al 2017 and also earlier in this paper with the same s x d 6 between the cylinders in this study the dimensionless il and cf dominant frequencies of cylinders 2 3 and 4 are lower than those of cylinder 1 and an isolated single cylinder in the meanwhile the transitions from one frequency synchronisation region to the next for the three downstream cylinders shift to higher v r as the locations of the cylinders get further downstream and the number of upstream cylinders is increased these observations and their inducements are consistent with those for the two downstream cylinders in the three cylinder system as mentioned in section 4 1 the variations of f x f y with v r for the four cylinder system are displayed in fig 12 similar to the three cylinder system f x f y 1 normally takes place at low v r and dual resonance with f x f y 2 is found to occur in most of the cases although some fluctuations in the f x f y values are observed especially for the downstream cylinders one interesting phenomenon is that f x f y 1 at high v r observed for cylinder 3 in the three cylinder system in fig 6 does not applicable to the most downstream cylinder i e cylinder 4 in the four cylinder system the il and cf dominant mode numbers against v r for the four cylinder system are presented in fig 13 as the presence and vibrations of cylinders 2 3 and 4 have little influence on the il and cf dominant frequencies of cylinder 1 it is not unexpected that the variations of the il and cf dominant mode numbers with v r for cylinder 1 agree with those of an isolated single cylinder the highest modes of cylinders 1 and 2 are identical with the 5th mode and the 3rd mode in the il and cf directions respectively the highest attainable il mode of cylinder 3 can still reach the 5th mode whereas that in the cf direction decreases to the 2nd mode for cylinder 4 the highest mode in the il direction reduces to the 4th mode with the 2nd mode being the highest in the cf direction the delay in the mode transitions between two adjacent vibration modes as mentioned in section 4 1 is also observed for cylinders 2 3 and 4 in the four cylinder system based on fig 13 the low mode number vibrations do not occur for cylinder 4 in the four cylinder system leading to the absence of f x f y 1 at high v r for the most downstream cylinder it is speculated that the differences in the dominant frequency and dominant mode number characteristics between cylinder 3 in the three cylinder system and cylinder 4 in the four cylinder system at high v r can be attributed to the different response characteristics and wake flow patterns of the three and four cylinder systems the shielding effects of the upstream cylinders might be weaker with stronger buffeting forces from upstream vortices on cylinder 4 of the four cylinder system than those on cylinder 3 of the three cylinder system because of the differences in the complexities of the dynamic responses and the vortical structure patterns attempts will be made in the future research to quantitatively investigate the shielding effects and buffeting forces in the multi cylinder systems with the help of flow visualisation techniques similarly as a result of the instabilities in the mode transition regions the abrupt changes are observed in the variations of the dominant frequencies f x f y and the dominant mode numbers with v r for the four cylinder system figs 14 and 15 demonstrate the fiv responses of the four cylinder system in the il and cf directions at v r 20 04 in order to make a comparison with the fiv responses of the three cylinder system the same v r as used in figs 8 and 9 is selected it can be seen from fig 14 that at v r 20 04 the il and cf vibrations of cylinder 1 are dominated by the 5th mode and the 3rd mode respectively in contrast the dominant modes of cylinders 2 3 and 4 are the 4th mode in the il direction and the 2nd mode in the cf direction respectively a combination of standing wave and travelling wave responses are observed for the spatial temporal plots of the nondimensional il displacements of cylinders 2 and 4 this is also reflected from the fact that the profiles of the spanwise distributions of the dimensionless rms displacements are not close to zero in contrast the rest of the responses of the four cylinders exhibit standing wave characteristics with definite nodes and antinodes in both the spanwise distributions of the dimensionless rms displacements and the spatial temporal plots of the nondimensional displacements the il and cf displacement time histories psd plots and orbital trajectories at different measurement locations for the four cylinder system at v r 20 04 are presented in fig 15 the il and cf displacement time histories are intercepted for the time range of 20 40 s as in fig 9 it can be interpreted from the psd plots in fig 15 a c and d that there is a main frequency component with several smaller spikes in the il and cf displacements of cylinders 1 3 and 4 of the four cylinder system the majority of the il dominant frequencies of those three cylinders are twice the cf dominant frequencies resulting in orbital trajectories of a figure eight shape the weaker frequency components represented by the smaller spikes in the psd plots lead to the nonrepeatable trajectories the cf response of cylinder 2 also shows one large peak with some contributions from other frequency components however its il response is more complicated the il displacement signals at g1 g3 g5 and g7 are still dominated by the second harmonic frequency components but there are also considerable amount of the third harmonic frequency components as a consequence the outlines of the orbital trajectories at the four measurement locations are of a figure eight shape while they are not repeatable the il responses at g2 g4 and g6 are dominated by the third harmonic frequency components their corresponding orbital trajectories are irregular due to the fact that the il to cf dominant frequency ratios are not integers overall the response characteristics of cylinder 1 in the three and four cylinder systems are qualitatively similar whereas noticeable differences exist in the response characteristics of the downstream cylinders the mechanism behind those differences is similar to that described by yu et al 2016 for two and three elastically mounted rigid circular cylinders in tandem arrangement as discussed by yu et al 2016 the nonlinearities in the tandem cylinder systems originate from the flow the different multi tandem cylinder configurations result in large variations in the vortical structure patterns and the subsequent wake structure interactions which leads to the distinct dynamic response characteristics of the three and four cylinder systems in the present study 5 conclusions towing tank tests of three and four flexible cylinders in tandem arrangement subject to fivs were conducted for identical cylinders with m 1 9 l d 350 and t 450 n the spacing ratios between the cylinders were fixed at s x d 6 the fiv response characteristics of the three and four cylinder systems were investigated and their similarities to and differences from an isolated single cylinder and two flexible cylinders arranged in tandem at the same spacing ratio were identified the main findings of this paper can be summarised as follows the presence and vibrations of the downstream cylinders have stronger influence on the il amplitude response of cylinder 1 at high v r in contrast their effects on the cf amplitude response of cylinder 1 are almost negligible for the il and cf vibrations of the downstream cylinders distinct humps representing the local vortex resonance responses of different vibration modes are observed at low v r when v r is high the responses of the downstream cylinders exhibit wiv characteristics with the response amplitudes gradually building up as v r is increased due to the shielding effects of the upstream cylinder cylinders and the presence and vibrations of the downstream cylinder cylinders the il and cf response amplitudes of the middle cylinders cylinder 2 in the three cylinder system and cylinders 2 and 3 in the four cylinder system are smaller than those of cylinder 1 and an isolated single cylinder in certain v r ranges in terms of the frequency responses the il and cf frequency responses of cylinder 1 are similar to those of an isolated single cylinder reflecting that they are nearly unaffected by the presence and vibrations of the downstream cylinders the il and cf dominant frequencies of cylinder 1 of both the three and four cylinder systems approximately follow the strouhal lines with increasing v r due to the occurrence of the second wiv regime the il and cf dominant frequencies of the downstream cylinders show evident synchronisations with the natural frequencies of different vibration modes moreover as the locations of the cylinders get more downstream and the number of upstream cylinders is increased the transitions from one frequency synchronisation region to the next shift to higher v r because of the shielding effects of the upstream cylinder cylinders and the extensions of the synchronous regions as a feature of the second wiv regime in most of the cases of the three and four cylinder systems the cylinder responses are dual resonant with the 2 1 il to cf dominant frequency ratios however f x f y 1 is mainly observed for cylinder 3 of the three cylinder system as the presence and vibrations of the downstream cylinders have little influence on the il and cf dominant frequencies of cylinder 1 in the three and four cylinder systems the variations of the il and cf dominant mode numbers with v r for cylinder 1 agree with those of an isolated single cylinder the dominant mode numbers of the three and four cylinder systems vary from 1 5 and 1 3 in the il and cf directions respectively upon most occasions the il dominant mode numbers of the cylinders are higher than those in the cf direction with cylinder 3 in the three cylinder system being an exception which has identical dominant mode numbers in the il and cf directions the mode transitions between two adjacent vibration modes for the downstream cylinders are delayed to higher v r as a result of the shielding effects of the upstream cylinder cylinders and the fact that the second wiv regime extends the synchronisation region of each vibration mode at the selected v r 20 04 both combined standing wave and travelling wave responses and standing wave dominated responses are observed for the three and four cylinder systems the cylinder responses normally consist of one dominant frequency and multiple weaker frequencies at most of the time the il to cf dominant frequency ratios are 2 1 and the orbital trajectories are of a figure eight shape which is an indication of the occurrence of dual resonance however for cylinder 3 of the three cylinder system the il and cf dominant frequencies are identical leading to the d shape trajectories the orbital trajectories are nonrepeatable due to the multi amplitude and multi frequency natures of the responses in general the present experimental study provides better insights into the important aspects of the fivs of three and four flexible cylinders in tandem arrangement the results are meaningful to the design of engineering structures which involve clusters of long flexible cylinders as the spacing ratios between the cylinders are fixed at s x d 6 in the present research and the analyses of the experimental data lack the support from flow visualisation results more comprehensive and systematic studies on the effect of the spacing ratios on the fivs of more than two tandem flexible cylinders with high resolution measurements of the flow statistics will be carried out in the future acknowledgements this work was financially supported by national

22899,multiple flexible cylindrical structures arranged in tandem are commonly used in various fields of engineering up to now limited information is available about the flow induced vibrations fivs of more than two tandem flexible cylinders although some fiv characteristics of multiple tandem flexible cylinders can be studied by considering a tandem flexible cylinder pair there are other characteristics remain unrevealed which require further investigations this paper presents an experimental study on the fivs of three and four flexible cylinders in tandem arrangement the flexible cylinder models are identical with a mass ratio of 1 9 and a length to diameter ratio of 350 the centre to centre spacings between the cylinders are kept constant as 6 d the towing speed ranges from 0 05 m s to 1 m s and the corresponding reynolds number lies in the range of 800 16 000 it is found that the presence and vibrations of the downstream cylinders have almost negligible effects on the responses of the most upstream cylinder wake induced vibration wiv type responses are observed at high reduced velocities for the downstream cylinders due to the shielding effects of the upstream cylinder cylinders and the influence of the second wiv regime the transitions between adjacent frequency synchronisation regions and neighbouring vibration modes of the downstream cylinders are delayed to higher reduced velocities most of the cylinder responses are dual resonant except for the most downstream cylinder in the three cylinder system which has identical dominant frequencies in the in line and cross flow directions combined standing wave and travelling wave responses and standing wave dominated responses are identified for three and four tandem flexible cylinders undergoing fivs keywords flow induced vibrations fivs multi mode response multiple flexible cylinders tandem arrangement 1 introduction multiple cylindrical structures arranged in tandem are encountered in many engineering applications such as overhead electric power transmission lines and clustered offshore risers flow induced vibrations fivs can occur when the cylinders are flexible or flexibly mounted and subject to a cross flow these vibrations may lead to severe structural damages due to fatigue the practical significance and the associated complex fluid dynamics of such fluid structure interaction fsi phenomena have stimulated enormous research efforts the interested readers are referred to the review articles by chen 1986 zdravkovich 1988 païdoussis and price 1988 moretti 1993 and bearman 2011 among the existing publications on the fivs of multiple tandem cylinders in the literature the simplest configuration with two cylinders arranged in line has received the most study when two stationary cylinders are in tandem arrangement depending on the longitudinal centre to centre spacing s x between these cylinders the flow patterns can be classified into three basic types zdravkovich 1987 xu and zhou 2004 zhou and yiu 2006 the extended body regime the reattachment regime and the co shedding regime the extended body regime takes place when the two cylinders are sufficiently close to each other and they behave as if a single structure at intermediate s x the separated free shear layers from the upstream cylinder reattach onto the surface of the downstream cylinder this is often referred to as the reattachment regime for even larger s x kármán vortex shedding occurs behind both cylinders which is called the co shedding regime recently alam et al 2018 numerically investigated the forces and phase lags between the vortex sheddings from three stationary cylinders in tandem arrangement at r e v d ν 200 where v is the freestream velocity d is the diameter of the cylinder and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid for spacing ratios s x 1 d 3 5 5 25 and s x 2 d 3 6 5 5 where s x 1 was the centre to centre spacing between the upstream and middle cylinders and s x 2 was that between the middle and downstream cylinders it was found that the flow around the cylinders was more sensitive to s x 1 d than to s x 2 d moreover both phase lags ϕ 1 between vortex sheddings of upstream and middle cylinders and ϕ 2 between vortex sheddings of middle and downstream cylinders had greater impact on the upstream cylinder than on the other two cylinders there have been research efforts in the attempt to enrich our understanding of the fivs of a pair of cylinders in tandem arrangement in order to study the effect of the upstream cylinder wake on the flow induced vibration fiv of a downstream rigid cylinder hover and triantafyllou 2001 and assi et al 2010 2013 conducted experimental studies with the upstream cylinder fixed and the downstream cylinder elastically supported and free to vibrate in the cross flow cf direction in hover and triantafyllou 2001 a constant spacing ratio of s x d 4 75 was considered and the reynolds number was r e 3 10 4 it was found that the downstream cylinder underwent a large amplitude galloping response and the frequency lock in extended to a reduced velocity v r of at least 17 the phase change typically associated with the frequency lock in was delayed to higher v r while the motions of the downstream cylinder had a negligible effect on the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder assi et al 2010 investigated the excitation mechanism of the wake induced vibration wiv a fluid elastic mechanism able to excite a bluff body immersed in the wake generated from another body positioned upstream into oscillatory motion of the downstream cylinder r e in their experiments was up to 3 10 4 they suggested that the wiv of the downstream cylinder was excited by the unsteady vortex structure interaction between the body and the upstream wake assi et al 2013 subsequently studied how the downstream cylinder responded to the vortex structure interaction excitation by introducing the concept of wake stiffness the results indicated that it was the wake stiffness phenomenon that defined the character of the wiv response assi 2014 further examined the wiv of a downstream cylinder with two degrees of freedom 2dof for r e between 2000 and 25 000 the upstream cylinder was kept static and the streamwise separation was fixed to 4 diameters in his study the evidence of a type of wake stiffness concept was also observed to occur for 2dof wiv in the tandem arrangement especially for higher v r besides the aforementioned experiments numerical simulations have been performed as well to investigate the fiv of a downstream rigid cylinder in the wake of an upstream stationary cylinder carmo et al 2011 numerically investigated the fiv of a downstream cylinder subject to the upstream cylinder wake at a low reynolds number of r e 150 the upstream cylinder was fixed and the downstream cylinder was elastically mounted and free to oscillate in the transverse direction the s x d range they considered was from 1 5 to 8 the downstream cylinder exhibited larger maximum amplitudes and wider lock in ranges than an isolated cylinder significant vibration amplitudes were observed for v r beyond the lock in range later on carmo et al 2013 simulated the cf only fiv of a completely free i e without any spring or damper attached to it downstream cylinder immersed in the wake of an identical stationary cylinder a fixed spacing ratio of s x d 4 was considered and r e was varied from 100 to 645 in their study three different regimes were identified a monotonically decreasing amplitude with increasing r e was observed in the first regime 90 r e 165 the second regime ranging from r e 180 to r e 360 was characterised by a significant scatter in the vibration amplitudes the second regime gradually transited to the third regime when 360 r e 405 whereas in the third regime which extended up to the highest r e the amplitude was found to grow monotonically as r e was increased the case where the upstream cylinder is fixed and the downstream cylinder is flexible has also been considered brika and laneville 1997 1999 investigated the response of the flexible downstream cylinder exposed to the wake of an identical stationary cylinder s x d between the two cylinder ranged from 7 to 25 and r e ranged from 5000 to 27 000 it was found that the response of the flexible cylinder was no longer hysteretic but showed a single branch with a wider synchronisation region the width of the synchronisation region decreased with the increase in the spacing between the two cylinders compared to the case of an isolated cylinder the onset of the synchronisation shifted to higher v r more recently huera huarte et al 2016 performed experiments with a flexible circular cylinder towed behind a stationary circular cylinder at s x d 2 6 the amplitude response of the downstream cylinder was found to be dominated by the lock in regions in the v r axis at different structural modes the amplitude responses were considerably higher than those of an isolated cylinder at the same reduced velocities and the response was more multi modal with large amplitude contributions from several adjacent modes if both cylinders are allowed to vibrate the resultant fivs will become much more intricate compared to the case where upstream cylinder is fixed and only the downstream cylinder can vibrate freely kim et al 2009 presented some experimental results of the fiv characteristics of a tandem cylinder pair both free to vibrate in the cf direction at r e 4365 74 200 five different response regimes were identified in their study depending on s x d papaioannou et al 2008 studied the effect of spacing on the fivs of two rigid cylinders in tandem arrangement the computations were carried out for three spacing ratios s x d 2 5 3 5 and 5 at r e 160 it was observed that as s x d was decreased the range of the response region of the upstream cylinder became wider the synchronisation curve shifted on the v r axis depending on s x d when the two cylinders were brought to the spacing corresponding to the reattachment regime in the stationary system the maximum vibration amplitude of the downstream cylinder increased prasanth and mittal 2009 numerically investigated the fivs of two tandem circular cylinders with s x d 5 5 at r e 100 v r ranged from 2 to 15 large amplitude vibrations in both the in line il and cf directions were observed for the downstream cylinder while lock in and hysteresis were found to exist for both the upstream and downstream cylinders the phase difference between the cf displacement and the lift force went through a 180 jump in the middle of the synchronisation regimes of both cylinders and the flow regime was divided into five sub regimes based on the phase difference and the flow patterns bao et al 2012 examined the 2dof fivs of two tandem cylinders with varying natural frequency ratios at r e 150 a constant spacing ratio of s x d 5 was considered in their numerical simulations they found that the il response of the downstream cylinder was more sensitive to the natural frequency ratio than that in the cf direction when dual resonance was excited the upstream cylinder vortex shedding might show a p s pattern a pair of vortices and a single vortex were shed alternatively in a vibration cycle which would strongly suppress the vortex shedding from the downstream cylinder as for the more practical scenario where the two cylinder are flexible huera huarte and bearman 2011 and huera huarte and gharib 2011 experimentally studied the vortex and wake induced vibrations of two tandem flexible cylinders with near and far wake interferences in a r e range up to 12 000 it was found that the responses of both cylinders showed classical vortex induced vibration viv resonance when v r was close to the typical lock in reduced velocities for small s x d the maximum vibration amplitude of the upstream cylinder was higher than that of the downstream cylinder and the maximum vibration amplitude of the upstream cylinder increased with the decrease in s x d for a large s x d the response of the downstream cylinder exhibited non classical viv resonance with large amplitudes at high v r xu et al 2018b conducted towing tank tests of the fivs of two tandem long flexible cylinders in a r e range of 800 16 000 five centre to centre spacing ratios i e s x d 4 6 8 10 and 16 were considered in their experiments to investigate the effect of s x d on the multi mode fiv behaviours of the two flexible cylinders the fiv response of the upstream cylinder was found to be similar to that of an isolated flexible cylinder within the s x d range considered in contrast as the result of the wake shielding effects generated by the upstream cylinder the response of the downstream cylinder was distinctly different from that of the upstream cylinder chen et al 2013 simulated the fivs of two vertical risers in tandem arrangement at r e 8400 and found that when the two vertical risers were arranged in tandem suppression of the vortex street in between the risers took place and the shear layers from the upstream riser reattached onto the downstream one at s x d 3 vortex shedding was initiated in the gap between the two risers as s x d was increased to 4 the computed vortex patterns and dynamic responses of the risers were in good agreement with the experimental data wang et al 2017 numerically studied the effect of spacing on the fivs of two tandem flexible cylinders the results showed that the responses of the two flexible cylinders were similar to the classical viv responses at small s x d once s x d was large enough for the vortices to become detached from the upstream cylinder the upstream cylinder response still resembled the classical viv response while the downstream cylinder was subject to wiv compared to the popularity of research on the fivs of two in line cylinders investigations of the fivs of more than two cylinders in tandem arrangement are more scarce yu et al 2016 numerically explored the 2dof fivs of three elastically mounted circular cylinders placed in an in line configuration a constant s x d 4 was considered and v r was varied from 2 to 13 at r e 100 and 150 it was observed that the maximum cf vibration amplitude increased by about 25 with a very large il oscillation amplitude comparable to that in the transverse direction furthermore the free oscillations of the three cylinders in tandem arrangement seemed to approach a chaotic response even at such low r e chen et al 2018 used an immersed boundary method to investigate the cf fivs of three tandem cylinders with an identical mass ratio of m m s ρ π d 2 4 2 where m s is the mass per unit length and ρ is the fluid density at r e 100 and v r 3 80 six spacing ratios ranging from 1 2 to 5 were considered it was found that large amplitude vibrations of the cylinders were excited at small s x d because of the strong wake cylinder interference for large s x d a vibration response similar to that of an isolated cylinder was observed for the upstream cylinder indicating that as the spacing was increased the effects of the presence and vibrations of the downstream cylinder on the upstream cylinder gradually vanished as a result of the asymmetric vibration of the cylinders and the transverse dislocation of the equilibrium positions a t s vortex shedding mode a triplet of vortices and a single vortex were shed alternatively in a vibration cycle was identified with increasing s x d two different vibration patterns were observed i e wake induced galloping wg for the small s x d case s x d 1 2 and viv for moderate to large s x d cases s x d 1 5 5 multiple slender flexible cylindrical structures arranged in tandem are prone to fivs these vibrations are the main cause of fatigue failures and together with wake interactions they might result in the collisions of the structures therefore it is of practical relevance and importance to study the fiv response characteristics of multiple flexible cylinders in tandem arrangement the existing studies on the fivs of more than two cylinders indicate that it is inappropriate to predict the oscillation behaviours of multiple in line cylinders by extrapolating from those of the simpler freely oscillating tandem cylinder pair however to the authors knowledge there is no published experimental investigations on the fivs of more than two flexible cylinders in tandem arrangement therefore the present study is aimed at elucidating the fiv response characteristics of three and four tandem flexible cylinders the outline of the rest of this paper is as follows a brief description of the experimental setup is provided in section 2 section 3 introduces the methods for the processing of the measured strain signals and the reconstruction of the displacement responses in section 4 the experimental results are presented alongside with detailed discussions finally this paper is concluded in section 5 2 experimental setup the fivs of three and four cylinder arrays in tandem arrangement as shown in fig 1 were experimentally investigated the uniform incoming flow condition was realised by towing the flexible cylinder models along a towing tank 137 m long 7 m wide and 3 3 m deep at the state key laboratory of hydraulic engineering simulation and safety in tianjin university the towing velocity ranged from 0 05 m s to 1 0 m s with an increment of 0 05 m s the corresponding r e was approximately in the range of 800 16 000 in order to eliminate the free surface effect the cylinder models were immersed 1 m below the still water free surface the cylinder models were placed nearly 2 m away from the bottom of the towing tank to avoid the boundary condition effect caused by the tank bottom the flexible cylinder models in the present study were identical in terms of their sizes properties and axial pretensions the key parameters of the cylinder models are tabulated in table 1 each cylinder model was made of a long copper pipe covered with a smooth silicon tube with an outer diameter of d 0 016 m and a length of l 5 6 m the corresponding length to diameter ratio l d was 350 the same flexible cylinder models have also been used in our previous experimental studies on the multi mode fivs of two flexible cylinders in side by side and tandem arrangements xu et al 2018a b the mass per unit length of the cylinder models was m s 0 3821 kg m resulting in a mass ratio of m 1 9 the axial tensions of the cylinders were initially set to t 450 n the damping ratios of the flexible cylinder models were determined from free decay tests and calculated by 1 ζ ln y i y i j 2 j π where y i and y i j are the strain response amplitudes of the i th and the i j th cycles respectively eq 1 has been widely used by huera huarte 2006 gao et al 2015b and han et al 2017 for estimating the damping ratios in flexible cylinder viv experiments in the present experimental tests the damping ratios of the flexible cylinder models in water are quantitatively similar with an average value of 0 034 the apparatus used in the experiment is shown in fig 2 as shown in the figure guide plates were used to eliminate the disturbed flow caused by the supporting plates and ensure the two dimensionality of the incoming flow the cylinder models were hinged by universal joints on the one end and connected to steel wires on the other end the steel wires passed through the guide and supporting plates and were connected to springs via pulleys the springs allowed the tensioners to adjust the axial tensions on the cylinder models gradually the variations of the axial tensions were monitored by the load cells rotatable circular disks were implemented on both the supporting and guide plates to realise the different configurations of the multiple flexible cylinders including tandem side by side and staggered arrangements in this paper the experimental study on the fivs of multiple flexible cylinders in tandem arrangement is presented the tandem spacings between the flexible cylinders play an important role in the fivs and wake flow fields of these cylinders zdravkovich 1988 papaioannou et al 2008 wang et al 2017 the present research is devoted to investigating the fiv response characteristics of the two specific multi cylinder configurations with three and four flexible cylinders arranged in tandem a detailed analysis of the effect of the spacing ratios between the flexible cylinders on their fivs is beyond the scope of this paper consequently the spacing ratios between the cylinder models were fixed at s x d 6 throughout the tests according to zdravkovich 1988 for two stationary cylinders in tandem arrangement s x d 6 belonged to the co shedding regime in our previous experimental study about the effect of the spacing on the fivs of two tandem flexible cylinders xu et al 2018b five centre to centre spacing ratios s x d 4 6 8 10 and 16 were considered evident wake interference was observed up to s x d 16 moreover the selection of s x d 6 makes it easier to compare the present results with those of the two tandem flexible cylinder system in xu et al 2018b for each flexible cylinder model in the present experimental campaign the il and cf bending strains were directly measured by the two pairs of strain gauges installed around the internal copper pipe as shown in fig 3 a and a total of fourteen pairs of strain gauges were mounted on the seven measurement locations g1 g7 uniformly distributed along the cylinder span as illustrated in fig 3 b the sampling frequency of the measuring instruments was 100 hz which was sufficient to avoid the aliasing problems the sampling duration of each test run was 50 s after the towing carriage reached a steady towing speed the waiting time between two consecutive towing runs was 15 min for the tank to settle 3 data analysis as mentioned in the previous section the structural strains were directly measured by using the strain gauges at the measurement locations g1 g7 along the cylinders in the experiments the cf strain can be divided into two parts the tensile strain caused by the axial pretension and the bending strain due to the fivs according to the assumption that the time average of the bending strain is zero and that of the initial strain is independent of time the strain caused by the fivs in the cf direction can be obtained the il strain at the each measurement location is similar to the cf strain but contains an additional mean bending strain component as a result of the mean drag force the il strain was processed in the same manner as the cf one a filter was applied to the bending strain in the frequency domain to remove the undesired frequency components these strain signals were high pass filtered with a cutoff of 1 hz to eliminate the low frequency effect caused by the motion of the carriage and the vibrations of the supporting structures and low pass filtered with a cutoff of 40 hz to remove the inevitable high frequency noise a modal approach which has been widely used in the flexible cylinder viv experiments chaplin et al 2005 trim et al 2005 lie and kaasen 2006 song et al 2011 gao et al 2015a b xu et al 2018a b c was employed in the present study to reconstruct the displacement responses of the flexible cylinders from the measured strain signals for each cylinder a cartesian coordinate system with the origin at the left end of the cylinder as shown in fig 3 b was adopted the positive x axis was pointing against the direction of the incoming flow the y axis was perpendicular to the incoming flow with the upright direction being positive and the z axis extended along the axis of the cylinder the vibrations of the flexible cylinders could be assumed to be approximately linear and the time varying responses of the cylinder models could be viewed as the sum of a series of mode shapes herein the cf displacement is taken as an example to briefly introduce the reconstruction process the response displacement can be expressed as 2 y z t n 1 ϕ n z w n t where y z t is the cf displacement z is the coordinate along the axis of the cylinder t is the time n is the mode number ϕ n z is the mode shape w n t is the modal weight the pretensioned cylinders used in the tests can be simplified as euler bernoulli beams with both ends pinned hence the mode shape of the nth mode is given by 3 ϕ n z sin n π z l the displacement is then reconstructed based on the relationship between the curvature and the strain 4 ε z t r n 1 n π l 2 sin n π z l w n t where ε z t is the strain data and r is the outer radius of the copper pipe in eq 4 w n t is the only unknown variable which can be calculated using the filtered fiv bending strain signals the reconstruction of the il displacement followed the same process more details about the modal approach used in the reconstruction of the displacement responses could be found in trim et al 2005 and lie and kaasen 2006 4 results and discussions towing tank tests were performed to investigate the fivs of three and four flexible circular cylinders in tandem arrangement as described in section 2 in this section the experimental results are presented and important fiv response characteristics such as the displacement amplitudes the dominant frequencies and the dominant mode numbers are analysed in detail sections 4 1 and 4 2 are focused on the three and four cylinder systems respectively 4 1 three cylinder system the coordinates of a point on a cylinder model are identified as x z t y z t overall indications of the magnitudes of the il and cf displacements at a certain spanwise location z are provided by the root mean square rms values x r m s z and y r m s z with respect to time these are defined by 5 x r m s z 1 t 0 t x z t 2 d t y r m s z 1 t 0 t y z t 2 d t where x z t and y z t are the oscillating il and cf displacements at the location z and the time instant t the integration with respect to time is carried out over an interval t with constant towing speed v which was usually taken as the time range of 20 40 s for the 50 s sampling duration of each test run the maximum displacements of flexible cylindrical structures are the prime focus in practical engineering applications in the present study the maximum dimensionless rms displacement amplitudes in the il and cf directions max x r m s d and max y r m s d are used to represent the magnitudes of the fiv responses fig 4 shows the variations of the maximum values of the rms dimensionless displacements of the three cylinder system with v r in the il and cf directions the results for the viv of an isolated single flexible cylinder are also included for comparison here v r is expressed as 6 v r v f 1 d where f 1 is the fundamental natural frequency of each flexible cylinder in still water which in theory can be approximately calculated by 7 f 1 1 2 l t m π l 2 e i m it should be noted that m is the total mass per unit length including the structural mass m s and the added mass m a ρ π d 2 4 free decay tests were conducted for the flexible cylinder models in still water to estimate their fundamental natural frequencies it was found that although there existed slight differences between the theoretical and measured values of the fundamental natural frequencies those two values were generally in reasonable agreement as the flexible cylinder models in the present study were assumed to be identical v r was calculated based on the theoretical fundamental natural frequency the same strategy has been adopted to calculate v r in our recent studies on the fivs of two tandem flexible cylinders xu et al 2018b and three and four flexible cylinders in side by side arrangement xu et al 2018d it can be seen from fig 4 a that the il amplitude response curve of cylinder 1 generally follows that of an isolated single cylinder when v r 11 27 however some discrepancies between the two curves are observed in the v r range of 12 52 25 05 which indicates that for the identical spacing ratios s x d 6 between the cylinders the presence and vibrations of cylinders 2 and 3 have stronger effects on the il amplitude response of cylinder 1 at high v r the variations of the rms il displacement amplitudes of cylinders 2 and 3 with v r share similar trends at low v r distinct humps corresponding to local vortex resonance responses of different vibration modes are observed however for high v r the il response amplitudes of the two cylinders increase with increasing v r this type of phenomenon has been reported by hover and triantafyllou 2001 and assi et al 2010 2013 for the one degree of freedom 1dof wiv and by assi 2014 for the 2dof wiv of the downstream cylinder in a pair of rigid cylinders in tandem arrangement similar wiv responses have also been reported by huera huarte and bearman 2011 for two tandem flexible cylinders with spacing ratios of s x d 3 5 and 4 and by huera huarte and gharib 2011 for spacing ratios between the two flexible cylinders in the range of 4 s x d 8 as concluded in the previous papers wiv is caused by the existence of vortex shedding between the cylinders and the influence of the shedding on the rear models fig 4 b depicts the dimensionless rms cf displacement amplitudes as a function of v r for the three cylinder system as shown in the figure the rms cf displacement amplitude of cylinder 1 varies similarly to that of an isolated single cylinder indicating that at s x d 6 between the cylinders the two downstream cylinders cylinders 2 and 3 do not significantly change the cf amplitude response of the upstream cylinder cylinder 1 which is consistent with the results of huera huarte and bearman 2011 huera huarte and gharib 2011 and our previous results in xu et al 2018b with the same s x d 6 for two tandem flexible cylinders the cf amplitude responses of cylinders 2 and 3 exhibit analogous variation trends with v r to the il ones the local vortex resonance responses of different vibration modes appear at low v r and when v r is high their cf response amplitudes build up gradually as v r is increased another distinct feature in fig 4 is that the rms il and cf displacement amplitudes of cylinder 2 are generally smaller than those of the other two cylinders in the three cylinder system and an isolated single cylinder it is speculated that both the shielding effect of cylinder 1 and the presence and vibrations of cylinder 3 contribute to the reductions in the fluctuating hydrodynamic forces on cylinder 2 and the subsequent decreases in the vibration amplitudes the variations of the dimensionless il and cf dominant frequencies f x f 1 and f y f 1 with v r for the three cylinder system are plotted in fig 5 the fast fourier transform fft is employed to determine the dominant frequencies from the steady state displacement time histories here the il and cf dominant frequencies are normalised with f 1 the diagonal grey dash lines in fig 5 a and b represent respectively twice the strouhal frequency and the strouhal frequency in the il and cf directions for an isolated single cylinder the corresponding values are derived from our previous experiment xu et al 2017 and the horizontal grey dash lines are f x 2 f 1 and f y f 1 in the il and cf directions respectively it is obvious that the il and cf dominant frequencies of cylinder 1 and their counterparts of an isolated single cylinder are very much alike by following the strouhal lines which reveals that cylinders 2 and 3 have almost negligible effects on the frequency response of cylinder 1 however the frequency responses of cylinders 2 and 3 are distinctly different from those of cylinder 1 and an isolated single cylinder for the two downstream cylinders at low v r their il and cf dominant frequencies climb along the strouhal lines with the increase in v r there exist evident synchronisations between the dominant frequencies of the two downstream cylinders and their natural frequencies of different vibration modes assi et al 2013 classified the wiv response of an elastically mounted downstream cylinder into three regimes i before the vortex shedding frequency f v the natural frequency of the cylinder f n when strouhal frequency is approaching f n the amplitude response resembles the typical viv response and the oscillation frequency f o follows the strouhal line up to the resonance peak ii the second regime between f v f n and the equivalent natural frequency of the wake stiffness f w f n is marked by a steep slope in the amplitude response curve f o remains rather close to f n iii the third regime beyond the second resonance f w f n is characterised by changes of slopes in both the amplitude and frequency response curves fig 5 suggests that the frequency responses of cylinders 2 and 3 are similar to the first two wiv regimes of an elastically mounted downstream cylinder as described by assi et al 2013 this observation also agrees with the conclusion by wang et al 2017 that only the first two wiv regimes can appear if the downstream cylinder is flexible the reason why the third wiv regime cannot be achieved for a flexible downstream cylinder is that a flexible cylinder has an infinite number of natural frequencies and the vortex shedding frequency will reach the natural frequency of the next vibration mode before the equivalent natural frequency of the wake stiffness approaches the natural frequency of the current vibration mode it can also be seen from fig 5 that as the locations of the cylinders get more downstream the nondimensional il and cf dominant frequencies of the cylinders become lower demonstrating that in the current three cylinder system with identical spacing ratios s x d 6 between the cylinders the shielding effects grow as the number of upstream cylinders is increased in addition the transitions from one frequency synchronisation region to the next shift to higher v r despite the shielding effects of the upstream cylinder cylinders the extensions of the synchronous regions as a feature of the second wiv regime also contribute to the late transitions fig 6 is the il to cf dominant frequency ratios f x f y against v r for the three cylinder system according to the figure for cylinders 1 and 2 f x f y 2 in most of the cases indicating the occurrence of dual resonance dahl et al 2010 song et al 2011 wu et al 2012 huera huarte et al 2014 zhu et al 2016 xu et al 2017 in those cases however f x f y 1 is mainly observed for cylinder 3 the possible reasons will be explained later the il and cf dominant mode numbers versus v r for the three cylinder system are presented in fig 7 as illustrated in the figure the variations of the il and cf dominant mode numbers with v r of cylinder 1 are analogous to those of an isolated single cylinder which proves that the presence and vibrations of cylinders 2 and 3 have little influence on the il and cf dominant mode numbers of cylinder 1 as for the second cylinder the highest attainable vibration modes are the same as those of the first cylinder i e the 5th and 3rd modes in the il and cf directions respectively compared to cylinders 1 and 2 the dominant mode numbers of cylinder 3 are significantly lower with the highest attainable dominant modes in both the il and cf directions being the 2nd mode for cylinders 2 and 3 the mode transitions between two adjacent vibration modes are delayed to higher v r as mentioned previously in the paper the reason for the late mode transitions of the two downstream cylinders is twofold due to the shielding effects of the upstream cylinder cylinders the true in flow velocities to cylinders 2 and 3 are lower than the freestream velocity and the fact that the second wiv regime extends the synchronisation region of each vibration mode as it is shown in fig 7 that for both the il and cf dominant mode numbers there are some abrupt jumps during their variations with v r these abrupt jumps usually take place in the mode transition regions it is deduced that they are probably related to the instabilities in the mode transition regions this might also be the reason for the sudden changes in the dominant frequency curves in fig 5 and in the f x f y curves in fig 6 by analysing figs 6 and 7 together it is clear that for all the three flexible cylinders in the tandem configuration f x f y 1 usually takes place when the cylinders are vibrating at low mode numbers the 1st and 2nd modes therefore it is believed that the aforementioned identical dominant frequencies in the il and cf directions of cylinder 3 are related to its low mode number vibrations caused by the strong shielding effects of cylinders 1 and 2 in order to investigate the typical fiv characteristics of three tandem flexible cylinders subject to uniform flow the il and cf responses of the three cylinders at v r 20 04 are analysed fig 8 presents the spanwise distributions of the dimensionless rms il and cf displacements and the spatial temporal plots of the nondimensional il and cf displacements for the three cylinder system the three subplots have the same configuration the first column illustrates the spanwise distribution of the dimensionless rms il displacement the second column is the spatial temporal plot of the nondimensional il displacement within the time interval from 25 s to 26 s the third and fourth columns are the two corresponding plots for the cf direction it can be seen from fig 8 that for cylinders 1 and 2 the vibrations of the two cylinders are dominated by the 5th and the 3rd modes in the il and cf directions respectively in contrast both the il and cf vibrations of cylinder 3 are dominated by the 2nd mode compared with cylinders 1 and 3 the il and cf displacements of cylinder 2 are smaller which agrees with the observation in fig 4 it is clear that for the il and cf responses of cylinder 1 and the il response of cylinder 2 the spanwise distributions of the dimensionless rms displacements are not close to zero and their spatial temporal plots of the nondimensional displacements exhibit combined standing wave and travelling wave behaviours nevertheless the cf vibration of cylinder 2 and the il and cf oscillations of cylinder 3 are mainly dominated by standing wave responses with the minimum dimensionless rms displacements close to zero and the spatial distributions of the rms displacements along the cylinder spans nearly symmetric the il and cf displacement time histories power spectral density plots and orbital trajectories at the seven measurement locations for the three cylinder system are provided in fig 9 each row in the subplots of fig 9 represents a measurement location g1 g7 from top to bottom and the five columns stand for the il displacement time histories for the time range of 20 s 40 s the power spectral density psd plots for the il displacements the cf displacement time histories for the same time range the psd plots for the cf displacements and the orbital trajectories respectively it is observed that the il and cf displacement amplitudes of the three cylinders vary along the cylinders the measurement locations with larger amplitudes are close to the positions of mode antinodes while the smaller amplitudes are associated with the nodes of the dominant modes the psd plots for the il and cf displacements demonstrate that the fiv responses of the three cylinders consist of one strong frequency with the highest power and multiple weaker frequencies with lower power contents according to the psd plots the il dominant frequencies of cylinders 1 and 2 are approximately twice of the cf dominant frequencies reflecting that the fivs of the two cylinders at v r 20 04 are dual resonant this conclusion is supported by the orbital trajectories most of the orbital trajectories are of a figure eight shape although they are not repeatable because the vibrations are multi amplitude and multi frequency in terms of cylinder 3 the il and cf dominant frequencies are identical leading to the outlines of the trajectories similar to the d shape trajectories as detailed in kang and jia 2013 kang et al 2016 and negri et al 2018 it is worth noting that at some measurement locations on cylinder 3 the il vibrations also have frequency components around 2 f y which together with the multi amplitude nature contributes to the nonrepeatability of the orbital trajectories of cylinder 3 4 2 four cylinder system in this section we present the results of the fiv responses of four flexible cylinders in tandem arrangement followed by the detailed discussions the same format as section 4 1 is adopted here for easy comparisons of the experimental data the maximum dimensionless rms il and cf amplitudes as a function of v r for the four cylinder system are plotted in fig 10 it can be seen that the il amplitude response of cylinder 1 in the four cylinder system almost matches that of an isolated single cylinder for v r 11 27 disparities between the two curves are observed from v r 12 52 up to the highest v r considered in the present study similar phenomena have also appeared for cylinder 1 of the three cylinder system this means that when the spacing ratios between the cylinders are identical with the values of s x d 6 the influence of the presence and vibrations of the three downstream cylinders cylinders 2 3 and 4 on the il amplitude response of cylinder 1 is stronger at high v r when v r is low there exist synchronous regions of different vibration modes in the il amplitude response curves of cylinders 2 3 and 4 furthermore similar to the two downstream cylinders in the three cylinder system the wiv type responses with increasing amplitudes as v r is increased are also observed for cylinders 2 3 and 4 in the four cylinder system at high v r as shown in fig 10 b there is good agreement in the cf amplitude responses between cylinder 1 of the four cylinder system and an isolated single cylinder it indicates that the presence and vibrations of cylinders 2 3 and 4 have little impact on the cf response amplitudes of cylinder 1 with the spacing ratios between the cylinders being s x d 6 in the present experiments the humps in the cf amplitude responses of cylinders 2 3 and 4 correspond to the local vortex resonance responses of different vibration modes the cf amplitude responses of the three downstream cylinders also exhibit some increasing trends with the increase in v r at high v r especially for cylinders 3 and 4 the combined actions of the shielding effects of the upstream cylinder cylinders and the presence and vibrations of the downstream cylinder cylinders lead to the il and cf response amplitudes of the two middle cylinders cylinder 2 and 3 in the four cylinder system being smaller than those of cylinder 1 and an isolated single cylinder in certain v r ranges these actions are more pronounced in the il amplitude responses than the cf ones as the v r range corresponding to the two middle cylinders having smaller response amplitudes than cylinder 1 and an isolated single cylinder shrinks from nearly the whole v r range considered in the present experiment for the il direction to v r 18 79 for the cf direction in terms of cylinder 4 both the il and cf response amplitudes are smaller than those of cylinder 1 and an isolated single cylinder previous studies by klamo et al 2005 govardhan and williamson 2006 and swithenbank et al 2008 showed a clear trend of increasing amplitude with increasing r e therefore the possible reason for the smaller response amplitudes of cylinder 4 might be that the shielding effects of the three upstream cylinders cylinders 1 2 and 3 cause the local in flow velocity and r e being lower than the freestream ones it is noted from figs 4 b and 10 b that the peak values of the maximum rms cf displacement amplitudes for both the three and four cylinder systems are around 1 5 d which is considerably higher than the maximum amplitude of around 1 d obtained in previous works by chaplin et al 2005 huera huarte 2006 and huera huarte and bearman 2009 on the viv of a single flexible cylinder such large cf response amplitudes have been reported by song et al 2011 and huera huarte et al 2014 in their experiments on the viv of a single flexible cylinder with low mass ratio it is presumed that the large cf response amplitudes in the viv resonance regions in the present study can be attributed to the low mass ratios of the flexible cylinder models according to huera huarte et al 2014 the effect of having a very low mass ratio for the flexible cylinders should be similar to that observed by jauvtis and williamson 2004 for elastically mounted rigid cylinders unfortunately there is no particle image velocimetry piv equipped in the present experiment consequently it is not able to verify whether the large amplitude vibrations in the present study are also associated with the 2t two triplets of vortices were shed alternatively in a vibration cycle vortex shedding mode as for the downstream cylinders the wiv also contributes to their large vibration amplitudes as the wiv response is typically characterised by a build up of amplitudes with increasing v r fig 11 presents the dimensionless il and cf dominant frequencies against v r for the four cylinder system as shown in the figure the variation trends of the nondimensional il and cf dominant frequencies with v r of cylinder 1 are similar to those of an isolated single cylinder they both approximately follow the strouhal lines revealing that at the current spacing ratios of s x d 6 between the cylinders the effects of the presence and vibrations of cylinders 2 3 and 4 on the frequency response of cylinder 1 are insignificant this conclusion agrees with the one derived in section 4 1 for the three cylinder system with regard to the frequency responses of cylinders 2 3 and 4 the dominant frequencies follow the strouhal lines at low v r and obviously lock on to the natural frequencies of different vibration modes of these cylinders with increasing v r because of the first two wiv regimes for the downstream flexible cylinders as discussed in wang et al 2017 and also earlier in this paper with the same s x d 6 between the cylinders in this study the dimensionless il and cf dominant frequencies of cylinders 2 3 and 4 are lower than those of cylinder 1 and an isolated single cylinder in the meanwhile the transitions from one frequency synchronisation region to the next for the three downstream cylinders shift to higher v r as the locations of the cylinders get further downstream and the number of upstream cylinders is increased these observations and their inducements are consistent with those for the two downstream cylinders in the three cylinder system as mentioned in section 4 1 the variations of f x f y with v r for the four cylinder system are displayed in fig 12 similar to the three cylinder system f x f y 1 normally takes place at low v r and dual resonance with f x f y 2 is found to occur in most of the cases although some fluctuations in the f x f y values are observed especially for the downstream cylinders one interesting phenomenon is that f x f y 1 at high v r observed for cylinder 3 in the three cylinder system in fig 6 does not applicable to the most downstream cylinder i e cylinder 4 in the four cylinder system the il and cf dominant mode numbers against v r for the four cylinder system are presented in fig 13 as the presence and vibrations of cylinders 2 3 and 4 have little influence on the il and cf dominant frequencies of cylinder 1 it is not unexpected that the variations of the il and cf dominant mode numbers with v r for cylinder 1 agree with those of an isolated single cylinder the highest modes of cylinders 1 and 2 are identical with the 5th mode and the 3rd mode in the il and cf directions respectively the highest attainable il mode of cylinder 3 can still reach the 5th mode whereas that in the cf direction decreases to the 2nd mode for cylinder 4 the highest mode in the il direction reduces to the 4th mode with the 2nd mode being the highest in the cf direction the delay in the mode transitions between two adjacent vibration modes as mentioned in section 4 1 is also observed for cylinders 2 3 and 4 in the four cylinder system based on fig 13 the low mode number vibrations do not occur for cylinder 4 in the four cylinder system leading to the absence of f x f y 1 at high v r for the most downstream cylinder it is speculated that the differences in the dominant frequency and dominant mode number characteristics between cylinder 3 in the three cylinder system and cylinder 4 in the four cylinder system at high v r can be attributed to the different response characteristics and wake flow patterns of the three and four cylinder systems the shielding effects of the upstream cylinders might be weaker with stronger buffeting forces from upstream vortices on cylinder 4 of the four cylinder system than those on cylinder 3 of the three cylinder system because of the differences in the complexities of the dynamic responses and the vortical structure patterns attempts will be made in the future research to quantitatively investigate the shielding effects and buffeting forces in the multi cylinder systems with the help of flow visualisation techniques similarly as a result of the instabilities in the mode transition regions the abrupt changes are observed in the variations of the dominant frequencies f x f y and the dominant mode numbers with v r for the four cylinder system figs 14 and 15 demonstrate the fiv responses of the four cylinder system in the il and cf directions at v r 20 04 in order to make a comparison with the fiv responses of the three cylinder system the same v r as used in figs 8 and 9 is selected it can be seen from fig 14 that at v r 20 04 the il and cf vibrations of cylinder 1 are dominated by the 5th mode and the 3rd mode respectively in contrast the dominant modes of cylinders 2 3 and 4 are the 4th mode in the il direction and the 2nd mode in the cf direction respectively a combination of standing wave and travelling wave responses are observed for the spatial temporal plots of the nondimensional il displacements of cylinders 2 and 4 this is also reflected from the fact that the profiles of the spanwise distributions of the dimensionless rms displacements are not close to zero in contrast the rest of the responses of the four cylinders exhibit standing wave characteristics with definite nodes and antinodes in both the spanwise distributions of the dimensionless rms displacements and the spatial temporal plots of the nondimensional displacements the il and cf displacement time histories psd plots and orbital trajectories at different measurement locations for the four cylinder system at v r 20 04 are presented in fig 15 the il and cf displacement time histories are intercepted for the time range of 20 40 s as in fig 9 it can be interpreted from the psd plots in fig 15 a c and d that there is a main frequency component with several smaller spikes in the il and cf displacements of cylinders 1 3 and 4 of the four cylinder system the majority of the il dominant frequencies of those three cylinders are twice the cf dominant frequencies resulting in orbital trajectories of a figure eight shape the weaker frequency components represented by the smaller spikes in the psd plots lead to the nonrepeatable trajectories the cf response of cylinder 2 also shows one large peak with some contributions from other frequency components however its il response is more complicated the il displacement signals at g1 g3 g5 and g7 are still dominated by the second harmonic frequency components but there are also considerable amount of the third harmonic frequency components as a consequence the outlines of the orbital trajectories at the four measurement locations are of a figure eight shape while they are not repeatable the il responses at g2 g4 and g6 are dominated by the third harmonic frequency components their corresponding orbital trajectories are irregular due to the fact that the il to cf dominant frequency ratios are not integers overall the response characteristics of cylinder 1 in the three and four cylinder systems are qualitatively similar whereas noticeable differences exist in the response characteristics of the downstream cylinders the mechanism behind those differences is similar to that described by yu et al 2016 for two and three elastically mounted rigid circular cylinders in tandem arrangement as discussed by yu et al 2016 the nonlinearities in the tandem cylinder systems originate from the flow the different multi tandem cylinder configurations result in large variations in the vortical structure patterns and the subsequent wake structure interactions which leads to the distinct dynamic response characteristics of the three and four cylinder systems in the present study 5 conclusions towing tank tests of three and four flexible cylinders in tandem arrangement subject to fivs were conducted for identical cylinders with m 1 9 l d 350 and t 450 n the spacing ratios between the cylinders were fixed at s x d 6 the fiv response characteristics of the three and four cylinder systems were investigated and their similarities to and differences from an isolated single cylinder and two flexible cylinders arranged in tandem at the same spacing ratio were identified the main findings of this paper can be summarised as follows the presence and vibrations of the downstream cylinders have stronger influence on the il amplitude response of cylinder 1 at high v r in contrast their effects on the cf amplitude response of cylinder 1 are almost negligible for the il and cf vibrations of the downstream cylinders distinct humps representing the local vortex resonance responses of different vibration modes are observed at low v r when v r is high the responses of the downstream cylinders exhibit wiv characteristics with the response amplitudes gradually building up as v r is increased due to the shielding effects of the upstream cylinder cylinders and the presence and vibrations of the downstream cylinder cylinders the il and cf response amplitudes of the middle cylinders cylinder 2 in the three cylinder system and cylinders 2 and 3 in the four cylinder system are smaller than those of cylinder 1 and an isolated single cylinder in certain v r ranges in terms of the frequency responses the il and cf frequency responses of cylinder 1 are similar to those of an isolated single cylinder reflecting that they are nearly unaffected by the presence and vibrations of the downstream cylinders the il and cf dominant frequencies of cylinder 1 of both the three and four cylinder systems approximately follow the strouhal lines with increasing v r due to the occurrence of the second wiv regime the il and cf dominant frequencies of the downstream cylinders show evident synchronisations with the natural frequencies of different vibration modes moreover as the locations of the cylinders get more downstream and the number of upstream cylinders is increased the transitions from one frequency synchronisation region to the next shift to higher v r because of the shielding effects of the upstream cylinder cylinders and the extensions of the synchronous regions as a feature of the second wiv regime in most of the cases of the three and four cylinder systems the cylinder responses are dual resonant with the 2 1 il to cf dominant frequency ratios however f x f y 1 is mainly observed for cylinder 3 of the three cylinder system as the presence and vibrations of the downstream cylinders have little influence on the il and cf dominant frequencies of cylinder 1 in the three and four cylinder systems the variations of the il and cf dominant mode numbers with v r for cylinder 1 agree with those of an isolated single cylinder the dominant mode numbers of the three and four cylinder systems vary from 1 5 and 1 3 in the il and cf directions respectively upon most occasions the il dominant mode numbers of the cylinders are higher than those in the cf direction with cylinder 3 in the three cylinder system being an exception which has identical dominant mode numbers in the il and cf directions the mode transitions between two adjacent vibration modes for the downstream cylinders are delayed to higher v r as a result of the shielding effects of the upstream cylinder cylinders and the fact that the second wiv regime extends the synchronisation region of each vibration mode at the selected v r 20 04 both combined standing wave and travelling wave responses and standing wave dominated responses are observed for the three and four cylinder systems the cylinder responses normally consist of one dominant frequency and multiple weaker frequencies at most of the time the il to cf dominant frequency ratios are 2 1 and the orbital trajectories are of a figure eight shape which is an indication of the occurrence of dual resonance however for cylinder 3 of the three cylinder system the il and cf dominant frequencies are identical leading to the d shape trajectories the orbital trajectories are nonrepeatable due to the multi amplitude and multi frequency natures of the responses in general the present experimental study provides better insights into the important aspects of the fivs of three and four flexible cylinders in tandem arrangement the results are meaningful to the design of engineering structures which involve clusters of long flexible cylinders as the spacing ratios between the cylinders are fixed at s x d 6 in the present research and the analyses of the experimental data lack the support from flow visualisation results more comprehensive and systematic studies on the effect of the spacing ratios on the fivs of more than two tandem flexible cylinders with high resolution measurements of the flow statistics will be carried out in the future acknowledgements this work was financially supported by national
