16765,photo aging of microplastics mps in water environment are relevant to free radical associated polymer chain reaction and various photo chemical reactive constitutes i e cl br no3 co3 2 and natural organic matters would affect the reaction leading to a great difference in the photo aging mechanism of mps between freshwater and seawater system this study investigated light induced photo aging process of polypropylene pp mps in ultrapure water estuary water and seawater results revealed that the aging rate of pp mps was significantly decreased in estuary water and seawater compared with that in ultrapure water leading to a longer resistance time after emission in marine environment besides lower carbonyl index was found with the increased aqueous cl concentration highlighting the important role of cl in the inhibitory effect for pp mps aging process in seawater this is due to the formation of cl2 in seawater which could react with ho2 and prevent the formation of o2 thus inhibit the photo aging process of pp mps under light irradiation the finding in this study clearly indicates the impact of the water matrices on the photo aging rate of mps in natural water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics photo aging polypropylene estuary water and seawater chlorine ion 1 introduction microplastics mps plastics with particle size 5 mm pollution is of increasing concern due to their smaller size and readily to be ingested by organisms at different trophic level lu et al 2016 it was estimated that 380 million tons of plastics were produced and utilized in 2015 with 76 of those been disposed rather than been recycled or incinerated geyer et al 2017 mps thus have been demonstrated to invade into varied water matrices i e river lake estuary and sea and sink into marine environment ultimately estuary water and coastal seawater were potential secondary sources for mps in marine environment it was estimated that 1 15 and 2 41 million tons of plastic debris were emitted from estuary water and coastal seawater to marine environment yearly gall and thompson 2015 lebreton et al 2017 the contribution of plastic debris in marine environment are generally controlled by multiple factors such as region population density tide and ocean current even in some places and time ocean based e g fisheries debris was over land based one many efforts have reported the extensive distribution of mps in global estuary water and coastal seawater and the highest concentration was up to 930 000 particles m3 according to table s1 of supporting information si besides browne et al browne et al 2010 reported the small size mps contributed more than 65 in tamar estuary of uk bulk plastic wastes exist in estuary water and coastal seawater will undergo continuous weathering processes i e hydrolysis photolysis and biodegradation and breakdown into micrometer and nanometer plastic particles rowenczyk et al 2020 wu et al 2020 zhu et al 2020b thus studying the aging process of mps in estuary water and coastal seawater is fundamental for tracking their potential ecological risk to marine organisms photo degradation of mps is an essential pathway to produce abundant secondary fragments in water with free radical induced polymer chain reactions involved andrady 2015 the photo aging process will induce changes in the physicochemical properties of mps including surface roughness crystallinity surface functional groups hydrophilicity and surface charging singh and sharma 2008 several morphological alterations are also occurred in this duration and ultimately induced the formation of cracks and pores on the surface of plastic materials the modified mp properties in photo aging process may be crucial to explain the formation pathway and potential ecological effects of secondary mps observed in water environment while the dominant contributor to the alterations of mp properties have not been well depicted according to current knowledge once entering into marine environment mps are susceptible to interact with varied types and contents of organic and inorganic constituents including cl br no3 co3 2 and natural organic matters nom these organic and inorganic constituents are considered as high efficient reactive intermediates and able to be involved in the free radical reaction in mps aging under light irradiation leading to the diverse aging mechanisms in different water bodies grebel et al 2010 presumably the formation capacity for reactive oxygen species ros such as superoxide radical o2 hydroxyl radical oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 may be different with the co existence of different organic and inorganic constituents in water zhu et al 2020b in estuary water and seawater environment such as halide ions of chlorine ion cl and bromine ion br are ubiquitous in seawater and have important contribution to drive the photo degradation of organic contaminants in seawater for example parker et al parker et al 2016 reported that seawater halides could increase the degradation of domoic acid and microcystin which mainly attributed to the scavenging of hydroxyl radical oh and formation of a series of reactive halogen species rhs cl br cl2 br2 and clbr besides the destruction efficiency and potential mechanism of halide ions to pollutants may vary for different organic pollutants with the inhibitory effect for the degradation of contaminants found as the cl and br concentrations increased in aqueous solution grebel et al 2010 compared with br cl in seawater may possess higher potential to the photo degradation of organic contaminants because the concentration of cl are generally 675 folds higher than that of br emphasizing that more attention should be focused for the impact of cl on the degradation process of organic contaminants in seawater mopper and zhou 1990 although halide ions mediated photo aging of mps in estuary water and seawater might be significant to the aging process and potential environmental risks of mps in marine environment few studies have been addressed the topic to date pp was selected as target plastic due to its extensive production 19 3 to world production in 2016 and disposal in aquatic environment plasticseurope 2016 besides pp bond dissociation energy 77 kcal mol at 370 nm is relatively vulnerable to photo oxidation compared to polyethylene pe bond dissociation energy 96 kcal mol at 300 nm and polystyrene ps bond dissociation energy 90 kcal mol at 318 nm mps song et al 2017 to simulate long term aging process of pp mps in estuary water and coastal seawater system pp mps are exposed to uv irradiation for 12 d the objectives of this work are to i compare the discrepancy for the photo aging of mps in ultrapure water estuary water and seawater ii investigate the dominant factors impacting the photo aging process of mps in estuary water and seawater and iii understand the impact mechanism of water components on the aging of pp mps in water the obtained results may facilitate the prediction of physicochemical properties transportation and fate and potential ecological risk for existing mps in natural waters 2

xujiang electromechanical inc china was used and irradiated by a 500 w mercury lamp uv365 100 w m2 figure s3a and the irradiation intensity was determined by a uv radiation meter uv a beijing normal university photoelectric instrument factory china because uv irradiation was considered as primary component to the photo oxidation of plastic polymers in water a 500 w mercury lamp was chosen to simulate the long term weathering of pp mps in natural waters in this study which was also used for the aging of mps in similar studies shi et al 2021 wang et al 2020 based on the difference of spectral distribution between mercury lamp and natural sunlight caution should be made when extrapolating the results obtained in this study to real environment figure s3b the uv irradiance in

dark conditions or without pp mps for control note that all of the mps photo aging experiments were repeated in triplicate strategies to convert the accelerated experiment period to natural weathering

surface morphology as well as the distribution of element carbon and oxygen for pristine and aged pp mps sem images were also used to quantify the altered particle size of mps during aging process

ftir and dsc before and after aging experiments were conducted for 3 times 2 4 qualitative and quantitative analysis for the formation of reactive oxygen species 1o2 o2 and oh during pp mps aging process 2 4 1 qualitative analysis for the formation of 1o2 o2 and oh the formation of 1o2 o2 and oh in seawater were conducted by electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometer bruker emxplus dmpo was used as the probe compound to capture oh and o2 generated during pp mps aging process and the concentration were set at 50 mm and 100 mm respectively temp was used to capture 1o2 with the concentration set at 200 mm for the epr experiment 0 5 g of pp mps were added into a silica tube containing 20 ml ultrapure water and irradiated for 20 min with a 500 w mercury lamp then free radical quencher i e dmpo or temp was added into the reaction system immediately and passed through a 0 45 μm membrane before instrumental analysis during epr measuring the instrumental parameters were set as

and cl contained aqueous solution were quantified using xtt as probe compound rate constants 8 6 104 m 1s 1 sutherland and learmonth 1997 0 5 g pp mps and 4 mm xtt were put into 20 ml ultrapure water or 0 6 m cl contained saline water and uv irradiated for 50 min 2 ml sample was removed at 10 20 30 40 and 50 min and passing through a 0 45 μm gf f control experiments in dark conditions were conducted simultaneously xtt formazan reduction product for xtt with o2 was determined by uv vis spectrophotometer with the absorbance of 470 nm chen and jafvert 2010 sutherland and learmonth 1997 the cumulated concentration of xtt formazan at different irradiation time was determined according to the extinction coefficient of xtt formazan 21 600 m 1cm 1 at 470 nm sutherland and learmonth 1997 the cumulated concentration of o2 was 2 folds of the xtt formazan based on the reaction of xtt and o2 figure s4 oh measurements nb was used to quantify the amount of oh produced in the aging process of pp mps kong et al 2016 the 20 ml reaction system contained 0 5 g pp mps 12 ml nb 3 mm and 8 ml water after uv exposure 0 5 ml suspension was removed from the reaction system and filtrated through 0 45 μm gf f prior analysis the concentration of nb in suspension was determined by an agilent 1200 series hplc high performance liquid chromatography the chromatographic separation column was agilent eclipse xdb c18 reversed phase column 5 μm 250 mm 4 mm the mobile phase was acetonitrile and ultrapure water 60 40 v v with a flow rate of 0 5 ml min the detection wavelength injection volume and temperature were set at 263 nm 20 μl and 30 c respectively ye et al 2017 in determining the concentration of nb at different aging time 6 external standards were used with the concentration set at 0 1 0 2 0 5 1 2 and 5 m respectively 2 5 statistic analysis the correlation of carbonyl index ci for pp mps versus aging time was conducted using ibm spss 19 for windows the correlation coefficient was considered significant when p 0 05 to assure the quality of experimental data all of experiments were repeated in triplicate and the results were given as mean values standard deviation sd 3 results and discussion 3 1 photo aging of pp mps in ultrapure water estuary water and seawater to better understand the properties of aged pp mps after long term weathering in estuary water and seawater environment uv accelerated aging experiments were conducted and mps were irradiated for 20 d in ultrapure water estuary water and seawater respectively compared with dark controls new peaks in carbonyl 1500 cm 1 1800 cm 1 and hydroxyl region 3000 cm 1 3800 cm 1 were observed for irradiated pp mps in different water matrices according to the atr ftir analysis fig 1 a 1b indicating the formation of oxygen related functional groups on the surface of mps during aging process the aging extent of pp mps at different aging time was assessed using ci value 1715 cm 1 974 cm 1 as indicator rajakumar et al 2009 from fig 1c the ci value for pp mps was increased with aging time while no changes were observed in dark controls fig 1d this indicated that photo oxidation of pp mps in water may induce oxygen accumulation on the surface of plastic materials pseudo first order kinetics were applied to fit the correlation between ci value and aging time and the rate constants in ultrapure water 0 27 d 1 was higher than that in estuary water 0 13 d 1 and seawater 0 12 d 1 suggesting the obvious difference existed in the aging extent of mps between freshwater and seawater environment from 12 d 20 d of uv irradiation the ci value displayed little change with aging time fig 1c thus we considered that the ci value of pp mps have reached equilibrium state after 12 d of exposure period the plateau stage occurred between 12 d 20 d of uv irradiation might attribute to the limited diffusion ability of oxygen or free radicals to the inner layer of mps during aging process ter halle et al 2017 12 d of uv irradiation duration was chosen to further explore the changes of mp properties in different water matrices it is worthy to note that 12 d ci 0 66 0 005 of uv irradiation is comparable to approximately 90 days ci 0 74 0 04 of natural weathering in outdoor environment figure s5 3 2 characterization of pristine and aged pp mps in different water matrices the changes of surface properties and molecular structure including functional groups oxygen element distribution surface charge surface morphology melting temperature and crystallinity for aged pp mps were investigated to better understand the photo aging of pp mps in estuary water and seawater from atr ftir results different types of oxygen containing functional groups were found on the surface of aged pp mps after 12 d uv irradiation in three different water matrices including oh stretching 1653 cm 1 lu et al 2017 carboxylic acid 1712 cm 1 rajakumar et al 2009 esters 1735 cm 1 adams 1970 and lactones 1780 cm 1 morlat et al 2004 fig 2 a the formation of oxygen containing groups on the surface of pp mps was also demonstrated by eds analysis the oxygen content of pristine pp mps was 0 50 0 14 after 12 d uv exposure the percentages of oxygen content were increased to 2 95 0 63 1 35 0 07 and 1 30 0 28 for irradiated mps in ultrapure water estuary water and seawater respectively figure s6 the produced oxygen associated functional groups on the surface of aged mps may also result in the changes of surface charging and hydrophilic properties zeta potentials were varied from 1 94 0 64 mv of pristine pp mps to 10 4 4 71 mv 7 37 1 76 mv and 7 07 1 18 mv of uv irradiated 12 d mps in ultrapure water estuary water and seawater respectively fig 2b more negative charges were produced on the surface of aged mps after uv exposure which might induce higher polarity for mps in water contact angles were measured to evaluate the hydrophilicity of pp mps before and after uv irradiation liu et al 2019b as showed in fig 2c pristine pp mps was strongly hydrophobic with the measured contact angle of 103 after 12 d of uv treatment the contact angles were decreased to 89 8 ultrapure water 97 9 estuary water and 98 2 seawater which revealed that light oxidation process could apparently increase the hydrophilicity of mps no significant changes were observed for oxygen associated functional groups figure s7a surface zeta potentials figure s7b and contact angles figure s7c between pristine mps and 12 d treatment of pp mps in darkness which noted that light oxidation was critical for the alteration of mps properties in water pseudo first order kinetics was adopted to model the changes of pp mps particle size which was evaluated by comparing the ln s s0 s the average particle size at irradiation time t d s0 particle size before irradiation with aging time d as depicted in fig 2d linear correlation was established with the absolute first order kinetic constant of 0 138 d 1 0 097 d 1 and 0 050 d 1 for mps in ultrapure water estuary water and seawater respectively pp mps without light irradiation displayed little change in particle size figure s7d indicating that light oxidation coupled with mechanical abrasion was capable to produce more secondary mp fragments in aquatic environment after long term light exposure the changes of pp mps particle size during aging process can also be elucidated from the variations of mps surface morphology sem images showed that the surface of pristine pp mps was smooth and plentiful cracks and holes were formed on the out layer after 12 d of uv irradiation while no obvious change in the surface morphology was found in dark controls figure s8 dsc analysis revealed that the melting temperature followed pristine mps 166 2 c aged mps in seawater 156 3 c in estuary water 147 4 c and in ultrapure water 147 3 c fig 2e after 12 d of uv irradiation with no changes for the melting temperature found in dark controls figure s7e suggesting that photo degradation of pp mps in water could produce more flexible molecular structure for mps the result was in agreement with the changes of mp crystallinity calculated according to the absorption ratio of 998 cm 1 to 974 cm 1 crystallinity 100 1 1 i998 i974 1 233 1 i998 i974 100 brandon et al 2016 rajakumar et al 2009 differing from the changes of mps crystallinity in dark controls figure s7f the crystallinity of pp mps was decreased from 98 56 0 98 to 91 75 0 46 in ultrapure water 95 53 0 65 in estuary water and 98 16 4 15 in seawater after 12 d uv irradiation fig 2f this reflected that light irradiation of mps was susceptible to create more non crystalline region on the surface of mps which might alter the mechanical properties of polymers and then readily to be eroded by extrusion and shear forces caused by wind and wave in addition lower fragment ratio as well as the changes of melting temperature and crystallinity displayed in seawater sample illustrated that photo aging rate of pp mps in marine environment might be impeded compared with those in freshwater system hence the impact of solution chemistry on the photo aging of pp mps in estuary water and seawater were investigated further 3 3 factors controlling the aging of pp mps in estuary water and seawater to illustrate dominant water components controlling the photo aging process of pp mps in estuary water and seawater environment the contributions of dissolved organic matters dom cl br no3 and co3 2 on the photo aging of pp mps in water were compared figure s9 the concentration of these water components were chosen based on the ion chromatography and toc analysis results table s2 the determination method for the concentration of these water components was given in text s1 in figure s10 particle size of pp mps decreased by 9 51 in 0 6 m cl which was lower than that in 10 mg l no3 38 58 10 mg c l ndnom surrogate standard for dom 80 37 500 mg l co3 2 84 18 and ultrapure water 70 75 after 12 d of uv irradiation this illustrated that cl was the primary contributor to the inhibitory effect for the photo aging of pp mps in estuary water and seawater to single out the effect of cl on the photo aging of pp mps we exposed pristine pp mps into cl contained solution with concentration at 0 0 1 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 m and uv irradiated for 12 d at ph 7 dark control was conducted at the same conditions simultaneously linear correlation was fitted between the ci value and aging time with the pseudo first order constants of 0 013 d 1 0 025 d 1 0 031 d 1 0 037 d 1 and 0 043 d 1 in 0 6 0 4 0 2 0 1 and 0 m cl contained solution fig 3 a besides significant correlation r 0 993 p 0 01 between the pseudo first order constants and cl concentration was found no difference of ci value was found with aging time in dark controls fig 3b reduction of photo degradation efficiency with the increase of cl concentration in aqueous solution was also applicable to the photo degradation of methylene blue saleh and taufik 2019 and sulfadiazine biosic et al 2017 respectively therefore we can conclude that the presence of cl in water could impede the photo aging process of pp mps meant longer resistance time for pp mps after emission into estuary water and seawater environment 3 4 potential mechanism for the impact of cl on the aging of pp mps 3 4 1 formation of ros by pp mps under light irradiation photo aging of mps in water was assigned to the free radical associated polymer chain reaction process and mainly controlled by oh 1o2 and o2 wang et al 2020 zhu et al 2020a b under light irradiation pristine pp mps was readily to absorb light energy and induce the formation of excited triplet state pp mps which could transfer energy to dissolved oxygen and form 1o2 figure 11 wang et al 2021 the ch bond in tertiary carbon atom of excited triplet state pp polymer would break and result in the formation of alkyl radical r because the bond energy of tertiary alkyl radical ch3 3c 8 03 kcal mol was lower than secondary alkyl radical ch3 2ch 10 13 kcal mol primary alkyl radical ch3ch2 11 83 kcal mol and methyl radical ch3 14 23 kcal mol liu et al 2019a tedder 1982 the produced r then would react with dissolved oxygen in water and lead to the formation of alkoxy radical ro and alkyl peroxyl radical roo which ultimately transformed into hydroperoxide rooh by reacting with hydrogen radical the produced rooh then would break into ro and oh the formed ro then would be transformed to oxygen containing products such as acetic acid acetone and acetic anhydride which was demonstrated from atr ftir results fig 2a in addition the formed r ro and roo could act as electron donor the provided electrons could react with oxygen o2 e o2 oxidation potential 0 18 v or singlet oxygen 1o2 e o2 oxidation potential 0 81 v to form o2 figure s11 khachatryan et al 2011 wang et al 2021 oh 1o2 and o2 generated by plastic polymers under light irradiation may display diverse reactivity toward mps oh is a non selective free radical and able to attack contaminants through one electron oxidation h abstraction and addition to unsaturated cc bonds with the oxidation potential of 2 73 v minakata et al 2017 oh in aqueous solution was mainly produced through the breakage of hydroperoxide rooh rooh ro oh chen et al 2019 o2 in aqueous solution was a potential source of perhydroxyl radical ho2 h o2 ho2 with redox potential 1 0 v the formed ho2 can attack organic compounds through hydrogen abstraction rh ho2 r h2o2 k 300 m 1s 1 bielski et al 1983 1o2 could react with olefins in polymer by adding into conjugated carbon carbon double bond c c and induce the formation of rooh di mascio et al 2019 the c c in aged polymers was mainly formed by β scission of the polymer chain rajakumar et al 2009 in this study the formation of oh 1o2 and o2 from pp mps in water under simulated light irradiation was explored through electron paramagnetic resonance epr experiments in fig 4 a obvious quartet epr signals were observed after 20 min of uv exposure with the peak intensity followed 1 2 2 1 which was typical for the formation of dmpooh fontmorin et al 2016 fig 4b showed a broad 4 line epr signal for pp mps under light irradiation evidencing the formation of dmpoo2 spin adduct in suspension khachatryan et al 2011 while in fig 4c tempo 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 1 piperidinyloxyl was detected in epr spectrum which exhibited a distinctive triplicate epr line pattern and was assigned to the oxidation product of temp and 1o2 nardi et al 2014 contrastively no epr signals were produced after treatment in dark controls these implied that light irradiation of pp mps was responsible for the formation of oh 1o2 and o2 in water to further explore the dominant ros species controlling the aging of pp mps in water we exposed pp mps in different ros scavenger including 400 mm isopropyl alcohol ipa to quench oh 4 mm xtt to quench o2 and 4 mm ffa to quench 1o2 after exposed to uv irradiation for 48 h the ci value of mps decreased from 0 27 0 002 to 0 17 0 028 in ipa decreased for 36 84 0 22 0 046 in xtt decreased for 16 75 and 0 26 0 029 in ffa decreased for 0 42 contained solution fig 4d these implied that oh and o2 have important roles controlling the aging of pp mps in water under light irradiation 3 4 2 impact of cl on the formation of oh and o2 during pp mps aging process the impact of cl on the formation of oh and o2 by pp mps was investigated by comparing the formation capacity of oh and o2 in ultrapure water and 0 6 m cl contained aqueous solution the formation of oh in ultrapure water and cl solution were determined using nb as probe compound k nb oh 3 9 109 m 1s 1 alfassi et al 1988 figure s12 showed the direct transformation of nb was negligible during experimental period the steady state concentrations of oh oh ss was then calculated based on the second order rate constant and pseudo first order rate constants k n b eqs 1 1 k n b k n b o h o h s s surprisingly higher concentration of oh ss was foun in cl contained solution 7 33 10 15 m than that in ultrapure water 6 76 10 15 m and the first order kinetics constants were 0 095 h 1 and 0 103 h 1 respectively fig 4e the role of oh on the aging of pp mps in cl contained solution was explored through the changes of carbonyl index figure s13a contact angle figure s13b and particle size figure s13c for mps in ultrapure water 100 mm h2o2 to generate oh 0 6 m cl and 100 mm h2o2 0 6 m cl after 48 h of uv irradiation the results showed that the aging extent of pp mps was inhibited in 100 mm h2o2 0 6 m cl solution compared with that of 100 mm h2o2 solely and similar to that in 0 6 m cl contained suspension these implied that the addition of oh was not effective to the aging extent of pp mps besides the adsorption results of cl 0 6 m on pp mps 0 5 g 20 ml illustrated that the concentration of cl was decreased after 50 min of adsorption time under darkness conditions figure s14 suggesting the cl in water was able to adsorb on the surface of mps during aging process these adsorbed cl on the surface of mps may interfere the absorption efficiency of light by mps and competing the reaction sites with oh during mps aging process in water gao et al 2011 moreover under light irradiation cl can also react with oh ho cl ohcl 4 3 109 m 1s 1 and reduce the reaction efficiency between oh and mps fang et al 2014 from this point of view we deduced that oh might not act as dominant contributor to the inhibitory effect for the photo aging of pp mps in cl contained seawater because the purpose of this work is to identify the presence of cl on the inhibitory mechanism of pp mps photo aging process in seawater the non effectiveness of oh on the aging of mps in seawater is not concluded here while for o2 pseudo first order kinetic model ultrapure water y 2 57 1 e 0 07x 0 6 m cl y 1 04 1 e 0 04x was feasible to fit the changes for the cumulated concentration of o2 with uv irradiation time fig 4f higher concentration of o2 was found in ultrapure water equilibrium concentration 2 57 μm than that in 0 6 m cl contained solution equilibrium concentration 1 04 μm after 50 min of light irradiation indicating that the yield of o2 for pp mps was inhibited in the presence of cl which may result in the inhibitory effect to the aging of pp mps in seawater therefore the impact mechanism of cl on the decrease of o2 during pp mps aging process was investigated subsequently 3 4 3 inhibitory mechanism of cl on the formation of o2 during pp mps aging process according to fig 5 reaction of cl and oh under light irradiation will lead to the formation of ohcl which then decompose to oh and cl subsequently the decomposition of ohcl may responsible for the observed additional amount of oh in cl contained aqueous solution caregnato et al 2013 besides the decompose of ohcl can also generate many secondary chlorine containing radicals such as hydroxyl chloride radical ohcl ho cl ohcl 4 3 109 m 1s 1 chlorine radicals cl ohcl h cl h2o 2 6 1010 m 1s 1 which can transfer into dichloride radical anion ultimately cl2 cl cl cl2 6 5 109 m 1s 1 fang et al 2014 minakata et al 2017 this implied that cl and cl2 may play important roles to the yield of o2 during pp mps aging in seawater the production of cl was determined using 10 mm ba as a probe compound k ba oh 5 9 109 m 1s 1 k ba cl 1 8 1010 m 1s 1 k ba cl fang et al 2014 and the hplc detection method for ba in aqueous solution was given in text s2 figure s15a and s15b showed that the concentration ratio c c0 of ba exhibited no difference after 5 h uv irradiation in ultrapure water indicating the negligible self degradation of ba under uv irradiation besides no adsorption of ba on pp mps was observed after 5 h reaction in dark conditions figure s15c figure s15d showed the degradation ratio of ba was higher first order kinetic constant 0 228 h 1 in the presence of pp mps and 0 6 m cl than that of pp mps alone first order kinetic constant 0 028 h 1 revealing the formation of cl in the uv chloride reaction system and the loss of ba in aqueous solution was attributed to the formed free radicals i e cl cl2 and oh by pp mps under light irradiation impact of cl on the yield of o2 during pp mps aging process in seawater was explored using ba as cl capturer the result showed that no difference for the cumulated concentration of o2 was found either in the presence of cl or not suggesting the cl may not act as o2 contributor fig 6 a to explore the effect of cl2 on the yield of o2 during pp mps aging process 0 5 g pp mps 4 mm xtt and 2 68 mm free cl2 2500 mg l sodium hypochlorite naocl solution 8 free chlorine were added into 10 mm ba which was used to quench cl2 in the aqueous solution reaction rate constant 2 0 106 m 1s 1 contained aqueous solution or ultrapure water and uv irradiated for 50 min fang et al 2014 fig 6b showed that more of o2 was observed in the in the presence of ba compared with that in ultrapure water and no difference of uv vis at 470 nm was discovered under dark controls figure s16a and s16b evidencing that cl2 in the reaction solution could impede the formation of o2 hasegawa and neta 1978 this may due to the fact that the formed cl2 could quench ho2 ho2 cl2 h 2cl o2 produced by o2 h o2 ho2 reaction rate constant 1 0 109 m 1s 1 and accelerates the consumption of o2 in the aqueous system bielski et al 1985 the results implied that the inhibitory mechanism for cl on the aging of pp mps in seawater may be ascribed to the formed cl2 in seawater which tend to react with ho2 and interfere the free radical chain reaction process of pp mps under light irradiation the inhibitory effect of cl2 on the aging of pp mps was also demonstrated by comparing the changes of carbonyl index figure s13a contact angle figure s13b and mps particle size figure s13c in ultrapure water and free cl2 contained aqueous solution 4 conclusions photo aging is widely accepted as an effective approach for the weathering of mps in ambient water environment and mainly assign to the free radical associated polymer chain reaction under sunlight irradiation considering different types and concentrations of photochemical reactive species i e cl and br in natural waters the photo aging mechanism of mps may be modified consequently resulting in great difference in photo aging process of mps in freshwater and seawater environment thus studying the long term photo aging process of mps in estuary water and seawater are important to evaluate their potential ecological risk to aquatic organisms this study investigated long time weathering of pp mps in ultrapure water estuary water and seawater respectively the results indicated that cl in seawater exhibited significant inhibitory effect on the aging process of pp mps meant that their aging time was longer in seawater than that in estuary water and freshwater besides the inhibitory effect mediated by cl was revealed which indicated that the impact mechanism may assign to the formation of cl2 which could quench ho2 produced by o2 and involve in the free radial chain reaction of mps under light irradiation moreover further studies are urgently required to consider the multiple impact of plastic additives water components i e halides ions nom and biofilm as well as organic inorganic pollutants on the photo aging process of mps in natural waters this may be helpful to evaluate the formation fragmentation and potential ecological risk of aged mps residue in current water

16765,photo aging of microplastics mps in water environment are relevant to free radical associated polymer chain reaction and various photo chemical reactive constitutes i e cl br no3 co3 2 and natural organic matters would affect the reaction leading to a great difference in the photo aging mechanism of mps between freshwater and seawater system this study investigated light induced photo aging process of polypropylene pp mps in ultrapure water estuary water and seawater results revealed that the aging rate of pp mps was significantly decreased in estuary water and seawater compared with that in ultrapure water leading to a longer resistance time after emission in marine environment besides lower carbonyl index was found with the increased aqueous cl concentration highlighting the important role of cl in the inhibitory effect for pp mps aging process in seawater this is due to the formation of cl2 in seawater which could react with ho2 and prevent the formation of o2 thus inhibit the photo aging process of pp mps under light irradiation the finding in this study clearly indicates the impact of the water matrices on the photo aging rate of mps in natural water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics photo aging polypropylene estuary water and seawater chlorine ion 1 introduction microplastics mps plastics with particle size 5 mm pollution is of increasing concern due to their smaller size and readily to be ingested by organisms at different trophic level lu et al 2016 it was estimated that 380 million tons of plastics were produced and utilized in 2015 with 76 of those been disposed rather than been recycled or incinerated geyer et al 2017 mps thus have been demonstrated to invade into varied water matrices i e river lake estuary and sea and sink into marine environment ultimately estuary water and coastal seawater were potential secondary sources for mps in marine environment it was estimated that 1 15 and 2 41 million tons of plastic debris were emitted from estuary water and coastal seawater to marine environment yearly gall and thompson 2015 lebreton et al 2017 the contribution of plastic debris in marine environment are generally controlled by multiple factors such as region population density tide and ocean current even in some places and time ocean based e g fisheries debris was over land based one many efforts have reported the extensive distribution of mps in global estuary water and coastal seawater and the highest concentration was up to 930 000 particles m3 according to table s1 of supporting information si besides browne et al browne et al 2010 reported the small size mps contributed more than 65 in tamar estuary of uk bulk plastic wastes exist in estuary water and coastal seawater will undergo continuous weathering processes i e hydrolysis photolysis and biodegradation and breakdown into micrometer and nanometer plastic particles rowenczyk et al 2020 wu et al 2020 zhu et al 2020b thus studying the aging process of mps in estuary water and coastal seawater is fundamental for tracking their potential ecological risk to marine organisms photo degradation of mps is an essential pathway to produce abundant secondary fragments in water with free radical induced polymer chain reactions involved andrady 2015 the photo aging process will induce changes in the physicochemical properties of mps including surface roughness crystallinity surface functional groups hydrophilicity and surface charging singh and sharma 2008 several morphological alterations are also occurred in this duration and ultimately induced the formation of cracks and pores on the surface of plastic materials the modified mp properties in photo aging process may be crucial to explain the formation pathway and potential ecological effects of secondary mps observed in water environment while the dominant contributor to the alterations of mp properties have not been well depicted according to current knowledge once entering into marine environment mps are susceptible to interact with varied types and contents of organic and inorganic constituents including cl br no3 co3 2 and natural organic matters nom these organic and inorganic constituents are considered as high efficient reactive intermediates and able to be involved in the free radical reaction in mps aging under light irradiation leading to the diverse aging mechanisms in different water bodies grebel et al 2010 presumably the formation capacity for reactive oxygen species ros such as superoxide radical o2 hydroxyl radical oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 may be different with the co existence of different organic and inorganic constituents in water zhu et al 2020b in estuary water and seawater environment such as halide ions of chlorine ion cl and bromine ion br are ubiquitous in seawater and have important contribution to drive the photo degradation of organic contaminants in seawater for example parker et al parker et al 2016 reported that seawater halides could increase the degradation of domoic acid and microcystin which mainly attributed to the scavenging of hydroxyl radical oh and formation of a series of reactive halogen species rhs cl br cl2 br2 and clbr besides the destruction efficiency and potential mechanism of halide ions to pollutants may vary for different organic pollutants with the inhibitory effect for the degradation of contaminants found as the cl and br concentrations increased in aqueous solution grebel et al 2010 compared with br cl in seawater may possess higher potential to the photo degradation of organic contaminants because the concentration of cl are generally 675 folds higher than that of br emphasizing that more attention should be focused for the impact of cl on the degradation process of organic contaminants in seawater mopper and zhou 1990 although halide ions mediated photo aging of mps in estuary water and seawater might be significant to the aging process and potential environmental risks of mps in marine environment few studies have been addressed the topic to date pp was selected as target plastic due to its extensive production 19 3 to world production in 2016 and disposal in aquatic environment plasticseurope 2016 besides pp bond dissociation energy 77 kcal mol at 370 nm is relatively vulnerable to photo oxidation compared to polyethylene pe bond dissociation energy 96 kcal mol at 300 nm and polystyrene ps bond dissociation energy 90 kcal mol at 318 nm mps song et al 2017 to simulate long term aging process of pp mps in estuary water and coastal seawater system pp mps are exposed to uv irradiation for 12 d the objectives of this work are to i compare the discrepancy for the photo aging of mps in ultrapure water estuary water and seawater ii investigate the dominant factors impacting the photo aging process of mps in estuary water and seawater and iii understand the impact mechanism of water components on the

xujiang electromechanical inc china was used and irradiated by a 500 w mercury lamp uv365 100 w m2 figure s3a and the irradiation intensity was determined by a uv radiation meter uv a beijing normal university photoelectric instrument factory china because uv irradiation was considered as primary component to the photo oxidation of plastic polymers in water a 500 w mercury lamp was chosen to simulate the long term weathering of pp mps in natural waters in this study which was also used for the aging of mps in similar studies shi et al 2021 wang et al 2020 based on the difference of spectral distribution between mercury lamp and natural sunlight caution should be made when extrapolating the results obtained in this study to real environment figure s3b the uv irradiance in

process 2 4 1 qualitative analysis for the formation of 1o2 o2 and oh the formation of 1o2 o2 and oh in seawater were conducted by electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometer bruker emxplus dmpo was used as the probe compound to capture oh and o2 generated during pp mps aging process and the concentration were set at 50 mm and 100 mm respectively temp was used to capture 1o2 with the concentration set at 200 mm for the epr experiment 0 5 g of pp mps were added into a silica tube containing 20 ml ultrapure water and irradiated for 20 min with a 500 w mercury lamp then free radical

or 0 6 m cl contained saline water and uv irradiated for 50 min 2 ml sample was removed at 10 20 30 40 and 50 min and passing through a 0 45 μm gf f control experiments in dark conditions were conducted simultaneously xtt formazan reduction product for xtt with o2 was determined by uv vis spectrophotometer with the absorbance of 470 nm chen and jafvert 2010 sutherland and learmonth 1997 the cumulated concentration of xtt formazan at different irradiation time was determined according to the extinction coefficient of xtt formazan 21 600 m 1cm 1 at 470 nm sutherland and learmonth 1997 the cumulated concentration of o2 was 2 folds of the xtt formazan based on the reaction of xtt and o2 figure s4 oh measurements nb was used to quantify the amount of oh produced in the aging process of pp mps kong et al 2016 the 20 ml reaction system contained 0 5 g pp mps 12 ml nb 3 mm and 8 ml water after uv exposure 0 5 ml suspension was removed from the reaction system and filtrated through 0 45 μm gf f prior analysis the concentration of nb in suspension was determined by an agilent 1200 series hplc high performance liquid chromatography the chromatographic separation column was agilent eclipse xdb c18 reversed phase column 5 μm 250 mm 4 mm the mobile phase was acetonitrile and ultrapure water 60 40 v v with a flow rate of 0 5 ml min the detection wavelength injection volume and temperature

and 5 m respectively 2 5 statistic analysis the correlation of carbonyl index ci for pp mps versus aging time was conducted using ibm spss 19 for windows the correlation coefficient was considered significant when p 0 05 to assure the quality of experimental data all of experiments were repeated in triplicate and the results were given as mean values standard deviation sd 3 results and discussion 3 1 photo aging of pp mps in ultrapure water estuary water and seawater to better understand the properties of aged pp mps after long term weathering in estuary water and seawater environment uv accelerated aging experiments were conducted and mps were irradiated for 20 d in ultrapure water estuary water and seawater respectively compared with dark controls new peaks in carbonyl 1500 cm 1 1800 cm 1 and hydroxyl region 3000 cm 1 3800 cm 1 were observed for irradiated pp mps in different water matrices according to the atr ftir analysis fig 1 a 1b indicating the formation of oxygen related functional groups on the surface of mps during aging process the aging extent of pp mps at different aging time was assessed using ci value 1715 cm 1 974 cm 1 as indicator rajakumar et al 2009 from fig 1c the ci value for pp mps was increased with aging time while no changes were observed in dark controls fig 1d this indicated that photo oxidation of pp mps in water may induce oxygen accumulation on the surface of plastic materials pseudo first order kinetics were applied to fit the correlation between ci value and aging time and the rate constants in ultrapure water 0 27 d 1 was higher than that in estuary water 0 13 d 1 and seawater 0 12 d 1 suggesting the obvious difference existed in the aging extent of mps between freshwater and seawater environment from 12 d 20 d of uv irradiation the ci value displayed little change with aging time fig 1c thus we considered that the ci value of pp mps have reached equilibrium state after 12 d of exposure period the plateau stage occurred between 12 d 20 d of uv irradiation might attribute to the limited diffusion ability of oxygen or free radicals to the inner layer of mps during aging process ter halle et al 2017 12 d of uv irradiation duration was chosen to further explore the changes of mp properties in different water matrices it is worthy to note that 12 d ci 0 66 0 005 of uv irradiation is comparable to approximately 90 days ci 0 74 0 04 of natural weathering in outdoor environment figure s5 3 2 characterization of pristine and aged pp mps in different water matrices the changes of surface properties and molecular structure including functional groups oxygen element distribution surface charge surface morphology melting temperature and crystallinity for aged pp mps were investigated to better understand the photo aging of pp mps in estuary water and seawater from atr ftir results different types of oxygen containing functional groups were found on the surface of aged pp mps after 12 d uv irradiation in three different water matrices including oh stretching 1653 cm 1 lu et al 2017 carboxylic acid 1712 cm 1 rajakumar et al 2009 esters 1735 cm 1 adams 1970 and lactones 1780 cm 1 morlat et al 2004 fig 2 a the formation of oxygen containing groups on the surface of pp mps was also demonstrated by eds analysis the oxygen content of pristine pp mps was 0 50 0 14 after 12 d uv exposure the percentages of oxygen content were increased to 2 95 0 63 1 35 0 07 and 1 30 0 28 for irradiated mps in ultrapure water estuary water and seawater respectively figure s6 the produced oxygen associated functional groups on the surface of aged mps may also result in the changes of surface charging and hydrophilic properties zeta potentials were varied from 1 94 0 64 mv of pristine pp mps to 10 4 4 71 mv 7 37 1 76 mv and 7 07 1 18 mv of uv irradiated 12 d mps in ultrapure water estuary water and seawater respectively fig 2b more negative charges were produced on the surface of aged mps after uv exposure which might induce higher polarity for mps in water contact angles were measured to evaluate the hydrophilicity of pp mps before and after uv irradiation liu et al 2019b as showed in fig 2c pristine pp mps was strongly hydrophobic with the measured contact angle of 103 after 12 d of uv treatment the contact angles were decreased to 89 8 ultrapure water 97 9 estuary water and 98 2 seawater which revealed that light oxidation process could apparently increase the hydrophilicity of mps no significant changes were observed for oxygen associated functional groups figure s7a surface zeta potentials figure s7b and contact angles figure s7c between pristine mps and 12 d treatment of pp mps in darkness which noted that light oxidation was critical for the alteration of mps properties in water pseudo first order kinetics was adopted to model the changes of pp mps particle size which was evaluated by comparing the ln s s0 s the average particle size at irradiation time t d s0 particle size before irradiation with aging time d as depicted in fig 2d linear correlation was established with the absolute first order kinetic constant of 0 138 d 1 0 097 d 1 and 0 050 d 1 for mps in ultrapure water estuary water and seawater respectively pp mps without light irradiation displayed little change in particle size figure s7d indicating that light oxidation coupled with mechanical abrasion was capable to produce more secondary mp fragments in aquatic environment after long term light exposure the changes of pp mps particle size during aging process can also be elucidated from the variations of mps surface morphology sem images showed that the surface of pristine pp mps was smooth and plentiful cracks and holes were formed on the out layer after 12 d of uv irradiation while no obvious change in the surface morphology was found in dark controls figure s8 dsc analysis revealed that the melting temperature followed pristine mps 166 2 c aged mps in seawater 156 3 c in estuary water 147 4 c and in ultrapure water 147 3 c fig 2e after 12 d of uv irradiation with no changes for the melting temperature found in dark controls figure s7e suggesting that photo degradation of pp mps in water could produce more flexible molecular structure for mps the result was in agreement with the changes of mp crystallinity calculated according to the absorption ratio of 998 cm 1 to 974 cm 1 crystallinity 100 1 1 i998 i974 1 233 1 i998 i974 100 brandon et al 2016 rajakumar et al 2009 differing from the changes of mps crystallinity in dark controls figure s7f the crystallinity of pp mps was decreased from 98 56 0 98 to 91 75 0 46 in ultrapure water 95 53 0 65 in estuary water and 98 16 4 15 in seawater after 12 d uv irradiation fig 2f this reflected that light irradiation of mps was susceptible to create more non crystalline region on the surface of mps which might alter the mechanical properties of polymers and then readily to be eroded by extrusion and shear forces caused by wind and wave in addition lower fragment ratio as well as the changes of melting temperature and crystallinity displayed in seawater sample illustrated that photo aging rate of pp mps in marine environment might be impeded compared with those in freshwater system hence the impact of solution chemistry on the photo aging of pp mps in estuary water and seawater were investigated further 3 3 factors controlling the aging of pp mps in estuary water and seawater to illustrate dominant water components controlling the photo aging process of pp mps in estuary water and seawater environment the contributions of dissolved organic matters dom cl br no3 and co3 2 on the photo aging of pp mps in water were compared figure s9 the concentration of these water components were chosen based on the ion chromatography and toc analysis results table s2 the determination method for the concentration of these water components was given in text s1 in figure s10 particle size of pp mps decreased by 9 51 in 0 6 m cl which was lower than that in 10 mg l no3 38 58 10 mg c l ndnom surrogate standard for dom 80 37 500 mg l co3 2 84 18 and ultrapure water 70 75 after 12 d of uv irradiation this illustrated that cl was the primary contributor to the inhibitory effect for the photo aging of pp mps in estuary water and seawater to single out the effect of cl on the photo aging of pp mps we exposed pristine pp mps into cl contained solution with concentration at 0 0 1 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 m and uv irradiated for 12 d at ph 7 dark control was conducted at the same conditions simultaneously linear correlation was fitted between the ci value and aging time with the pseudo first order constants of 0 013 d 1 0 025 d 1 0 031 d 1 0 037 d 1 and 0 043 d 1 in 0 6 0 4 0 2 0 1 and 0 m cl contained solution fig 3 a besides significant correlation r 0 993 p 0 01 between the pseudo first order constants and cl concentration was found no difference of ci value was found with aging time in dark controls fig 3b reduction of photo degradation efficiency with the increase of cl concentration in aqueous solution was also applicable to the photo degradation of methylene blue saleh and taufik 2019 and sulfadiazine biosic et al 2017 respectively therefore we can conclude that the presence of cl in water could impede the photo aging process of pp mps meant longer resistance time for pp mps after emission into estuary water and seawater environment 3 4 potential mechanism for the impact of cl on the aging of pp mps 3 4 1 formation of ros by pp mps under light irradiation photo aging of mps in water was assigned to the free radical associated polymer chain reaction process and mainly controlled by oh 1o2 and o2 wang et al 2020 zhu et al 2020a b under light irradiation pristine pp mps was readily to absorb light energy and induce the formation of excited triplet state pp mps which could transfer energy to dissolved oxygen and form 1o2 figure 11 wang et al 2021 the ch bond in tertiary carbon atom of excited triplet state pp polymer would break and result in the formation of alkyl radical r because the bond energy of tertiary alkyl radical ch3 3c 8 03 kcal mol was lower than secondary alkyl radical ch3 2ch 10 13 kcal mol primary alkyl radical ch3ch2 11 83 kcal mol and methyl radical ch3 14 23 kcal mol liu et al 2019a tedder 1982 the produced r then would react with dissolved oxygen in water and lead to the formation of alkoxy radical ro and alkyl peroxyl radical roo which ultimately transformed into hydroperoxide rooh by reacting with hydrogen radical the produced rooh then would break into ro and oh the formed ro then would be transformed to oxygen containing products such as acetic acid acetone and acetic anhydride which was demonstrated from atr ftir results fig 2a in addition the formed r ro and roo could act as electron donor the provided electrons could react with oxygen o2 e o2 oxidation potential 0 18 v or singlet oxygen 1o2 e o2 oxidation potential 0 81 v to form o2 figure s11 khachatryan et al 2011 wang et al 2021 oh 1o2 and o2 generated by plastic polymers under light irradiation may display diverse reactivity toward mps oh is a non selective free radical and able to attack contaminants through one electron oxidation h abstraction and addition to unsaturated cc bonds with the oxidation potential of 2 73 v minakata et al 2017 oh in aqueous solution was mainly produced through the breakage of hydroperoxide rooh rooh ro oh chen et al 2019 o2 in aqueous solution was a potential source of perhydroxyl radical ho2 h o2 ho2 with redox potential 1 0 v the formed ho2 can attack organic compounds through hydrogen abstraction rh ho2 r h2o2 k 300 m 1s 1 bielski et al 1983 1o2 could react with olefins in polymer by adding into conjugated carbon carbon double bond c c and induce the formation of rooh di mascio et al 2019 the c c in aged polymers was mainly formed by β scission of the polymer chain rajakumar et al 2009 in this study the formation of oh 1o2 and o2 from pp mps in water under simulated light irradiation was explored through electron paramagnetic resonance epr experiments in fig 4 a obvious quartet epr signals were observed after 20 min of uv exposure with the peak intensity followed 1 2 2 1 which was typical for the formation of dmpooh fontmorin et al 2016 fig 4b showed a broad 4 line epr signal for pp mps under light irradiation evidencing the formation of dmpoo2 spin adduct in suspension khachatryan et al 2011 while in fig 4c tempo 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 1 piperidinyloxyl was detected in epr spectrum which exhibited a distinctive triplicate epr line pattern and was assigned to the oxidation product of temp and 1o2 nardi et al 2014 contrastively no epr signals were produced after treatment in dark controls these implied that light irradiation of pp mps was responsible for the formation of oh 1o2 and o2 in water to further explore the dominant ros species controlling the aging of pp mps in water we exposed pp mps in different ros scavenger including 400 mm isopropyl alcohol ipa to quench oh 4 mm xtt to quench o2 and 4 mm ffa to quench 1o2 after exposed to uv irradiation for 48 h the ci value of mps decreased from 0 27 0 002 to 0 17 0 028 in ipa decreased for 36 84 0 22 0 046 in xtt decreased for 16 75 and 0 26 0 029 in ffa decreased for 0 42 contained solution fig 4d these implied that oh and o2 have important roles controlling the aging of pp mps in water under light irradiation 3 4 2 impact of cl on the formation of oh and o2 during pp mps aging process the impact of cl on the formation of oh and o2 by pp mps was investigated by comparing the formation capacity of oh and o2 in ultrapure water and 0 6 m cl contained aqueous solution the formation of oh in ultrapure water and cl solution were determined using nb as probe compound k nb oh 3 9 109 m 1s 1 alfassi et al 1988 figure s12 showed the direct transformation of nb was negligible during experimental period the steady state concentrations of oh oh ss was then calculated based on the second order rate constant and pseudo first order rate constants k n b eqs 1 1 k n b k n b o h o h s s surprisingly higher concentration of oh ss was foun in cl contained solution 7 33 10 15 m than that in ultrapure water 6 76 10 15 m and the first order kinetics constants were 0 095 h 1 and 0 103 h 1 respectively fig 4e the role of oh on the aging of pp mps in cl contained solution was explored through the changes of carbonyl index figure s13a contact angle figure s13b and particle size figure s13c for mps in ultrapure water 100 mm h2o2 to generate oh 0 6 m cl and 100 mm h2o2 0 6 m cl after 48 h of uv irradiation the results showed that the aging extent of pp mps was inhibited in 100 mm h2o2 0 6 m cl solution compared with that of 100 mm h2o2 solely and similar to that in 0 6 m cl contained suspension these implied that the addition of oh was not effective to the aging extent of pp mps besides the adsorption results of cl 0 6 m on pp mps 0 5 g 20 ml illustrated that the concentration of cl was decreased after 50 min of adsorption time under darkness conditions figure s14 suggesting the cl in water was able to adsorb on the surface of mps during aging process these adsorbed cl on the surface of mps may interfere the absorption efficiency of light by mps and competing the reaction sites with oh during mps aging process in water gao et al 2011 moreover under light irradiation cl can also react with oh ho cl ohcl 4 3 109 m 1s 1 and reduce the reaction efficiency between oh and mps fang et al 2014 from this point of view we deduced that oh might not act as dominant contributor to the inhibitory effect for the photo aging of pp mps in cl contained seawater because the purpose of this work is to identify the presence of cl on the inhibitory mechanism of pp mps photo aging process in seawater the non effectiveness of oh on the aging of mps in seawater is not concluded here while for o2 pseudo first order kinetic model ultrapure water y 2 57 1 e 0 07x 0 6 m cl y 1 04 1 e 0 04x was feasible to fit the changes for the cumulated concentration of o2 with uv irradiation time fig 4f higher concentration of o2 was found in ultrapure water equilibrium concentration 2 57 μm than that in 0 6 m cl contained solution equilibrium concentration 1 04 μm after 50 min of light irradiation indicating that the yield of o2 for pp mps was inhibited in the presence of cl which may result in the inhibitory effect to the aging of pp mps in seawater therefore the impact mechanism of cl on the decrease of o2 during pp mps aging process was investigated subsequently 3 4 3 inhibitory mechanism of cl on the formation of o2 during pp mps aging process according to fig 5 reaction of cl and oh under light irradiation will lead to the formation of ohcl which then decompose to oh and cl subsequently the decomposition of ohcl may responsible for the observed additional amount of oh in cl contained aqueous solution caregnato et al 2013 besides the decompose of ohcl can also generate many secondary chlorine containing radicals such as hydroxyl chloride radical ohcl ho cl ohcl 4 3 109 m 1s 1 chlorine radicals cl ohcl h cl h2o 2 6 1010 m 1s 1 which can transfer into dichloride radical anion ultimately cl2 cl cl cl2 6 5 109 m 1s 1 fang et al 2014 minakata et al 2017 this implied that cl and cl2 may play important roles to the yield of o2 during pp mps aging in seawater the production of cl was determined using 10 mm ba as a probe compound k ba oh 5 9 109 m 1s 1 k ba cl 1 8 1010 m 1s 1 k ba cl fang et al 2014 and the hplc detection method for ba in aqueous solution was given in text s2 figure s15a and s15b showed that the concentration ratio c c0 of ba exhibited no difference after 5 h uv irradiation in ultrapure water indicating the negligible self degradation of ba under uv irradiation besides no adsorption of ba on pp mps was observed after 5 h reaction in dark conditions figure s15c figure s15d showed the degradation ratio of ba was higher first order kinetic constant 0 228 h 1 in the presence of pp mps and 0 6 m cl than that of pp mps alone first order kinetic constant 0 028 h 1 revealing the formation of cl in the uv chloride reaction system and the loss of ba in aqueous solution was attributed to the formed free radicals i e cl cl2 and oh by pp mps under light irradiation impact of cl on the yield of o2 during pp mps aging process in seawater was explored using ba as cl capturer the result showed that no difference for the cumulated concentration of o2 was found either in the presence of cl or not suggesting the cl may not act as o2 contributor fig 6 a to explore the effect of cl2 on the yield of o2 during pp mps aging process 0 5 g pp mps 4 mm xtt and 2 68 mm free cl2 2500 mg l sodium hypochlorite naocl solution 8 free chlorine were added into 10 mm ba which was used to quench cl2 in the aqueous solution reaction rate constant 2 0 106 m 1s 1 contained aqueous solution or ultrapure water and uv irradiated for 50 min fang et al 2014 fig 6b showed that more of o2 was observed in the in the presence of ba compared with that in ultrapure water and no difference of uv vis at 470 nm was discovered under dark controls figure s16a and s16b evidencing that cl2 in the reaction solution could impede the formation of o2 hasegawa and neta 1978 this may due to the fact that the formed cl2 could quench ho2 ho2 cl2 h 2cl o2 produced by o2 h o2 ho2 reaction rate constant 1 0 109 m 1s 1 and accelerates the consumption of o2 in the aqueous system bielski et al 1985 the results implied that the inhibitory mechanism for cl on the aging of pp mps in seawater may be ascribed to the formed cl2 in seawater which tend to react with ho2 and interfere the free radical chain reaction process of pp mps under light irradiation the inhibitory effect of cl2 on the aging of pp mps was also demonstrated by comparing the changes of carbonyl index figure s13a contact angle figure s13b and mps particle size figure s13c in ultrapure water and free cl2 contained aqueous solution 4 conclusions photo aging is widely accepted as an effective approach for the weathering of mps in ambient water environment and mainly assign to the free radical associated polymer chain reaction under sunlight irradiation considering different types and concentrations of photochemical reactive species i e cl and br in natural waters the photo aging mechanism of mps may be modified consequently resulting in great difference in photo aging process of mps in freshwater and seawater environment thus studying the long term photo aging process of mps in estuary water and seawater are important to evaluate their potential ecological risk to aquatic organisms this study investigated long time weathering of pp mps in ultrapure water estuary water and seawater respectively the results indicated that cl in seawater exhibited significant inhibitory effect on the aging process of pp mps meant that their aging time was longer in seawater than that in estuary water and freshwater besides the inhibitory effect mediated by cl was revealed which indicated that the impact mechanism may assign to the formation of cl2 which could quench ho2 produced by o2 and involve in the free radial chain reaction of mps under light irradiation moreover further studies are urgently required to consider the multiple impact of plastic additives water components i e halides ions nom and biofilm as well as organic inorganic pollutants on the photo aging process of mps in natural waters this may be helpful to evaluate the formation fragmentation and potential ecological risk of aged mps residue in current water

16766,the increased release of phosphonates to natural waters causes global concern due to their potential threat to the aquatic environment it is curial to mineralize phosphonates to orthophosphate po4 3 before they are thoroughly removed from wastewater via conventional biological treatment in this study we systematically investigated the performance and mechanism of degradation of phosphonates in co ii triggered peroxymonosulfate pms activation process the degradation efficiency of various phosphonates is highly dependent on their coordination with co ii using 1 hydroxyethane 1 1 diphosphonic acid hedp as a target pollutant the co ii pms process is effective in a broad solution ph range from 5 0 to 10 0 multiple experimental results imply that co ii pms complex is the primary reactive species while hydroxyl radicals ho sulfate radicals so4 singlet oxygen 1o2 and co iii play as the secondary reactive species for the degradation of hedp the presence of cl hco3 and natural organic matters nom inhibits the degradation of hedp however in real water samples the selectivity and efficiency for hedp removal in the co ii pms process are higher than that in free radicals mediated advanced oxidation processes this study not only sheds new lights on the mechanism of co ii triggered pms activation process but also provides feasible technology for the degradation of phosphonates in wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phosphonate peroxymonosulfate advanced oxidation processes co ii pms complex selectivity 1 introduction phosphonates are widely used as chelating agents scale corrosion inhibitors and bleach stabilizers in industry nowack 2003 rott et al 2019 2018 the past decades have witnessed a great increase in global phosphonate consumption raising serious concerns about their aqueous environmental risk as various phosphonates have been detected in natural waters and municipal effluents rott et al 2019 2018 wang et al 2019a in the natural environment phosphonates are likely to be photodegraded to release orthophosphate po4 3 which is a key factor that causes water eutrophication lesueur et al 2005 rott et al 2018 in addition their strong complexing ability could facilitate the remobilization of toxic metals in sediments nowack 2003 furthermore previous studies have reported that the presence of phosphonates can inhibit the final removal efficiency of total phosphorous tp in industrial wastewaters via precipitation flocculation rott et al 2018 sun et al 2019 therefore it is essential to mineralize phosphonates to inorganic po4 3 before being discharged into the receiving bodies to alleviate the negative effects on the environment in general phosphonates are resistant to chemical hydrolysis thermal decomposition and biodegradation due to their chemically stable c p bond rott et al 2018 studnik et al 2015 recently advanced oxidation processes aops such as uv h2o2 rott et al 2017 uv fe ii h2o2 rott et al 2017 uv peroxydisulfate pds wang et al 2019b and uv chlorine huang et al 2019 have been used for the removal of phosphonates in these processes phosphonates could be effectively degraded to orthophosphate po4 3 due to the attack of the highly reactive free radicals e g hydroxyl radicals ho and sulfate radicals so4 the presence of fe iii also contributes to the cleavage of the c p bond via a ligands to metals charge transfer lmct mechanism with the assistance of uv matthus et al 1989 nowack 2003 sun et al 2019 however the use of uv would greatly increase the disposal costs and the accumulation of fe sludge in the uv fe ii and uv fe ii h2o2 processes is also troublesome therefore efficient and cost effective approach for the mineralization of phosphonates in wastewater is still required the reaction of peroxymonosulfate pms with co ii has been regarded as one of the most promising aops for the degradation of refractory organic compounds george and dionysios 2004 zhang et al 2020b compared to other transition metals e g fe ii co ii exhibits excellent activity towards pms activation even at a ppb level chen et al 2019 huang et al 2009 and over a wide ph range e g 4 0 to 8 0 hu and long 2016 previous studies have established that pms is activated to produce so4 via the redox cycle of co iii co ii anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 hu and long 2016 although co iii is a strong oxidant with redox potential of 1 92 v george and dionysios 2004 its contribution in the degradation of organic pollutants is negligible under near neutral ph condition kim et al 2020 li et al 2021 wang et al 2020b however recent studies reported that nonradical species with higher selectivity than free radicals were the main oxidizing intermediates in the co ii pms process li et al 2021 zong et al 2020 which is beneficial for the oxidation of phosphonates in complicated water samples nevertheless little information is available in terms of the performance and mechanism of phosphonates degradation in the co ii pms process in this study the degradation of five typical phosphonates in the co ii pms process was investigated and their complexation effects on the catalytic activity of co ii were explored to identify the main reactive species involved in this process radical quenching and chemical probing experiments as well as epr electron paramagnetic resonance analysis were conducted with 1 hydroxyethane 1 1 diphosphonic acid hedp as the target pollutant based on these results a possible mechanism involving co ii pms complex as the primary reactive species was proposed in addition the effects of several important parameters such as solution chemistry i e ph and coexisting substances co ii dosage and pms dosage on the degradation of hedp were examined finally the feasibility of degradation of hedp in real water samples using the co ii pms process was tested 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals 1 hydroxyethane 1 1 diphosphonic acid hedp 2

the chemicals were used without further purification deionized di water with a resistivity of 18 2 mω cm was employed throughout the experiments 2 2 experimental procedures the experiments were generally carried out in 50 ml beaker flask at 20 under magnetic stirring typically predetermined volumes of pms and phosphonates i e hedp stock solutions were first added into the beaker flask with without substrates e g inorganic anions and nom afterwards the solution ph was quickly adjusted to the desired values by using 0 1 m naoh hno3 the reaction was initiated by adding the desired dosage of co ii 1 0 ml sample was withdrawn at different time intervals from the reactor and quenched with 50 μl na2so3 0 5 m before analysis when co iii was employed as the oxidant 50 ml borate buffer was employed to stabilize the solution ph for the oxidation of hedp in uv pds and uv h2o2 processes the experiments were carried out in 10 ml quartz photo reactive tube which was placed in a carousel uv

wang et al 2019a the concentrations of tp and po4 3 were analyzed using the ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method according to the chinese standard gb 11 893 89 and the detailed procedures of

epr emx 10 12 bruker germany technique with temp and dmpo as the spin trapping agents respectively yanan et al 2020 yang et al 2018b the complexation of phosphonates with co ii was characterized by fourier transform infrared ftir nicolet is5 thermo scientific usa spectroscopy 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of phosphonates in co ii pms process the degradation behavior of five typical phosphonates i e hedp pbtc ntmp edtmp and dtpmp in the co ii pms process was first investigated their chemical structures are presented in fig s1 as shown in fig 1 a the removal efficiency of hedp ntmp and pbtc is 97 9 100 and 48 6 respectively and negligible abatement of edtmp and dtpmp is observed after reaction meanwhile a noticeable decrease of solution ph is detected table s2 in addition results in fig 1b show that 93 3 78 3 and 47 3 of the tp in hedp ntmp and pbtc is transformed to po4 3 respectively the concentrations of po4 3 are listed in table s3 however the generation of po4 3 in the sole pms is limited for each phosphonate fig s2 suggesting that the pms induced direct oxidation plays a minor role in the removal of phosphonates in the co ii pms process to elucidate the reason for different removal efficiencies of phosphonates in the co ii pms process the decomposition of pms was investigated and the results are shown in fig s3 without phosphonate 44 3 of pms is decomposed after 60 min reaction in the presence of hedp and ntmp the decomposition efficiency of pms is increased to 57 3 and 51 9 respectively this is probably because the presence of hedp and ntmp promotes the consumption of the reactive species and subsequently enhances the decomposition of pms however the addition of pbtc edtmp and dtpmp significantly inhibits the decomposition of pms for instance only 5 4 of pms is decomposed in the co ii pms pbtc process and negligible abatement is observed in the co ii pms edtmp and co ii pms dtpmp processes obviously the inferior removal efficiency of pbtc edtmp and dtpmp could be ascribed to their negative effect on the activity of co ii towards pms activation previous studies have reported that phosphonates have a strong complexing capability with transition metals cardiano et al 2017 galezowska and gumienna kontecka 2012 rott et al 2018 ftir analysis was conducted to confirm the complexation of phosphonates with co ii as shown in fig s4a the adsorption peaks belonging to phosphate and carboxylate groups are observed in all the five phosphonates and pbtc respectively kropacheva et al 2020 rao and rao 2009 while no bond relating to n containing groups is detected probably due to the weak ir response similar phenomenon could also be observed in previous studies wang and wang 2020 zenobi et al 2008 2010 after coordination with co ii a red shift of the characteristic peaks takes place fig s4b and table s4 suggesting that co ii might exist in the coordinating state i e co ii phosphonate in the presence of phosphonates rao and rao 2009 table s5 summarizes the number of possible coordinating sites available for co ii in different phosphonates papadaki and demadis 2009 scheglova et al 2019 yang et al 2015 it is interesting to find that the removal efficiency of phosphonates and the corresponding decomposition efficiency of pms are reversely correlated to the number of coordinating sites in phosphonates we postulate that the phosphonate co ii complex with a larger coordination number e g co ii edtmp and co ii dtpmp offers stronger steric hindrance for pms resulting in the inhibition of the generation of reactive species for phosphonates degradation in the following sections hedp is selected as the target pollutant considering its predominant contribution to the total phosphonates in wastewater rott et al 2019 wang et al 2020a 3 2 identification of reactive species radical quenching experiments were performed to explore the role of ho and so4 in the oxidation of hedp in the co ii pms system tba was employed as the scavenger for both ho and so4 the second order rate constants of tba with ho and so4 are 3 8 7 6 108 and 4 0 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 respectively george and dionysios 2004 in addition the second order rate constants of ho and so4 with hedp are calculated to be 3 8 108 and 7 4 107 m 1 s 1 respectively text s2 and fig s5 therefore 100 mm tba is theoretically sufficient to quench the possible ho and so4 generated in the co ii pms process to confirm this the oxidation of hedp with 100 mm tba was conducted in the uv h2o2 and uv pds processes benchmark sources of free radicals as expected negligible po4 3 is generated fig s6 however the presence of 100 mm tba exhibits negligible inhibition on the formation of po4 3 in the co ii pms process fig 2 a ruling out the major role of both ho and so4 epr analysis was conducted to further identify the reactive species involved in the co ii pms system 1o2 has been reported to be generated in the co ii pms process zhang et al 2020a zhu et al 2020 results in fig s7a show that a relatively weak signal belonging to the temp 1o2 adducts is detected in pms alone implying that 1o2 is generated due to the self decomposition of pms yang et al 2018a the intensity of the temp 1o2 signal in the co ii pms system is much higher than that in pms alone suggesting that co ii could catalyze the decomposition of pms to produce 1o2 similar results have been reported in previous studies zhu et al 2021 2020 superoxide radicals o2 might be responsible for the generation of 1o2 qi et al 2016 to verify this nbt was used as a chemical probe of o2 bielski et al 1980 results in fig s8 show that negligible reduction product of nbt by o2 is observed suggesting that o2 is rarely generated the detailed mechanism for the production of 1o2 should be further investigated as shown in fig s7b no po4 3 is produced in the photosensitized rb process a benchmark source of 1o2 haag and hoigne 1986 yun et al 2018 indicating that 1o2 plays a negligible role in the degradation of hedp in the co ii pms process we continued to investigate the major reactive species in the co ii pms process by using dmpo as a spin trapping agent as shown in fig 2b no obvious epr signal is observed in the co ii pms process this could be ascribed to the low initial concentration of co ii 0 85 μm because a noticeable signal belonging to 5 tert butoxycarbonyl methyl 2 oxo pyrroline 1 oxyl dmpox is generated by elevating the initial co ii concentration to 8 5 μm however in the presence of hedp the dmpox signal could be clearly observed at co ii 0 0 85 μm suggesting that the presence of hedp promotes the catalytic activity of co ii for pms activation to generate reactive species previous studies have established that both radical and nonradical species are possibly responsible for the formation of dmpox li et al 2018a 2018b wang et al 2017 as the involvement of ho and so4 in the co ii pms process has been excluded in this study the generation of dmpox should be ascribed to the nonradical species induced oxidation one of the possible reactive species is co iii since co iii is a strong oxidant and readily oxidizes various organic compounds under very acid conditions sandberg et al 1972 trivedi and dhawan 1991 co iii solution was prepared by electro oxidation of saturated coso4 according to the previous literature fig s9 swann and xanthakos 2002 and its oxidation performance was subsequently investigated results in fig 2b show that a strong dmpox signal is generated by using sole co iii as an oxidant suggesting that co iii is probably produced in the co ii pms process additional experiments were carried out to evaluate the role of co iii in the oxidation of hedp in the co ii pms process results in fig s10a show that about 53 2 of tp in hedp is transformed to po4 3 in co iii solution co iii 0 30 μm suggesting that co iii is capable of oxidizing hedp however co iii is not the sole reactive species in the co ii pms process this is because the presence of 100 mm meoh almost completely suppresses the degradation of hedp in the co ii pms process fig s10b while the formation efficiency of po4 3 only decreases to 29 0 in the co iii solution fig s10a to further exclude the sole role of co iii in the oxidation of hedp in the co ii pms process the electron transfer mechanism involved in the co ii pms process and co iii solution was compared by using mpso as a chemical probe wang et al 2018 herein the yield of mpso2 ηmpso2 is defined as the moles of mpso2 generated per mole of mpso consumed wang et al 2019c results in fig 3 a show that 88 2 of mpso is removed in the co ii pms process and the oxidized mpso is partially transformed to mpso2 ηmpso2 55 6 suggesting both one electron transfer pathway and oxygen atom transfer pathway are involved in the co ii pms process however results in fig 3b show that mpso is totally oxidized to form mpso2 in co iii solution ηmpso2 100 indicating the oxidation of mpso in co iii solution proceeds via sole oxygen atom transfer pathway the formation of mpso2 in co iii solution should be ascribed to the ph dependent species transformation of co iii previous study has shown that co iii is prone to hydrolysis to form dimeric co ii species with intramolecular oo bond in water solution davies and warnqvist 1970 based on its hydrolysis constant k h 0 22 0 05 anbar and pecht 1967 at ph higher than 2 0 almost all the co iii would exist in the dimeric co peroxide species which possibly accounts for the production of mpso2 however the different electron transfer mechanism in the co iii solution and co ii pms process confirms that co iii is not the sole reactive species in the co ii pms process in fact the generation of co iii should accompany the formation of so4 via the homolytic cleavage of the oo bond in pms while negligible amount of free radical is detected in the co ii pms process as demonstrated above consequently we postulate that co iii make a minor contribution to the oxidation of hedp in the co ii pms process another possible reactive species is the co ii pms complex it has been reported that the adsorption of pms on the surface carbon based materials would prolong peroxy oo bond in pms enhancing its reactivity in pollutants oxidation gao et al 2020 miao et al 2020 ren et al 2019 similar results have also been found in the metal oxides mediated pms activation process wei et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 in which the formation of metal pms complex is the initial and crucial step as reported in our recent study li et al 2021 the co ii pms species could conduct both one electron transfer and oxygen atom transfer reactions such reaction behavior of co ii pms is similar to that of other metal oxygen species e g metal peroxy metal hydroperoxo and metal oxo species devi et al 2020 nam et al 2018 sankaralingam et al 2018 consequently we postulate that co ii pms complex is the major reactive species in the co ii pms process 3 3 proposed mechanism based on the above results and discussion a possible mechanism is proposed for the nonradical oxidation of phosphonates in the co ii pms fig 4 the complexed co ii as lewis acid coordinates with pms to form l co ii pms complex l phosphonates as the primary reactive species prs in which the oo bond is likely weakened due to the back donation from electron rich co ii to the antibonding σ orbital of pms hikichi et al 1998 as a result phosphonates e g hedp are oxidized mainly by the attack of prs in addition the prs species could also react with another pms to generate 1o2 since the intensity of temp 1o2 signal is significantly enhanced in the presence of co ii and or decompose to co iii and so4 via the homolytic cleavage of the oo bond nevertheless the occurrence of the latter process might be difficult from the aspect of thermodynamics because the redox potential of hso5 so4 2 1 82 v is very close to that of co iii co ii 1 88 v biedermann et al 1986 steele and appelman 1982 therefore only a small amount of co iii and so4 is produced 1o2 co iii and so4 could be regarded as the secondary reactive species srs which plays a minor role in the oxidation of phosphonates it should be noted that the coordination of phosphonates with co ii could affect their removal efficiency probably from two perspectives i e the steric hindrance that hinders the interaction of co ii with pms and the ligand effect that influences the reactivity of l co ii pms species 3 4 effect of operation parameters the effect of solution ph on the degradation of hedp in the co ii pms process was examined over a wide ph range from 5 0 to 10 0 as shown in fig 5 a the formation efficiency of po4 3 increases from 82 7 to 100 as the solution ph increases from 5 0 to 6 0 followed by a drop to 43 3 when the solution ph further elevates to 10 0 however in the solo pms process the formation efficiency of po4 3 gradually increases from 3 4 to 16 3 with increasing the solution ph from 5 0 to 10 0 fig s11 probably arising from the role of alkali in the activation of pms qi et al 2016 the ph dependent degradation efficiency in the co ii pms process might mainly result from the combined effect of ph on the species distribution of the hedp co ii complex and the reactivity of the prs as previously reported hedp could coordinate with co ii to form various co ii hedp complexes with the molar ratio of co ii hedp from 1 1 to 1 3 scheglova et al 2019 with increasing solution ph the molar ratio of co ii hedp changes from 1 3 to 1 1 which is beneficial for pms accessing to the central co ii meanwhile the hedp co ii complex and pms pka 9 4 become more negatively charged ghanbari and moradi 2017 scheglova et al 2019 hindering the interaction between hedp co ii and pms from forming prs due to the enhanced electrostatic repulsion as a result the optimal removal efficiency of hedp in the co ii pms process is expected to be observed at solution ph ranging from 5 0 to 8 0 in addition the solution ph is able to influence the reactivity of metal oxygen species mirza et al 1996 which might be also responsible for the ph dependent degradation performance of hedp in the co ii pms process the detailed mechanism should be further investigated the impact of inorganic anions i e no3 so4 2 cl and hco3 on the degradation of hedp is shown in fig 5b one could see that both no3 and so4 2 exhibit no obvious influence on the degradation of hedp however in the presence of cl the removal efficiency of hedp is slightly inhibited with the transformation efficiency of tp to po4 3 determined to be 78 8 attributing to the competing reaction of cl with the prs in the case of hco3 the oxidation of hedp is greatly suppressed as only 25 0 of tp in hedp is transformed to po4 3 such negative effect of hco3 could be ascribed to their coordination with co ii huang et al 2016 which is not desired for the production of reactive intermediate li et al 2015 in addition the possible formation of peroxymonocarbonate via the direct reaction of pms with hco3 2 might also inhibit the oxidation of hedp eq 1 giannakis et al 2021 lee et al 2020 1 hco3 2 hso5 hco4 2 hso4 nom is ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and normally influences the efficiency of aops in a negative way as shown in fig s12 with the addition of 5 0 mgc l nom the transformation efficiency of tp in hedp decreases to 69 7 arising from its direct competition with hedp for the prs hartland et al 2014 xie et al 2015 in addition nom could directly react with pms fig s13 which might also contribute to the decrease of removal efficiency of hedp jia et al 2020 however the formation efficiency of po4 3 in the co ii pms process is much higher than that in the uv h2o2 6 6 and uv pds 35 2 processes fig s12 fig s14a presents the formation efficiency of po4 3 at varying co ii levels one could see that the formation efficiency of po4 3 increases with increasing co ii dosage 0 017 to 0 85 μm at the preset dosage of pms 0 20 mm in addition 59 6 of tp in hedp is converted to po4 3 at the initial concentration of co ii as low as 0 017 μm implying that the co ii pms process is efficient for the degradation of hedp the formation efficiency of po4 3 also increases with pms concentration 0 01 to 0 2 mm at the same co ii dosage 0 85 μm fig s14b this is because increasing pms and co ii dosage would provide more prs for hedp degradation 3 5 degradation of hedp in real wastewaters the potential of the co ii pms process for practical application was examined in real wastewaters which were taken from different wastewater treatment plants in china the main water chemistry compositions of the two effluents are described in table s6 as a reference the degradation of hedp in free radical based aops i e uvh2o2 and uv pds process was also investigated as shown in fig 6 for all the three catalytic oxidation systems the formation efficiencies of po4 3 in both effluent 1 and effluent 2 are lower than that in synthetic water this could be ascribed to the negative effect of the coexisting substrates e g cl hco3 and nom in the two effluents however for the real wastewaters the formation efficiency of po4 3 in the co ii pms system is much higher than that in the uv h2o2 and uv pds processes suggesting a higher selectivity and efficiency for the degradation of hedp in the co ii pms process than free radical based aops 4 conclusions in summary the coordination of phosphonates with co ii significantly affects their degradation efficiency in the co ii pms process the primary reactive species involved in the co ii pms process is proposed to be co ii pms complex while free radicals 1o2 and co iii play as the secondary reactive species that make a minor contribution in the oxidation of targeted pollutant i e hedp the co ii pms process exhibits satisfied capability for the oxidation of hedp even at a trace level of co ii i e 0 017 μm and the optimal solution ph is 6 0 the presence of cl hco3 and nom suppresses the degradation of hedp concerning the real water samples the removal efficiency of hedp in the co ii pms process is higher than that in the uv h2o2 and uv pds processes

16766,the increased release of phosphonates to natural waters causes global concern due to their potential threat to the aquatic environment it is curial to mineralize phosphonates to orthophosphate po4 3 before they are thoroughly removed from wastewater via conventional biological treatment in this study we systematically investigated the performance and mechanism of degradation of phosphonates in co ii triggered peroxymonosulfate pms activation process the degradation efficiency of various phosphonates is highly dependent on their coordination with co ii using 1 hydroxyethane 1 1 diphosphonic acid hedp as a target pollutant the co ii pms process is effective in a broad solution ph range from 5 0 to 10 0 multiple experimental results imply that co ii pms complex is the primary reactive species while hydroxyl radicals ho sulfate radicals so4 singlet oxygen 1o2 and co iii play as the secondary reactive species for the degradation of hedp the presence of cl hco3 and natural organic matters nom inhibits the degradation of hedp however in real water samples the selectivity and efficiency for hedp removal in the co ii pms process are higher than that in free radicals mediated advanced oxidation processes this study not only sheds new lights on the mechanism of co ii triggered pms activation process but also provides feasible technology for the degradation of phosphonates in wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phosphonate peroxymonosulfate advanced oxidation processes co ii pms complex selectivity 1 introduction phosphonates are widely used as chelating agents scale corrosion inhibitors and bleach stabilizers in industry nowack 2003 rott et al 2019 2018 the past decades have witnessed a great increase in global phosphonate consumption raising serious concerns about their aqueous environmental risk as various phosphonates have been detected in natural waters and municipal effluents rott et al 2019 2018 wang et al 2019a in the natural environment phosphonates are likely to be photodegraded to release orthophosphate po4 3 which is a key factor that causes water eutrophication lesueur et al 2005 rott et al 2018 in addition their strong complexing ability could facilitate the remobilization of toxic metals in sediments nowack 2003 furthermore previous studies have reported that the presence of phosphonates can inhibit the final removal efficiency of total phosphorous tp in industrial wastewaters via precipitation flocculation rott et al 2018 sun et al 2019 therefore it is essential to mineralize phosphonates to inorganic po4 3 before being discharged into the receiving bodies to alleviate the negative effects on the environment in general phosphonates are resistant to chemical hydrolysis thermal decomposition and biodegradation due to their chemically stable c p bond rott et al 2018 studnik et al 2015 recently advanced oxidation processes aops such as uv h2o2 rott et al 2017 uv fe ii h2o2 rott et al 2017 uv peroxydisulfate pds wang et al 2019b and uv chlorine huang et al 2019 have been used for the removal of phosphonates in these processes phosphonates could be effectively degraded to orthophosphate po4 3 due to the attack of the highly reactive free radicals e g hydroxyl radicals ho and sulfate radicals so4 the presence of fe iii also contributes to the cleavage of the c p bond via a ligands to metals charge transfer lmct mechanism with the assistance of uv matthus et al 1989 nowack 2003 sun et al 2019 however the use of uv would greatly increase the disposal costs and the accumulation of fe sludge in the uv fe ii and uv fe ii h2o2 processes is also troublesome therefore efficient and cost effective approach for the mineralization of phosphonates in wastewater is still required the reaction of peroxymonosulfate pms with co ii has been regarded as one of the most promising aops for the degradation of refractory organic compounds george and dionysios 2004 zhang et al 2020b compared to other transition metals e g fe ii co ii exhibits excellent activity towards pms activation even at a ppb level chen et al 2019 huang et al 2009 and over a wide ph range e g 4 0 to 8 0 hu and long 2016 previous studies have established that pms is activated to produce so4 via the redox cycle of co iii co ii anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 hu and long 2016 although co iii is a strong oxidant with redox potential of 1 92 v george and dionysios 2004 its contribution in the degradation of organic pollutants is negligible under near neutral ph condition kim et al 2020 li et al 2021 wang et al 2020b however recent studies reported that nonradical species with higher selectivity than free radicals were the main oxidizing intermediates in the co ii pms process li et al 2021 zong et al 2020 which is beneficial for the oxidation of phosphonates in complicated water samples nevertheless little information is available in terms of the performance and mechanism of phosphonates degradation in the co ii pms process in this study the degradation of five typical phosphonates in the co ii pms process was investigated and their complexation effects on the catalytic activity of co ii were explored to identify the main reactive species involved in this process radical quenching and chemical probing experiments as well as epr electron paramagnetic resonance analysis were conducted with 1 hydroxyethane 1 1 diphosphonic acid hedp as the target pollutant based on these results a possible mechanism involving co ii pms complex as the primary reactive species was proposed in addition the effects of several important parameters such as solution chemistry i e ph and coexisting substances co ii dosage and pms dosage on the degradation of hedp were examined finally the feasibility of degradation of hedp in real water samples using the co ii pms process was tested 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals 1 hydroxyethane 1 1 diphosphonic acid hedp 2

the chemicals were used without further purification deionized di water with a resistivity of 18 2 mω cm was employed throughout the experiments 2 2 experimental procedures the experiments were generally carried out in 50 ml beaker flask at 20 under magnetic stirring typically predetermined volumes of pms and phosphonates i e hedp stock solutions were first added into the beaker flask with without substrates e g inorganic anions and nom afterwards the solution ph was quickly adjusted to the desired values by using 0 1 m naoh hno3 the reaction was initiated by adding the desired dosage of co ii 1 0 ml sample was withdrawn at different time intervals from the reactor and quenched with 50 μl na2so3 0 5 m before analysis when co iii was employed as the oxidant 50 ml borate buffer was employed to stabilize the solution ph for the oxidation of hedp in uv pds and uv h2o2 processes the experiments were carried out in 10 ml quartz photo reactive tube which was placed in a carousel uv

wang et al 2019a the concentrations of tp and po4 3 were analyzed using the ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method according to the chinese standard gb 11 893 89 and the detailed procedures of

epr emx 10 12 bruker germany technique with temp and dmpo as the spin trapping agents respectively yanan et al 2020 yang et al 2018b the complexation of phosphonates with co ii was characterized by fourier transform infrared ftir nicolet is5 thermo scientific usa spectroscopy 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of phosphonates in co ii pms process the degradation behavior of five typical phosphonates i e hedp pbtc ntmp edtmp and dtpmp in the co ii pms process was first investigated their chemical structures are presented in fig s1 as shown in fig 1 a the removal efficiency of hedp ntmp and pbtc is 97 9 100 and 48 6 respectively and negligible abatement of edtmp and dtpmp is observed after reaction meanwhile a noticeable decrease of solution ph is detected table s2 in addition results in fig 1b show that 93 3 78 3 and 47 3 of the tp in hedp ntmp and pbtc is transformed to po4 3 respectively the concentrations of po4 3 are listed in table s3 however the generation of po4 3 in the sole pms is limited for each phosphonate fig s2 suggesting that the pms induced direct oxidation plays a minor role in the removal of phosphonates in the co ii pms process to elucidate the reason for different removal efficiencies of phosphonates in the co ii pms process the decomposition of pms was investigated and the results are shown in fig s3 without phosphonate 44 3 of pms is decomposed after 60 min reaction in the presence of hedp and ntmp the decomposition efficiency of pms is increased to 57 3 and 51 9 respectively this is probably because the presence of hedp and ntmp promotes the consumption of the reactive species and subsequently enhances the decomposition of pms however the addition of pbtc edtmp and dtpmp significantly inhibits the decomposition of pms for instance only 5 4 of pms is decomposed in the co ii pms pbtc process and negligible abatement is observed in the co ii pms edtmp and co ii pms dtpmp processes obviously the inferior removal efficiency of pbtc edtmp and dtpmp could be ascribed to their negative effect on the activity of co ii towards pms activation previous studies have reported that phosphonates have a strong complexing capability with transition metals cardiano et al 2017 galezowska and gumienna kontecka 2012 rott et al 2018 ftir analysis was conducted to confirm the complexation of phosphonates with co ii as shown in fig s4a the adsorption peaks belonging to phosphate and carboxylate groups are observed in all the five phosphonates and pbtc respectively kropacheva et al 2020 rao and rao 2009 while no bond relating to n containing groups is detected probably due to the weak ir response similar phenomenon could also be observed in previous studies wang and wang 2020 zenobi et al 2008 2010 after coordination with co ii a red shift of the characteristic peaks takes place fig s4b and table s4 suggesting that co ii might exist in the coordinating state i e co ii phosphonate in the presence of phosphonates rao and rao 2009 table s5 summarizes the number of possible coordinating sites available for co ii in different phosphonates papadaki and demadis 2009 scheglova et al 2019 yang et al 2015 it is interesting to find that the removal efficiency of phosphonates and the corresponding decomposition efficiency of pms are reversely correlated to the number of coordinating sites in phosphonates we postulate that the phosphonate co ii complex with a larger coordination number e g co ii edtmp and co ii dtpmp offers stronger steric hindrance for pms resulting in the inhibition of the generation of reactive species for phosphonates degradation in the following sections hedp is selected as the target pollutant considering its predominant contribution to the total phosphonates in wastewater rott et al 2019 wang et al 2020a 3 2 identification of reactive species radical quenching experiments were performed to explore the role of ho and so4 in the oxidation of hedp in the co ii pms system tba was employed as the scavenger for both ho and so4 the second order rate constants of tba with ho and so4 are 3 8 7 6 108 and 4 0 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 respectively george and dionysios 2004 in addition the second order rate constants of ho and so4 with hedp are calculated to be 3 8 108 and 7 4 107 m 1 s 1 respectively text s2 and fig s5 therefore 100 mm tba is theoretically sufficient to quench the possible ho and so4 generated in the co ii pms process to confirm this the oxidation of hedp with 100 mm tba was conducted in the uv h2o2 and uv pds processes benchmark sources of free radicals as expected negligible po4 3 is generated fig s6 however the presence of 100 mm tba exhibits negligible inhibition on the formation of po4 3 in the co ii pms process fig 2 a ruling out the major role of both ho and so4 epr analysis was conducted to further identify the reactive species involved in the co ii pms system 1o2 has been reported to be generated in the co ii pms process zhang et al 2020a zhu et al 2020 results in fig s7a show that a relatively weak signal belonging to the temp 1o2 adducts is detected in pms alone implying that 1o2 is generated due to the self decomposition of pms yang et al 2018a the intensity of the temp 1o2 signal in the co ii pms system is much higher than that in pms alone suggesting that co ii could catalyze the decomposition of pms to produce 1o2 similar results have been reported in previous studies zhu et al 2021 2020 superoxide radicals o2 might be responsible for the generation of 1o2 qi et al 2016 to verify this nbt was used as a chemical probe of o2 bielski et al 1980 results in fig s8 show that negligible reduction product of nbt by o2 is observed suggesting that o2 is rarely generated the detailed mechanism for the production of 1o2 should be further investigated as shown in fig s7b no po4 3 is produced in the photosensitized rb process a benchmark source of 1o2 haag and hoigne 1986 yun et al 2018 indicating that 1o2 plays a negligible role in the degradation of hedp in the co ii pms process we continued to investigate the major reactive species in the co ii pms process by using dmpo as a spin trapping agent as shown in fig 2b no obvious epr signal is observed in the co ii pms process this could be ascribed to the low initial concentration of co ii 0 85 μm because a noticeable signal belonging to 5 tert butoxycarbonyl methyl 2 oxo pyrroline 1 oxyl dmpox is generated by elevating the initial co ii concentration to 8 5 μm however in the presence of hedp the dmpox signal could be clearly observed at co ii 0 0 85 μm suggesting that the presence of hedp promotes the catalytic activity of co ii for pms activation to generate reactive species previous studies have established that both radical and nonradical species are possibly responsible for the formation of dmpox li et al 2018a 2018b wang et al 2017 as the involvement of ho and so4 in the co ii pms process has been excluded in this study the generation of dmpox should be ascribed to the nonradical species induced oxidation one of the possible reactive species is co iii since co iii is a strong oxidant and readily oxidizes various organic compounds under very acid conditions sandberg et al 1972 trivedi and dhawan 1991 co iii solution was prepared by electro oxidation of saturated coso4 according to the previous literature fig s9 swann and xanthakos 2002 and its oxidation performance was subsequently investigated results in fig 2b show that a strong dmpox signal is generated by using sole co iii as an oxidant suggesting that co iii is probably produced in the co ii pms process additional experiments were carried out to evaluate the role of co iii in the oxidation of hedp in the co ii pms process results in fig s10a show that about 53 2 of tp in hedp is transformed to po4 3 in co iii solution co iii 0 30 μm suggesting that co iii is capable of oxidizing hedp however co iii is not the sole reactive species in the co ii pms process this is because the presence of 100 mm meoh almost completely suppresses the degradation of hedp in the co ii pms process fig s10b while the formation efficiency of po4 3 only decreases to 29 0 in the co iii solution fig s10a to further exclude the sole role of co iii in the oxidation of hedp in the co ii pms process the electron transfer mechanism involved in the co ii pms process and co iii solution was compared by using mpso as a chemical probe wang et al 2018 herein the yield of mpso2 ηmpso2 is defined as the moles of mpso2 generated per mole of mpso consumed wang et al 2019c results in fig 3 a show that 88 2 of mpso is removed in the co ii pms process and the oxidized mpso is partially transformed to mpso2 ηmpso2 55 6 suggesting both one electron transfer pathway and oxygen atom transfer pathway are involved in the co ii pms process however results in fig 3b show that mpso is totally oxidized to form mpso2 in co iii solution ηmpso2 100 indicating the oxidation of mpso in co iii solution proceeds via sole oxygen atom transfer pathway the formation of mpso2 in co iii solution should be ascribed to the ph dependent species transformation of co iii previous study has shown that co iii is prone to hydrolysis to form dimeric co ii species with intramolecular oo bond in water solution davies and warnqvist 1970 based on its hydrolysis constant k h 0 22 0 05 anbar and pecht 1967 at ph higher than 2 0 almost all the co iii would exist in the dimeric co peroxide species which possibly accounts for the production of mpso2 however the different electron transfer mechanism in the co iii solution and co ii pms process confirms that co iii is not the sole reactive species in the co ii pms process in fact the generation of co iii should accompany the formation of so4 via the homolytic cleavage of the oo bond in pms while negligible amount of free radical is detected in the co ii pms process as demonstrated above consequently we postulate that co iii make a minor contribution to the oxidation of hedp in the co ii pms process another possible reactive species is the co ii pms complex it has been reported that the adsorption of pms on the surface carbon based materials would prolong peroxy oo bond in pms enhancing its reactivity in pollutants oxidation gao et al 2020 miao et al 2020 ren et al 2019 similar results have also been found in the metal oxides mediated pms activation process wei et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 in which the formation of metal pms complex is the initial and crucial step as reported in our recent study li et al 2021 the co ii pms species could conduct both one electron transfer and oxygen atom transfer reactions such reaction behavior of co ii pms is similar to that of other metal oxygen species e g metal peroxy metal hydroperoxo and metal oxo species devi et al 2020 nam et al 2018 sankaralingam et al 2018 consequently we postulate that co ii pms complex is the major reactive species in the co ii pms process 3 3 proposed mechanism based on the above results and discussion a possible mechanism is proposed for the nonradical oxidation of phosphonates in the co ii pms fig 4 the complexed co ii as lewis acid coordinates with pms to form l co ii pms complex l phosphonates as the primary reactive species prs in which the oo bond is likely weakened due to the back donation from electron rich co ii to the antibonding σ orbital of pms hikichi et al 1998 as a result phosphonates e g hedp are oxidized mainly by the attack of prs in addition the prs species could also react with another pms to generate 1o2 since the intensity of temp 1o2 signal is significantly enhanced in the presence of co ii and or decompose to co iii and so4 via the homolytic cleavage of the oo bond nevertheless the occurrence of the latter process might be difficult from the aspect of thermodynamics because the redox potential of hso5 so4 2 1 82 v is very close to that of co iii co ii 1 88 v biedermann et al 1986 steele and appelman 1982 therefore only a small amount of co iii and so4 is produced 1o2 co iii and so4 could be regarded as the secondary reactive species srs which plays a minor role in the oxidation of phosphonates it should be noted that the coordination of phosphonates with co ii could affect their removal efficiency probably from two perspectives i e the steric hindrance that hinders the interaction of co ii with pms and the ligand effect that influences the reactivity of l co ii pms species 3 4 effect of operation parameters the effect of solution ph on the degradation of hedp in the co ii pms process was examined over a wide ph range from 5 0 to 10 0 as shown in fig 5 a the formation efficiency of po4 3 increases from 82 7 to 100 as the solution ph increases from 5 0 to 6 0 followed by a drop to 43 3 when the solution ph further elevates to 10 0 however in the solo pms process the formation efficiency of po4 3 gradually increases from 3 4 to 16 3 with increasing the solution ph from 5 0 to 10 0 fig s11 probably arising from the role of alkali in the activation of pms qi et al 2016 the ph dependent degradation efficiency in the co ii pms process might mainly result from the combined effect of ph on the species distribution of the hedp co ii complex and the reactivity of the prs as previously reported hedp could coordinate with co ii to form various co ii hedp complexes with the molar ratio of co ii hedp from 1 1 to 1 3 scheglova et al 2019 with increasing solution ph the molar ratio of co ii hedp changes from 1 3 to 1 1 which is beneficial for pms accessing to the central co ii meanwhile the hedp co ii complex and pms pka 9 4 become more negatively charged ghanbari and moradi 2017 scheglova et al 2019 hindering the interaction between hedp co ii and pms from forming prs due to the enhanced electrostatic repulsion as a result the optimal removal efficiency of hedp in the co ii pms process is expected to be observed at solution ph ranging from 5 0 to 8 0 in addition the solution ph is able to influence the reactivity of metal oxygen species mirza et al 1996 which might be also responsible for the ph dependent degradation performance of hedp in the co ii pms process the detailed mechanism should be further investigated the impact of inorganic anions i e no3 so4 2 cl and hco3 on the degradation of hedp is shown in fig 5b one could see that both no3 and so4 2 exhibit no obvious influence on the degradation of hedp however in the presence of cl the removal efficiency of hedp is slightly inhibited with the transformation efficiency of tp to po4 3 determined to be 78 8 attributing to the competing reaction of cl with the prs in the case of hco3 the oxidation of hedp is greatly suppressed as only 25 0 of tp in hedp is transformed to po4 3 such negative effect of hco3 could be ascribed to their coordination with co ii huang et al 2016 which is not desired for the production of reactive intermediate li et al 2015 in addition the possible formation of peroxymonocarbonate via the direct reaction of pms with hco3 2 might also inhibit the oxidation of hedp eq 1 giannakis et al 2021 lee et al 2020 1 hco3 2 hso5 hco4 2 hso4 nom is ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and normally influences the efficiency of aops in a negative way as shown in fig s12 with the addition of 5 0 mgc l nom the transformation efficiency of tp in hedp decreases to 69 7 arising from its direct competition with hedp for the prs hartland et al 2014 xie et al 2015 in addition nom could directly react with pms fig s13 which might also contribute to the decrease of removal efficiency of hedp jia et al 2020 however the formation efficiency of po4 3 in the co ii pms process is much higher than that in the uv h2o2 6 6 and uv pds 35 2 processes fig s12 fig s14a presents the formation efficiency of po4 3 at varying co ii levels one could see that the formation efficiency of po4 3 increases with increasing co ii dosage 0 017 to 0 85 μm at the preset dosage of pms 0 20 mm in addition 59 6 of tp in hedp is converted to po4 3 at the initial concentration of co ii as low as 0 017 μm implying that the co ii pms process is efficient for the degradation of hedp the formation efficiency of po4 3 also increases with pms concentration 0 01 to 0 2 mm at the same co ii dosage 0 85 μm fig s14b this is because increasing pms and co ii dosage would provide more prs for hedp degradation 3 5 degradation of hedp in real wastewaters the potential of the co ii pms process for practical application was examined in real wastewaters which were taken from different wastewater treatment plants in china the main water chemistry compositions of the two effluents are described in table s6 as a reference the degradation of hedp in free radical based aops i e uvh2o2 and uv pds process was also investigated as shown in fig 6 for all the three catalytic oxidation systems the formation efficiencies of po4 3 in both effluent 1 and effluent 2 are lower than that in synthetic water this could be ascribed to the negative effect of the coexisting substrates e g cl hco3 and nom in the two effluents however for the real wastewaters the formation efficiency of po4 3 in the co ii pms system is much higher than that in the uv h2o2 and uv pds processes suggesting a higher selectivity and efficiency for the degradation of hedp in the co ii pms process than free radical based aops 4 conclusions in summary the coordination of phosphonates with co ii significantly affects their degradation efficiency in the co ii pms process the primary reactive species involved in the co ii pms process is proposed to be co ii pms complex while free radicals 1o2 and co iii play as the secondary reactive species that make a minor contribution in the oxidation of targeted pollutant i e hedp the co ii pms process exhibits satisfied capability for the oxidation of hedp even at a trace level of co ii i e 0 017 μm and the optimal solution ph is 6 0 the presence of cl hco3 and nom suppresses the degradation of hedp concerning the real water samples the removal efficiency of hedp in the co ii pms process is higher than that in the uv h2o2 and uv pds processes therefore co ii pms process is a promising technology for removing phosphonates from wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

16767,hydrolysis is considered to be the rate limiting step in anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge was in this study an innovative 4 stages cascade anaerobic digestion system was researched to 1 comprehensively clarify whether cascading configuration enhances was hydrolysis and to 2 better understand the governing hydrolysis kinetics in this system the cascade system consisted of three 2 2 l ultra short solids retention times srt continuous stirred tank reactors cstrs and one 15 4 l cstr the cascade system was compared with a reference conventional cstr digester 22 l in terms of process performance hydrolytic enzyme activities and microbial community dynamics under mesophilic conditions 35 c the results showed that the cascade system achieved a high and stable total chemical oxygen demand tcod reduction efficiency of 40 42 even at 12 days total srt that corresponded to only 1 2 days srt each in the first three reactors of the cascade the reference cstr converted only 31 tcod into biogas and suffered process deterioration at the applied low srts calculated specific hydrolysis rates in the first reactors of the cascade system were significantly higher compared to the reference cstr especially at the lowest applied srts the activities of several hydrolytic enzymes produced in the different stages revealed that protease cellulase amino peptidases and most of the tested glycosyl hydrolases had significantly higher activities in the first three small digesters of the cascade system compared to the reference cstr this increase in hydrolytic enzyme production by far exceeded the increase in specific hydrolysis rate indicating that hydrolysis was limited by solids surface availability for enzymatic attack correspondingly high relative abundances of hydrolytic fermentative bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens as well as the presence of syntrophic bacteria were found in the first three digesters of the cascade system however in the fourth reactor acetoclastic methanogens dominated similarly as in the reference cstr overall the results concluded that using multiple cstrs that are operated at low srts in a cascade mode of operation significantly improved the enzymatic hydrolysis rate and extend in anaerobic was digestion moreover the governing hydrolysis kinetics in the cascading reactors were far more complex than the generally assumed simplified first order kinetics graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste activated sludge cascading anaerobic digesters first order kinetics hydrolytic enzyme activity microbial community structure introduction waste activated sludge was is an inevitable by product generated in biological wastewater treatment plants wwtps due to quantitative and qualitative extension of wastewater treatment the annual was production has increased in the european union during the last two decades from 10 million tons in 2008 to 11 5 million tons in 2015 and is expected to approach 13 million tons by 2020 rorat et al 2019 anaerobic digestion ad is a proven key technology for both stabilization of was and recovery of the biochemical energy stored in the sludge in the form of biogas was usually contains complex particulate organics such as proteins polysaccharides lignocellulosic matters and fats gonzalez et al 2018 hydrolysis of was into soluble substrates is the first step in ad and is generally regarded as the rate limiting step in this process appels et al 2008 therefore conventional digesters using continuous stirred tank reactors cstrs have to be operated under prolonged sludge retention times srts exceeding 20 days for an acceptable was conversion to accelerate the conversion rate of was and decrease these long srts process optimisation has been applied as well as the development of hydrolysis enhancement technologies including thermal chemical and enzymatic methods zhen et al 2017 enzymatic hydrolysis enhancement seemingly offers unique advantages compared to chemical or physical processes as it neither causes generation of toxic substances nor needs operations under extreme conditions thus receiving an increased attention in the recent years gonzalez et al 2018 most of these studies focused on the direct addition of highly active hydrolytic enzymes into the digester yang et al 2010 or on pre fermentation by specific hydrolytic bacteria prior to ad agabo garcia et al 2019 these proof of concept methods showed remarkable improvement in was hydrolysis and bio degradation however full scale applications require a continuous purchase of enzymes and or the need for preservation of specific biomass while working with poorly defined substrates hydrolysis of organic matter during ad is performed by extracellular and or membrane bound hydrolytic enzymes kim et al 2012 enhancement of was hydrolysis also can be achieved by accelerating the reaction rates and or increasing the activity of these hydrolytic enzymes instead of adding external hydrolytic enzymes or applying pre fermentation a commonly applied strategy is to perform was digestion under thermophilic 55 c conditions which roughly results in a doubling of the enzymatic reaction rates compared to the commonly applied mesophilic 35 c conditions ge et al 2011a nevertheless decreased process performance was often observed under thermophilic conditions due to the accumulation of organic intermediates to a toxic level or to a drop in ph kim et al 2003 negatively impacting the actual enzymatic reaction rates in addition other constraints of thermophilic was digestion include higher energy requirement poor effluent quality and a poorer digestate s dewaterability de la rubia et al 2013 thus there is a great interest to search for alternative technologies the enzymatic hydrolysis of was is commonly described by empirical first order kinetics vavilin et al 2008 meaning that the observed solids conversion rate is dependant on the solid substrate concentration and the first order hydrolysis rate constant eq 1 1 d s d t k h s where s substrate concentration t time and kh first order hydrolysis rate constant theoretically in a cstr the concentration s in the reactor equals the effluent s concentration indicating that in reactor conversion rates decrease with decreasing s eq 1 agreeing with an increased conversion ratio η fig 1 a based on eq 2 the required volume of a cstr at a given inlet feeding rate f0 is fully determined by the required η and is graphically presented by the large rectangular area shown in fig 1b levenspiel 2006 on the contrary by cascading cstrs small reactor volumes in series are applied that result in high intermediate s concentrations consequently the first cstrs can be operated at high reaction rates whereas the last cstr of the cascade system will have a similar reaction rate as the single stage cstr thus the series of small cstrs will eventually reach to a similar η but to a significant smaller working volume compared to the single stage cstr fig 1c the overall required volume of the cascade system is reciprocally correlated to the number of cstrs 2 v f 0 1 r η where v volume of the cstr m3 f0 substrate feeding rate kg cod day r substrate conversion rate kg cod m3 day and η substrate conversion ratio 0 100 cascade cstr configurations are commonly applied to accelerate catalytic substrate conversions that are characterised by eq 1 miyawaki et al 2016 in case reaction rates are substrate dependant such as for soluble substrates in michaelis menten and or monod kinetics the impact of reactor cascading will even be higher however for solid substrates such as was concentration dependant reaction rates are rarely documented miron et al 2000 and generally first order reaction rate constants are considered blumensaat and keller 2005 up to now application of the cascade cstr configurations for was has been mainly reported in the scope of co digestion in food waste liu et al 2013 or agricultural waste zhou et al 2019 in which was contributed to improved buffer capacities and more balanced nutrient profiles in the past decade several researchers found higher was conversion efficiencies by using two stage two cstrs in series mesophilic ad systems either with or without addition of primary sludge for which no clear mechanistic explanation was given athanasoulia et al 2012 maspolim et al 2015b ge et al 2011b and wu et al 2015 observed an improved hydrolysis rate in temperature phased thermophilic cstr mesophilic cstr was anaerobic digestion processes nonetheless the authors attributed the enhanced hydrolysis merely to the thermophilic conditions applied despite the fact that staging has resulted in improved was digestion it remains unclear whether accelerated enzyme activities increased surface area of the solid substrates and or other factors were determinative however the published wide range of assessed hydrolysis rate constants for was batstone et al 2002 gives room for further research and process optimisation in order to 1 comprehensively clarify whether a cascade configuration enhances was hydrolysis and to 2 better understand the governing hydrolysis kinetics in this system a novel cascade ad system for was treatment was researched in this study which consisted of four cstrs in series i e three small volume cstrs and a large volume cstr considering that digestate recycle improves process stability in staged anaerobic digestion qin et al 2019 the cascade system was equipped with a modest digestate recirculation applying a much lower ratio than reported in literature wu et al 2015 as such the whole system can be interpreted as a semi plug flow device with only a negligible hydraulic impact of the recycle flow reactor performance in the different steps of the system were investigated detailed research on prevailing specific hydrolysis rates activities of key hydrolytic enzymes and the bacterial archaeal community structure was performed to explain the results of the reactor performance and unveil the impact of cascading on hydrolysis kinetics all results from the cascade system were compared to those obtained from a reference conventional cstr system operated under the same conditions with regard to feeding regime total organic loading and temperature materials and methods source and characteristics of inoculum and substrate all reactors were seeded with anaerobic sludge collected from a full scale mesophilic anaerobic digester srt of 20 days at the municipal wwtp harnaschpolder

approximately 53 g l by centrifugation or dilution with the fresh centrifuged supernatant obtained from the same wwtp and stored at 4 c before use experimental set up and operation the experiments were carried out using two digestion systems operated in parallel 1 a cascade ad system consisting of three cstrs with 2 2 l each r1 r2 r3 and a 15 4 l cstr r4 2 a conventional cstr as the reference

triplicate sludge samples including feed and digestates were collected for enzyme extraction at the end of phase ii day 145 and 151 phase iii day 252 and 258 and phase iv 323 and 329 of the individual reactors of both digestion systems the hydrolytic enzymes were separated into free and sludge attached fractions the free enzymes are defined as the enzymes that are present in the was s supernatant whereas the sludge attached enzymes are either membrane bound or in other ways attached to the sludge particles the extraction method of the hydrolytic enzymes was implemented according to zhang et al 2007 with a slight modification for sludge samples briefly 1 ml sludge sample was centrifuged in a 1 5 ml tube eppendorf germany at 14 000 rpm for 1 min the supernatant was transferred to a clean tube and was used for the measurement of free enzyme activities the pellet was washed twice using potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer ph 7 0 0 1 mol l and was subsequently resuspended in sodium acetate buffer at ph 6 0 to the original volume to release sludge attached enzymes after centrifugation the suspension at 3000 g for 10 min the supernatant was used for the determination of sludge attached enzyme activities quantification of enzyme activity this work mainly focused on two hydrolytic enzymes protease and cellulase the activities of protease and cellulase were individually analysed by pierce fluorescent protease assay kit thermo fisher usa and markergene fluorescent cellulase assay kit markergene usa using a 96 well microplate spectrophotometer biotek synergy htx usa meanwhile api zym strip biomerieux france was used to determine the activities of specific amino peptidases leucine arylamidase valine arylamidase and cystine arylamidase and glycosyl hydrolases α galactosidase β galactosidase β glucuronidase α glucosidase β glucosidase n acetyl glucosamidase α mannosidase and α fucosidase this commercial semi quantitative micro cell method works via colour development with a numerical level of 1 5 from low 5 nmol to high 20 nmol assigned to each sample based on the colour chart provided by the manufacturer the measurements of enzyme activity for both methods were performed at 35 c microbial community analysis during the experiment duplicate biomass samples were analysed to evaluate the microbial community dynamics including one inoculum sample two feed samples

provides functional annotations based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg pathway database results and discussion performance comparison between the cascade ad system and the reference cstr during the start up phase the effluent tcod concentrations and methane production rate fluctuated in all reactors fig 3 a both parameters gradually stabilised from day 71 onward after which the cascade and reference system were both operated under stable conditions for 81 days phase ii during both phase i and phase ii the cascade system and the reference cstr were operated with an srt of 22 days the tcod removal efficiency of the entire cascade system was 43 6 versus 40 5 of the reference cstr during this period both removal efficiencies were within typical ranges of mesophilic was digestion reported by previous studies maspolim et al 2015b on average the methane production rate was around 8 higher in the cascade system than in the reference cstr fig 3b after the total srt was lowered to 15 days phase iii effluent tcod concentrations of both r4 and the reference cstr increased due to the sudden increase in total organic loading rate olr from 2 4 to 3 5 g cod l d this reduction in tcod removal efficiency was also observed at the start of phase iv when the total srt was further decreased to 12 days and the total olr correspondingly increased to 4 4 g cod l d strikingly only the cascade system recovered to a tcod removal efficiency between 40 and 42 at the applied increased olr whereas the tcod removal efficiency in the reference cstr reduced to around 38 in phase iii and 31 in phase iv the difference in treatment performance was reflected by the increasing difference in methane production fig 3b the cascade system showed an average 13 higher methane production rate in phase iii and even an average 29 higher rate in phase iv than the reference cstr the obtained results clearly demonstrated the advantage of applying a cascade configuration particularly at reduced srts in fact at 12 days srt the overall capacity referring to the tcod removal efficiency of the cascade digester was 30 35 higher compared to the reference cstr with the same total volume zooming into the separate reactors of the cascade system reveals that the reactors r1 r2 and r3 with an srt of 2 2 days each phase ii contributed to 20 24 of the total methane volume that was produced in the cascade system fig 3b these results agree with a reported study on two staged ad systems under similar srt conditions which showed that the methane production in the first cstr was on average 25 of the total maspolim et al 2015b when the srt in the cascade reactors r1 r2 and r3 was decreased to 1 5 and 1 2 days each in phase iii and phase iv respectively the methane production stayed between 12 and 16 of the overall total methane production the biogas in these three reactors contained 46 53 methane while the methane content of the biogas of r4 and of the reference cstr was 56 62 negligible hydrogen partial pressure was found in all the anaerobic reactors 0 01 these observations showed that despite their short srt and most probably due to the 10 recirculation flow active methanogens were present in r1 r2 and r3 vfa concentrations and ph are commonly used as indicators for process perturbation and or reactor control franke whittle et al 2014 the total vfa concentration in the feed and all reactors is presented in fig 3c as expected the vfa concentration was always the highest in r1 and was gradually reduced along the system acetate and propionate accounted for 60 80 of the total vfas showing their predominance in all reactors fig s1 in supplementary materials with increased olr or decreased srt an elevation in vfa concentration in r1 r2 and r3 was observed from 310 100 and 60 mg l at srt 22 days to 590 380 and 175 mg l at srt 12 days respectively very low total vfas 5 mg l were found in reactor r4 in all phases demonstrating that all vfas were eventually converted to methane in the last step of the cascade system in the reference cstr there was no vfa accumulation observed even at the shortest srt 12 days when total vfa concentration slightly increased to around 110 mg l clearly the vfa concentrations remained far below the inhibition threshold for methanogenic activity wang et al 2009 and thus cannot explain the difference in was degradation between the cascade system and the reference cstr at short srts however the ph in both r1 and r2 of the cascade system was between 6 3 and 6 5 somewhat lower than the ph in the rest of the reactors the lower ph coincided with the somewhat higher vfa concentrations in r1 and r2 and can be attributed to increased acidifying activity and reduced methanogenic activity in the first reactors of the cascade maspolim et al 2015b in reactors r3 and r4 as well as in the reference system the ph remained neutral fig 3d nonetheless the relatively stable ph in r1 and r2 could be ascribed to alkalinity supplementation by digestate recirculation from r3 to r1 introducing sufficient buffer capacity as presented in fig s2 in supplementary material to be able to explain the different tcod removal efficiencies between the cascade and the reference system the specific hydrolysis rates were calculated using eq 3 the tcod and scod variations fig 1 and fig s3 in supplementary materials and the methane production fig 3b in each reactor computed specific hydrolysis rates resembling the first order hydrolysis rate constant kh eq 1 are shown in fig 4 under all tested operational conditions the specific hydrolysis rate was highest in r1 of the cascade system and steadily decreased throughout the subsequent reactors of the cascade during phase ii the specific hydrolysis rate calculated for the reference cstr was slightly higher than that in r3 of the cascade system reducing the srt from 22 to 12 days led to approximately a doubling of the specific hydrolysis rate in the reactors of the cascade system while it increased only 1 5 times in the reference cstr it should be noted that the bar presented specific hydrolysis rates are in fact underestimates of the actual values since these were calculated using eq 3 which includes both the substrate and biomass vs in each reactor however particularly in reactors r1 3 the contribution of the substrate vs to the total vs is relatively large we therefore recalculated the apparent kh values using the vs content in r4 which resembles the non digestible vs fraction in the entire cascade system the corrected kh values are presented above each bar of r1 3 in fig 4 showing an even higher increase in specific hydrolysis rates in the first stages of the cascade reactor strikingly under all loading conditions the assessed specific hydrolysis rates in r4 of the cascade system and the reference cstr were very similar nonetheless at the highest olr the overall specific hydrolysis rate in the reference cstr was significantly lower p value 0 05 than the separate specific hydrolysis rates in all reactors of the cascade system apparently the specific hydrolysis rate was process condition dependant and results in fig 4 showed that in all reactors the specific hydrolysis rate increased with increasing olrs similar observation were previously done by miron et al 2000 our present results clearly indicate that the potential volume reduction which can be attained by implementing cascade configurations is indeed much more than based on solely the theoretical considerations as explained in fig 1 levenspiel 2006 where the same first order reaction rate is applied for all individual reactors in the cascade system and the single stage cstr moreover at the applied low srts or imposed extreme olrs the specific hydrolysis rates increased significantly more p value 0 05 in the first reactors of the cascade system compared to that in the reference cstr fig 4 most likely the maximum organic loading potentials of the cascade system were not reached yet as process performance remained stable even at an srt of 12 days fig 3 results further indicate that for increasing the sludge treatment capacity at a common wwtp the present ad installation can be upgraded in a relatively easy manner to a very compact cascade reactor system via retrofitting existing parallel fed large scale conventional cstr based sludge digesters for instance one cstr digester could be divided into a sequence of several compartments and subsequently be connected with another digester in series hydrolytic enzyme activity to explain the large differences in observed specific hydrolysis rates between the different reactors the hydrolytic enzyme activities were assessed parawira et al 2005 cellulosic fibres and proteins are identified as the two predominated organic components in was guo et al 2020b therefore the activity of cellulase and protease were chosen as representative enzyme activities for a first characterisation of was hydrolysis in both systems applying a widely reported enzymes extraction protocol for anaerobic samples zhang et al 2007 meanwhile automatic measurements in a 96 well microplate reader rather than manual measurements were conducted for the analysis of enzyme activities in this study bonilla et al 2018 with the duplicate extraction of enzymes from the same reactor at three inconsecutive days results in fig 5 showed that both free and sludge attached enzymes are present in the digester regardless of the configuration type i e cascade or single cstr the results showed that protease activities were two orders of magnitude higher than cellulase activities which could be possibly due to the significant higher proportion of protein than cellulose in was guo et al 2020b highest protease and cellulase enzyme activities were present in the sludge attached fraction of both reactor configurations enzyme activities are proportionally related to the enzyme s amount kim et al 2012 suggesting that the hydrolytic enzymes were mainly adsorbed on or attached to the sludge matrix in line with a previous publication by maspolim et al 2015a in both free and sludge attached fractions the activity of hydrolytic enzymes distinctly increased from the feed to r1 especially at short srts indicating that hydrolysis in r1 was indeed accelerated owing to increased presence of hydrolytic enzymes significant higher enzyme activities p value 0 05 were observed in the three small reactors in comparison with the reference cstr the protease activities in r1 were double the activities in the reference cstr even the protease activities in r4 were slightly higher than those in the reference cstr meanwhile the cellulase activities in r1 r2 and r3 were statistically higher than those in r4 while the digestate of r4 showed a similar cellulase activity as the reference cstr fig 5d the observed higher hydrolytic enzyme activities in the cascade ad system compared to those of the reference cstr could be attributed to the imposed high olrs corresponding to short srts in reactors r1 r2 and r3 following first order reaction kinetics eq 1 the application of increased olrs results in accelerated hydrolytic enzyme activities menzel et al 2020 xiao et al 2017 results showed that enzyme activities especially the sludge attached ones in all reactors increased over three times when the total srt was reduced from 22 to 12 days fig 5 notably the increase in the enzyme activities in both systems exceeded the increase in the calculated specific hydrolysis rates in each reactor fig 4 this mismatch strongly indicates that the actual solids hydrolysis in the cascade system was limited by the available free surface for enzymatic attack rather than by the presence of sufficient hydrolytic conversion capacity a more detailed semi quantitative analysis of amino peptidases and glycosyl hydrolases in both free and sludge attached fractions using api zym strips were carried out at the same moments as described above fig 6 similar to protease and cellulase activities the activities of all hydrolases tested with this method increased at short srts and showed a downward trend in activity from r1 to r4 of the cascade digester surprisingly however the β glucuronidase α mannosidase and α fucosidase activities increased stepwise along the cascade system which indicates that the hydrolysis of target substrates of these enzymes occurs later in the process the presence and the role of the target substrates namely glucuronic acid mannose and fucose in the sludge matrix have been researched in several studies showing that they act as main building blocks in the structural extracellular polymeric substances seps that form the gel like structures of the sludge guo et al 2020a regarding the degradation of seps in both digestion systems fig s4 in supplementary materials results showed that seps were mostly converted in r4 irrespective of changes in srt which was in line with the distributions of the β glucuronidase α mannosidase and α fucosidase activities in addition observations from the cascade system reveal that in the first reactors the more easily biodegradable poly saccharides and poly proteins were degraded while in the remaining of the cascade system the more refractory organic residuals in was such as seps related saccharides were degraded as a consequence the cascade system revealed a more stepwise and improved reduction of different types of organics which e g resulted in 14 more seps reduction at the total srt of 22 days compared to the reference cstr at the shortest tested srt of 12 days seps reduction was even 64 higher fig s4 in supplementary materials pyrosequencing analysis of the microbial communities diversity indices the results of alpha diversity based on shannon diversity were listed in table s in supplementary material substrate sample 1 2 and the inoculum had the highest and lowest values respectively meaning that the was substrate contained the most diverse bacterial communities whereas the anaerobically grown inoculum had the least biodiversity shannon diversity decreased in both ad systems when operated at the total srt of 22 days and slightly increased as the srt was reduced this indicates that the initial microbiome members that were present in the feed partially disappeared in the cascade ad process and thus a narrowed ad community was eventually formed a microbial dynamic transition alongside with the cascade system from r1 to r4 could be clearly demonstrated by the beta diversity described via pcoa based on the matrix distance between the samples fig 7 in all operational conditions r1 r2 and r3 were clustering closely to each other while r4 was obviously separated from r1 3 and near the inoculum revealing a different microbial composition presented in r4 compared to other reactors in the cascade system the microbial structure of the reference cstr and the r1 3 was similar to that of was under the reduced srts suggesting less cell decay of the fed was at this short srt which is possibly linked to the deterioration in tcod reduction efficiency fig 3a it should be noted that the applied cascade ad system was equipped with a digestate recirculation system operating at a recirculation ratio of 10 it has been reported that recycling the digestate from a methanogenic reactor to an acidogenic reactor at a recycling ratio of 100 resulted in a changed and improved diversity of bacteria and archaea in the acidogenic reactor wu et al 2016 thus far the effect of only 10 recycling is unknown nonetheless in our present study considerable methane production was observed in r1 r2 and r3 fig 3b which might be ascribed to the supplement of methanogens via digestate recirculation however based on the pcoa results showing the clear microbial shift within the cascade system from r1 to r4 fig 7 it seems that this impact of 10 recycling was limited bacterial communities the bacterial species taxonomy at phylum level is shown in fig 8 a proteobacteria 55 60 followed by bacteroidetes 8 10 and actinobacteria 7 9 were the most dominant phyla in the raw was which is in line with previous studies westerholm et al 2016 the changes in microbial composition between samples were most pronounced for proteobacteria because the total reduction in the relative abundance of this phylum was distinctly higher than for the other phyla in both cascade system and reference cstr the relative abundance of the genus candidatus competibacter belonging to the phylum proteobacteria was reduced by approximately 30 in r1 r2 and r3 together while it was declined by 60 in the post digester r4 of the cascade ad system a similar observation was also found for other genera from this phylum such as candidatus accumulibacter related to phosphorus removal and dechloromonas sp for denitrification luo et al 2020 even though the fractions in was were relatively low in this study fig 8b the results imply that the aforementioned dominant phyla largely disappeared due to cell decay in the ad process considering that 9 24 of was consists of microorganisms gonzalez et al 2018 the released amount of intracellular organics due to endogenous decay of cells cannot be ignored in the cascade system and would become part of the tcod that was available as substrate for the investigated hydrolytic enzymes fig 5 and 6 firmicutes were not predominant in the was but clearly the relative abundance of this phylum increased in r1 r2 and r3 to approximately 6 7 compared to 4 5 in the feed sludge at the total srt of 22 days furthermore the relative abundance of firmicutes increased to 8 8 and 11 3 as the srt reduced to 15 and 12 days respectively firmicutes have been identified to hydrolyse and ferment large numbers of organic compounds under a variety of conditions in ad systems karthikeyan et al 2016 liu et al 2019 the increase in relative abundance of this type of species implies that the role of hydrolysis and acidogenesis processes in r1 r2 and r3 of the cascade system became increasingly more important as the srts decreased in line as was reported by zhang et al 2019 to relate the identified microbes to hydrolysis and acidogenesis of was in the cascade ad system under different operational conditions the top 10 genera that governed the hydrolysis acidogenesis of the organic compounds in both systems were selected and ranked by the relative abundance while the changes in relative abundance were shown in fig 8c bacteria affiliated to genera vadinbc27 wastewater sludge group clostridium sensu stricto 1 enterococcus gelria bivil28 wastewater sludge group and sedimentibacter had significantly higher p value 0 05 relative abundance in r1 r2 and r3 than in the reference cstr at the srt of 22 days this might have been due to the greater abundance of non hydrolysed substrates that were present in r1 r2 and r3 since these genera have been frequently reported as the prevalent fermenters that were capable of hydrolysing protein or carbohydrate in ad kirkegaard et al 2017 liu et al 2016 wang et al 2020 possibly the mentioned genera can be recognised as the main contributors to the enhanced hydrolysis rate in the cascade digester system moreover lowering the total srt of these reactors further increased the relative abundance of the aforementioned bacteria which implies their higher metabolic activities in the degradation of was at higher loading rates on the other hand an upward trend in relative abundance of smithella candidatus cloacamonas and thermovirga was detected in the cascade system especially in r1 r2 and r3 at the short srts these recently characterized microorganisms might oxidize propionate and ferment sugars and amino acids to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide indicating that these species may possibly constitute acidifying and syntrophic associations stolze et al 2015 zamanzadeh et al 2013 it should be noted that a small proportion of vadinbc27 wastewater sludge group and bivil28 wastewater sludge group was also found in was these strains directly might have contributed to the hydrolysis and degradation of was when they entered the cascade system moreover because of their continuous seeding they might have persisted as functional biomass in r1 3 where short srts were applied kim and speece 2002 however the exact role of the was related cultures in the cascade system needs further studies besides the investigation on the relative abundance of the functional bacteria the microbial functional pathways including amino acid and carbohydrates metabolisms in different experimental phases were also researched and the results were summarized in the excel file supplementary materials it was found that lysine degradation ko00310 as well as valine leucine and isoleucine degradation ko00280 were the dominant pathways related to biomass conversion the relative abundance of these metabolic pathways in the different reactors indeed increased when the reactor srt dropped from 22 to 12 days moreover they showed a similar trend as the activities of valine and leucine arylamidase that catalyse the hydrolysis of valine and leucine from peptide chains fig 8d and fig 6 these findings suggest that applying a cascade system results in an enhanced microbial metabolism of hydrolytic acidogenic bacteria that caused the observed acceleration in hydrolytic enzyme activity and subsequent enhanced sludge reduction compared to the reference cstr obtained results also illustrated the microbial complexity of was hydrolysis which is difficult to capture in first order hydrolysis kinetics particularly under high loading conditions methanogenic archaeal communities as for the archaeal domain displayed in fig 9 methanobrevibacter and methanosaeta were equally dominant in the feed around 28 each in relative abundance in phase ii when the cascade system was operated at an srt of 22 days methanobrevibacter a hydrogenotrophic methanogen was the most abundant methanogen in r1 but gradually became the minor species in favour of methanosaeta that utilize acetate as the sole substrate from r2 to r4 maspolim et al 2015c this means a clear microbial shift from hydrogenotrophic methanogens towards acetoclastic methanogens alongside the cascade system also at the low srts of 15 and 12 days in phase iii and phase iv the composition of methanogens in r1 4 followed a similar trend as in phase ii whereas the proportion of hydrogenotrophic methanogens was at a higher level the predominance and importance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the acidogenic first stage reactors of phased ad systems have been described in literature the very high olr in the first stages of the cascade system resulted in a very high acidogenesis rate with a concomitant high hydrogen and carbon dioxide production rate huang et al 2015 liu et al 2019 shimada et al 2011 zhang et al 2019 the increased hydrogen carbon dioxide flux in reactors r1 3 resulted in an increased yield of hydrogenotrophic methanogens leading to an increase and eventual dominance of hydrogenotrophic methanogenic subpopulations considering the maximum growth rate μmax of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the range between 2 00 2 85 d 1 which is around 3 9 folds that of methanosaeta species 0 33 0 71 d 1 batstone et al 2002 van lier et al 2020 and the very short srts of reactors r1 3 the microbial abundancy of hydrogenotrophic methanogens could outcompete the acetoclastic methanosaeta species in contrast the applied srt in r4 and the prevailing acetate flux resulted in a pre dominance of methanosaeta in the final reactor of the cascade notably the acetate concentrations in r1 r2 and r3 were all significantly higher p value 0 05 than the threshold 600 µg l for methanosaeta survival klocke et al 2008 therefore unlike the reference cstr and r4 methane production from hydrogen and carbon dioxide rather than from acetate was most likely the dominating methanogenic pathway in r1 r2 and r3 it is noteworthy that sequences affiliated with methanospirillum had promoted relative abundance in all digesters from the phase ii to phase iv which implies the importance of this methanogen in ad under high loading conditions recently methanospirillum has been found to play an important role in syntrophic propionate oxidation in phased anaerobic digestion maspolim et al 2015c as an increase in relative abundance was also observed for propionate oxidisers such as smithella the applied cascade system apparently provides proper conditions for attaining efficient syntrophic propionate conversion de bok et al 2001 conclusions the conclusions drawn from the current work can be summarized as follows 1 ad in the cascade system led to 8 more tcod reduction than the single stage cstr digester both operated at a total srt of 22 days stepwise reduction of the total srt from 22 to 12 days did not affect the tcod removal efficiency for the cascade system but showed a 29 decrease in the tcod removal in the reference cstr maintaining stability at high organic loading rates in a cascade system denotes an enhanced sludge treatment capacity of 30 35 compared to a conventional sludge digester of the same volume 2 normalised specific hydrolysis rates resembling the first order hydrolysis rate constant differed per reactor and increased with decreasing srts the highest increase by a factor 2 was found in the individual reactors of the cascade system normalised hydrolysis increased by a factor 1 52 in the reference cstr 3 clear higher enzyme activities were found in the cascade system compared to the reference cstr especially under short srts which explains the overall accelerated specific hydrolysis rate in the cascade ad system the overall hydrolytic enzyme activities increased with a factor up to 3 or even more while this was a factor less than 2 for the specific hydrolysis rate indicating that hydrolysis was limited by the solids surface availability 4 several enzymes that target hydrolysis of seps related organic compounds displayed reversed distribution and higher activity in the cascade system than in the reference cstr indicating an additional degradation capacity of refractory compounds in the cascade system 5 the increased relative abundance of key hydrolytic bacteria found in the first 3 reactors of the cascade system and the structural shift from hydrogenotrophic methanogens to acetoclastic methanogens alongside the cascade under low srts demonstrated that cascading cstrs possibly imposed selective pressures on the microbial population which

16767,hydrolysis is considered to be the rate limiting step in anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge was in this study an innovative 4 stages cascade anaerobic digestion system was researched to 1 comprehensively clarify whether cascading configuration enhances was hydrolysis and to 2 better understand the governing hydrolysis kinetics in this system the cascade system consisted of three 2 2 l ultra short solids retention times srt continuous stirred tank reactors cstrs and one 15 4 l cstr the cascade system was compared with a reference conventional cstr digester 22 l in terms of process performance hydrolytic enzyme activities and microbial community dynamics under mesophilic conditions 35 c the results showed that the cascade system achieved a high and stable total chemical oxygen demand tcod reduction efficiency of 40 42 even at 12 days total srt that corresponded to only 1 2 days srt each in the first three reactors of the cascade the reference cstr converted only 31 tcod into biogas and suffered process deterioration at the applied low srts calculated specific hydrolysis rates in the first reactors of the cascade system were significantly higher compared to the reference cstr especially at the lowest applied srts the activities of several hydrolytic enzymes produced in the different stages revealed that protease cellulase amino peptidases and most of the tested glycosyl hydrolases had significantly higher activities in the first three small digesters of the cascade system compared to the reference cstr this increase in hydrolytic enzyme production by far exceeded the increase in specific hydrolysis rate indicating that hydrolysis was limited by solids surface availability for enzymatic attack correspondingly high relative abundances of hydrolytic fermentative bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens as well as the presence of syntrophic bacteria were found in the first three digesters of the cascade system however in the fourth reactor acetoclastic methanogens dominated similarly as in the reference cstr overall the results concluded that using multiple cstrs that are operated at low srts in a cascade mode of operation significantly improved the enzymatic hydrolysis rate and extend in anaerobic was digestion moreover the governing hydrolysis kinetics in the cascading reactors were far more complex than the generally assumed simplified first order kinetics graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste activated sludge cascading anaerobic digesters first order kinetics hydrolytic enzyme activity microbial community structure introduction waste activated sludge was is an inevitable by product generated in biological wastewater treatment plants wwtps due to quantitative and qualitative extension of wastewater treatment the annual was production has increased in the european union during the last two decades from 10 million tons in 2008 to 11 5 million tons in 2015 and is expected to approach 13 million tons by 2020 rorat et al 2019 anaerobic digestion ad is a proven key technology for both stabilization of was and recovery of the biochemical energy stored in the sludge in the form of biogas was usually contains complex particulate organics such as proteins polysaccharides lignocellulosic matters and fats gonzalez et al 2018 hydrolysis of was into soluble substrates is the first step in ad and is generally regarded as the rate limiting step in this process appels et al 2008 therefore conventional digesters using continuous stirred tank reactors cstrs have to be operated under prolonged sludge retention times srts exceeding 20 days for an acceptable was conversion to accelerate the conversion rate of was and decrease these long srts process optimisation has been applied as well as the development of hydrolysis enhancement technologies including thermal chemical and enzymatic methods zhen et al 2017 enzymatic hydrolysis enhancement seemingly offers unique advantages compared to chemical or physical processes as it neither causes generation of toxic substances nor needs operations under extreme conditions thus receiving an increased attention in the recent years gonzalez et al 2018 most of these studies focused on the direct addition of highly active hydrolytic enzymes into the digester yang et al 2010 or on pre fermentation by specific hydrolytic bacteria prior to ad agabo garcia et al 2019 these proof of concept methods showed remarkable improvement in was hydrolysis and bio degradation however full scale applications require a continuous purchase of enzymes and or the need for preservation of specific biomass while working with poorly defined substrates hydrolysis of organic matter during ad is performed by extracellular and or membrane bound hydrolytic enzymes kim et al 2012 enhancement of was hydrolysis also can be achieved by accelerating the reaction rates and or increasing the activity of these hydrolytic enzymes instead of adding external hydrolytic enzymes or applying pre fermentation a commonly applied strategy is to perform was digestion under thermophilic 55 c conditions which roughly results in a doubling of the enzymatic reaction rates compared to the commonly applied mesophilic 35 c conditions ge et al 2011a nevertheless decreased process performance was often observed under thermophilic conditions due to the accumulation of organic intermediates to a toxic level or to a drop in ph kim et al 2003 negatively impacting the actual enzymatic reaction rates in addition other constraints of thermophilic was digestion include higher energy requirement poor effluent quality and a poorer digestate s dewaterability de la rubia et al 2013 thus there is a great interest to search for alternative technologies the enzymatic hydrolysis of was is commonly described by empirical first order kinetics vavilin et al 2008 meaning that the observed solids conversion rate is dependant on the solid substrate concentration and the first order hydrolysis rate constant eq 1 1 d s d t k h s where s substrate concentration t time and kh first order hydrolysis rate constant theoretically in a cstr the concentration s in the reactor equals the effluent s concentration indicating that in reactor conversion rates decrease with decreasing s eq 1 agreeing with an increased conversion ratio η fig 1 a based on eq 2 the required volume of a cstr at a given inlet feeding rate f0 is fully determined by the required η and is graphically presented by the large rectangular area shown in fig 1b levenspiel 2006 on the contrary by cascading cstrs small reactor volumes in series are applied that result in high intermediate s concentrations consequently the first cstrs can be operated at high reaction rates whereas the last cstr of the cascade system will have a similar reaction rate as the single stage cstr thus the series of small cstrs will eventually reach to a similar η but to a significant smaller working volume compared to the single stage cstr fig 1c the overall required volume of the cascade system is reciprocally correlated to the number of cstrs 2 v f 0 1 r η where v volume of the cstr m3 f0 substrate feeding rate kg cod day r substrate conversion rate kg cod m3 day and η substrate conversion ratio 0 100 cascade cstr configurations are commonly applied to accelerate catalytic substrate conversions that are characterised by eq 1 miyawaki et al 2016 in case reaction rates are substrate dependant such as for soluble substrates in michaelis menten and or monod kinetics the impact of reactor cascading will even be higher however for solid substrates such as was concentration dependant reaction rates are rarely documented miron et al 2000 and generally first order reaction rate constants are considered blumensaat and keller 2005 up to now application of the cascade cstr configurations for was has been mainly reported in the scope of co digestion in food waste liu et al 2013 or agricultural waste zhou et al 2019 in which was contributed to improved buffer capacities and more balanced nutrient profiles in the past decade several researchers found higher was conversion efficiencies by using two stage two cstrs in series mesophilic ad systems either with or without addition of primary sludge for which no clear mechanistic explanation was given athanasoulia et al 2012 maspolim et al 2015b ge et al 2011b and wu et al 2015 observed an improved hydrolysis rate in temperature phased thermophilic cstr mesophilic cstr was anaerobic digestion processes nonetheless the authors attributed the enhanced hydrolysis merely to the thermophilic conditions applied despite the fact that staging has resulted in improved was digestion it remains unclear whether accelerated enzyme activities increased surface area of the solid substrates and or other factors were determinative however the published wide range of assessed hydrolysis rate constants for was batstone et al 2002 gives room for further research and process optimisation in order to 1 comprehensively clarify whether a cascade configuration enhances was hydrolysis and to 2 better understand the governing hydrolysis kinetics in this system a novel cascade ad system for was treatment was researched in this study which consisted of four cstrs in series i e three small volume cstrs and a large volume cstr considering that digestate recycle improves process stability in staged anaerobic digestion qin et al 2019 the cascade system was equipped with a modest digestate recirculation applying a much lower ratio than reported in literature wu et al 2015 as such the whole system can be interpreted as a semi plug flow device with only a negligible hydraulic impact of the recycle flow reactor performance in the different steps of the system were investigated detailed research on prevailing specific hydrolysis rates activities of key hydrolytic enzymes and the bacterial archaeal community structure was performed to explain the results of the reactor performance and unveil the impact of cascading on hydrolysis kinetics all results from the cascade system were compared to those

triplicate sludge samples including feed and digestates were collected for enzyme extraction at the end of phase ii day 145 and 151 phase iii day 252 and 258 and phase iv 323 and 329 of the individual reactors of both digestion systems the hydrolytic enzymes were separated into free and sludge attached fractions the free enzymes are defined as the enzymes that are present in the was s supernatant whereas the sludge attached enzymes are either membrane bound or in other ways attached to the sludge particles the extraction method of the hydrolytic enzymes was implemented according to zhang et al 2007 with a slight modification for sludge samples briefly 1 ml sludge sample was centrifuged in a 1 5 ml tube eppendorf germany at 14 000 rpm for 1 min the supernatant was transferred to a clean tube and was used for the measurement of free enzyme activities the pellet was washed twice using potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer ph 7 0 0 1 mol l and was subsequently resuspended in sodium acetate buffer at ph 6 0 to the original volume to release sludge attached enzymes after centrifugation the suspension at 3000 g for 10 min the supernatant was used for the determination of sludge attached

provides functional annotations based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg pathway database results and discussion performance comparison between the cascade ad system and the reference cstr during the start up phase the effluent tcod concentrations and methane production rate fluctuated in all reactors fig 3 a both parameters gradually stabilised from day 71 onward after which the cascade and reference system were both operated under stable conditions for 81 days phase ii during both phase i and phase ii the cascade system and the reference cstr were operated with an srt of 22 days the tcod removal efficiency of the entire cascade system was 43 6 versus 40 5 of the reference cstr during this period both removal efficiencies were within typical ranges of mesophilic was digestion reported by previous studies maspolim et al 2015b on average the methane production rate was around 8 higher in the cascade system than in the reference cstr fig 3b after the total srt was lowered to 15 days phase iii effluent tcod concentrations of both r4 and the reference cstr increased due to the sudden increase in total organic loading rate olr from 2 4 to 3 5 g cod l d this reduction in tcod removal efficiency was also observed at the start of phase iv when the total srt was further decreased to 12 days and the total olr correspondingly increased to 4 4 g cod l d strikingly only the cascade system recovered to a tcod removal efficiency between 40 and 42 at the applied increased olr whereas the tcod removal efficiency in the reference cstr reduced to around 38 in phase iii and 31 in phase iv the difference in treatment performance was reflected by the increasing difference in methane production fig 3b the cascade system showed an average 13 higher methane production rate in phase iii and even an average 29 higher rate in phase iv than the reference cstr the obtained results clearly demonstrated the advantage of applying a cascade configuration particularly at reduced srts in fact at 12 days srt the overall capacity referring to the tcod removal efficiency of the cascade digester was 30 35 higher compared to the reference cstr with the same total volume zooming into the separate reactors of the cascade system reveals that the reactors r1 r2 and r3 with an srt of 2 2 days each phase ii contributed to 20 24 of the total methane volume that was produced in the cascade system fig 3b these results agree with a reported study on two staged ad systems under similar srt conditions which showed that the methane production in the first cstr was on average 25 of the total maspolim et al 2015b when the srt in the cascade reactors r1 r2 and r3 was decreased to 1 5 and 1 2 days each in phase iii and phase iv respectively the methane production stayed between 12 and 16 of the overall total methane production the biogas in these three reactors contained 46 53 methane while the methane content of the biogas of r4 and of the reference cstr was 56 62 negligible hydrogen partial pressure was found in all the anaerobic reactors 0 01 these observations showed that despite their short srt and most probably due to the 10 recirculation flow active methanogens were present in r1 r2 and r3 vfa concentrations and ph are commonly used as indicators for process perturbation and or reactor control franke whittle et al 2014 the total vfa concentration in the feed and all reactors is presented in fig 3c as expected the vfa concentration was always the highest in r1 and was gradually reduced along the system acetate and propionate accounted for 60 80 of the total vfas showing their predominance in all reactors fig s1 in supplementary materials with increased olr or decreased srt an elevation in vfa concentration in r1 r2 and r3 was observed from 310 100 and 60 mg l at srt 22 days to 590 380 and 175 mg l at srt 12 days respectively very low total vfas 5 mg l were found in reactor r4 in all phases demonstrating that all vfas were eventually converted to methane in the last step of the cascade system in the reference cstr there was no vfa accumulation observed even at the shortest srt 12 days when total vfa concentration slightly increased to around 110 mg l clearly the vfa concentrations remained far below the inhibition threshold for methanogenic activity wang et al 2009 and thus cannot explain the difference in was degradation between the cascade system and the reference cstr at short srts however the ph in both r1 and r2 of the cascade system was between 6 3 and 6 5 somewhat lower than the ph in the rest of the reactors the lower ph coincided with the somewhat higher vfa concentrations in r1 and r2 and can be attributed to increased acidifying activity and reduced methanogenic activity in the first reactors of the cascade maspolim et al 2015b in reactors r3 and r4 as well as in the reference system the ph remained neutral fig 3d nonetheless the relatively stable ph in r1 and r2 could be ascribed to alkalinity supplementation by digestate recirculation from r3 to r1 introducing sufficient buffer capacity as presented in fig s2 in supplementary material to be able to explain the different tcod removal efficiencies between the cascade and the reference system the specific hydrolysis rates were calculated using eq 3 the tcod and scod variations fig 1 and fig s3 in supplementary materials and the methane production fig 3b in each reactor computed specific hydrolysis rates resembling the first order hydrolysis rate constant kh eq 1 are shown in fig 4 under all tested operational conditions the specific hydrolysis rate was highest in r1 of the cascade system and steadily decreased throughout the subsequent reactors of the cascade during phase ii the specific hydrolysis rate calculated for the reference cstr was slightly higher than that in r3 of the cascade system reducing the srt from 22 to 12 days led to approximately a doubling of the specific hydrolysis rate in the reactors of the cascade system while it increased only 1 5 times in the reference cstr it should be noted that the bar presented specific hydrolysis rates are in fact underestimates of the actual values since these were calculated using eq 3 which includes both the substrate and biomass vs in each reactor however particularly in reactors r1 3 the contribution of the substrate vs to the total vs is relatively large we therefore recalculated the apparent kh values using the vs content in r4 which resembles the non digestible vs fraction in the entire cascade system the corrected kh values are presented above each bar of r1 3 in fig 4 showing an even higher increase in specific hydrolysis rates in the first stages of the cascade reactor strikingly under all loading conditions the assessed specific hydrolysis rates in r4 of the cascade system and the reference cstr were very similar nonetheless at the highest olr the overall specific hydrolysis rate in the reference cstr was significantly lower p value 0 05 than the separate specific hydrolysis rates in all reactors of the cascade system apparently the specific hydrolysis rate was process condition dependant and results in fig 4 showed that in all reactors the specific hydrolysis rate increased with increasing olrs similar observation were previously done by miron et al 2000 our present results clearly indicate that the potential volume reduction which can be attained by implementing cascade configurations is indeed much more than based on solely the theoretical considerations as explained in fig 1 levenspiel 2006 where the same first order reaction rate is applied for all individual reactors in the cascade system and the single stage cstr moreover at the applied low srts or imposed extreme olrs the specific hydrolysis rates increased significantly more p value 0 05 in the first reactors of the cascade system compared to that in the reference cstr fig 4 most likely the maximum organic loading potentials of the cascade system were not reached yet as process performance remained stable even at an srt of 12 days fig 3 results further indicate that for increasing the sludge treatment capacity at a common wwtp the present ad installation can be upgraded in a relatively easy manner to a very compact cascade reactor system via retrofitting existing parallel fed large scale conventional cstr based sludge digesters for instance one cstr digester could be divided into a sequence of several compartments and subsequently be connected with another digester in series hydrolytic enzyme activity to explain the large differences in observed specific hydrolysis rates between the different reactors the hydrolytic enzyme activities were assessed parawira et al 2005 cellulosic fibres and proteins are identified as the two predominated organic components in was guo et al 2020b therefore the activity of cellulase and protease were chosen as representative enzyme activities for a first characterisation of was hydrolysis in both systems applying a widely reported enzymes extraction protocol for anaerobic samples zhang et al 2007 meanwhile automatic measurements in a 96 well microplate reader rather than manual measurements were conducted for the analysis of enzyme activities in this study bonilla et al 2018 with the duplicate extraction of enzymes from the same reactor at three inconsecutive days results in fig 5 showed that both free and sludge attached enzymes are present in the digester regardless of the configuration type i e cascade or single cstr the results showed that protease activities were two orders of magnitude higher than cellulase activities which could be possibly due to the significant higher proportion of protein than cellulose in was guo et al 2020b highest protease and cellulase enzyme activities were present in the sludge attached fraction of both reactor configurations enzyme activities are proportionally related to the enzyme s amount kim et al 2012 suggesting that the hydrolytic enzymes were mainly adsorbed on or attached to the sludge matrix in line with a previous publication by maspolim et al 2015a in both free and sludge attached fractions the activity of hydrolytic enzymes distinctly increased from the feed to r1 especially at short srts indicating that hydrolysis in r1 was indeed accelerated owing to increased presence of hydrolytic enzymes significant higher enzyme activities p value 0 05 were observed in the three small reactors in comparison with the reference cstr the protease activities in r1 were double the activities in the reference cstr even the protease activities in r4 were slightly higher than those in the reference cstr meanwhile the cellulase activities in r1 r2 and r3 were statistically higher than those in r4 while the digestate of r4 showed a similar cellulase activity as the reference cstr fig 5d the observed higher hydrolytic enzyme activities in the cascade ad system compared to those of the reference cstr could be attributed to the imposed high olrs corresponding to short srts in reactors r1 r2 and r3 following first order reaction kinetics eq 1 the application of increased olrs results in accelerated hydrolytic enzyme activities menzel et al 2020 xiao et al 2017 results showed that enzyme activities especially the sludge attached ones in all reactors increased over three times when the total srt was reduced from 22 to 12 days fig 5 notably the increase in the enzyme activities in both systems exceeded the increase in the calculated specific hydrolysis rates in each reactor fig 4 this mismatch strongly indicates that the actual solids hydrolysis in the cascade system was limited by the available free surface for enzymatic attack rather than by the presence of sufficient hydrolytic conversion capacity a more detailed semi quantitative analysis of amino peptidases and glycosyl hydrolases in both free and sludge attached fractions using api zym strips were carried out at the same moments as described above fig 6 similar to protease and cellulase activities the activities of all hydrolases tested with this method increased at short srts and showed a downward trend in activity from r1 to r4 of the cascade digester surprisingly however the β glucuronidase α mannosidase and α fucosidase activities increased stepwise along the cascade system which indicates that the hydrolysis of target substrates of these enzymes occurs later in the process the presence and the role of the target substrates namely glucuronic acid mannose and fucose in the sludge matrix have been researched in several studies showing that they act as main building blocks in the structural extracellular polymeric substances seps that form the gel like structures of the sludge guo et al 2020a regarding the degradation of seps in both digestion systems fig s4 in supplementary materials results showed that seps were mostly converted in r4 irrespective of changes in srt which was in line with the distributions of the β glucuronidase α mannosidase and α fucosidase activities in addition observations from the cascade system reveal that in the first reactors the more easily biodegradable poly saccharides and poly proteins were degraded while in the remaining of the cascade system the more refractory organic residuals in was such as seps related saccharides were degraded as a consequence the cascade system revealed a more stepwise and improved reduction of different types of organics which e g resulted in 14 more seps reduction at the total srt of 22 days compared to the reference cstr at the shortest tested srt of 12 days seps reduction was even 64 higher fig s4 in supplementary materials pyrosequencing analysis of the microbial communities diversity indices the results of alpha diversity based on shannon diversity were listed in table s in supplementary material substrate sample 1 2 and the inoculum had the highest and lowest values respectively meaning that the was substrate contained the most diverse bacterial communities whereas the anaerobically grown inoculum had the least biodiversity shannon diversity decreased in both ad systems when operated at the total srt of 22 days and slightly increased as the srt was reduced this indicates that the initial microbiome members that were present in the feed partially disappeared in the cascade ad process and thus a narrowed ad community was eventually formed a microbial dynamic transition alongside with the cascade system from r1 to r4 could be clearly demonstrated by the beta diversity described via pcoa based on the matrix distance between the samples fig 7 in all operational conditions r1 r2 and r3 were clustering closely to each other while r4 was obviously separated from r1 3 and near the inoculum revealing a different microbial composition presented in r4 compared to other reactors in the cascade system the microbial structure of the reference cstr and the r1 3 was similar to that of was under the reduced srts suggesting less cell decay of the fed was at this short srt which is possibly linked to the deterioration in tcod reduction efficiency fig 3a it should be noted that the applied cascade ad system was equipped with a digestate recirculation system operating at a recirculation ratio of 10 it has been reported that recycling the digestate from a methanogenic reactor to an acidogenic reactor at a recycling ratio of 100 resulted in a changed and improved diversity of bacteria and archaea in the acidogenic reactor wu et al 2016 thus far the effect of only 10 recycling is unknown nonetheless in our present study considerable methane production was observed in r1 r2 and r3 fig 3b which might be ascribed to the supplement of methanogens via digestate recirculation however based on the pcoa results showing the clear microbial shift within the cascade system from r1 to r4 fig 7 it seems that this impact of 10 recycling was limited bacterial communities the bacterial species taxonomy at phylum level is shown in fig 8 a proteobacteria 55 60 followed by bacteroidetes 8 10 and actinobacteria 7 9 were the most dominant phyla in the raw was which is in line with previous studies westerholm et al 2016 the changes in microbial composition between samples were most pronounced for proteobacteria because the total reduction in the relative abundance of this phylum was distinctly higher than for the other phyla in both cascade system and reference cstr the relative abundance of the genus candidatus competibacter belonging to the phylum proteobacteria was reduced by approximately 30 in r1 r2 and r3 together while it was declined by 60 in the post digester r4 of the cascade ad system a similar observation was also found for other genera from this phylum such as candidatus accumulibacter related to phosphorus removal and dechloromonas sp for denitrification luo et al 2020 even though the fractions in was were relatively low in this study fig 8b the results imply that the aforementioned dominant phyla largely disappeared due to cell decay in the ad process considering that 9 24 of was consists of microorganisms gonzalez et al 2018 the released amount of intracellular organics due to endogenous decay of cells cannot be ignored in the cascade system and would become part of the tcod that was available as substrate for the investigated hydrolytic enzymes fig 5 and 6 firmicutes were not predominant in the was but clearly the relative abundance of this phylum increased in r1 r2 and r3 to approximately 6 7 compared to 4 5 in the feed sludge at the total srt of 22 days furthermore the relative abundance of firmicutes increased to 8 8 and 11 3 as the srt reduced to 15 and 12 days respectively firmicutes have been identified to hydrolyse and ferment large numbers of organic compounds under a variety of conditions in ad systems karthikeyan et al 2016 liu et al 2019 the increase in relative abundance of this type of species implies that the role of hydrolysis and acidogenesis processes in r1 r2 and r3 of the cascade system became increasingly more important as the srts decreased in line as was reported by zhang et al 2019 to relate the identified microbes to hydrolysis and acidogenesis of was in the cascade ad system under different operational conditions the top 10 genera that governed the hydrolysis acidogenesis of the organic compounds in both systems were selected and ranked by the relative abundance while the changes in relative abundance were shown in fig 8c bacteria affiliated to genera vadinbc27 wastewater sludge group clostridium sensu stricto 1 enterococcus gelria bivil28 wastewater sludge group and sedimentibacter had significantly higher p value 0 05 relative abundance in r1 r2 and r3 than in the reference cstr at the srt of 22 days this might have been due to the greater abundance of non hydrolysed substrates that were present in r1 r2 and r3 since these genera have been frequently reported as the prevalent fermenters that were capable of hydrolysing protein or carbohydrate in ad kirkegaard et al 2017 liu et al 2016 wang et al 2020 possibly the mentioned genera can be recognised as the main contributors to the enhanced hydrolysis rate in the cascade digester system moreover lowering the total srt of these reactors further increased the relative abundance of the aforementioned bacteria which implies their higher metabolic activities in the degradation of was at higher loading rates on the other hand an upward trend in relative abundance of smithella candidatus cloacamonas and thermovirga was detected in the cascade system especially in r1 r2 and r3 at the short srts these recently characterized microorganisms might oxidize propionate and ferment sugars and amino acids to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide indicating that these species may possibly constitute acidifying and syntrophic associations stolze et al 2015 zamanzadeh et al 2013 it should be noted that a small proportion of vadinbc27 wastewater sludge group and bivil28 wastewater sludge group was also found in was these strains directly might have contributed to the hydrolysis and degradation of was when they entered the cascade system moreover because of their continuous seeding they might have persisted as functional biomass in r1 3 where short srts were applied kim and speece 2002 however the exact role of the was related cultures in the cascade system needs further studies besides the investigation on the relative abundance of the functional bacteria the microbial functional pathways including amino acid and carbohydrates metabolisms in different experimental phases were also researched and the results were summarized in the excel file supplementary materials it was found that lysine degradation ko00310 as well as valine leucine and isoleucine degradation ko00280 were the dominant pathways related to biomass conversion the relative abundance of these metabolic pathways in the different reactors indeed increased when the reactor srt dropped from 22 to 12 days moreover they showed a similar trend as the activities of valine and leucine arylamidase that catalyse the hydrolysis of valine and leucine from peptide chains fig 8d and fig 6 these findings suggest that applying a cascade system results in an enhanced microbial metabolism of hydrolytic acidogenic bacteria that caused the observed acceleration in hydrolytic enzyme activity and subsequent enhanced sludge reduction compared to the reference cstr obtained results also illustrated the microbial complexity of was hydrolysis which is difficult to capture in first order hydrolysis kinetics particularly under high loading conditions methanogenic archaeal communities as for the archaeal domain displayed in fig 9 methanobrevibacter and methanosaeta were equally dominant in the feed around 28 each in relative abundance in phase ii when the cascade system was operated at an srt of 22 days methanobrevibacter a hydrogenotrophic methanogen was the most abundant methanogen in r1 but gradually became the minor species in favour of methanosaeta that utilize acetate as the sole substrate from r2 to r4 maspolim et al 2015c this means a clear microbial shift from hydrogenotrophic methanogens towards acetoclastic methanogens alongside the cascade system also at the low srts of 15 and 12 days in phase iii and phase iv the composition of methanogens in r1 4 followed a similar trend as in phase ii whereas the proportion of hydrogenotrophic methanogens was at a higher level the predominance and importance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the acidogenic first stage reactors of phased ad systems have been described in literature the very high olr in the first stages of the cascade system resulted in a very high acidogenesis rate with a concomitant high hydrogen and carbon dioxide production rate huang et al 2015 liu et al 2019 shimada et al 2011 zhang et al 2019 the increased hydrogen carbon dioxide flux in reactors r1 3 resulted in an increased yield of hydrogenotrophic methanogens leading to an increase and eventual dominance of hydrogenotrophic methanogenic subpopulations considering the maximum growth rate μmax of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the range between 2 00 2 85 d 1 which is around 3 9 folds that of methanosaeta species 0 33 0 71 d 1 batstone et al 2002 van lier et al 2020 and the very short srts of reactors r1 3 the microbial abundancy of hydrogenotrophic methanogens could outcompete the acetoclastic methanosaeta species in contrast the applied srt in r4 and the prevailing acetate flux resulted in a pre dominance of methanosaeta in the final reactor of the cascade notably the acetate concentrations in r1 r2 and r3 were all significantly higher p value 0 05 than the threshold 600 µg l for methanosaeta survival klocke et al 2008 therefore unlike the reference cstr and r4 methane production from hydrogen and carbon dioxide rather than from acetate was most likely the dominating methanogenic pathway in r1 r2 and r3 it is noteworthy that sequences affiliated with methanospirillum had promoted relative abundance in all digesters from the phase ii to phase iv which implies the importance of this methanogen in ad under high loading conditions recently methanospirillum has been found to play an important role in syntrophic propionate oxidation in phased anaerobic digestion maspolim et al 2015c as an increase in relative abundance was also observed for propionate oxidisers such as smithella the applied cascade system apparently provides proper conditions for attaining efficient syntrophic propionate conversion de bok et al 2001 conclusions the conclusions drawn from the current work can be summarized as follows 1 ad in the cascade system led to 8 more tcod reduction than the single stage cstr digester both operated at a total srt of 22 days stepwise reduction of the total srt from 22 to 12 days did not affect the tcod removal efficiency for the cascade system but showed a 29 decrease in the tcod removal in the reference cstr maintaining stability at high organic loading rates in a cascade system denotes an enhanced sludge treatment capacity of 30 35 compared to a conventional sludge digester of the same volume 2 normalised specific hydrolysis rates resembling the first order hydrolysis rate constant differed per reactor and increased with decreasing srts the highest increase by a factor 2 was found in the individual reactors of the cascade system normalised hydrolysis increased by a factor 1 52 in the reference cstr 3 clear higher enzyme activities were found in the cascade system compared to the reference cstr especially under short srts which explains the overall accelerated specific hydrolysis rate in the cascade ad system the overall hydrolytic enzyme activities increased with a factor up to 3 or even more while this was a factor less than 2 for the specific hydrolysis rate indicating that hydrolysis was limited by the solids surface availability 4 several enzymes that target hydrolysis of seps related organic compounds displayed reversed distribution and higher activity in the cascade system than in the reference cstr indicating an additional degradation capacity of refractory compounds in the cascade system 5 the increased relative abundance of key hydrolytic bacteria found in the first 3 reactors of the cascade system and the structural shift from hydrogenotrophic methanogens to acetoclastic methanogens alongside the cascade under low srts demonstrated that cascading cstrs possibly imposed selective pressures on the microbial population which

among these metabolites algal organic matters aoms can be precursor to disinfection by products dbps and increase coagulant demands in drinking water treatment plants dwtps he et al 2016 moreover

contrast cyanobacteria are less sensitive to kmno4 oxidation and thus kmno4 treatments are less likely to result in cell damage and thereby minimize the release of cyanotoxins and ioms xie et al 2013 fan et al 2013a in addition kmno4 can oxidize cyanotoxins and aoms through several reaction pathways including electron exchange hydrogen abstraction and direct donation of oxygen waldemer and tratnyek 2006 rodríguez et al 2007a 2007b huang et al 2008 xie et al 2013 li et al 2014 kim et al 2018 laszakovits et al 2020 during kmno4 oxidation adsorption coprecipitation with newly formed manganese dioxide mno2 can further enhance the removal of cyanobacteria and eoms by post coagulation chen and yeh 2005 xie et al 2013 liu et al 2017 naceradska et al 2017 moreover kmno4 is useful for

et al 2020a li et al 2020a found that low viability cyanobacteria were more susceptible to chlorination attributed to its poor cellular surfaces during chlorination cyanotoxins degradation rate of low viability cyanobacteria decreased due to competitive reactions with eoms leading to a high risk of elevated extracellular cyanotoxins li et al 2020a these results demonstrated that chlorination is not a feasible option for treating low viability cyanobacteria li et al 2020a many studies have shown that kmno4 has a variety of advantages to treat cyanobacteria compared to chlorine suggesting that kmno4 may be a promising pre oxidant for low viability cyanobacteria at decay stage of a successive bloom however to our knowledge no studies have investigated the effects of kmno4 on membrane integrity and associated metabolites removal of low viability cyanobacteria whether cell viability of cyanobacteria would affect kmno4 oxidation is also unknown consequently it is strongly essential to compare these effects of kmno4 oxidation on high and low viability cyanobacteria here various dosages of kmno4 were employed to treat high and low viability cyanobacteria oxidant decay membrane integrity loss cyanotoxin fate and eoms removal were investigated then kmno4 assisted coagulation experiments were performed to remove high and low viability cyanobacteria with the aim to evaluate the feasibility of kmno4 as a pre oxidant to treat low viability cyanobacteria at decay stage of a successive bloom 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents microcystis is one of the most pervasive bloom forming cyanobacteria in freshwater ecosystems harke et al 2016 in this study a toxic strain microcystis aeruginosa fachb 915 was employed to conduct kmno4 experiments this strain was cultured in bg11 medium supporting information text 1 at 28 c with a 12 h 12 h light dark cycle under light intensity of 35 μmol m 1 s 1 li et al 2020a potassium permanganate kmno4 stock solution 1 0

d in bg 11 medium including development maintenance and decay stages as described by li et al 2020a prior to experiments the same initial cell density of high and low viability cells was set to minimize the effects of cyanobacterial biomass on kmno4 oxidation microcystis samples were collected at 15 d development stage and 100 d decay stage with the same initial cell density of approximately 6 0 106 cells ml 1 and monitored using a flow cytometer fig s1 microcystis cells at 100 d held a much lower photosynthetic activity than at 15 d demonstrating that these samples could well represent high and low viability microcystis li et al 2020a fig s1 high and low viability microcystis were equally diluted with ddh2o to a final cell density of about 1 0 106 cells ml 1 as previous studies have conducted kmno4 experiments to treat high viability microcystis at development stage with an initial cell density of 106 cells ml 1 table s1 adding ddh2o did not affect membrane integrity of cyanobacteria and it did not contain any organic or inorganic matters to affect kmno4 oxidation li et al 2020a 2020b this study employed culture solutions as reaction backgrounds because this culture sollution could better show the effects of varied eoms of high and low viability microcystis on kmno4 oxidation 2 3 kmno4 oxidation to treat high and low viability microcystis high and low viability microcystis were treated with the desired dosages of kmno4 0 5 1 2 5 10 or 20 mg l 1 and mixed with a magnetic stirrer at 200 rpm magnetic stirring did not impair membrane integrity fig s2 during kmno4 oxidation microcystis samples were taken at a contact time of 0 0 2 0 5 1 2 3 4 6 and 8 h at each time interval residual kmno4 was measured to establish oxidant decay curves furthermore each sample of 1 ml was taken for membrane integrity analysis samples of 100 and 10 ml were immediately quenched with na2s2o3 and used for cyanotoxins and eoms analysis respectively control tests were performed using microcystis without adding kmno4 all of these kmno4 experiments were conducted in 5 l glass conical flasks at the same temperature of 20 2 influence of ph on cyanotoxin oxidation by kmno4 was negligible rodríguez et al 2007a kim et al 2018 and previous studies have conducted kmno4 experiments for high viability cells at ph 7 8 table s1 thus high and low viability microcystis samples were adjusted to ph 7 5 0 1 using 0 1 m sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid 2 4 kmno4 assisted coagulation to remove high and low viability microcystis high and low viability microcystis

viability microcystis were collected via centrifugation at 6000 g for 5 min supporting information text 1 these samples were employed to quantify expression of abc transporter gene mcyh via rt qpcr analysis since mcyh was responsible for transmembrane transport of intracellular microcystin tillet et al 2000 pearson et al 2004 2 6 analytical methods 2 6 1 measurement of kmno4 concentration a

and significant difference was defined at p 0 05 statistical analyses were performed using origin 8 0 3 results 3 1 kmno4 decay kmno4 concentration remained constant in bg 11 medium suggesting that medium components did not cause kmno4 consumption fig 1 with initial high dosages of 10 and 20 mg l 1 a decay pattern of fast slow fast was observed for both high and low viability cells fig 1 there was no residual kmno4 after 1 8 h with initial low dosages of 0 5 1 or 2 mg l 1 for both high and low viability cells whereas about 1 5 10 1 mg l 1 was present after 8 h with initial dosages of 5 10 and 20 mg l 1 fig 1 to compare kmno4 decay for high and low viability cells a pseudo first order kinetics model was employed to estimate rate constants kdecay of oxidant decay according to eq 1 as described by ho et al 2006 for chlorination 1 ln c t c 0 k d e c a y t where t h contact time ct mg l 1 residual kmno4 concentration after a given contact time c0 mg l 1 initial kmno4 concentration at

the models the kdecay was 0 07 0 61 and 0 10 1 30 h 1 for high and low viability cells respectively table 1 under equal initial dosages of kmno4 kdecay of high viability cells was higher than that of low viability cells p 0 05 table 1 3 2 membrane integrity loss prior to kmno4 oxidation more than 90 of high viability cells remained intact whereas up to about 55 were damaged for low viability cells fig 2 without kmno4 oxidation there was no membrane destruction of high and low viability cells fig 2 kmno4 of 0 5 mg l 1 did not impair membrane integrity for either high or low viability cells fig 2 initial high dosages of 5 10 and 20 mg l 1 induced complete loss of membrane integrity after a contact time of 2 6 h for high and low viability cells fig 2 moreover kmno4 at a concentration of 2 mg l 1 resulted in 75 and 89 of membrane damage for high and low viability cells respectively while lower percentages of 33 and 27 were disrupted with 1 mg l 1 respectively fig 2 to compare impairment of membrane integrity of high and low viability cells by kmno4 oxidation rate constants of membrane integrity loss kloss were estimated via pseudo first order kinetics eq 2 below followed ding et al 2010

describe the data with equal initial dosages of kmno4 ki 46 57 m 1 s 1 of low viability cells was higher than that of high viability cells 17 41 m 1 s 1 but ke 4 56 m 1 s 1 was lower than that of high

0 5 and 1 mg l 1 p 0 05 fig 4 in contrast with initial dosages of 2 5 10 and 20 mg l 1 an increase decrease pattern was observed fig 4 with a sufficient oxidant exposure doc and uv254 eventually decreased for both high and low viability cells fig 4 notably dosages of 2 5 10 and 20 mg l 1 achieved a higher removal ratio of doc 16 63 and uv254 27 70 than 0 5 and 1 mg l 1 doc 4 18 uv254 14 24 after a contact time of 8 h p 0 05 fig 4 3 5 kmno4 assisted coagulation to remove high and low viability cyanobacteria without kmno4 oxidation removal ratios of high and low viability cells were about

coagulation respectively p 0 05 fig 5 notably removal ratios of low viability cells exhibited a positive correlation with initial dosages of kmno4 but removal ratios of high viability cells were lower with dosages of 2 and 5 mg l 1 than that with dosages of 0 5 1 10 and 20 mg l 1 fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 effects of cell viability of cyanobacteria on kmno4 oxidation 4 1 1 kmno4 decay this study found that oxidant decay rate kdecay of low viability cells was higher than that of high viability cells table 1 kim et al 2018 found that elevated doc could reduce kmno4 exposure and that kmno4 had high reactivity with aromatic molecules in this study low viability cells exhibited higher concentrations of doc and uv254 than high viability cells p 0 05 fig 4 therefore elevated eoms containing more aromatic compounds could induce faster kmno4 consumption for low viability cells than for high viability cells the same as for chlorination li et al 2020a cell viability of cyanobacteria did not affect the pattern of kmno4 decay and initial high dosages of kmno4 10 and 20 mg l 1 exhibited a decay pattern of fast slow fast for both high and low viability cells this result may be ascribed to selective oxidation of aoms by kmno4 since wang et al 2013 and kim et al 2018 reported that kmno4 could effectively oxidize low molecular weight mw aoms into co2 but showed a lower oxidizing capacity with high mw proteins and polysaccharides jeong et al 2017 kim et al 2018 kmno4 molecules 10 and 20 mg l 1 firstly reacted with low mw eoms leading to a fast oxidant decay then the slow decay pattern could be attributed to weaker reaction with high mw polysaccharides and proteins on cellular surface after membrane destruction kmno4 further reacted with the released low mw ioms resulting in a fast oxidant decay 4 1 2 membrane integrity loss cellular surfaces e g mucilage are an important barrier to prevent cyanobacteria from oxidant attack for example li et al 2018 and xu et al 2019 observed that microcystis was more resistant to kmno4 attack than filamentous pseudoanabaena since microcystis had thicker mucilage surrounding cellular surface to form colonies in this study low viability cells exhibited higher rate constants of membrane integrity loss kloss than high viability cells fig 1 table 2 this result demonstrated that low viability cells were more susceptible to kmno4 oxidation than high viability cells the same as for chlorination li et al 2020a in contrast to kmno4 chlorination held a strong capacity to induce complete membrane destruction of low viability cells even with initial low dosage of 1 mg l 1 li et al 2020a however initial kmno4 of 1 mg l 1 only caused slight membrane damage for low viability cells 27 and even it was slightly lower than high viability cells 33 p 0 05 this result seemed to contradict the conclusion low viability cells were less resistant to kmno4 oxidation than high viability cells actually previous studies have noted that membrane destruction mainly depended on oxidant exposure of kmno4 fan et al 2013a 2013b li et al 2014 xu et al 2019 in this treatment actual oxidant exposure of low viability cells 11 mg min l 1 was much lower than that of high viability cells 24 mg min l 1 and this may have efficiently compensated for their low resistance to kmno4 oxidation lower dosage of kmno4 of 0 5 mg l 1 did not disrupt membrane integrity of high or low viability cells mainly due to its low reactivity with cyanobacteria overall although low viability cells were more susceptible to kmno4 attack than high viability cells initial low dosages of kmno4 0 5 and 1 mg l 1 as a pre oxidant could minimize membrane damage to low viability cells 4 1 3 cyanotoxins release and degradation kinetics of cyanotoxins release ki and degradation ke were strongly affected by the changes in cell viability similar to results using chlorination li et al 2020a low viability cells exhibited higher ki in line with kloss tables 2 and 3 besides ke of low viability cells was lower than that of high viability cells table 3 laszakovits and mackay 2019 found that inhibition of cyanotoxins degradation was ascribed to the competition with dissolved organic matters and jeong et al 2017 reported that the presence of aromatic molecules could exhibit an inhibitory effect on the removal efficiency of cyanotoxins by kmno4 oxidation hence the decrease of ke of low viability cells could be due to its elevated doc containing more aromatic compounds li et al 2020a found that high viability cells exhibited the pattern of ke ki whereas the changed pattern of ke ki occurred for low viability cells during chlorination unlike chlorination cell viability did not affect the pattern ke ki or ke ki by kmno4 oxidation and the pattern only depended on the initial dosages of oxidant for both high and low viability cells kmno4 1 mg l 1 could continuously decrease extracellular cyanotoxins with slight membrane damage for both high and low viability cells attributed to the same pattern of ke ki table 3 with initial kmno4 concentrations of 2 5 10 and 20 mg l 1 extracellular cyanotoxins increased within 1 h ascribed to the changed pattern of ke ki table 3 however extracellular total cyanotoxins were degraded to below the safety guideline of 1 μg l 1 for high viability cells with a ct value of 96 2718 mg min l 1 whereas a much higher ct 3312 mg min l 1 was required for low viability cells due to the decrease of ke fig 3 table 3 moreover kmno4 of 0 5 mg l 1 continuously degraded extracellular cyanotoxins without membrane damage for both high and low viability cells fig 3 these results suggested that kmno4 could effectively decrease the risk of cyanotoxins for both high and low viability cells with or without membrane damage 4 1 4 mechanism of intracellular cyanotoxin decrease kmno4 1 2 5 10 and 20 mg l 1 induced the loss of membrane integrity and thus the decrease of intracellular cyanotoxins could be ascribed to the fast release of intracellular cyanotoxins figs 2 and 3 furthermore this study employed sytox green molecular weight 509 to determine membrane integrity since the dye could permeate damaged membrane molecular weight of kmno4 158 is less than sytox green suggesting that it could permeate damaged cells to degrade intracellular cyanotoxins consequently the two pathways are important to decrease intracellular cyanotoxins for both high and low viability cells after kmno4 oxidation caused membrane destruction intriguingly kmno4 of 0 5 mg l 1 decreased intracellular cyanotoxins for both high and low viability cells without membrane destruction figs 2 and 3 a similar result was also observed for high viability cells by fan et al 2013a but its mechanism was not well understood ross et al 2019 found that exposure to various levels of salinity resulted in the active release of intracellular cyanotoxins without membrane damage via membrane transporters encoded by mcyh fig 6 shows that mcyh was upregulated of 2 6 3 9 fold for high viability cells whereas there was no significant change 1 fold for low viability cells this suggested that kmno4 could accelerate the secretion of intracellular cyanotoxins via transmembrane transporters for high viability cyanobacteria but this strategy was not adopted by low viability cells compared with high viability cells about 55 of low viability cells had damaged cellular membranes due to physiological injury after cell aging li et al 2020a this indicated that the permeation of kmno4 molecules through damaged cellular membranes may be another pathway to decrease intracellular cyanotoxins by low viability cells 4 1 5 extracellular organic matters eoms removal at present there is an argument concerning eoms removal after kmno4 oxidation to treat cyanobacteria laden waters xie et al 2013 observed an increase of doc without membrane damage attributed to kmno4 reactions with surface mucilage nevertheless other studies have demonstrated that kmno4 could oxidize aoms mw 11 kda to co2 and that the newly formed mno2 could further remove organic matters via physical adsorption wang et al 2013 naceradska et al 2017 in this study kmno4 0 5 and 1 mg l 1 achieved a continuous decrease of doc within 1 h and this was ascribed to three reasons 1 kmno4 oxidized low molecule aoms to co2 2 mno2 adsorption for aoms and 3 minimum release of ioms with slight membrane destruction meanwhile aromatic compounds uv254 continuously decreased in these treatments in agreement with naceradska et al 2017 and laszakovits et al 2020 in contrast with higher dosages of 2 5 10 and 20 mg l 1 doc and uv254 increased for both high and low viability cells within 1 h due to the fast release of ioms after severe membrane destruction figs 2 and 4 however with a sufficient oxidant exposure doc and uv254 eventually decreased for both high and low viability cells since these released ioms could be effectively degraded via kmno4 oxidation in general kmno4 held a strong capacity to decrease eoms aromatic compounds for both high and low viability cells with or without membrane damage 4 2 evaluation of kmno4 as a promising pre oxidant to treat low viability cyanobacteria various dosages of kmno4 as a pre oxidant showed a good performance in enhancing the removal of low viability cells by pacl coagulation and its removal ratio was positively correlated with initial dosages of kmno4 among these pre oxidation treatments low dosages of kmno4 0 5 and 1 mg l 1 could minimize membrane destruction and continuously decrease cyanotoxins and eoms aromatic compounds for low viability cells however it must be noted that residual extracellular cyanotoxins were above the safety guideline of 1 μg l 1 even after a sufficient contact time of 1 2 h which was mainly attributed to initial elevated cyanotoxins and the decrease of ke hence combining with other water treatment processes e g activated carbon adsorption may be necessary to further remove residual extracellular cyanotoxins for low viability cells ho et al 2011 jeong et al 2017 high dosages of kmno4 2 5 10 and 20 mg l 1 induced severe membrane destruction but sufficient oxidant exposure ct 3312 mg min l 1 could degrade extracellular cyanotoxins to below the safety guideline of 1 μg l 1 and achieve the highest removal ratio of eoms aromatic compounds among these treatments notably residual oxidant was another important issue in this treatment since a residual kmno4 of 0 05 mg l 1 or higher will result in a pink taint of drinking water overall drawbacks and advantages of kmno4 as a pre oxidant to treat low viability cyanobacteria should be carefully assessed in practice 5 conclusions although the change in cell viability could affect kmno4 oxidation to treat cyanobacteria to some extent this study suggested that kmno4 could be a promising pre oxidant to treat low viability cyanobacteria the main findings are given below i fast slow fast pattern of kmno4 decay was not changed by cell viability of cyanobacteria ii low viability cyanobacteria were less resistant to kmno4 oxidation than high viability cyanobacteria but low dosages of kmno4 0 5 and 1 mg l 1 could minimize membrane damage for low viability cyanobacteria iii cell viability of cyanobacteria did not change the pattern of cyanotoxins release and degradation ke ki or ke ki and the pattern was only depending on initial dosages of kmno4 for both high and low viability cyanobacteria iv without membrane destruction kmno4 accelerated the secretion of intracellular cyanotoxins via transmembrane transporters for high viability cyanobacteria but this strategy was not adopted by low viability cyanobacteria v kmno4 decreased the risk of extracellular cyanotoxins and eoms aromatic compounds for both high and low viability cyanobacteria with or without membrane destruction vi various dosages of kmno4 as a pre oxidant enhanced the removal of both high and low viability

introduction harmful cyanobacterial blooms are proliferating worldwide in natural freshwaters and a range of cyanobacteria species can produce undesirable metabolites o neil et al 2012 he et al 2016 among these metabolites algal organic matters aoms can be precursor to disinfection by products dbps and increase coagulant demands in drinking water treatment plants dwtps he et al 2016 moreover various cyanotoxins have been reported among which microcystin mc lr is the most studied cyanotoxin it has been shown to be a potent liver tumor promoter posing a high risk to human health merel et al

remove a portion of cyanobacteria and intracellular cyanotoxins but are ineffective for extracellular cyanotoxins chow et al 1999 yap et al 2014 pre oxidation process has been commonly used to enhance

liu et al 2017 chlorine ozone and kmno4 are widely employed as pre oxidants in dwtps previous studies have reported that chlorination and ozonation can easily cause complete cell damage leading to the release of intracellular cyanotoxins and organic matters ioms even at low dosages e g 1 mg l 1 daly et al 2007 ma et al 2012 xie et al 2013 zamyadi et al 2013 fan et al 2013b 2014 wert et al 2014 in contrast cyanobacteria are less sensitive to kmno4 oxidation and thus kmno4 treatments are less likely to result in cell damage and thereby minimize the release of cyanotoxins and ioms xie et al 2013 fan et al 2013a in addition kmno4 can oxidize cyanotoxins and aoms through several reaction pathways including electron exchange hydrogen abstraction and direct donation of oxygen waldemer and tratnyek 2006 rodríguez et al 2007a 2007b huang et al 2008 xie et al 2013 li et al 2014 kim et al 2018 laszakovits et al 2020 during kmno4 oxidation adsorption coprecipitation with newly formed manganese dioxide mno2 can further enhance the removal of cyanobacteria and eoms by post coagulation chen and yeh 2005 xie et al 2013 liu et al 2017 naceradska et al 2017 moreover kmno4 is useful for controlling the formation of dbps tastes and odors in dwtps xie et al 2013 therefore increasing numbers of studies have suggested that kmno4 as a better pre oxidant to treat cyanobacteria laden source waters than chlorine or ozone to optimize the application of kmno4 to treat cyanobacteria laden source waters previous studies have investigated its effects on membrane integrity and associated metabolites e g cyanotoxins eoms removal using high viability cyanobacteria mainly collected from development stage table s1 nonetheless in natural freshwaters cyanobacterial bloom is a successive process including development maintenance and decay stages tang et al 2018 wilhelm et al 2020 cell viability of cyanobacteria declines sharply at decay stage of a successive bloom tang et al 2018 li et al 2020a li et al 2020a found that low viability cyanobacteria were more susceptible to chlorination attributed to its poor cellular surfaces during chlorination cyanotoxins degradation rate of low viability cyanobacteria decreased due to competitive reactions with eoms leading to a high risk of elevated extracellular cyanotoxins li et al 2020a these results demonstrated that chlorination is not a feasible option for treating low viability cyanobacteria li et al 2020a many studies have shown that kmno4 has a variety of advantages to treat cyanobacteria compared to chlorine suggesting that kmno4 may be a promising pre oxidant for low viability cyanobacteria at decay stage of a successive bloom however to our knowledge no studies have investigated the effects of kmno4 on membrane integrity and associated metabolites removal of low viability cyanobacteria whether cell viability of cyanobacteria would affect kmno4 oxidation is also unknown consequently it is strongly essential to compare these effects of kmno4 oxidation on high and low viability cyanobacteria here various dosages of kmno4 were employed to treat high and low viability cyanobacteria oxidant decay membrane integrity loss cyanotoxin fate and eoms removal were investigated then kmno4 assisted coagulation experiments were performed to remove high and low viability cyanobacteria with the aim to evaluate the feasibility of kmno4 as a pre oxidant to treat low viability cyanobacteria at decay stage of a successive bloom 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents microcystis is one of the most pervasive bloom forming cyanobacteria in freshwater ecosystems harke et al 2016 in this study a toxic strain microcystis aeruginosa fachb 915 was employed to conduct kmno4 experiments this strain was cultured in bg11 medium supporting information text 1 at 28 c with a 12 h 12 h light dark cycle under light intensity of 35 μmol m 1 s 1 li et al 2020a potassium permanganate kmno4 stock solution 1 0 g l 1 was standardized by titration with sodium oxalate and kept under darkness at 4 sodium thiosulfate stock solution 4 0 g l 1 was employed to terminate oxidative reactions polyaluminum chloride pacl al2o3 28 basicity 70 75 was prepared as a stock solution with a concentration of 1 0 g l 1 sytox green nucleic acid stain was purchased from thermo fisher scientific usa microcystin standards solarbio china methanol and monopotassium were chromatography grade for cyanotoxin analysis 2 2 a preparation of high and low viability microcystis a successive microcystis bloom was simulated for 120 d in bg 11 medium including development maintenance and decay stages as described by li et al 2020a prior to experiments the same initial cell density of high and low viability cells was set to minimize the effects of cyanobacterial biomass on kmno4 oxidation microcystis samples were collected at 15 d development stage and 100 d decay stage with the same initial cell density of approximately 6 0 106 cells ml 1 and monitored using a flow cytometer fig s1 microcystis cells at 100 d held a much lower photosynthetic activity than at 15 d demonstrating that these samples could well represent high and low viability microcystis li et al 2020a fig s1 high and low viability microcystis were equally diluted with ddh2o to a final cell density of about 1 0 106 cells ml 1 as previous studies have conducted kmno4 experiments to treat high viability microcystis at development stage with an initial cell density of 106 cells ml 1 table s1 adding ddh2o did not affect membrane integrity of cyanobacteria and it did not contain any organic or inorganic matters to affect kmno4 oxidation li et al 2020a 2020b this study employed culture solutions as reaction backgrounds because this culture sollution could better show the effects of varied eoms of high and low viability microcystis on kmno4 oxidation 2 3 kmno4 oxidation to treat high and low viability microcystis high and low viability microcystis were treated with the desired dosages of kmno4 0 5 1 2 5 10 or 20 mg l 1 and mixed with a magnetic stirrer at 200 rpm magnetic stirring did not impair membrane integrity fig s2 during kmno4 oxidation microcystis samples were taken at a contact time of 0 0 2 0 5 1 2 3 4 6 and 8 h at each time interval residual kmno4 was measured to establish oxidant decay curves furthermore each sample of 1 ml was taken for membrane integrity analysis samples of 100 and 10 ml were immediately quenched with na2s2o3 and used for cyanotoxins and eoms analysis respectively control tests were performed using microcystis without adding kmno4 all of these kmno4 experiments were conducted in 5 l glass conical flasks at the same temperature of 20 2 influence of ph on cyanotoxin oxidation by kmno4 was negligible rodríguez et al 2007a kim et al 2018 and previous studies have conducted kmno4 experiments for high viability cells at ph 7 8 table s1 thus high and low viability microcystis samples were adjusted to ph 7 5 0 1 using 0 1 m sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid 2 4 kmno4 assisted coagulation to remove high and low viability microcystis high and low viability microcystis

a two channel fluorometer amiscience usa and removal ratio of microcystis was estimated 2 5 gene expression mcyh of microcystis after kmno4 treatment after kmno4 treatment 0 5 mg l 1 1 h high and low viability microcystis were collected via centrifugation at 6000 g for 5 min supporting information text 1 these samples were employed to quantify expression of abc transporter gene mcyh via rt qpcr analysis since mcyh was responsible for transmembrane transport of intracellular microcystin tillet et al 2000 pearson et al 2004 2 6 analytical methods 2 6 1 measurement of kmno4 concentration a

darkness after adding sytox green nucleic acid stain with a final concentration of 100 nm about 10 000 cells were monitored by fcm and these data were analyzed using flow cytometric analysis software

and significant difference was defined at p 0 05 statistical analyses were performed using origin 8 0 3 results 3 1 kmno4 decay kmno4 concentration remained constant in bg 11 medium suggesting that medium components did not cause kmno4 consumption fig 1 with initial high dosages of 10 and 20 mg l 1 a decay pattern of fast slow fast was observed for both high and low viability cells fig 1 there was no residual kmno4 after 1 8 h with initial low dosages of 0 5 1 or 2 mg l 1 for both high and low viability cells whereas about 1 5 10 1 mg l 1 was present after 8 h with initial dosages of 5 10

fig 2 without kmno4 oxidation there was no membrane destruction of high and low viability cells fig 2 kmno4 of 0 5 mg l 1 did not impair membrane integrity for either high or low viability cells fig 2 initial high dosages of 5 10 and 20 mg l 1 induced complete loss of membrane integrity after a contact time of 2 6 h for high and low viability cells fig 2 moreover kmno4 at a concentration of 2 mg l

membrane integrity of high and low viability cells by kmno4 oxidation rate constants of membrane integrity loss kloss were estimated via pseudo first order kinetics eq 2 below followed ding et al 2010

of high and low viability cells was in a range of 3 31 and 10 50 m 1 s 1 and average kloss of low viability cells was higher than that of high viability cells p 0 05 table 2 besides with the equal initial dosages of kmno4 kloss of low viability cells remained higher than that of high viability cells p 0 05 table 2 3 3 cyanotoxins release and degradation with kmno4 at 0 5 mg l 1 there was a continuous decrease of intracellular and extracellular cyanotoxins without membrane damage for both high and low viability cells p 0 05 fig 3 higher initial kmno4 concentrations of 1 2 5 10 and 20 mg

viability cells p 0 05 fig 3 however a pattern of increase decrease was observed with initial kmno4 of 2 5 10 and 20 mg l 1 fig 3 for high viability cells extracellular cyanotoxins were degraded to

describe the data with equal initial dosages of kmno4 ki 46 57 m 1 s 1 of low viability cells was higher than that of high viability cells 17 41 m 1 s 1 but ke 4 56 m 1 s 1 was lower than that of high

0 5 and 1 mg l 1 p 0 05 fig 4 in contrast with initial dosages of 2 5 10 and 20 mg l 1 an increase decrease pattern was observed fig 4 with a sufficient oxidant exposure doc and uv254 eventually decreased for both high and low viability cells fig 4 notably dosages of 2 5 10 and 20 mg l 1 achieved a higher removal ratio of doc 16 63 and uv254 27 70 than 0 5 and 1 mg l 1 doc 4 18 uv254 14 24 after a contact time of 8 h p 0 05 fig 4 3 5 kmno4 assisted coagulation to remove high and low viability cyanobacteria without kmno4 oxidation removal ratios of high and low viability cells were about

coagulation respectively p 0 05 fig 5 notably removal ratios of low viability cells exhibited a positive correlation with initial dosages of kmno4 but removal ratios of high viability cells were lower with dosages of 2 and 5 mg l 1 than that with dosages of 0 5 1 10 and 20 mg l 1 fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 effects of cell viability of cyanobacteria on kmno4 oxidation 4 1 1 kmno4 decay this study found that oxidant decay rate kdecay of low viability cells was higher than that of high viability cells table 1 kim et al 2018 found that elevated doc could reduce kmno4 exposure and that kmno4 had high reactivity with aromatic molecules in this study low viability cells exhibited higher concentrations of doc and uv254 than high viability cells p 0 05 fig 4 therefore elevated eoms containing more aromatic compounds could induce faster kmno4 consumption for low viability cells than for high viability cells the same as for chlorination li et al 2020a cell viability of cyanobacteria did not affect the pattern of kmno4 decay and initial high dosages of kmno4 10 and 20 mg l 1 exhibited a decay pattern of fast slow fast for both high and low viability cells this result may be ascribed to selective oxidation of aoms by kmno4 since wang et al 2013 and kim et al 2018 reported that kmno4 could effectively oxidize low molecular weight mw aoms into co2 but showed a lower oxidizing capacity with high mw proteins and polysaccharides jeong et al 2017 kim et al 2018 kmno4 molecules 10 and 20 mg l 1 firstly reacted with low mw eoms leading to a fast oxidant decay then the slow decay pattern could be attributed to weaker reaction with high mw polysaccharides and proteins on cellular surface after membrane destruction kmno4 further reacted with the released low mw ioms resulting in a fast oxidant decay 4 1 2 membrane integrity loss cellular surfaces e g mucilage are an important barrier to prevent cyanobacteria from oxidant attack for example li et al 2018 and xu et al 2019 observed that microcystis was more resistant to kmno4 attack than filamentous pseudoanabaena since microcystis had thicker mucilage surrounding cellular surface to form colonies in this study low viability cells exhibited higher rate constants of membrane integrity loss kloss than high viability cells fig 1 table 2 this result demonstrated that low viability cells were more susceptible to kmno4 oxidation than high viability cells the same as for chlorination li et al 2020a in contrast to kmno4 chlorination held a strong capacity to induce complete membrane destruction of low viability cells even with initial low dosage of 1 mg l 1 li et al 2020a however initial kmno4 of 1 mg l 1 only caused slight membrane damage for low viability cells 27 and even it was slightly lower than high viability cells 33 p 0 05 this result seemed to contradict the conclusion low viability cells were less resistant to kmno4 oxidation than high viability cells actually previous studies have noted that membrane destruction mainly depended on oxidant exposure of kmno4 fan et al 2013a 2013b li et al 2014 xu et al 2019 in this treatment actual oxidant exposure of low viability cells 11 mg min l 1 was much lower than that of high viability cells 24 mg min l 1 and this may have efficiently compensated for their low resistance to kmno4 oxidation lower dosage of kmno4 of 0 5 mg l 1 did not disrupt membrane integrity of high or low viability cells mainly due to its low reactivity with cyanobacteria overall although low viability cells were more susceptible to kmno4 attack than high viability cells initial low dosages of kmno4 0 5 and 1 mg l 1 as a pre oxidant could minimize membrane damage to low viability cells 4 1 3 cyanotoxins release and degradation kinetics of cyanotoxins release ki and degradation ke were strongly affected by the changes in cell viability similar to results using chlorination li et al 2020a low viability cells exhibited higher ki in line with kloss tables 2 and 3 besides ke of low viability cells was lower than that of high viability cells table 3 laszakovits and mackay 2019 found that inhibition of cyanotoxins degradation was ascribed to the competition with dissolved organic matters and jeong et al 2017 reported that the presence of aromatic molecules could exhibit an inhibitory effect on the removal efficiency of cyanotoxins by kmno4 oxidation hence the decrease of ke of low viability cells could be due to its elevated doc containing more aromatic compounds li et al 2020a found that high viability cells exhibited the pattern of ke ki whereas the changed pattern of ke ki occurred for low viability cells during chlorination unlike chlorination cell viability did not affect the pattern ke ki or ke ki by kmno4 oxidation and the pattern only depended on the initial dosages of oxidant for both high and low viability cells kmno4 1 mg l 1 could continuously decrease extracellular cyanotoxins with slight membrane damage for both high and low viability cells attributed to the same pattern of ke ki table 3 with initial kmno4 concentrations of 2 5 10 and 20 mg l 1 extracellular cyanotoxins increased within 1 h ascribed to the changed pattern of ke ki table 3 however extracellular total cyanotoxins were degraded to below the safety guideline of 1 μg l 1 for high viability cells with a ct value of 96 2718 mg min l 1 whereas a much higher ct 3312 mg min l 1 was required for low viability cells due to the decrease of ke fig 3 table 3 moreover kmno4 of 0 5 mg l 1 continuously degraded extracellular cyanotoxins without membrane damage for both high and low viability cells fig 3 these results suggested that kmno4 could effectively decrease the risk of cyanotoxins for both high and low viability cells with or without membrane damage 4 1 4 mechanism of intracellular cyanotoxin decrease kmno4 1 2 5 10 and 20 mg l 1 induced the loss of membrane integrity and thus the decrease of intracellular cyanotoxins could be ascribed to the fast release of intracellular cyanotoxins figs 2 and 3 furthermore this study employed sytox green molecular weight 509 to determine membrane integrity since the dye could permeate damaged membrane molecular weight of kmno4 158 is less than sytox green suggesting that it could permeate damaged cells to degrade intracellular cyanotoxins consequently the two pathways are important to decrease intracellular cyanotoxins for both high and low viability cells after kmno4 oxidation caused membrane destruction intriguingly kmno4 of 0 5 mg l 1 decreased intracellular cyanotoxins for both high and low viability cells without membrane destruction figs 2 and 3 a similar result was also observed for high viability cells by fan et al 2013a but its mechanism was not well understood ross et al 2019 found that exposure to various levels of salinity resulted in the active release of intracellular cyanotoxins without membrane damage via membrane transporters encoded by mcyh fig 6 shows that mcyh was upregulated of 2 6 3 9 fold for high viability cells whereas there was no significant change 1 fold for low viability cells this suggested that kmno4 could accelerate the secretion of intracellular cyanotoxins via transmembrane transporters for high viability cyanobacteria but this strategy was not adopted by low viability cells compared with high viability cells about 55 of low viability cells had damaged cellular membranes due to physiological injury after cell aging li et al 2020a this indicated that the permeation of kmno4 molecules through damaged cellular membranes may be another pathway to decrease intracellular cyanotoxins by low viability cells 4 1 5 extracellular organic matters eoms removal at present there is an argument concerning eoms removal after kmno4 oxidation to treat cyanobacteria laden waters xie et al 2013 observed an increase of doc without membrane damage attributed to kmno4 reactions with surface mucilage nevertheless other studies have demonstrated that kmno4 could oxidize aoms mw 11 kda to co2 and that the newly formed mno2 could further remove organic matters via physical adsorption wang et al 2013 naceradska et al 2017 in this study kmno4 0 5 and 1 mg l 1 achieved a continuous decrease of doc within 1 h and this was ascribed to three reasons 1 kmno4 oxidized low molecule aoms to co2 2 mno2 adsorption for aoms and 3 minimum release of ioms with slight membrane destruction meanwhile aromatic compounds uv254 continuously decreased in these treatments in agreement with naceradska et al 2017 and laszakovits et al 2020 in contrast with higher dosages of 2 5 10 and 20 mg l 1 doc and uv254 increased for both high and low viability cells within 1 h due to the fast release of ioms after severe membrane destruction figs 2 and 4 however with a sufficient oxidant exposure doc and uv254 eventually decreased for both high and low viability cells since these released ioms could be effectively degraded via kmno4 oxidation in general kmno4 held a strong capacity to decrease eoms aromatic compounds for both high and low viability cells with or without membrane damage 4 2 evaluation of kmno4 as a promising pre oxidant to treat low viability cyanobacteria various dosages of kmno4 as a pre oxidant showed a good performance in enhancing the removal of low viability cells by pacl coagulation and its removal ratio was positively correlated with initial dosages of kmno4 among these pre oxidation treatments low dosages of kmno4 0 5 and 1 mg l 1 could minimize membrane destruction and continuously decrease cyanotoxins and eoms aromatic compounds for low viability cells however it must be noted that residual extracellular cyanotoxins were above the safety guideline of 1 μg l 1 even after a sufficient contact time of 1 2 h which was mainly attributed to initial elevated cyanotoxins and the decrease of ke hence combining with other water treatment processes e g activated carbon adsorption may be necessary to further remove residual extracellular cyanotoxins for low viability cells ho et al 2011 jeong et al 2017 high dosages of kmno4 2 5 10 and 20 mg l 1 induced severe membrane destruction but sufficient oxidant exposure ct 3312 mg min l 1 could degrade extracellular cyanotoxins to below the safety guideline of 1 μg l 1 and achieve the highest removal ratio of eoms aromatic compounds among these treatments notably residual oxidant was another important issue in this treatment since a residual kmno4 of 0 05 mg l 1 or higher will result in a pink taint of drinking water overall drawbacks and advantages of kmno4 as a pre oxidant to treat low viability cyanobacteria should be carefully assessed in practice 5 conclusions although the change in cell viability could affect kmno4 oxidation to treat cyanobacteria to some extent this study suggested that kmno4 could be a promising pre oxidant to treat low viability cyanobacteria the main findings are given below i fast slow fast pattern of kmno4 decay was not changed by cell viability of cyanobacteria ii low viability cyanobacteria were less resistant to kmno4 oxidation than high viability cyanobacteria but low dosages of kmno4 0 5 and 1 mg l 1 could minimize membrane damage for low viability cyanobacteria iii cell viability of cyanobacteria did not change the pattern of cyanotoxins release and degradation ke ki or ke ki and the pattern was only depending on initial dosages of kmno4 for both high and low viability cyanobacteria iv without membrane destruction kmno4 accelerated the secretion of intracellular cyanotoxins via transmembrane transporters for high viability cyanobacteria but this strategy was not adopted by low viability cyanobacteria v kmno4 decreased the risk of extracellular cyanotoxins and eoms aromatic compounds for both high and low viability cyanobacteria with or without membrane destruction vi various dosages of kmno4 as a pre oxidant enhanced the removal of both high and low viability

16769,granular biofilms are dense spherical complex biological systems composed mainly of multi microbial cells water and extracellular polymeric substances eps they facilitate efficient purification and settling of activated sludge in wastewater treatment processes the viscoelastic properties of these complex biofilm systems are important characteristics that control their growth and dictate how they respond to hydrodynamic forces and chemical stimuli however the viscoelastic properties of granular biofilms are poorly understood in this paper we study granular biofilms viscoelastic properties using optical coherence elastography oce a nondestructive method that integrates optical coherence tomography oct with elastic wave propagation while quantitative viscoelastic characterization of granular biofilms is challenging due to their heterogeneous properties we show that elastic waves are suitable for this purpose first we employ guided elastic waves in a thin section of a granular biofilm to reveal a two layered profile for the viscoelastic properties next we utilize circumferential elastic waves that propagate near the surface of a non sectioned spherical biofilm to quantify the layered system s viscoelastic properties to the best of our knowledge this work is the first quantitative study that characterizes the layered viscoelastic properties of granular biofilms the measurement approach may provide a platform to study the interplay between the viscoelastic properties and other characteristics of granular biofilms such as the complex microbial system morphology and oxygen distribution graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords granular biofilms optical coherence elastography nondestructive viscoelastic characterization mechanics of granular biofilms 1 introduction granular biofilms are microbial aggregates composed of multispecies bacterial communities and extracellular polymeric substances eps compared to conventional biofilms that colonize surfaces granular biofilms aggregate and grow without surface attachment ding et al 2015 liu et al 2009 liu and tay 2002 milferstedt et al 2017 granular biofilms have a sphere like geometry and are recognized by different names in the literature including granular sludge nancharaiah and kiran kumar reddy 2018 wang et al 2016 granules liu et al 2009 sarma et al 2017 or biogranules liu et al 2004 milferstedt et al 2017 over the past decade aerobic granular biofilms in sludge bioprocesses have attracted increasing interest because their operational efficiency outperforms the widely used flocculent activated sludge in wastewater processing applications for removing unwanted components carbon nitrogen phosphorous organic pollutants etc layer et al 2019 milferstedt et al 2017 sarma et al 2017 wagner et al 2015 granular biofilms facilitate the operational efficiency in wastewater recovery due to their process intensification decreasing process footprint and or increasing loading rate to the process optimal energy use and overall cost liu et al 2009 liu and tay 2002 milferstedt et al 2017 pronk et al 2015 sarma et al 2017 successful and sustainable implementation of granular biofilm reactors depends on the ability to predictably control biofilm growth of which their mechanical properties are of crucial importance derlon et al 2016 liu and tay 2002 nancharaiah and kiran kumar reddy 2018 sarma et al 2017 mechanical properties of granular biofilms are relevant to biofilm reactors because they control biofilms structural stability and propensity for detachment and in turn influence the retention of key microbial populations the competition in biofilms and the system functions aravas and laspidou 2008 derlon et al 2013 elenter et al 2007 flemming and wingender 2010 lackner et al 2009 morgenroth and wilderer 2000 rittmann and laspidou 2003 stoodley et al 2002 wells et al 2014 the physical robustness of granular biofilms is largely attributed to the eps which plays a prominent role in providing cohesiveness for granulation flemming et al 2016 ras et al 2013 seviour et al 2019 zhu et al 2012 researchers found that eps shares similar viscoelastic behavior with hydrogels for example eps and hydrogels behave as solids under small deformations and as liquids when subjected to large deformations lin and wang 2017 ma et al 2014 seviour et al 2009 wang et al 2016 in the small deformation regime where elastic changes to the shape or volume of the eps or hydrogel are less than 0 1 with respect to their equilibrium configurations the force displacement relationship of the materials follows the linear hooke s law since hydrogels gelation results from cross linking of polymer molecules and the linking density controls the viscoelastic properties dash et al 2013 seidel et al 2001 seviour et al 2009 it is conceivable that eps viscoelastic properties may control the granulation of biofilms therefore studying the viscoelasticity of granular biofilms may provide a more in depth understanding of granulation processes and enhance the operational efficiency of granular biofilm reactors when it comes to viscoelastic characterization rheometery is a common and versatile technique for such a purpose lin and wang 2017 ma et al 2014 wang et al 2016 however in our previous work liou et al 2019a we reviewed several limitations of rheometery for granular biofilm characterization and proposed optical coherence elastography oce technique as a suitable alternative the oce technique relies on the measurement of propagating elastic waves in a sample and the conversion from the wave speed to the viscoelastic properties by inverse modeling we have validated the application of oce technique on viscoelastic characterization of soft materials in our previous papers liou et al 2019a b when employing this technique one thing to take note of is the depth it can probe which is limited by the penetration depth of the oce light source and that of the elastic wave the former is generally less than 3 mm and the latter is in the millimeter range as circumferential waves are preferentially excited at frequencies in the khz range nevertheless since the length scale of granular biofilms also falls within the millimeter range the limitations mentioned above are not a concern when implementing oce measurements on them specifically this work attempts to profile the layered viscoelastic properties of granular biofilms using the oce technique the motivation for this study stems from the hypothesis that the mechanical properties of granular biofilms may vary with position due to the gradient of the oxygen concentration that may stratify the biofilm into regions with living and dead bacterial cells or form a spatial gradient of the cell population ding et al 2015 liu et al 2009 nancharaiah and kiran kumar reddy 2018 sarma et al 2017 we first probe the spatial variation of the elastic wave speed in a sectioned granular biofilm to establish the viscoelastic properties potential layering next we approximate the non sectioned granular biofilm as a two layered sphere with different layer properties and quantify the layers viscoelastic properties based on oce measurements combined with the visco elastodynamic modeling for a layered structure our measurements suggest that both the shear modulus and viscosity of the granular biofilm are smaller close to the core compared to the surface confirming the hypothesis that the viscoelastic properties are layered one possible explanation for the core having a lower shear modulus and viscosity may be the higher biomass i e bacterial cells concentration this assumption is verified on artificial granular biofilms where the shear modulus and viscosity are higher in pure alginate hydrogel spheres low biomass and lower in alginate spheres filled with activated sludge high biomass to the best of our knowledge this work is the first quantitative study that reveals the layered viscoelastic properties of granular biofilms the measurement approach and our findings reported in this paper may lay the foundation for future correlation studies of the structure composition and viscoelastic properties of granular biofilms 2 materials and methods 2 1 artificial graded agarose gel phantom the layered agarose sample was created by pouring heated agarose solution in a plastic mold with the following order 1 5 1 25 and 1 0 w v of agarose concentrations the solutions were prepared using the protocol detailed in our previous study s supplementary information liou et al 2019b the boiled solution 1 5 for the first layer was poured into the mold and left to stand at ambient temperature 22 c for 20 min to cool down and solidify the second layer solution 1 25 was then poured on top of the first layer right after it was boiled in the microwave oven the solution s temperature was still over 90 c so it formed a strong bond with the first layer at the interface as it cooled after waiting for another 20 min for the second layer to cool and solidify at ambient temperature the third layer was added by repeating the same procedure for the second layer note that the interfaces observed in fig 2a are not perpendicular to the sample surface due to the surface tension between the agarose solution and the mold wall these angled interfaces create a gradual property change along the elastic waves propagation path which is a good approximation of the property variation in real biofilms 2 2 natural granular biofilms the granular biofilm tested in this paper was obtained from a full scale aerobic granular sludge ags reactor aqua aerobic systems inc rockford il usa in section 3 2 2 the granular biofilm was cut to have a sectioned sample whose thickness is approximately 1 mm in section 3 2 3 2 the whole sphere like granular biofilm was tested 2 3 artificial granular biofilms two kinds of artificial granular biofilms were made 1 pure alginate hydrogel spheres and 2 alginate spheres filled with activated sludge we followed the same protocol in our previous paper liou et al 2019a to prepare the alginate solution with 1 2 w v of concentration for both kinds the extra step to prepare the second kind of samples was adding 5 ml of concentrated activated sludge in the 45 ml of 1 2 w v alginate solution the activated sludge was obtained from the terrance j o brien wastewater treatment plant skokie il usa with the concentrations of total solids ts total suspended solids tss and total dissolved solids tds been 963 5 355 5 and 608 mg l respectively were determined following standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater published by american public health association apha 1992 the 5 ml activated sludge was concentrated from 10 ml by centrifuging at 10 000 rpm for 5 min leading to the final solids concentration of 192 8 mg l note that artificial granular biofilms are also referred as artificial biogranules in this paper 3 results and discussion 3 1 numerical simulation a numerical model was developed to predict the wave speeds of circumferential elastic waves in a layered spherical structure the model was also used for inverse analysis of oce measurements of the elastic wave speeds in the granular biofilm samples from which the viscoelastic properties were determined fig 1 a shows the configuration of the layered model the model consists of an inner core with the radius r a an outer layer between r a and r b and an inviscid water halfspace beyond r b the water halfspace represents the native aqueous environment surrounding the biofilm each layer in the model is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic the elastic waves generated in this structure include bulk waves longitudinal and shear waves and circumferential interface waves the bulk waves travel within the sample and reflect from or transmit through boundaries the circumferential waves on the other hand are bound to the curved surface and their penetration depth into the sample depends on the wavelength or equivalently the frequency the wave speeds of circumferential waves can be derived from the superposition of the bulk waves based on the model setup illustrated in fig 1a the arrows in fig 1a represent the partial bulk waves l for longitudinal s for shear traveling outward or inward and only the longitudinal wave is supported in the surrounding water halfspace since it is assumed inviscid cannot support shear motions the water halfspace perturbs the propagation of circumferential waves at the sphere water interface by loading the sphere surface and providing a dissipation channel for the elastic wave energy we remark that the circumferential elastic waves supported on the surface of a homogeneous and isotropic sphere are toroidal jiangong et al 2007 towfighi and kundu 2003 in the special case where the toroidal wave is monitored along the meridian that is normal to the wavefront its propagation can be approximated by the circumferential wave traveling on the cylindrical surface with the same curvature as the meridian which simplifies the sphere model down to a cylindrical geometry details of the numerical model for a homogenous and isotropic viscoelastic cylinder were published in our recent article liou et al 2019a the numerical model from that paper was extended to a two layered viscoelastic cylinder in this work the modeling is formulated by the following steps 1 composing the governing elastodynamic equations using the potential functions associated with partial bulk waves 2 expressing the components of the displacements and stress fields by the unknown amplitudes and acoustic phases of the partial waves 3 applying boundary conditions to obtain characteristic equations and 4 numerically solving the characteristic equations for the dispersion relation liou et al 2019a 2019b liu and qu 1998 lowe 1995 rose 1999 while the details of the governing equations boundary conductions and dispersion relation are provided in the supporting information here we remark that the viscoelastic behavior of the biofilm is accounted for by assuming that the shear constitutive relation follows the kevin voigt model as follows 1 μ a ω μ a i η μ a ω 2 μ b ω μ b i η μ b ω where μ is the complex shear modulus μ is the shear modulus for a purely elastic material ημ is the shear viscosity ω is the angular frequency and the superscripts a and b represent the inner core and the outer layer respectively the longitudinal wave speeds α l shear wave speeds α s are defined in terms of the material density ρ and the complex first and second lamé constants λ and μ as follows 3 α l a λ 2 μ a ρ α s a μ a ρ α l b λ 2 μ b ρ α s b μ b ρ for circumferential waves traveling in the two layered cylindrical model three important factors need to be considered 1 the radius of curvature 2 the ratio of the radii of the two layers and 3 the contrast of complex lamé constants and shear moduli i e material properties between the two layers since we have discussed the influence of the radius of curvature on the speed of circumferential waves in our recent publication liou et al 2019a here we focus on factors 2 and 3 to investigate how the radius ratio and the property contrast of the two layers affect the frequency dependent speed of the circumferential wave in the following investigations the material properties used for the two layers are density ρ 1000 kg m3 longitudinal wave speeds α l a α l b 1480 m s and shear wave speeds α s a 1 m s α s b 2 m s the density and longitudinal wave speed are chosen to be the same as water due to biofilms high water content note that the numerical calculations in this section are restricted to pure elastic deformation with no viscous damping so the complex wave speeds only have the real parts in this case the symbol α may be replaced by c to follow the conventional denotation for wave speeds fig 1b shows seven dispersion curves and each represents the lowest order circumferential wave calculated with the numerical model for a fixed outer radius b 2 mm fixed material properties for both layers and different inner core radii a all the curves show similar trends the circumferential wave speed is higher at low frequencies and decreases monotonically as the frequency increases the topmost and bottommost dispersion curves correspond to extreme cases of a single homogeneous composition with merely the outer layer s material properties or the inner core s respectively the top four dispersion curves i e for a 1 mm converge to the same curve at high frequencies since the penetration depth of the circumferential wave approximately equals to one wavelength liou et al 2019a becomes smaller than the thickness of the outer layer i e b a for example at 3000 hz the top four curves wave speed converges to 2 68 m s corresponding to a wavelength penetration depth of 0 89 mm at 3000 hz and higher frequencies the penetration depth is smaller than b a thus the circumferential wave has limited interaction with the inner core and the wave speed depends only on α s b in summary the distribution of the seven dispersion curves from top to down show that the wave speed is sensitive to the material fraction occupied by the inner core as indicated by factor 2 listed above next we compare dispersion curves obtained from three different shear wave speeds of the inner core α s a 1 m s 2 m s and 4 m s in fig 1c the following properties a 1 mm b 2 mm and α s b 2 m s are fixed in the calculations the three curves converge to the same curve close to 3000 hz where the circumferential wave s penetration depth is smaller than the outer layer thickness b a however below 3000 hz the wave speed changes appreciably with frequency for α s a 4 m s these numerical results show that the circumferential wave speed is sensitive only to the bulk shear wave speed of the outer layer at higher frequencies where the penetration depth is less than the thickness at lower frequencies where the penetration depth is longer than the outer layer s thickness the wave speed depends on the bulk shear wave speeds of both layers 3 2 experimental measurements 3 2 1 spatial profiling of viscoelastic properties this section and the following one are to test the hypothesis that granular biofilms have layered viscoelastic properties a new measurement approach was developed to probe the spatial dependence of the elastic wave speed in graded and heterogeneous samples we first evaluated the measurement approach in a model sample made from agarose gel with distinct boundaries that separate three regions laterally of graded agarose concentrations 1 1 25 and 1 5 w v see materials section next in the following section the measurement approach was applied to a sectioned thin plate like granular biofilm the structural optical coherence tomography oct oce and acoustic b scan images of the agarose sample are shown in fig 2 a the middle layer in the oct image is 2 mm wide and the widths of the other two layers are over 10 mm the thickness and the height of the sample are 30 mm and 10 mm in the out of plane direction y direction and the vertical direction z direction respectively the oce image shows the full field dynamic response of the sample induced by a 2100 hz harmonic elastic wave the elastic wave was actuated by a thin knife edge that periodically impacted the sample surface the knife edge was connected to a piezoelectric transducer driven at 2100 hz and was placed parallel to the y direction to serve as a line source of the wave the color contour in the oce image represents the local vertical displacement in the sample and the working principles of the oct microscope to record such kind of images is detailed as follows the oct microscope is basically an interferometer that is sensitive to the dynamic vertical displacement in the field of view and thus is suitable for visualizing the shear dominated harmonic elastic waves in the soft materials liou et al 2019a the red and blue fringes in the oce image correspond to the optical phase difference δϕ red for positive blue for negative measured by the oct interferometer which is related to the local vertical displacement uz through the relationship δϕ 4πnδuz λ 0 where n is the refractive index in the sample λ 0 is the center wavelength of the oct light source and δuz is the displacement increment within a small time delay δt therefore the fringe color is eventually related to the polarity of the displacement red for upward blue for downward note that δϕ varies from π to π radian while fig 2b was plotted with saturation limits at π 2 and π 2 radian to enhance the color contrast when large displacement amplitudes occur causing the δϕ to go over the π π limit the phase wrapping phenomenon arises and results in sign flipping of δϕ from blue to red or from red to blue in the center of a fringe since the displacement amplitudes are larger in the region close to the source top left in the figure the phase wrapping is more prominent for x 4 mm while it is absent for x 4 mm in total 21 oce images were recorded at different trigger delays t from t 0 to 0 5 ms from each oce image the waveform of the elastic wave was extracted along the wave path indicated by the white dashed line in fig 2b the waveforms from different trigger delays were stacked row by row to create an acoustic b scan fig 2c and the local wave speed was estimated from the local slope of the tilted color contour in fig 2c as marked by the white dots in the figure the resulting wave speed profile is shown in fig 2d the two blue vertical dashed lines in fig 2d indicate the locations of the interfaces in the oct image that separate the regions of different agarose concentrations as expected the local wave speed increases with the agarose concentration from left to right and clear turns of the speed at x 3 mm and 5 mm coincide with the interfaces where the agarose concentration changes furthermore a 75 raise in speed is observed when comparing the rightmost to the leftmost regions the resolution of this measurement approach was evaluated by finite element modeling and found to be approximately half of the elastic wavelength see supporting information for more details in addition an animation that loops the 21 oce images and shows the harmonic wave propagation is also available in supporting information 3 2 2 sectioned granular biofilm in this section the local elastic wave speed profile in a thin slice 1 mm thick of a granular biofilm was measured fig 3 shows normal microscope oct oce and acoustic b scan images of the sample the central portion in the optical image fig 3a appears darker than other areas in the sample and the radius of the dark portion is estimated qualitatively as the separation between the two vertical dashed lines this radius of the inner core dark region is approximately 50 of the whole sample although the optical image shows the light dark contrast such layering distinction is not seen in the structural oct image fig 3b since the gray scale intensity in the oct image corresponds to the refractive index variation in the sample we may conclude that the granular biofilm layering distinguished by the light dark color contrast does not lead to a resolvable refractive index variation corresponding to an extreme property difference the oce image in fig 3c shows the elastic wave s displacement distribution for an excitation frequency at 3200 hz the wave was probed along the red arrow in fig 3a since the sample slice was obtained at the equator of the biofilm sphere we can assume that the property variation along the thickness is negligible and changes of the local wave speed can all be attributed to the property variation along the lateral direction 25 oce images were recorded at different trigger delays ranging from 0 to 0 3 ms see supporting information for the animated video clip the displacement distributions extracted along the wave path white dashed line in fig 3c at all trigger delays were stacked together to produce the acoustic b scan shown in fig 3d in fig 3d the signal to noise ratio of the oce measurement deteriorates dramatically beyond x 3 mm due to the attenuation of the elastic waves along the propagation path the white dots in this figure mark the movement of the elastic wave with respect to time from which the local wave speed profile fig 3e was estimated fig 3e shows that the wave speed changes intensely along the propagation path suggesting strong heterogeneity of the sample in terms of elastic properties it is essential to point out that the wave speed s local variation is not due to artifacts from the oct interferometer since the oct image is virtually featureless also during the experiment the transducer had no translation and the sample was stationary so the concern of motion artifacts stemming from the translation of the transducer or the sample can be dismissed the dashed lines in fig 3e are at the same locations of those in fig 3a which indicate the center and the boundary of the sample s dark region the wave speed profile appears to be symmetric with respect to the second dashed line center of the biofilm sphere and the local minima occur closely at both dashed lines as the first line marks the dark region boundary the most important information obtained in this testing is the elastic property distinction between the light region outer layer and the dark region inner core the averaged elastic wave speed of the latter is 76 of the former 3 5 m s to 4 57 m s one potential origin of the difference of the elastic wave speeds in both layers may be the spatially varying biomass i e bacterial cells concentration in the sample ding et al 2015 liu et al 2009 sarma et al 2017 this assumption will be verified on artificial biogranule spheres with different biomass concentrations in the following section 3 2 3 viscoelastic characterization of granular biofilms by circumferential waves 3 2 3 1 artificial granular biofilms to verify the assumption stated in the previous section that a higher concentration of biomass leads to a slower elastic wave speed we tested artificial granular biofilms made from alginate spheres with primary settling effluent sourced from a wastewater treatment plant and compared them to the pure alginate spheres which serve as control samples the alginate material was chosen to mimic the viscoelastic properties of the eps while the primary settling effluent is a source of suspended bacteria cells the properties of the effluent are discussed in the materials section we characterized the viscoelastic properties of the artificial granular biofilms based on oce measurements of the circumferential wave speed in the samples this measurement approach was adopted to avoid sectioning the samples the details of the approach to quantify viscoelastic properties of pure alginate spheres can be found in a recent publication from our group liou et al 2019a fig 4 a and 4b show the oct and oce images of the alginate sphere with distributed biomass the sample was submerged in water to mimic the native aqueous environment of real granular biofilms the white speckles in the oct image are the biomass aggregates the oce image shows the displacement pattern of a 1600 hz harmonic circumferential wave the white line indicates the path where the circumferential wave s displacement distribution was extracted to estimate the wavelength and the wave speed the measurement was repeated at different frequencies to determine the frequency dependent wave speeds as marked by the hollowed circles for the control sample and solid dots for alginate with biomass in fig 4c the solid lines in fig 4c are the best fits for the experimentally measured speeds obtained from theoretical calculations note that the theoretical calculations assumed that the samples have only one uniform composition with effective properties the control sample s wave speed measurements agree well with our previous report liou et al 2019a demonstrating the reliability of the sample fabrication and the repeatability of the wave speed measurement the frequency dependent wave speed for the control sample and artificial biogranule share similar trends the wave speed curves have local minima between 1500 and 2500 hz depending on the sample composition the clear two group separation between the control sample and the alginate spheres with biomass indicates the distinct property difference shear modulus and complex viscosity between these two kinds of samples the artificial biogranules have distinctly lower wave speeds compared to the control sample the small variability of the wave speeds for the artificial biogranules is due to slight differences in their radii the radii of the control sample and the biogranules are listed in table 1 we estimated the radii by curve fitting samples surfaces visualized in the structural oct images the input viscoelastic properties and bulk shear wave speeds to achieve the best fits for the samples are also listed in table 1 the results suggest that the presence of biomass in the alginate spheres lowers the shear modulus and viscosity of the samples the shear modulus of the artificial biogranules is approximately 45 lower than the control and the viscosities decrease by 46 as shown in fig 4d one fortuitous outcome of the measurements is that the ratio of the bulk shear wave speeds the artificial biogranules to the control sample is 74 3 close to the ratio obtained from the spatial wave speed profiling on the biofilm slice in section 3 2 2 based on these observations we may confirm the assumption that the local wave speed changes observed in the sectioned biogranule may be attributed to the variation of local biomass concentrations 3 2 3 2 natural granular biofilm finally the layered viscoelastic properties of the natural granular biofilm were examined by measuring the speed of circumferential waves in the sample the granular biofilm was obtained from an aerobic granular sludge reactor at a wastewater treatment facility see materials section for more details the structural oct image of the granular biofilm are shown in fig 5 a the sample was submerged in a native aqueous solution from the aerobic granular sludge reactor to maintain the biofilm s natural environment the oct light source s penetration depth into the sample is less than 1 mm but it is sufficient to resolve the circular outline of the biofilm surface the radius of the sample is approximately 2 3 mm the floating speckles near the biofilm surface are filaments the oct image of the biofilm does not reveal distinct structural features that may indicate the stratification or heterogeneity of the sample structural properties rather the morphology of the sample is uniform over the penetration depth of the oct light source the oce image in fig 5b shows the displacement pattern of a 3400 hz harmonic circumferential wave along the biofilm surface the apparent penetration depth of the displacement profile is limited by the shallow imaging depth of the oct microscope from the oce image we extracted the wavelength 1 62 mm of the displacement pattern along the wave propagation path indicated by the white dashed line in the figure the product of the frequency 3400 hz and the wavelength 1 62 mm yields the wave speed 5 5 m s the measured speeds of the circumferential wave at frequencies from 2600 to 5600 hz are shown by circular dots in fig 5c the wave speed of the sample is larger than the artificial biogranule as such longer wavelengths of the displacement pattern were recorded in the sample for the same frequencies the green curve in fig 5c is the best fit of the measured wave speeds obtained from the theoretical calculation note that for the calculation as stated in the numerical simulation section the granular biofilm were modeled as a two layered sphere for which the radius of the inner core is half of the outer radius furthermore the ratio of bulk shear wave speeds the inner core to the outer layer was assumed to be 76 following the result of wave speed profiling from the sectioned biofilm section 3 2 2 also given the artificial biogranules closely mimicked this 76 ratio of bulk shear wave speeds we assumed that the viscosity ratio of the artificial biogranules 53 the alginate spheres with biomass to the pure alginate sphere is representative of the ratio between the inner core and the outer layer and this ratio was used as one of the inputs for the theoretical calculation the shear wave speed and viscosity used to obtain the best fit are listed in table 2 we remark that only two fitting parameters c s b and η s b were used in the theoretical model from the best fit properties we determined the shear moduli of the outer layer and the inner core to be 8 41 kpa and 4 84 kpa and their shear viscosities are 0 37 pa s and 0 20 pa s the shear moduli are within the range of biofilm mechanical properties previously reported in the literature peterson et al 2015 4 conclusions in this paper we studied the layered viscoelastic properties of granular biofilms based on the elastic wave speed measurements measurements on a thin slice of a granular biofilm from an aerobic granular sludge reactor show significant spatial variation in the speed of shear dominated guided elastic waves the central region of the sample has a lower wave speed compared to other parts we hypothesized that the spatial variation of the wave speed stems from the biomass s non uniform distribution in the granular biofilm resulting from the gradient in the sample s oxygen concentration to support this claim we fabricated artificial biogranules by containing primary effluent in alginate spheres to mimic the core of the granular biofilm while the pure alginate sample was selected to mimic the outer layer the hypothesis is supported by our experimental observations that the viscoelastic properties of the artificial biogranules are at least 45 lower than the pure alginate sphere confirming that biomass concentration can control granular biofilms viscoelastic properties inspired by all findings above we assumed that the non sectioned natural granular biofilms can be modeled as two layered spheres leading to an inner core and an outer layer with different viscoelastic properties we then developed a layered circumferential wave model to characterize the viscoelastic properties of the granular biofims based on the oce measurements of the frequency dependent circumferential wave speed and inverse analysis the shear modulus and viscosity of the granular biofilms estimated by this approach fall within the range of reported values for biofilms here we highlight two crucial points from this study first oce measurement of circumferential elastic waves is a powerful tool to nondestructively characterize the viscoelasticity of biofilms with curved geometry the circumferential waves are confined to the surface of the sample and are sensitive to the surface curvature and the viscoelastic properties their wavelength dependent penetration depths potentially allow for sampling the variation of viscoelastic properties in soft materials like biofilms along the depth second we quantified the spatial gradient of the viscoelastic properties in a natural granular biofilm which not only is the first of its kind report in this subject but also supports the findings presented in the literature that granular biofilms are stratified into layers ongoing measurements on a statistically relevant size of granular biofilms in authors laboratory will provide deeper insight into how consistent the heterogeneity profile is in terms of viscoelastic properties across samples we will also explore local wave speed profiling with shorter wavelengths to increase the spatial resolution of the mechanical property mapping which may lead to a more precise depiction of the layered structure in granular biofilms this paper lays the fundation for further studies regarding the relationships between growth conditions morphology and material properties of granular biofilms by gaining more insights about the interplay between these factors we hope to enhance the control of granular biofilms granulation processes and ultimately facilitate their applications in wastewater treatment reactors finally we remark that the measurement approach oce measurements of elastic waves presented in this work is applicable not only in the biofilm field but also holds promising potential in other contexts such as biological tissues or biomedical treatments where the viscoelastic properties of soft materials with layered structures or complex geometries are of great interest supporting information details about 1 the visco

16769,granular biofilms are dense spherical complex biological systems composed mainly of multi microbial cells water and extracellular polymeric substances eps they facilitate efficient purification and settling of activated sludge in wastewater treatment processes the viscoelastic properties of these complex biofilm systems are important characteristics that control their growth and dictate how they respond to hydrodynamic forces and chemical stimuli however the viscoelastic properties of granular biofilms are poorly understood in this paper we study granular biofilms viscoelastic properties using optical coherence elastography oce a nondestructive method that integrates optical coherence tomography oct with elastic wave propagation while quantitative viscoelastic characterization of granular biofilms is challenging due to their heterogeneous properties we show that elastic waves are suitable for this purpose first we employ guided elastic waves in a thin section of a granular biofilm to reveal a two layered profile for the viscoelastic properties next we utilize circumferential elastic waves that propagate near the surface of a non sectioned spherical biofilm to quantify the layered system s viscoelastic properties to the best of our knowledge this work is the first quantitative study that characterizes the layered viscoelastic properties of granular biofilms the measurement approach may provide a platform to study the interplay between the viscoelastic properties and other characteristics of granular biofilms such as the complex microbial system morphology and oxygen distribution graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords granular biofilms optical coherence elastography nondestructive viscoelastic characterization mechanics of granular biofilms 1 introduction granular biofilms are microbial aggregates composed of multispecies bacterial communities and extracellular polymeric substances eps compared to conventional biofilms that colonize surfaces granular biofilms aggregate and grow without surface attachment ding et al 2015 liu et al 2009 liu and tay 2002 milferstedt et al 2017 granular biofilms have a sphere like geometry and are recognized by different names in the literature including granular sludge nancharaiah and kiran kumar reddy 2018 wang et al 2016 granules liu et al 2009 sarma et al 2017 or biogranules liu et al 2004 milferstedt et al 2017 over the past decade aerobic granular biofilms in sludge bioprocesses have attracted increasing interest because their operational efficiency outperforms the widely used flocculent activated sludge in wastewater processing applications for removing unwanted components carbon nitrogen phosphorous organic pollutants etc layer et al 2019 milferstedt et al 2017 sarma et al 2017 wagner et al 2015 granular biofilms facilitate the operational efficiency in wastewater recovery due to their process intensification decreasing process footprint and or increasing loading rate to the process optimal energy use and overall cost liu et al 2009 liu and tay 2002 milferstedt et al 2017 pronk et al 2015 sarma et al 2017 successful and sustainable implementation of granular biofilm reactors depends on the ability to predictably control biofilm growth of which their mechanical properties are of crucial importance derlon et al 2016 liu and tay 2002 nancharaiah and kiran kumar reddy 2018 sarma et al 2017 mechanical properties of granular biofilms are relevant to biofilm reactors because they control biofilms structural stability and propensity for detachment and in turn influence the retention of key microbial populations the competition in biofilms and the system functions aravas and laspidou 2008 derlon et al 2013 elenter et al 2007 flemming and wingender 2010 lackner et al 2009 morgenroth and wilderer 2000 rittmann and laspidou 2003 stoodley et al 2002 wells et al 2014 the physical robustness of granular biofilms is largely attributed to the eps which plays a prominent role in providing cohesiveness for granulation flemming et al 2016 ras et al 2013 seviour et al 2019 zhu et al 2012 researchers found that eps shares similar viscoelastic behavior with hydrogels for example eps and hydrogels behave as solids under small deformations and as liquids when subjected to large deformations lin and wang 2017 ma et al 2014 seviour et al 2009 wang et al 2016 in the small deformation regime where elastic changes to the shape or volume of the eps or hydrogel are less than 0 1 with respect to their equilibrium configurations the force displacement relationship of the materials follows the linear hooke s law since hydrogels gelation results from cross linking of polymer molecules and the linking density controls the viscoelastic properties dash et al 2013 seidel et al 2001 seviour et al 2009 it is conceivable that eps viscoelastic properties may control the granulation of biofilms therefore studying the viscoelasticity of granular biofilms may provide a more in depth understanding of granulation processes and enhance the operational efficiency of granular biofilm reactors when it comes to viscoelastic characterization rheometery is a common and versatile technique for such a purpose lin and wang 2017 ma et al 2014 wang et al 2016 however in our previous work liou et al 2019a we reviewed several limitations of rheometery for granular biofilm characterization and proposed optical coherence elastography oce technique as a suitable alternative the oce technique relies on the measurement of propagating elastic waves in a sample and the conversion from the wave speed to the viscoelastic properties by inverse modeling we have validated the application of oce technique on viscoelastic characterization of soft materials in our previous papers liou et al 2019a b when employing this technique one thing to take note of is the depth it can probe which is limited by the penetration depth of the oce light source and that of the elastic wave the former is generally less than 3 mm and the latter is in the millimeter range as circumferential waves are preferentially excited at frequencies in the khz range nevertheless since the length scale of granular biofilms also falls within the millimeter range the limitations mentioned above are not a concern when implementing oce measurements on them specifically this work attempts to profile the layered viscoelastic properties of granular biofilms using the oce technique the motivation for this study stems from the hypothesis that the mechanical properties of granular biofilms may vary with position due to the gradient of the oxygen concentration that may stratify the biofilm into regions with living and dead bacterial cells or form a spatial gradient of the cell population ding et al 2015 liu et al 2009 nancharaiah and kiran kumar reddy 2018 sarma et al 2017 we first probe the spatial variation of the elastic wave speed in a sectioned granular biofilm to establish the viscoelastic properties potential layering next we approximate the non sectioned granular biofilm as a two layered sphere with different layer properties and quantify the layers viscoelastic properties based on oce measurements combined with the visco elastodynamic modeling for a layered structure our measurements suggest that both the shear modulus and viscosity of the granular biofilm are smaller close to the core compared to the surface confirming the hypothesis that the viscoelastic properties are layered one possible explanation for the core having a lower shear modulus and viscosity may be the higher biomass i e bacterial cells concentration this assumption is verified on artificial granular biofilms where the shear modulus and viscosity are higher in pure alginate hydrogel spheres low biomass and lower in alginate spheres filled with activated sludge high biomass to the best of our knowledge this work is the first quantitative study that reveals the layered viscoelastic properties of granular biofilms the measurement approach and our findings reported in this paper may lay the foundation for future correlation studies of the structure composition and viscoelastic properties of granular biofilms 2 materials and methods 2 1 artificial graded agarose gel phantom the layered agarose sample was created by pouring heated agarose solution in a plastic mold with the following order 1 5 1 25 and 1 0 w v of agarose concentrations the solutions were prepared using the protocol detailed in our previous study s supplementary information liou et al 2019b the boiled solution 1 5 for the first layer was poured into the mold and left to stand at ambient temperature 22 c for 20 min to cool down and solidify the second layer solution 1 25 was then poured on top of the first layer right after it was boiled in the microwave oven the solution s temperature was still over 90 c so it formed a strong bond with the first layer at the interface as it cooled after waiting for another 20 min for the second layer to cool and solidify at ambient temperature the third layer was added by repeating the same procedure for the second layer note that the interfaces observed in fig 2a are not perpendicular to the sample surface due to the surface tension between the agarose solution and the mold wall these angled interfaces create a gradual property change along the elastic waves propagation path which is a good approximation of the property variation in real biofilms 2 2 natural granular biofilms the granular biofilm tested in this paper was obtained from a full scale aerobic granular sludge ags reactor aqua aerobic systems inc rockford il usa in section 3 2 2 the granular biofilm was cut to have a sectioned sample whose thickness is approximately 1 mm in section 3 2 3 2 the whole sphere like granular biofilm was tested 2 3 artificial granular biofilms two kinds of artificial granular biofilms were made 1 pure alginate hydrogel spheres and 2 alginate spheres filled with activated sludge we followed the same protocol in our previous paper liou et al 2019a to prepare the alginate solution with 1 2 w v of concentration for both kinds the extra step to prepare the second kind of samples was adding 5 ml of concentrated activated sludge in the 45 ml of 1 2 w v alginate solution the activated sludge was obtained from the terrance j o brien wastewater treatment plant skokie il usa with the concentrations of total solids ts total suspended solids tss and total dissolved solids tds been 963 5 355 5 and 608 mg l respectively were determined following standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater published by american public health association apha 1992 the 5 ml activated sludge was concentrated from 10 ml by centrifuging at 10 000 rpm for 5 min leading to the final solids concentration of 192 8 mg l note that artificial granular biofilms are also referred as artificial biogranules in this paper 3 results and discussion 3 1 numerical simulation a numerical model was developed to predict the wave speeds of circumferential elastic waves in a layered spherical structure the model was also used for inverse analysis of oce measurements of the elastic wave speeds in the granular biofilm samples from which the viscoelastic properties were determined fig 1 a shows the configuration of the layered model the model consists of an inner core with the radius r a an outer layer between r a and r b and an inviscid water halfspace beyond r b the water halfspace represents the native aqueous environment surrounding the biofilm each layer in the model is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic the elastic waves generated in this structure include bulk waves longitudinal and shear waves and circumferential interface waves the bulk waves travel within the sample and reflect from or transmit through boundaries the circumferential waves on the other hand are bound to the curved surface and their penetration depth into the sample depends on the wavelength or equivalently the frequency the wave speeds of circumferential waves can be derived from the superposition of the bulk waves based on the model setup illustrated in fig 1a the arrows in fig 1a represent the partial bulk waves l for longitudinal s for shear traveling outward or inward and only the longitudinal wave is supported in the surrounding water halfspace since it is assumed inviscid cannot support shear motions the water halfspace perturbs the propagation of circumferential waves at the sphere water interface by loading the sphere surface and providing a dissipation channel for the elastic wave energy we remark that the circumferential elastic waves supported on the surface of a homogeneous and isotropic sphere are toroidal jiangong et al 2007 towfighi and kundu 2003 in the special case where the toroidal wave is monitored along the meridian that is normal to the wavefront its propagation can be approximated by the circumferential wave traveling on the cylindrical surface with the same curvature as the meridian which simplifies the sphere model down to a cylindrical geometry details of the numerical model for a homogenous and isotropic viscoelastic cylinder were published in our recent article liou et al 2019a the numerical model from that paper was extended to a two layered viscoelastic cylinder in this work the modeling is formulated by the following steps 1 composing the governing elastodynamic equations using the potential functions associated with partial bulk waves 2 expressing the components of the displacements and stress fields by the unknown amplitudes and acoustic phases of the partial waves 3 applying boundary conditions to obtain characteristic equations and 4 numerically solving the characteristic equations for the dispersion relation liou et al 2019a 2019b liu and qu 1998 lowe 1995 rose 1999 while the details of the governing equations boundary conductions and dispersion relation are provided in the supporting information here we remark that the viscoelastic behavior of the biofilm is accounted for by assuming that the shear constitutive relation follows the kevin voigt model as follows 1 μ a ω μ a i η μ a ω 2 μ b ω μ b i η μ b ω where μ is the complex shear modulus μ is the shear modulus for a purely elastic material ημ is the shear viscosity ω is the angular frequency and the superscripts a and b represent the inner core and the outer layer respectively the longitudinal wave speeds α l shear wave speeds α s are defined in terms of the material density ρ and the complex first and second lamé constants λ and μ as follows 3 α l a λ 2 μ a ρ α s a μ a ρ α l b λ 2 μ b ρ α s b μ b ρ for circumferential waves traveling in the two layered cylindrical model three important factors need to be considered 1 the radius of curvature 2 the ratio of the radii of the two layers and 3 the contrast of complex lamé constants and shear moduli i e material properties between the two layers since we have discussed the influence of the radius of curvature on the speed of circumferential waves in our recent publication liou et al 2019a here we focus on factors 2 and 3 to investigate how the radius ratio and the property contrast of the two layers affect the frequency dependent speed of the circumferential wave in the following investigations the material properties used for the two layers are density ρ 1000 kg m3 longitudinal wave speeds α l a α l b 1480 m s and shear wave speeds α s a 1 m s α s b 2 m s the density and longitudinal wave speed are chosen to be the same as water due to biofilms high water content note that the numerical calculations in this section are restricted to pure elastic deformation with no viscous damping so the complex wave speeds only have the real parts in this case the symbol α may be replaced by c to follow the conventional denotation for wave speeds fig 1b shows seven dispersion curves and each represents the lowest order circumferential wave calculated with the numerical model for a fixed outer radius b 2 mm fixed material properties for both layers and different inner core radii a all the curves show similar trends the circumferential wave speed is higher at low frequencies and decreases monotonically as the frequency increases the topmost and bottommost dispersion curves correspond to extreme cases of a single homogeneous composition with merely the outer layer s material properties or the inner core s respectively the top four dispersion curves i e for a 1 mm converge to the same curve at high frequencies since the penetration depth of the circumferential wave approximately equals to one wavelength liou et al 2019a becomes smaller than the thickness of the outer layer i e b a for example at 3000 hz the top four curves wave speed converges to 2 68 m s corresponding to a wavelength penetration depth of 0 89 mm at 3000 hz and higher frequencies the penetration depth is smaller than b a thus the circumferential wave has limited interaction with the inner core and the wave speed depends only on α s b in summary the distribution of the seven dispersion curves from top to down show that the wave speed is sensitive to the material fraction occupied by the inner core as indicated by factor 2 listed above next we compare dispersion curves obtained from three different shear wave speeds of the inner core α s a 1 m s 2 m s and 4 m s in fig 1c the following properties a 1 mm b 2 mm and α s b 2 m s are fixed in the calculations the three curves converge to the same curve close to 3000 hz where the circumferential wave s penetration depth is smaller than the outer layer thickness b a however below 3000 hz the wave speed changes appreciably with frequency for α s a 4 m s these numerical results show that the circumferential wave speed is sensitive only to the bulk shear wave speed of the outer layer at higher frequencies where the penetration depth is less than the thickness at lower frequencies where the penetration depth is longer than the outer layer s thickness the wave speed depends on the bulk shear wave speeds of both layers 3 2 experimental measurements 3 2 1 spatial profiling of viscoelastic properties this section and the following one are to test the hypothesis that granular biofilms have layered viscoelastic properties a new measurement approach was developed to probe the spatial dependence of the elastic wave speed in graded and heterogeneous samples we first evaluated the measurement approach in a model sample made from agarose gel with distinct boundaries that separate three regions laterally of graded agarose concentrations 1 1 25 and 1 5 w v see materials section next in the following section the measurement approach was applied to a sectioned thin plate like granular biofilm the structural optical coherence tomography oct oce and acoustic b scan images of the agarose sample are shown in fig 2 a the middle layer in the oct image is 2 mm wide and the widths of the other two layers are over 10 mm the thickness and the height of the sample are 30 mm and 10 mm in the out of plane direction y direction and the vertical direction z direction respectively the oce image shows the full field dynamic response of the sample induced by a 2100 hz harmonic elastic wave the elastic wave was actuated by a thin knife edge that periodically impacted the sample surface the knife edge was connected to a piezoelectric transducer driven at 2100 hz and was placed parallel to the y direction to serve as a line source of the wave the color contour in the oce image represents the local vertical displacement in the sample and the working principles of the oct microscope to record such kind of images is detailed as follows the oct microscope is basically an interferometer that is sensitive to the dynamic vertical displacement in the field of view and thus is suitable for visualizing the shear dominated harmonic elastic waves in the soft materials liou et al 2019a the red and blue fringes in the oce image correspond to the optical phase difference δϕ red for positive blue for negative measured by the oct interferometer which is related to the local vertical displacement uz through the relationship δϕ 4πnδuz λ 0 where n is the refractive index in the sample λ 0 is the center wavelength of the oct light source and δuz is the displacement increment within a small time delay δt therefore the fringe color is eventually related to the polarity of the displacement red for upward blue for downward note that δϕ varies from π to π radian while fig 2b was plotted with saturation limits at π 2 and π 2 radian to enhance the color contrast when large displacement amplitudes occur causing the δϕ to go over the π π limit the phase wrapping phenomenon arises and results in sign flipping of δϕ from blue to red or from red to blue in the center of a fringe since the displacement amplitudes are larger in the region close to the source top left in the figure the phase wrapping is more prominent for x 4 mm while it is absent for x 4 mm in total 21 oce images were recorded at different trigger delays t from t 0 to 0 5 ms from each oce image the waveform of the elastic wave was extracted along the wave path indicated by the white dashed line in fig 2b the waveforms from different trigger delays were stacked row by row to create an acoustic b scan fig 2c and the local wave speed was estimated from the local slope of the tilted color contour in fig 2c as marked by the white dots in the figure the resulting wave speed profile is shown in fig 2d the two blue vertical dashed lines in fig 2d indicate the locations of the interfaces in the oct image that separate the regions of different agarose concentrations as expected the local wave speed increases with the agarose concentration from left to right and clear turns of the speed at x 3 mm and 5 mm coincide with the interfaces where the agarose concentration changes furthermore a 75 raise in speed is observed when comparing the rightmost to the leftmost regions the resolution of this measurement approach was evaluated by finite element modeling and found to be approximately half of the elastic wavelength see supporting information for more details in addition an animation that loops the 21 oce images and shows the harmonic wave propagation is also available in supporting information 3 2 2 sectioned granular biofilm in this section the local elastic wave speed profile in a thin slice 1 mm thick of a granular biofilm was measured fig 3 shows normal microscope oct oce and acoustic b scan images of the sample the central portion in the optical image fig 3a appears darker than other areas in the sample and the radius of the dark portion is estimated qualitatively as the separation between the two vertical dashed lines this radius of the inner core dark region is approximately 50 of the whole sample although the optical image shows the light dark contrast such layering distinction is not seen in the structural oct image fig 3b since the gray scale intensity in the oct image corresponds to the refractive index variation in the sample we may conclude that the granular biofilm layering distinguished by the light dark color contrast does not lead to a resolvable refractive index variation corresponding to an extreme property difference the oce image in fig 3c shows the elastic wave s displacement distribution for an excitation frequency at 3200 hz the wave was probed along the red arrow in fig 3a since the sample slice was obtained at the equator of the biofilm sphere we can assume that the property variation along the thickness is negligible and changes of the local wave speed can all be attributed to the property variation along the lateral direction 25 oce images were recorded at different trigger delays ranging from 0 to 0 3 ms see supporting information for the animated video clip the displacement distributions extracted along the wave path white dashed line in fig 3c at all trigger delays were stacked together to produce the acoustic b scan shown in fig 3d in fig 3d the signal to noise ratio of the oce measurement deteriorates dramatically beyond x 3 mm due to the attenuation of the elastic waves along the propagation path the white dots in this figure mark the movement of the elastic wave with respect to time from which the local wave speed profile fig 3e was estimated fig 3e shows that the wave speed changes intensely along the propagation path suggesting strong heterogeneity of the sample in terms of elastic properties it is essential to point out that the wave speed s local variation is not due to artifacts from the oct interferometer since the oct image is virtually featureless also during the experiment the transducer had no translation and the sample was stationary so the concern of motion artifacts stemming from the translation of the transducer or the sample can be dismissed the dashed lines in fig 3e are at the same locations of those in fig 3a which indicate the center and the boundary of the sample s dark region the wave speed profile appears to be symmetric with respect to the second dashed line center of the biofilm sphere and the local minima occur closely at both dashed lines as the first line marks the dark region boundary the most important information obtained in this testing is the elastic property distinction between the light region outer layer and the dark region inner core the averaged elastic wave speed of the latter is 76 of the former 3 5 m s to 4 57 m s one potential origin of the difference of the elastic wave speeds in both layers may be the spatially varying biomass i e bacterial cells concentration in the sample ding et al 2015 liu et al 2009 sarma et al 2017 this assumption will be verified on artificial biogranule spheres with different biomass concentrations in the following section 3 2 3 viscoelastic characterization of granular biofilms by circumferential waves 3 2 3 1 artificial granular biofilms to verify the assumption stated in the previous section that a higher concentration of biomass leads to a slower elastic wave speed we tested artificial granular biofilms made from alginate spheres with primary settling effluent sourced from a wastewater treatment plant and compared them to the pure alginate spheres which serve as control samples the alginate material was chosen to mimic the viscoelastic properties of the eps while the primary settling effluent is a source of suspended bacteria cells the properties of the effluent are discussed in the materials section we characterized the viscoelastic properties of the artificial granular biofilms based on oce measurements of the circumferential wave speed in the samples this measurement approach was adopted to avoid sectioning the samples the details of the approach to quantify viscoelastic properties of pure alginate spheres can be found in a recent publication from our group liou et al 2019a fig 4 a and 4b show the oct and oce images of the alginate sphere with distributed biomass the sample was submerged in water to mimic the native aqueous environment of real granular biofilms the white speckles in the oct image are the biomass aggregates the oce image shows the displacement pattern of a 1600 hz harmonic circumferential wave the white line indicates the path where the circumferential wave s displacement distribution was extracted to estimate the wavelength and the wave speed the measurement was repeated at different frequencies to determine the frequency dependent wave speeds as marked by the hollowed circles for the control sample and solid dots for alginate with biomass in fig 4c the solid lines in fig 4c are the best fits for the experimentally measured speeds obtained from theoretical calculations note that the theoretical calculations assumed that the samples have only one uniform composition with effective properties the control sample s wave speed measurements agree well with our previous report liou et al 2019a demonstrating the reliability of the sample fabrication and the repeatability of the wave speed measurement the frequency dependent wave speed for the control sample and artificial biogranule share similar trends the wave speed curves have local minima between 1500 and 2500 hz depending on the sample composition the clear two group separation between the control sample and the alginate spheres with biomass indicates the distinct property difference shear modulus and complex viscosity between these two kinds of samples the artificial biogranules have distinctly lower wave speeds compared to the control sample the small variability of the wave speeds for the artificial biogranules is due to slight differences in their radii the radii of the control sample and the biogranules are listed in table 1 we estimated the radii by curve fitting samples surfaces visualized in the structural oct images the input viscoelastic properties and bulk shear wave speeds to achieve the best fits for the samples are also listed in table 1 the results suggest that the presence of biomass in the alginate spheres lowers the shear modulus and viscosity of the samples the shear modulus of the artificial biogranules is approximately 45 lower than the control and the viscosities decrease by 46 as shown in fig 4d one fortuitous outcome of the measurements is that the ratio of the bulk shear wave speeds the artificial biogranules to the control sample is 74 3 close to the ratio obtained from the spatial wave speed profiling on the biofilm slice in section 3 2 2 based on these observations we may confirm the assumption that the local wave speed changes observed in the sectioned biogranule may be attributed to the variation of local biomass concentrations 3 2 3 2 natural granular biofilm finally the layered viscoelastic properties of the natural granular biofilm were examined by measuring the speed of circumferential waves in the sample the granular biofilm was obtained from an aerobic granular sludge reactor at a wastewater treatment facility see materials section for more details the structural oct image of the granular biofilm are shown in fig 5 a the sample was submerged in a native aqueous solution from the aerobic granular sludge reactor to maintain the biofilm s natural environment the oct light source s penetration depth into the sample is less than 1 mm but it is sufficient to resolve the circular outline of the biofilm surface the radius of the sample is approximately 2 3 mm the floating speckles near the biofilm surface are filaments the oct image of the biofilm does not reveal distinct structural features that may indicate the stratification or heterogeneity of the sample structural properties rather the morphology of the sample is uniform over the penetration depth of the oct light source the oce image in fig 5b shows the displacement pattern of a 3400 hz harmonic circumferential wave along the biofilm surface the apparent penetration depth of the displacement profile is limited by the shallow imaging depth of the oct microscope from the oce image we extracted the wavelength 1 62 mm of the displacement pattern along the wave propagation path indicated by the white dashed line in the figure the product of the frequency 3400 hz and the wavelength 1 62 mm yields the wave speed 5 5 m s the measured speeds of the circumferential wave at frequencies from 2600 to 5600 hz are shown by circular dots in fig 5c the wave speed of the sample is larger than the artificial biogranule as such longer wavelengths of the displacement pattern were recorded in the sample for the same frequencies the green curve in fig 5c is the best fit of the measured wave speeds obtained from the theoretical calculation note that for the calculation as stated in the numerical simulation section the granular biofilm were modeled as a two layered sphere for which the radius of the inner core is half of the outer radius furthermore the ratio of bulk shear wave speeds the inner core to the outer layer was assumed to be 76 following the result of wave speed profiling from the sectioned biofilm section 3 2 2 also given the artificial biogranules closely mimicked this 76 ratio of bulk shear wave speeds we assumed that the viscosity ratio of the artificial biogranules 53 the alginate spheres with biomass to the pure alginate sphere is representative of the ratio between the inner core and the outer layer and this ratio was used as one of the inputs for the theoretical calculation the shear wave speed and viscosity used to obtain the best fit are listed in table 2 we remark that only two fitting parameters c s b and η s b were used in the theoretical model from the best fit properties we determined the shear moduli of the outer layer and the inner core to be 8 41 kpa and 4 84 kpa and their shear viscosities are 0 37 pa s and 0 20 pa s the shear moduli are within the range of biofilm mechanical properties previously reported in the literature peterson et al 2015 4 conclusions in this paper we studied the layered viscoelastic properties of granular biofilms based on the elastic wave speed measurements measurements on a thin slice of a granular biofilm from an aerobic granular sludge reactor show significant spatial variation in the speed of shear dominated guided elastic waves the central region of the sample has a lower wave speed compared to other parts we hypothesized that the spatial variation of the wave speed stems from the biomass s non uniform distribution in the granular biofilm resulting from the gradient in the sample s oxygen concentration to support this claim we fabricated artificial biogranules by containing primary effluent in alginate spheres to mimic the core of the granular biofilm while the pure alginate sample was selected to mimic the outer layer the hypothesis is supported by our experimental observations that the viscoelastic properties of the artificial biogranules are at least 45 lower than the pure alginate sphere confirming that biomass concentration can control granular biofilms viscoelastic properties inspired by all findings above we assumed that the non sectioned natural granular biofilms can be modeled as two layered spheres leading to an inner core and an outer layer with different viscoelastic properties we then developed a layered circumferential wave model to characterize the viscoelastic properties of the granular biofims based on the oce measurements of the frequency dependent circumferential wave speed and inverse analysis the shear modulus and viscosity of the granular biofilms estimated by this approach fall within the range of reported values for biofilms here we highlight two crucial points from this study first oce measurement of circumferential elastic waves is a powerful tool to nondestructively characterize the viscoelasticity of biofilms with curved geometry the circumferential waves are confined to the surface of the sample and are sensitive to the surface curvature and the viscoelastic properties their wavelength dependent penetration depths potentially allow for sampling the variation of viscoelastic properties in soft materials like biofilms along the depth second we quantified the spatial gradient of the viscoelastic properties in a natural granular biofilm which not only is the first of its kind report in this subject but also supports the findings presented in the literature that granular biofilms are stratified into layers ongoing measurements on a statistically relevant size of granular biofilms in authors laboratory will provide deeper insight into how consistent the heterogeneity profile is in terms of viscoelastic properties across samples we will also explore local wave speed profiling with shorter wavelengths to increase the spatial resolution of the mechanical property mapping which may lead to a more precise depiction of the layered structure in granular biofilms this paper lays the fundation for further studies regarding the relationships between growth conditions morphology and material properties of granular biofilms by gaining more insights about the interplay between these factors we hope to enhance the control of granular biofilms granulation processes and ultimately facilitate their applications in wastewater treatment reactors finally we remark that the measurement approach oce measurements of elastic waves presented in this work is applicable not only in the biofilm field but also holds promising potential in other contexts such as biological tissues or biomedical treatments where the viscoelastic properties of soft materials with layered structures or complex geometries are of great interest supporting information details about 1 the visco
