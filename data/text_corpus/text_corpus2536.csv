12680,bisphenol a bpa is an organic pollutant that is widely spread in waterbody with effluents as a result of its extensive use in the plastics industry it posses to the class of compounds that are endocrine disruptors and has a great negative impact on living organisms therefore the progress in development of green technology for bpa removal from the aquatic media is crucial for environmental protection this paper presents bpa removal by electrochemical oxidation on sno2 mwcnt tin dioxide multi walled carbon nanotube nanocomposite anode the nanocomposite was structural and morphological characterized by x ray powder diffraction and transmission electron microscopy electrochemical properties of the sno2 mwcnt anode were investigated using cyclic voltammetry linear sweep voltammetry and electrical impedance spectroscopy the electrochemical behavior of anodes toward bpa in sodium sulfate solutions has shown that bpa is oxidized by indirectly mechanism via hydroxyl radicals verified by quenching tests electrolysis of bpa has been done in galvanostatic regime at current densities 2 5 5 0 10 0 15 0 and 20 0 ma cm 2 in 0 1 m sodium sulfate supported electrolyte ph 4 0 complete degradation of bpa was accomplished after 5 h of electrolysis at a current density of 20 ma cm 2 the proposed electrochemical technology using a low cost sno2 mwcnt electrode is promising for wastewater bpa removal keywords bisphenol a electrochemical oxidation functionalized mwcnt sno2 mwcnt data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction many frequently used chemicals in everyday life like pharmaceuticals personal care products surfactants various industrial additives and pesticides are compounds that cause disrupting the function of the endocrine system endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs are compounds that mimic hormones that affect the growth and development of reproductive organs in humans and animals one of them is bisphenol a bpa or 2 2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane 1 it has been noted that bpa binds to estrogen receptors and oral ingestion of bpa is harmful to the reproductive organs of animals 1 3 due to their hazardous health effects the u s environmental protection agency us epa the european union and the world wildlife fund imf placed bpa on the list of priority pollutants 4 bpa is one of the most applicable chemicals in the industry which is why it is produced on large scale over 8 billion pounds each year worldwide in the plastics industry 5 6 it is used as a precursor in the synthesis of polycarbonates and epoxy resins which are employed for the manufacture of a lot of commercial products like relay parts lamp sockets safety switches power plugs fluorescent tube sockets current meters polycarbonate bottles including water and milk bottle and different epoxy protective primers and coatings for food and drink cans adhesives etc 7 due to its extensive industrial and commercial applications the highest concentrations of bpa are found in industrial and municipal wastewater 8 and landfill leachates 9 also a lack of attention to environmental issues causes to bpa found its way into rivers seas and soils 10 13 the latest studies have confirmed the presence of bpa in urine placental tissue and human blood 14 16 wastewater treatment containing bpa and its derivatives is a frequent problem in environmental chemistry various degradation technologies including adsorption 17 24 biodegradation 25 26 and photocatalytic oxidation 27 28 were applied however these methods are mostly complex and expensive and can lead to incomplete degradation and the formation of more ecotoxic products therefore in recent decades significant attention has been paid to the development of more environmentally friendly and cost effective technologies such as advanced oxidation processes aops aops encompass a group of depollution methods that use hydroxyl radicals oh the strongest known oxidant for the oxidation of organic pollutants including electrochemical oxidation electrochemical oxidation is one of the most promising processes for removing organic pollutants from water and wastewater because it is using electrons as a clean reagent there are no chemicals involved and toxic waste after the treatment is completed it can be performed directly by the charge transfer between the surface of the anode and organic pollutants or indirectly via reactive oxygen species ros formed on the surface anode 29 one of the main ros types is adsorbed oh or surface bound oh onto the anode surface which is generated as an intermediate oxygen evolution during the oxidation of water molecules in the electrochemical system electrochemical oxidation provides high efficiency and low resource consumption and it requires simple apparatus and experimental conditions the efficiency of the electrochemical oxidation process toward a specific organic pollutant depends on the performance of the anode materials in this view many research groups including ours are dealing with developing novel or testing well known anodic materials for bpa removal from aquatic media m govindaraj et al 30 were used graphite anodes and obtained efficiency in terms of chemical oxygen demand cod removal of 73 3 while jun zhaoa et al 31 showed that the removal efficiency of cod could be reached up to 92 2 on new synthetized ti based co3o4 pbo2 composite anodes recently samarghandi et al 32 applied graphite Î² pbo2 electrodes and granular activated carbon for bpa degradation in a three dimensional electrochemical reactor obtained bpa removal efficiency was 98 8 a lot of research studies showed that the boron doped diamond bdd electrode has exceptional efficiency in bpa electrochemical degradation murugananthan et al 33 have proved that the total mineralization has been achieved only on bdd compared to pt gc electrode during 14 h of electrolysis also pereira et al 34 found the best performance of nb bdd compared to ti pt b pbo2 and tio2 ruo2 anodes however widely application of bdd electrodes was limited with high price complexity of scaled up preparation technology on the other hand sno2 based anodes have many advantages including that they are inexpensive non toxic and simple in their preparation procedure applications of pure sno2 in the field of electrochemical oxidation technology seemed to be further restricted by its poor electric conductivity and stability 35 this problem can be overcome by reducing grain size to nanometer dimension doping with metals nanoparticles or carbon based nanomaterial antimony doped tin dioxide electrodes sno2 sb showed excellent electrocatalytic performance for bpa electrochemical oxidation compared to the pt and ti ruo2 anodes 36 nevertheless the short service life and durability of the ti sb sno2 anode still need to be greatly improved for commercial application a significant improvement in electrode performance and electrocatalytic activity for bpa oxidation was achieved by wu et al 37 and xue et al 38 using ptfe cnt and pbo2 modified sno2 sb electrodes the introduction of carbon based materials such as graphene oxide carbon nanotubes reduced graphene oxide improves the conductivity and structural stability of the electrodes 39 41 the doping of carbon based nanomaterial such as multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnt into a metal oxide electrode can lead to enhanced conductivity and electrocatalytic activity electrode thus enabling their successful electrochemical application it is well known that sno2 mwcnt nanocomposite anode is efficiently used as an electrochemical sensor for many organic compounds 42 nevertheless to our knowledge there are no publications that explain the efficiency of oxidation and bpa degradation on sno2 mwcnt anode in wastewaters and electrochemical behavior toward bpa in this complex electrode system according to the generally accepted classification depending on the type of interaction with oh and values of overvoltage for oxygen evolution oep electrode materials was classified into active with low oep formed chemisorbed species partially mineralize organic pollutants and non active with high oep physisorbed oh reacts directly with organic molecules leading to their total mineralization in co2 and h2o 43 studies 44 have shown that the nature physical and chemical characteristics of anodic material like lattice structure grain size the crystal plane and the existence of the functional groups on the electrode surface play a critical role in formation of different types of oh sno2 electrodes are typical examples of nonactive electrodes and carbon based anodes like mwcnt show active behavior 29 45 46 the literature reviews 47 show that rigid division of the electrode materials is not quite entirely acceptable and anode material can exhibit dual behavior with the predominance of one over other characteristic also oep as a critical index for evaluation of the electrode oh generation performance might be an inappropriate indicator of capacity for oh generation based on this it is very interesting to investigate electrochemical behavior of bpa on combined active non active composite and consequently whether it leads to the partial or total mineralization of bpa in presented study bpa removal by electrochemical oxidation on the synthesized sno2 mwcnt anode was investigated for this purpose a sno2 mwcnt nanocomposite was synthesized and structural x ray powder diffraction spectrometry xrpd and transmission electron microscopy tem and electrochemical cyclic voltammetry cv linear sweep voltammetry lsv and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis characterization were done based on these characterization methods behavior of the anode material was described as well as the kinetics and mechanisms of bpa degradation on it electrochemical removal of bpa from sulphate based aquatic electrolyte as a model of communal and industrial wastewaters demonstrates an appropriate simulation of bpa elimination from contaminated environmental media 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials for the synthesis of sno2 mwcnt nanocomposite following chemicals

electrochemical cell ag agcl was used as a reference electrode and a pt mesh as a counter electrode while the bare ss mwcnt and sno2 mwcnt specimen served as the working electrodes the electrochemical oxidation was carried out in a two electrode electrolytic cell in which prepared sno2 mwcnt electrode was used as anode and a ss plate of the same surface area 2 cm2 as a cathode these electrodes were immersed in 60 ml 0 1 m na2so4 solution ph 4 containing 30 mg l 1 bpa with a distance of 1 cm between them chronopotentiometry experiments with the applied different current densities 2 5 5 0 10 0 15

analyzer shimadzu co kyoto japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterization the xrpd patterns of functionalized mwcnt sno2 and sno2 mwcnt nanocomposite are presented in fig 1 all of the reflections for mwcnt sno2 composite were assigned and indexed in agreement with the jcpds cards joint committee of powder diffraction studies the diffraction peaks at 25 9 and 43 1 were observed in fig 1 black line and can be ascribed to reflection from 002 and 100 planes of graphite jspds card no 96 101 1061 53 confirming that treatment of mwcnt using weak acid does not change the structure of mwcnt on the xrpd pattern of sno2 mwcnt shown in fig 1 red line was noticed dominant reflections appeared at 26 5 33 8 37 9 38 9 43 0 51 8 54 8 and 57 8 which can be ascribed to the 110 101 200 110 210 211 220 and 002 crystal planes of sno2 this indicates that prepared sno2 nanoparticles crystallize in rutile type tetragonal structure having space group p4 2 m n m jcpds file no 41 1445 54 also the highly intense strong and sharp peaks prove the high crystallinity of sno2 in the composite however in the xrpd pattern of sno2 mwcnt the diffraction peak related to mwcnt was absent perhaps due to the overlapping of the 110 plane of sno2 and 002 plane of mwcnt low crystallinity of nanotubes compared to sno2 55 56 the mean crystallite size determined by sherrer s equation 57 was found to be d xrpd 13 1 nm and confirms the formation of nanocrystalline sno2 tem examinations confirmed the success of the attachment of sno2 nanoparticles to mwcnts as shown in fig 2 it can be seen fig 2 that a large number of small sno2 nanoparticles are linked to mwcnt surfaces probably via carbonyl co or hydroxyl oh functional groups created by acid treatment of nanotubes decorated sno2 nanoparticles were primarily spherical in shape with a few polygonal shapes see insert in fig 2c the estimated average particle size in the nanocomposite is about 15 nm which is in agreement with the previous xrpd experiment also it is interesting to note the agglomeration of sno2 particles on the mwcnt chains which probably occurs due to ultrasonic treatment during composite preparation through the edx microanalysis fig 2h it is confirmed that elements o c and sn are present in the synthesized nanocomposite also signals observed at 1 8 and 9 kev originate from cu which is used as a sample holder during tem measurements the elemental mapping images show the distribution of c fig 2e sn fig 2f and o fig 2g in the selected area which is represented in the haadf micrograph fig 2d in the ir spectrum of functionalized mwcnt blue line in fig 3 the bands existing at 2853 cm 1 and 2924 cm 1 can be assigned to stretching vibrations of the c h group 58 after functionalization of the mwcnt the new intensive bands corresponding to stretching vibrations of co 1385 cm 1 and co group 1630 cm 1 appeared also two new peaks at 1715 cm 1 and 1100 cm 1 emerged in the ir spectrum of functionalized mwcnt indicating the existence of co and co stretching vibrations of the carboxylic groups cooh respectively 59 stretching vibrations from oh in a range of 3300 3600 cm 1 could be attributed to the free oh groups of carboxylic acids or water adsorbed onto mwcnt surfaces 60 3 2 electrochemical characterization of the electrodes the electrochemical characterization and behavior of the working electrodes firstly were examined in standard electrolytes such as 0 1 m kcl and then the actual behavior of the electrodes in real systems acidic 0 1 m na2so4 was investigated using cv eis and lsv cv is a powerful tool for the investigation of electrode processes and chemical reactions in a solution that are initiated by charge transfer at the electrode in combination with eis and lsv important information about electrochemical behavior and catalytic properties of the prepared electrodes can be obtained 3 2 1 the effective surface area and electrochemical behavior of working electrodes cyclic voltammograms of 5 mm potassium hexacyanoferrate in 0 1 m kcl at 100 mv s 1 for bare ss mwcnt sno2 and sno2 mwcnt electrodes fig 4 clearly indicate that all investigated electrodes except sno2 provide an electrochemical response to the tested redox pare fe2 fe3 compared to the bare ss electrode modified electrodes showed an increase in the redox currents of the fe2 3 couple the peak to peak separation Î´e between oxidation and reduction peaks of sno2 mwcnt was smaller than in the case of bare ss and mwcnt modified electrodes Î´e from 166 mv to 186 mv respectively the increased values in comparison to the theoretical Î´e of 59 mv can be assigned to the heterogeneous structure of the modified electrodes this confirms that the modification process enhances the electrode interface by increasing the active surface area and forcing diffusion processes of ferrocyanide ions at the surface of the sno2 mwcnt working electrode as the scan rate increases the peak current rises continually supp fig s1a indicating that adsorption processes occur at the surface of the sno2 mwcnt electrode too also slight shifts in the peak potential with the increase of the scan rate toward more positive values confirm the adsorption nature of the processes occurs at the electrode solution interface the effective surface area of the working electrodes was expressed by the randles sevcik eq 1 61 62 1 i p 2 69 10 5 n 3 2 a d 0 1 2 v 1 2 c where i p a is the peak current n is the number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction n 1 in this case a cm2 is the effective surface area d cm2 s 1 is the diffusion coefficient for k3 fe cn 6 c mol cm 3 is the concentration of the reaction species in the electrolyte 5 10 6 for fe cn 6 4 and v v s 1 is the scan rate the effective surface area was calculated from the slope of the linear fit curve function i p f Î½1 2 shown in supp fig s1 obtained values are 1 620 2 290 and 4 051 cm2 for mwcnt bare ss and sno2 mwcnt electrodes respectively this indicates the effective surface area of the sno2 mwcnt electrode is greater than bare ss and mwcnt so better electrochemical performance toward organic pollutant degradation can be expected eis is an effective technique for the detailed investigation of interfacial phenomena between the solution and the surface of modified electrodes therefore it can provide important information about electrode reaction kinetics and the corresponding mechanism based on these findings we estimated the electrochemical behavior of sno2 mwcnt mwcnt ss and sno2 electrodes in a real medium acidic 0 1 m na2so4 solution using eis measurement was performed in the frequency range from 0 1 hz to 1 mhz nyquist diagrams and the corresponding equivalent electrical circuit models are shown in supp fig s2 as can be seen in supp fig s2a the nyquist plot of sno2 mwcnt consists of a semicircular part at intermediate and higher frequencies domains corresponding to the electron transfer process and a straight line at lower frequencies which represents adsorption controlled processes the eic spectra were fitted according to the model presented in supp fig s2b with the following components r s is the uncompensated electrolyte solution resistance r ct is the charge transfer resistance at the electrode solution interface which have an impact on the electrocatalytic activity of the electrode cpe in the intermediate and high frequency domains is the constant phase element represents electric double layer capacitance parallel r ads q ads in low frequency domains refers to the capacitive resistance r ads q ads arising behavior of the hydrated layer promoted by the adsorption desorption of hydroxyl radical 63 the results demonstrate two things first the r ct 212 Ï is much smaller than the determined r ads 1 7 106 Ï which implies that the discharge process on the interface mwcnt sno2 electrode is primarily controlled by the resistance of the adsorption desorption of the species which create a hydrated layer consequently the electrocatalytic activity of the electrode is dependent on the adherence of the hydroxyl radical on the electrode surface the lower value of r ads indicate weakly adhered hydroxyl radicals hence it is easily available for the oxidation of organics 64 second we have observed a decrease in the r ct 212 Ï of mwcnt sno2 compared to the r ct of mwcnt 496 Ï and bare ss 8 0 103 Ï electrodes supp fig s2 which is an indication of enhanced interfacial properties of the mwcnt sno2 electrode and improved transport of charge through solution electrode interface and better electrocatalytic activity similar results were confirmed with the cv measurements the observed better reversibility of the process and therefore a greater diffusion layer on the sno2 mwcnt working electrode in relation to other electrodes confirms that the modification process was done successfully due to the expected progress of the electrode interface there is also a certain improvement in electrocatalytic properties 3 2 2 possibility for oxygen evolution reaction fig 5a shows the lsv curves of bare ss and modified ss electrodes with the sno2 mwcnt and sno2 mwcnt nanocomposite in 0 1 m na2so4 solution at 25 c the measured potentials vs the ag agcl were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode rhe scale via the nernst eq 2 2 e rhe e ag agcl 0 059 ph e ag agcl 0 where e rhe is the converted potential vs rhe e ag agcl is the experimental potential measured against ag agcl reference electrode and e ag agcl 0 is the standard potential of ag agcl at 25 c 0 1976 v vs rhe compared to other modified electrodes modified mwcnt at the same current density has the lowest oxygen evolution potential 1 77 v vs rhe and consequently higher electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution the literature review 43 65 shows that electrodes with lower oxygen evolution potential have higher electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction and have active behavior for oxidation of organics pollutants 43 also a carbon electrode is a typical representative of active electrodes so it is not surprising that mwcnt as a carbon material shows the same behavior on the other hand a sno2 electrode shows non active behaviors and the highest oxygen evolution potential 2 57 v vs rhe see fig 5a therefore the sno2 mwcnt electrode shows the potential for the oxygen evolution reaction between these two electrodes at 1 89 v vs rhe and intermediate behavior due to its high resistance sno2 displays a very low current whence mwcnt as carbon material with excellent electrocatalytic properties is added to increase their electric conductivity well known advantages of sno2 such as being inexpensive non toxic and the simplicity of its preparation procedure favor its use as a material suitable for the preparation of anodes for electrochemical application more details about the catalytic behavior of the prepared electrodes including basic oxygen evolution kinetic parameters tafel slope b intercept a exchange current density j o and oxygen evolution potential e of the electrodes were obtained by tafel analysis see supp text s1 linear fitting curves of the bare ss and modified electrode and the results of oxygen evolution parameters are summarized in fig 5b and table 1 respectively it is well known that oxygen evolution parameters depend on the structure of the materials electrode higher exchange current density and smaller tafel slope are obtained for ss mwcnt and sno2 mwcnt electrodes compared to sno2 this means the modified electrode with mwcnt and nanocomposite sno2 mwcnt makes the faster electron transfer process for reaction evaluation oxygen compared to sno2 electrodes leading to better electrocatalytic properties for oxygen evolution the observed slightly lower tafel slope of the nanocomposite sno2 mwcnt electrode compared to mwcnt is probably related only to the change of mechanism for the oxygen evolution process 3 3 electrochemical oxidation of bpa the electrochemical behavior of bpa on the mwcnt sno2 electrode was examined on the basis of the change of shape and characteristics of the cv curves obtained at different bpa concentrations in 0 1 m na2so4 ph 4 0 sulfates were chosen to improve the mobility of ionic species and as models of sulfate rich wastewater from the food textile and paint and varnish industries acidic ph was selected based on literature data 66 67 which have been shown that in the acidic range degradation of bpa is favorable however in an alkaline solution co2 obtained from degradation exists as hco3 and co3 2 ions which are known as strong oh scavengers and therefore inhibit bpa oxidation by oh as can be seen from fig 6a cv curves have the same shape without the appearance of new peaks in the presence and absence of bpa these prompt the conclusion that bpa oxidation does not occur directly by electron transfer between the anode surface and bpa with the rising of bpa concentration in supporting electrolytes up to 400 mg l 1 an increase of the anode peak current and a slight shift of pick potential to positive values 1 14 v to 1 18 v are observed confirming that the oxidation of bpa occurred it is interesting to point out that with a further increase in the concentration of bpa probably due to the occupation of active sites on the electrode surface by bpa oxidation products electropolymerization occurs i e blocking the electrode surface and the anode peak current decreases since bpa structurally consists of 2 linked methylated molecules of phenol it is expected that its electrochemical behavior is similar to phenol based on the literature review 29 45 it can be assumed that bpa probably is oxidized indirectly via oh how the electrode process will take place depends on whether the electrode is active or non active the sno2 electrode belongs to non active electrodes with high overvoltage for oxygen evolution so degradation of organic molecules takes place by indirect mechanism via physisorbed oh our results see tafel analysis demonstrated that the overvoltage for oxygen evaluation reduces with the addition of mwcnt to sno2 and organic molecules on the modified electrode also are degrading indirectly but via chemisorbed oh due to the strong interaction of the chemisorbed oh with the surface of active electrodes higher oxides or superoxides mo are produced which further oxidizes organic pollutants r eqs 5 6 5 m oh mo h e 6 mo r m ro the scan rates v affect the peak currents i p a of bpa at mwcnt sno2 fig 6b shows that i p a increases continuously with the scan rate on the constant bpa concentration a linear relationship was found between i p a in the scan range of 10 100 mv s 1 insert of fig 6b the obtained regression equations was i p a Î¼a 1 2 0 0975 v mv s 1 r 2 0 984 also peak to peak separation Î´e potential is independent with scan rate all of this is expected for the redox reaction of surface adsorbed species meanwhile a linear relationship was also found between ln i p a and ln v supp fig s3 their relationship was expressed as ln i p a ma 0 7078 ln v v s 1 4 6587 r 2 0 985 where the slope is 0 7078 according to literature 68 when a slope value is close to 0 5 it implies to diffusion controlled electrode processes and for values of slope close to 1 0 electrode processes are adsorption controlled it demonstrates that both control processes contribute to the oxidation of bpa predominant adsorption with a minor part of diffusion 68 similar kinetic was observed by other authors 67 69 3 4 removal efficiency and degradation reaction kinetics of bpa for evaluation of the proposed electrode material bpa was oxidized on sno2 mwcnt anode in an electrochemical cell in order to monitor the degradation of bpa in the electrolyte we determined the initial concentration of bpa and its change during electrolysis using the gc ms method the presented results confirmed the findings in the literature about decreasing bpa concentration due to oxidation on the anode 36 70 72 electrolytic oxidation of 30 mg l 1 bpa was performed at different current densities 2 5 5 0 10 0 15 0 and 20 0 ma cm 2 based on fig 7 it can be noticed that with the decline of the current density the removal efficiency decreases which is consistent with data from the literature 36 70 there is a significant difference between the degradation at a current density of 2 5 ma cm 2 and 20 ma cm 2 where the efficiency removals are 39 34 and 99 00 respectively on the other hand the difference between the degradation efficiency at currents of 20 0 ma cm 2 and 15 0 ma cm 2 is minor 6 indicating that a further increase in current density does not particularly affect the degradation efficiency the biggest decline of bpa concentration in the electrolyte can be observed in the first hour of electrolytic oxidation and follows the growth trend with current density and amounts up to 20 30 in relation to the initial concentration of bpa this can be explained by the fact that energy is used not only for the degradation of bpa but also for its oxidation products and their further degradation also it is possible that due to the increased number of oxidized molecules originated by bpa degradation for bpa molecules it is more difficult to migrate to the anode and thus there is a decrease in efficiency in the further course of electrolysis however there are implications in the literature 73 74 that bpa polymerization occurs at the anode which also slows down its degradation degradation efficiency of bpa compared to mineralization efficiency of bpa in terms toc removal see supp fig s4 is quite low in the first 2 h of electrolysis afterwards it was increasing rapidly during the rest of test this implies that bpa was oxidized to other organic compounds before it is fully converted to co2 and h2o about 84 of bpa is completely mineralized after 5 h of treatment at a current density of 15 0 ma cm 2 the kinetics rate constant of the bpa removal process followed the pseudo first order reaction see supp text s2 which is in line with the literature data on electrochemical degradation of bpa 66 71 the k values were 0 001 0 002 0 006 0 009 and 0 013 min 1 at the current densities of 2 5 5 0 10 0 15 0 and 20 0 ma cm 2 respectively the main reason for elevated k value is greater production of hydroxyl radicals due to larger current density in addition kinetic rate constant of the bpa removal was used to calculate the electric energy per order ee 0 as an effective parameter to estimate energy consumption for this process ee 0 presents the amount of energy required to reduce 90 of the polutant concentration in 1 m3 of the electrolyte the equation is shown in supplementary text s3 75 76 calculated ee 0 shows that the rise of the current density leads to a slight decline in energy consumption from 9 40 kwh m 3 to 9 38 kwh m 3 on current density of 2 5 ma cm 2 and 5 ma cm 2 and 7 20 kwh m 3 7 00 kwh m 3 and 6 90 kwh m 3 on 10 ma cm 2 15 ma cm 2 and 20 ma cm 2 respectively especially as the current density exceeded 10 ma cm 2 ee 0 values are almost constant indicating that under the higher current bpa degradation was no longer controlled by current density overall the presented electrochemical system is more efficient in terms of bpa degradation operative cost based on energy consumption than the previous studies reported by govindaraj et al 30 who employed graphite electrodes and consuming was approximately 18 24 to 39 36 kwh m 3 and dianati et al 77 who reported an ee 0 of 23 06 to 99 96 kwh m 3 for the degradation of 10 100 mg l 1 bpa using photocatalytic technology in table 2 comparison of bpa degradation under similar conditions on sno2 mwcnt composite and other different electrodes reported in the literature was shown the experiments were performed in sodium sulfate in acid medium at a current density of 20 0 ma cm 2 for 5 h or more see supp fig 5 the presented results for bpa efficiency removal were from 78 8 for ti sno2 sb electrode to 100 0 for bdd electrode for all exhibited electrodes the electrolysis time lasts 6 h except for sno2 mwcnt and bdd electrodes if we take into account the electrolysis time and the efficiency of bpa degradation the obtained results for the sno2 mwcnt electrode stands out compared to other electrodes except the bdd electrode 3 5 mechanism study the identification of the ros types produced in the system during electrochemical oxidation of bpa was done by free radical quenching test as reported in the literature 75 78 methanol is typically quencher for both sulfate so4 and hydroxyl radical tba is considered as an effective quenching agent only for oh while ffa is used for singlet oxygen 1o2 determination as it is shown in fig 8 the bpa removal efficiency was decreased by introducing 2 m meoh from 92 96 to 88 50 and 2 m tba from 92 96 to 69 15 into the reaction system after 5 h of electrolysis the tba inhibitor effects are stronger than meoh which can be explained by its different values of dielectric constant due to higher dielectric constant meoh 33 7 has stronger hydrophilicity and react with oh in the bulk solution while tba 12 47 as poor hydrophilicity compound can be easily adsorbed on the surface of electrode and scavenge both surface bound oh and oh in the bulk solution a similar effect of scavengers was obtained by other authors studying the degradation of phenolic compounds 79 80 compared to other quenchers used in this study the strongest inhibitory effect shows ffa only 35 86 of bpa could be removed when ffa was added to the system it is proof of singlet 1o2 participation to the electrochemical oxidation bpa actually during electrochemical oxidation oxygen is constantly evolution at the anode and then partially dissolves in the electrolyte singlet oxygen is formed during the reduction of dissolved oxygen at the cathode 81 and supports the electrochemical removal of bpa however a few numerous studies 75 82 84 demonstrated that ffa mainly interacts with other ros which are possibly formed in reaction medium due to non negligible reactivity of ffa with oh and previously confirmed formation of oh radicals in a significant amount during electrochemical oxidation their contribution to ffa test can be included the concentration of oh radical production was obtained by measurements of h2o2 formation in system for the time of degradation see supp fig 6 it is calculated as difference between hydrogen peroxide formation with and without tba scavenger using the method proposed by sellers et al 85 and zhao et al 86 preliminary tests on a mass spectrometer in negative mode indicate the existence of hydroxylated derivatives of bpa catechol dicatechol quinones which means that so4 cannot play crucial role in bpa removal process as the electrolysis progressed in contrast to the first hours where fragments of large masses m z 200 were detected a peaks at smaller masses can be noticed with mass fragments pointing to isopropenylphenol hydroquinone hydroxyacetophenone and dihydroxyacetophenone see supp table s1 these basic findings are consistent with research showing that attack of hydroxyl ions on the aromatic ring is the favored process during bpa degradation by various aops including electrochemical oxidation 36 37 87 a very small portion of bpa intermediates remained in solution due to a small difference between mineralization 84 and removal efficiency 93 based on literature data oxidized bpa derivates express lower endocrine disrupting activity than bpa 88 89 the existence of these intermediates is consistent with literature data indicating a mechanism presented in supplementary see supp fig s7 3 6 stability and recyclability of sno2 mwcnt electrode in order to check the stability and recyclability of sno2 mwcnt electrode the measurements of bpa degradation efficiency and the xrpd analysis of electrode material before and after four cycles of electrolysis at a current density of 15 ma cm 2 were done changes in the structure after cycling on the xrpd patterns of the sample see supp fig s8 were not noticed also the efficiency of bpa degradation does not change significantly about 6 decrease these results clearly indicate that the prepared electrode is sufficiently stable and possesses the possibility of recycling which is useful for practical applications these results clearly indicate that the prepared electrode is sufficiently stable and possesses the possibility of recycling which is useful for practical applications 4 conclusion this work proposed green electrochemical technology based on electrochemical oxidation with sno2 mwcnt nanocomposite anode for bpa removal in acidic sulphate rich wastewater results imply that sno2 nanoparticles dimension of 10 15 nm are attached to mwcnts also the increase in the effective surface of the sno2 mwcnt electrode predicts their good electrochemical properties lsv measurement displays a higher overpotential for oxygen evolution of sno2 mwcnt electrodes compared to bare ss and mwcnt electrodes pointing to higher electrochemical activity for degradation of organic molecules including bpa presented investigations confirm that oxidation of bpa occurs by indirectly mechanism with oh sno2 mwcnt electrode exhibits dual behavior with dominance of chemisorption and results from eis investigation implies a small contribution from physisorption this process is predominantly adsorption controlled particularly the results indicated that metal oxide carbon base electrodes can be used successfully for bpa removal using electrochemical oxidation and applied current density is an important factor and significantly affects the removal efficiency the main benefit of the suggested approach is the low cost and ease of the synthesis process of anodic materials without employing expensive chemicals on the other hand the economic cost effectiveness of the process requires as low as possible lower energy consumption is related to lower treatment time and lower current therefore the focus of our future study will be on enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of anodic materials toward bpa most likely through the creation of composites made of our material and the same rare

12680,bisphenol a bpa is an organic pollutant that is widely spread in waterbody with effluents as a result of its extensive use in the plastics industry it posses to the class of compounds that are endocrine disruptors and has a great negative impact on living organisms therefore the progress in development of green technology for bpa removal from the aquatic media is crucial for environmental protection this paper presents bpa removal by electrochemical oxidation on sno2 mwcnt tin dioxide multi walled carbon nanotube nanocomposite anode the nanocomposite was structural and morphological characterized by x ray powder diffraction and transmission electron microscopy electrochemical properties of the sno2 mwcnt anode were investigated using cyclic voltammetry linear sweep voltammetry and electrical impedance spectroscopy the electrochemical behavior of anodes toward bpa in sodium sulfate solutions has shown that bpa is oxidized by indirectly mechanism via hydroxyl radicals verified by quenching tests electrolysis of bpa has been done in galvanostatic regime at current densities 2 5 5 0 10 0 15 0 and 20 0 ma cm 2 in 0 1 m sodium sulfate supported electrolyte ph 4 0 complete degradation of bpa was accomplished after 5 h of electrolysis at a current density of 20 ma cm 2 the proposed electrochemical technology using a low cost sno2 mwcnt electrode is promising for wastewater bpa removal keywords bisphenol a electrochemical oxidation functionalized mwcnt sno2 mwcnt data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction many frequently used chemicals in everyday life like pharmaceuticals personal care products surfactants various industrial additives and pesticides are compounds that cause disrupting the function of the endocrine system endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs are compounds that mimic hormones that affect the growth and development of reproductive organs in humans and animals one of them is bisphenol a bpa or 2 2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane 1 it has been noted that bpa binds to estrogen receptors and oral ingestion of bpa is harmful to the reproductive organs of animals 1 3 due to their hazardous health effects the u s environmental protection agency us epa the european union and the world wildlife fund imf placed bpa on the list of priority pollutants 4 bpa is one of the most applicable chemicals in the industry which is why it is produced on large scale over 8 billion pounds each year worldwide in the plastics industry 5 6 it is used as a precursor in the synthesis of polycarbonates and epoxy resins which are employed for the manufacture of a lot of commercial products like relay parts lamp sockets safety switches power plugs fluorescent tube sockets current meters polycarbonate bottles including water and milk bottle and different epoxy protective primers and coatings for food and drink cans adhesives etc 7 due to its extensive industrial and commercial applications the highest concentrations of bpa are found in industrial and municipal wastewater 8 and landfill leachates 9 also a lack of attention to environmental issues causes to bpa found its way into rivers seas and soils 10 13 the latest studies have confirmed the presence of bpa in urine placental tissue and human blood 14 16 wastewater treatment containing bpa and its derivatives is a frequent problem in environmental chemistry various degradation technologies including adsorption 17 24 biodegradation 25 26 and photocatalytic oxidation 27 28 were applied however these methods are mostly complex and expensive and can lead to incomplete degradation and the formation of more ecotoxic products therefore in recent decades significant attention has been paid to the development of more environmentally friendly and cost effective technologies such as advanced oxidation processes aops aops encompass a group of depollution methods that use hydroxyl radicals oh the strongest known oxidant for the oxidation of organic pollutants including electrochemical oxidation electrochemical oxidation is one of the most promising processes for removing organic pollutants from water and wastewater because it is using electrons as a clean reagent there are no chemicals involved and toxic waste after the treatment is completed it can be performed directly by the charge transfer between the surface of the anode and organic pollutants or indirectly via reactive oxygen species ros formed on the surface anode 29 one of the main ros types is adsorbed oh or surface bound oh onto the anode surface which is generated as an intermediate oxygen evolution during the oxidation of water molecules in the electrochemical system electrochemical oxidation provides high efficiency and low resource consumption and it requires simple apparatus and experimental conditions the efficiency of the electrochemical oxidation process toward a specific organic pollutant depends on the performance of the anode materials in this view many research groups including ours are dealing with developing novel or testing well known anodic materials for bpa removal from aquatic media m govindaraj et al 30 were used graphite anodes and obtained efficiency in terms of chemical oxygen demand cod removal of 73 3 while jun zhaoa et al 31 showed that the removal efficiency of cod could be reached up to 92 2 on new synthetized ti based co3o4 pbo2 composite anodes recently samarghandi et al 32 applied graphite Î² pbo2 electrodes and granular activated carbon for bpa degradation in a three dimensional electrochemical reactor obtained bpa removal efficiency was 98 8 a lot of research studies showed that the boron doped diamond bdd electrode has exceptional efficiency in bpa electrochemical degradation murugananthan et al 33 have proved that the total mineralization has been achieved only on bdd compared to pt gc electrode during 14 h of electrolysis also pereira et al 34 found the best performance of nb bdd compared to ti pt b pbo2 and tio2 ruo2 anodes however widely application of bdd electrodes was limited with high price complexity of scaled up preparation technology on the other hand sno2 based anodes have many advantages including that they are inexpensive non toxic and simple in their preparation procedure applications of pure sno2 in the field of electrochemical oxidation technology seemed to be further restricted by its poor electric conductivity and stability 35 this problem can be overcome by reducing grain size to nanometer dimension doping with metals nanoparticles or carbon based nanomaterial antimony doped tin dioxide electrodes sno2 sb showed excellent electrocatalytic performance for bpa electrochemical oxidation compared to the pt and ti ruo2 anodes 36 nevertheless the short service life and durability of the ti sb sno2 anode still need to be greatly improved for commercial application a significant improvement in electrode performance and electrocatalytic activity for bpa oxidation was achieved by wu et al 37 and xue et al 38 using ptfe cnt and pbo2 modified sno2 sb electrodes the introduction of carbon based materials such as graphene oxide carbon nanotubes reduced graphene oxide improves the conductivity and structural stability of the electrodes 39 41 the doping of carbon based nanomaterial such as multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnt into a metal oxide electrode can lead to enhanced conductivity and electrocatalytic activity electrode thus enabling their successful electrochemical application it is well known that sno2 mwcnt nanocomposite anode is efficiently used as an electrochemical sensor for many organic compounds 42 nevertheless to our knowledge there are no publications that explain the efficiency of oxidation and bpa degradation on sno2 mwcnt anode in wastewaters and electrochemical behavior toward bpa in this complex electrode system according to the generally accepted classification depending on the type of interaction with oh and values of overvoltage for oxygen evolution oep electrode materials was classified into active with low oep formed chemisorbed species partially mineralize organic pollutants and non active with high oep physisorbed oh reacts directly with organic molecules leading to their total mineralization in co2 and h2o 43 studies 44 have shown that the nature physical and chemical characteristics of anodic material like lattice structure grain size the crystal plane and the existence of the functional groups on the electrode surface play a critical role in formation of different types of oh sno2 electrodes are typical examples of nonactive electrodes and carbon based anodes like mwcnt show active behavior 29 45 46 the literature reviews 47 show that rigid division of the electrode materials is not quite entirely acceptable and anode material can exhibit dual behavior with the predominance of one over other characteristic also oep as a critical index for evaluation of the electrode oh generation performance might be an inappropriate indicator of capacity for oh generation based on this it is very interesting to investigate electrochemical behavior of bpa on combined active non active composite and consequently whether it leads to the partial or total mineralization of bpa in presented study bpa removal by electrochemical oxidation on the synthesized sno2 mwcnt anode was investigated for this purpose a sno2 mwcnt nanocomposite was synthesized and structural x ray powder diffraction spectrometry xrpd and transmission electron microscopy tem and electrochemical cyclic voltammetry cv linear sweep voltammetry lsv and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis characterization were done based on these characterization methods behavior of the anode material was described as well as the kinetics and mechanisms of bpa degradation on it electrochemical removal of bpa from sulphate based aquatic electrolyte as a model of communal and industrial wastewaters demonstrates an appropriate simulation of bpa elimination from contaminated environmental media 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials for the synthesis of sno2 mwcnt nanocomposite following chemicals

of mwcnt functionalization of mwcnt were performed using a slightly modified method described in the literature 48 49 25 mg of mwcnt was mixed with 3 m nitric acid using a magnetic stirrer for 1 5 h at a constant temperature of 70 c obtained mixture was filtered and washed several times with deionized water until ph neutral was achieved ph was monitored with ph indicator stripes the precipitate

described by kose et al 50 the nanosized sno2 synthesis procedure was started by the addition of 2 26 g of tin ii chloride dehydrate in 20 ml of deionized water in order to precipitate tin hydroxide 25 ammonia solution was added while ph was 9 the obtained white precipitate was filtered and thoroughly washed with diluted ammonia solution until a negative reaction to the chlorides silver nitrate test firstly tin hydroxide was dissolved in glacial acetic acid and then ethylene glycol was added the mixture was stirred at a constant temperature of 70 c until acetic acid had evaporated and the orange gel was obtained the gel was dried overnight in an oven at 120 c finally the dried gel was annealed at 600 c in an air atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 c min 1 and held at the same

electrochemical cell ag agcl was used as a reference electrode and a pt mesh as a counter electrode while the bare ss mwcnt and sno2 mwcnt specimen served as the working electrodes the electrochemical oxidation was carried out in a two electrode electrolytic cell in which prepared sno2 mwcnt electrode was used as anode and a ss plate of the same surface area 2 cm2 as a cathode these electrodes were immersed in 60 ml 0 1 m na2so4 solution ph 4 containing 30 mg l 1 bpa with a distance of 1 cm between them chronopotentiometry experiments with the applied different current densities 2 5 5 0 10 0 15

reflections for mwcnt sno2 composite were assigned and indexed in agreement with the jcpds cards joint committee of powder diffraction studies the diffraction peaks at 25 9 and 43 1 were observed in fig 1 black line and can be ascribed to reflection from 002 and 100 planes of graphite jspds card no 96 101 1061 53 confirming that treatment of mwcnt using weak acid does not change the structure of mwcnt on the xrpd pattern of sno2 mwcnt shown in fig 1 red line was noticed dominant reflections appeared at 26 5 33 8 37 9 38 9 43 0 51 8 54 8 and 57 8 which can be ascribed to the 110 101 200 110 210 211 220 and 002 crystal planes of sno2 this indicates that prepared sno2 nanoparticles crystallize in rutile type tetragonal structure having space group p4 2 m n m jcpds file no 41 1445 54 also the highly intense strong and sharp peaks prove the high crystallinity of sno2 in the composite however in the xrpd pattern of sno2 mwcnt the diffraction peak related to mwcnt was absent perhaps due to the overlapping of the 110 plane of sno2 and 002 plane of mwcnt low crystallinity of nanotubes compared to sno2 55 56 the mean crystallite size determined by sherrer s equation 57 was found to be d xrpd 13 1 nm and confirms the formation of nanocrystalline sno2 tem examinations confirmed the success of the attachment of sno2 nanoparticles to mwcnts as shown in fig 2 it can be seen fig 2 that a large number of small sno2 nanoparticles are linked to mwcnt surfaces probably via carbonyl co or hydroxyl oh functional groups created by acid treatment of nanotubes decorated sno2 nanoparticles were primarily spherical in shape with a few polygonal shapes see insert in fig 2c the estimated average particle size in the nanocomposite is about 15 nm which is in agreement with the previous xrpd experiment also it is interesting to note the agglomeration of sno2 particles on the mwcnt chains which probably occurs due to ultrasonic treatment during composite preparation through the edx microanalysis fig 2h it is confirmed that elements o c and sn are present in the synthesized nanocomposite also signals observed at 1 8 and 9 kev originate from cu which is used as a sample holder during tem measurements the elemental mapping images show the distribution of c fig 2e sn fig 2f and o fig 2g in the selected area which is represented in the haadf micrograph fig 2d in the ir spectrum of functionalized mwcnt blue line in fig 3 the bands existing at 2853 cm 1 and 2924 cm 1 can be assigned to stretching vibrations of the c h group 58 after functionalization of the mwcnt the new intensive bands corresponding to stretching vibrations of co 1385 cm 1 and co group 1630 cm 1 appeared also two new peaks at 1715 cm 1 and 1100 cm 1 emerged in the ir spectrum of functionalized mwcnt indicating the existence of co and co stretching vibrations of the carboxylic groups cooh respectively 59 stretching vibrations from oh in a range of 3300 3600 cm 1 could be attributed to the free oh groups of carboxylic acids or water adsorbed onto mwcnt surfaces 60 3 2 electrochemical characterization of the electrodes the electrochemical characterization and behavior of the working electrodes firstly were examined in standard electrolytes such as 0 1 m kcl and then the actual behavior of the electrodes in real systems acidic 0 1 m na2so4 was investigated using cv eis and lsv cv is a powerful tool for the investigation of electrode processes and chemical reactions in a solution that are initiated by charge transfer at the electrode in combination with eis and lsv important information about electrochemical behavior and catalytic properties of the prepared electrodes can be obtained 3 2 1 the effective surface area and electrochemical behavior of working electrodes cyclic voltammograms of 5 mm potassium hexacyanoferrate in 0 1 m kcl at 100 mv s 1 for bare ss mwcnt sno2 and sno2 mwcnt electrodes fig 4 clearly indicate that all investigated electrodes except sno2 provide an electrochemical response to the tested redox pare fe2 fe3 compared to the bare ss electrode modified electrodes showed an increase in the redox currents of the fe2 3 couple the peak to peak separation Î´e between oxidation and reduction peaks of sno2 mwcnt was smaller than in the case of bare ss and mwcnt modified electrodes Î´e from 166 mv to 186 mv respectively the increased values in comparison to the theoretical Î´e of 59 mv can be assigned to the heterogeneous structure of the modified electrodes this confirms that the modification process enhances the electrode interface by increasing the active surface area and forcing diffusion processes of ferrocyanide ions at the surface of the sno2 mwcnt working electrode as the scan rate increases the peak current rises continually supp fig s1a indicating that adsorption processes occur at the surface of the sno2 mwcnt electrode too also slight shifts in the peak potential with the increase of the scan rate toward more positive values confirm the adsorption nature of the processes occurs at the electrode solution interface the effective surface area of the working electrodes was expressed by the randles sevcik eq 1 61 62 1 i p 2 69 10 5 n 3 2 a d 0 1 2 v 1 2 c where i p a is the peak current n is the number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction n 1 in this case a cm2 is the effective surface area d cm2 s 1 is the diffusion coefficient for k3 fe cn 6 c mol cm 3 is the concentration of the reaction species in the electrolyte 5 10 6 for fe cn 6 4 and v v s 1 is the scan rate the effective surface area was calculated from the slope of the linear fit curve function i p f Î½1 2 shown in supp fig s1 obtained values are 1 620 2 290 and 4 051 cm2 for mwcnt bare ss and sno2 mwcnt electrodes respectively this indicates the effective surface area of the sno2 mwcnt electrode is greater than bare ss and mwcnt so better electrochemical performance toward organic pollutant degradation can be expected eis is an effective technique for the detailed investigation of interfacial phenomena between the solution and the surface of modified electrodes therefore it can provide important information about electrode reaction kinetics and the corresponding mechanism based on these findings we estimated the electrochemical behavior of sno2 mwcnt mwcnt ss and sno2 electrodes in a real medium acidic 0 1 m na2so4 solution using eis measurement was performed in the frequency range from 0 1 hz to 1 mhz nyquist diagrams and the corresponding equivalent electrical circuit models are shown in supp fig s2 as can be seen in supp fig s2a the nyquist plot of sno2 mwcnt consists of a semicircular part at intermediate and higher frequencies domains corresponding to the electron transfer process and a straight line at lower frequencies which represents adsorption controlled processes the eic spectra were fitted according to the model presented in supp fig s2b with the following components r s is the uncompensated electrolyte solution resistance r ct is the charge transfer resistance at the electrode solution interface which have an impact on the electrocatalytic activity of the electrode cpe in the intermediate and high frequency domains is the constant phase element represents electric double layer capacitance parallel r ads q ads in low frequency domains refers to the capacitive resistance r ads q ads arising behavior of the hydrated layer promoted by the adsorption desorption of hydroxyl radical 63 the results demonstrate two things first the r ct 212 Ï is much smaller than the determined r ads 1 7 106 Ï which implies that the discharge process on the interface mwcnt sno2 electrode is primarily controlled by the resistance of the adsorption desorption of the species which create a hydrated layer consequently the electrocatalytic activity of the electrode is dependent on the adherence of the hydroxyl radical on the electrode surface the lower value of r ads indicate weakly adhered hydroxyl radicals hence it is easily available for the oxidation of organics 64 second we have observed a decrease in the r ct 212 Ï of mwcnt sno2 compared to the r ct of mwcnt 496 Ï and bare ss 8 0 103 Ï electrodes supp fig s2 which is an indication of enhanced interfacial properties of the mwcnt sno2 electrode and improved transport of charge through solution electrode interface and better electrocatalytic activity similar results were confirmed with the cv measurements the observed better reversibility of the process and therefore a greater diffusion layer on the sno2 mwcnt working electrode in relation to other electrodes confirms that the modification process was done successfully due to the expected progress of the electrode interface there is also a certain improvement in electrocatalytic properties 3 2 2 possibility for oxygen evolution reaction fig 5a shows the lsv curves of bare ss and modified ss electrodes with the sno2 mwcnt and sno2 mwcnt nanocomposite in 0 1 m na2so4 solution at 25 c the measured potentials vs the ag agcl were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode rhe scale via the nernst eq 2 2 e rhe e ag agcl 0 059 ph e ag agcl 0 where e rhe is the converted potential vs rhe e ag agcl is the experimental potential measured against ag agcl reference electrode and e ag agcl 0 is the standard potential of ag agcl at 25 c 0 1976 v vs rhe compared to other modified electrodes modified mwcnt at the same current density has the lowest oxygen evolution potential 1 77 v vs rhe and consequently higher electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution the literature review 43 65 shows that electrodes with lower oxygen evolution potential have higher electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction and have active behavior for oxidation of organics pollutants 43 also a carbon electrode is a typical representative of active electrodes so it is not surprising that mwcnt as a carbon material shows the same behavior on the other hand a sno2 electrode shows non active behaviors and the highest oxygen evolution potential 2 57 v vs rhe see fig 5a therefore the sno2 mwcnt electrode shows the potential for the oxygen evolution reaction between these two electrodes at 1 89 v vs rhe and intermediate behavior due to its high resistance sno2 displays a very low current whence mwcnt as carbon material with excellent electrocatalytic properties is added to increase their electric conductivity well known advantages of sno2 such as being inexpensive non toxic and the simplicity of its preparation procedure favor its use as a material suitable for the preparation of anodes for electrochemical application more details about the catalytic behavior of the prepared electrodes including basic oxygen evolution kinetic parameters tafel slope b intercept a exchange current density j o and oxygen evolution potential e of the electrodes were obtained by tafel analysis see supp text s1 linear fitting curves of the bare ss and modified electrode and the results of oxygen evolution parameters are summarized in fig 5b and table 1 respectively it is well known that oxygen evolution parameters depend on the structure of the materials electrode higher exchange current density and smaller tafel slope are obtained for ss mwcnt and sno2 mwcnt electrodes compared to sno2 this means the modified electrode with mwcnt and nanocomposite sno2 mwcnt makes the faster electron transfer process for reaction evaluation oxygen compared to sno2 electrodes leading to better electrocatalytic properties for oxygen evolution the observed slightly lower tafel slope of the nanocomposite sno2 mwcnt electrode compared to mwcnt is probably related only to the change of mechanism for the oxygen evolution process 3 3 electrochemical oxidation of bpa the electrochemical behavior of bpa on the mwcnt sno2 electrode was examined on the basis of the change of shape and characteristics of the cv curves obtained at different bpa concentrations in 0 1 m na2so4 ph 4 0 sulfates were chosen to improve the mobility of ionic species and as models of sulfate rich wastewater from the food textile and paint and varnish industries acidic ph was selected based on literature data 66 67 which have been shown that in the acidic range degradation of bpa is favorable however in an alkaline solution co2 obtained from degradation exists as hco3 and co3 2 ions which are known as strong oh scavengers and therefore inhibit bpa oxidation by oh as can be seen from fig 6a cv curves have the same shape without the appearance of new peaks in the presence and absence of bpa these prompt the conclusion that bpa oxidation does not occur directly by electron transfer between the anode surface and bpa with the rising of bpa concentration in supporting electrolytes up to 400 mg l 1 an increase of the anode peak current and a slight shift of pick potential to positive values 1 14 v to 1 18 v are observed confirming that the oxidation of bpa occurred it is interesting to point out that with a further increase in the concentration of bpa probably due to the occupation of active sites on the electrode surface by bpa oxidation products electropolymerization occurs i e blocking the electrode surface and the anode peak current decreases since bpa structurally consists of 2 linked methylated molecules of phenol it is expected that its electrochemical behavior is similar to phenol based on the literature review 29 45 it can be assumed that bpa probably is oxidized indirectly via oh how the electrode process will take place depends on whether the electrode is active or non active the sno2 electrode belongs to non active electrodes with high overvoltage for oxygen evolution so degradation of organic molecules takes place by indirect mechanism via physisorbed oh our results see tafel analysis demonstrated that the overvoltage for oxygen evaluation reduces with the addition of mwcnt to sno2 and organic molecules on the modified electrode also are degrading indirectly but via chemisorbed oh due to the strong interaction of the chemisorbed oh with the surface of active electrodes higher oxides or superoxides mo are produced which further oxidizes organic pollutants r eqs 5 6 5 m oh mo h e 6 mo r m ro the scan rates v affect the peak currents i p a of bpa at mwcnt sno2 fig 6b shows that i p a increases continuously with the scan rate on the constant bpa concentration a linear relationship was found between i p a in the scan range of 10 100 mv s 1 insert of fig 6b the obtained regression equations was i p a Î¼a 1 2 0 0975 v mv s 1 r 2 0 984 also peak to peak separation Î´e potential is independent with scan rate all of this is expected for the redox reaction of surface adsorbed species meanwhile a linear relationship was also found between ln i p a and ln v supp fig s3 their relationship was expressed as ln i p a ma 0 7078 ln v v s 1 4 6587 r 2 0 985 where the slope is 0 7078 according to literature 68 when a slope value is close to 0 5 it implies to diffusion controlled electrode processes and for values of slope close to 1 0 electrode processes are adsorption controlled it demonstrates that both control processes contribute to the oxidation of bpa predominant adsorption with a minor part of diffusion 68 similar kinetic was observed by other authors 67 69 3 4 removal efficiency and degradation reaction kinetics of bpa for evaluation of the proposed electrode material bpa was oxidized on sno2 mwcnt anode in an electrochemical cell in order to monitor the degradation of bpa in the electrolyte we determined the initial concentration of bpa and its change during electrolysis using the gc ms method the presented results confirmed the findings in the literature about decreasing bpa concentration due to oxidation on the anode 36 70 72 electrolytic oxidation of 30 mg l 1 bpa was performed at different current densities 2 5 5 0 10 0 15 0 and 20 0 ma cm 2 based on fig 7 it can be noticed that with the decline of the current density the removal efficiency decreases which is consistent with data from the literature 36 70 there is a significant difference between the degradation at a current density of 2 5 ma cm 2 and 20 ma cm 2 where the efficiency removals are 39 34 and 99 00 respectively on the other hand the difference between the degradation efficiency at currents of 20 0 ma cm 2 and 15 0 ma cm 2 is minor 6 indicating that a further increase in current density does not particularly affect the degradation efficiency the biggest decline of bpa concentration in the electrolyte can be observed in the first hour of electrolytic oxidation and follows the growth trend with current density and amounts up to 20 30 in relation to the initial concentration of bpa this can be explained by the fact that energy is used not only for the degradation of bpa but also for its oxidation products and their further degradation also it is possible that due to the increased number of oxidized molecules originated by bpa degradation for bpa molecules it is more difficult to migrate to the anode and thus there is a decrease in efficiency in the further course of electrolysis however there are implications in the literature 73 74 that bpa polymerization occurs at the anode which also slows down its degradation degradation efficiency of bpa compared to mineralization efficiency of bpa in terms toc removal see supp fig s4 is quite low in the first 2 h of electrolysis afterwards it was increasing rapidly during the rest of test this implies that bpa was oxidized to other organic compounds before it is fully converted to co2 and h2o about 84 of bpa is completely mineralized after 5 h of treatment at a current density of 15 0 ma cm 2 the kinetics rate constant of the bpa removal process followed the pseudo first order reaction see supp text s2 which is in line with the literature data on electrochemical degradation of bpa 66 71 the k values were 0 001 0 002 0 006 0 009 and 0 013 min 1 at the current densities of 2 5 5 0 10 0 15 0 and 20 0 ma cm 2 respectively the main reason for elevated k value is greater production of hydroxyl radicals due to larger current density in addition kinetic rate constant of the bpa removal was used to calculate the electric energy per order ee 0 as an effective parameter to estimate energy consumption for this process ee 0 presents the amount of energy required to reduce 90 of the polutant concentration in 1 m3 of the electrolyte the equation is shown in supplementary text s3 75 76 calculated ee 0 shows that the rise of the current density leads to a slight decline in energy consumption from 9 40 kwh m 3 to 9 38 kwh m 3 on current density of 2 5 ma cm 2 and 5 ma cm 2 and 7 20 kwh m 3 7 00 kwh m 3 and 6 90 kwh m 3 on 10 ma cm 2 15 ma cm 2 and 20 ma cm 2 respectively especially as the current density exceeded 10 ma cm 2 ee 0 values are almost constant indicating that under the higher current bpa degradation was no longer controlled by current density overall the presented electrochemical system is more efficient in terms of bpa degradation operative cost based on energy consumption than the previous studies reported by govindaraj et al 30 who employed graphite electrodes and consuming was approximately 18 24 to 39 36 kwh m 3 and dianati et al 77 who reported an ee 0 of 23 06 to 99 96 kwh m 3 for the degradation of 10 100 mg l 1 bpa using photocatalytic technology in table 2 comparison of bpa degradation under similar conditions on sno2 mwcnt composite and other different electrodes reported in the literature was shown the experiments were performed in sodium sulfate in acid medium at a current density of 20 0 ma cm 2 for 5 h or more see supp fig 5 the presented results for bpa efficiency removal were from 78 8 for ti sno2 sb electrode to 100 0 for bdd electrode for all exhibited electrodes the electrolysis time lasts 6 h except for sno2 mwcnt and bdd electrodes if we take into account the electrolysis time and the efficiency of bpa degradation the obtained results for the sno2 mwcnt electrode stands out compared to other electrodes except the bdd electrode 3 5 mechanism study the identification of the ros types produced in the system during electrochemical oxidation of bpa was done by free radical quenching test as reported in the literature 75 78 methanol is typically quencher for both sulfate so4 and hydroxyl radical tba is considered as an effective quenching agent only for oh while ffa is used for singlet oxygen 1o2 determination as it is shown in fig 8 the bpa removal efficiency was decreased by introducing 2 m meoh from 92 96 to 88 50 and 2 m tba from 92 96 to 69 15 into the reaction system after 5 h of electrolysis the tba inhibitor effects are stronger than meoh which can be explained by its different values of dielectric constant due to higher dielectric constant meoh 33 7 has stronger hydrophilicity and react with oh in the bulk solution while tba 12 47 as poor hydrophilicity compound can be easily adsorbed on the surface of electrode and scavenge both surface bound oh and oh in the bulk solution a similar effect of scavengers was obtained by other authors studying the degradation of phenolic compounds 79 80 compared to other quenchers used in this study the strongest inhibitory effect shows ffa only 35 86 of bpa could be removed when ffa was added to the system it is proof of singlet 1o2 participation to the electrochemical oxidation bpa actually during electrochemical oxidation oxygen is constantly evolution at the anode and then partially dissolves in the electrolyte singlet oxygen is formed during the reduction of dissolved oxygen at the cathode 81 and supports the electrochemical removal of bpa however a few numerous studies 75 82 84 demonstrated that ffa mainly interacts with other ros which are possibly formed in reaction medium due to non negligible reactivity of ffa with oh and previously confirmed formation of oh radicals in a significant amount during electrochemical oxidation their contribution to ffa test can be included the concentration of oh radical production was obtained by measurements of h2o2 formation in system for the time of degradation see supp fig 6 it is calculated as difference between hydrogen peroxide formation with and without tba scavenger using the method proposed by sellers et al 85 and zhao et al 86 preliminary tests on a mass spectrometer in negative mode indicate the existence of hydroxylated derivatives of bpa catechol dicatechol quinones which means that so4 cannot play crucial role in bpa removal process as the electrolysis progressed in contrast to the first hours where fragments of large masses m z 200 were detected a peaks at smaller masses can be noticed with mass fragments pointing to isopropenylphenol hydroquinone hydroxyacetophenone and dihydroxyacetophenone see supp table s1 these basic findings are consistent with research showing that attack of hydroxyl ions on the aromatic ring is the favored process during bpa degradation by various aops including electrochemical oxidation 36 37 87 a very small portion of bpa intermediates remained in solution due to a small difference between mineralization 84 and removal efficiency 93 based on literature data oxidized bpa derivates express lower endocrine disrupting activity than bpa 88 89 the existence of these intermediates is consistent with literature data indicating a mechanism presented in supplementary see supp fig s7 3 6 stability and recyclability of sno2 mwcnt electrode in order to check the stability and recyclability of sno2 mwcnt electrode the measurements of bpa degradation efficiency and the xrpd analysis of electrode material before and after four cycles of electrolysis at a current density of 15 ma cm 2 were done changes in the structure after cycling on the xrpd patterns of the sample see supp fig s8 were not noticed also the efficiency of bpa degradation does not change significantly about 6 decrease these results clearly indicate that the prepared electrode is sufficiently stable and possesses the possibility of recycling which is useful for practical applications these results clearly indicate that the prepared electrode is sufficiently stable and possesses the possibility of recycling which is useful for practical applications 4 conclusion this work proposed green electrochemical technology based on electrochemical oxidation with sno2 mwcnt nanocomposite anode for bpa removal in acidic sulphate rich wastewater results imply that sno2 nanoparticles dimension of 10 15 nm are attached to mwcnts also the increase in the effective surface of the sno2 mwcnt electrode predicts their good electrochemical properties lsv measurement displays a higher overpotential for oxygen evolution of sno2 mwcnt electrodes compared to bare ss and mwcnt electrodes pointing to higher electrochemical activity for degradation of organic molecules including bpa presented investigations confirm that oxidation of bpa occurs by indirectly mechanism with oh sno2 mwcnt electrode exhibits dual behavior with dominance of chemisorption and results from eis investigation implies a small contribution from physisorption this process is predominantly adsorption controlled particularly the results indicated that metal oxide carbon base electrodes can be used successfully for bpa removal using electrochemical oxidation and applied current density is an important factor and significantly affects the removal efficiency the main benefit of the suggested approach is the low cost and ease of the synthesis process of anodic materials without employing expensive chemicals on the other hand the economic cost effectiveness of the process requires as low as possible lower energy consumption is related to lower treatment time and lower current therefore the focus of our future study will be on enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of anodic materials toward bpa most likely through the creation of composites made of our material and the same rare

12681,a temperature sensitive hydrogel modified with sewage sludge ash ssa was used as an advanced draw agent for forward osmosis fo application in treating chromium containing wastewater the performance of the modified hydrogel ssa tsh was measured in terms of the swelling and deswelling properties as well as adsorption and desorption effects on cr vi chemical oxygen demand cod total phosphorous tp and ammonium nh4 n in chromium containing wastewater furthermore the efficiencies of wastewater treatment water flux and the reusability of the ssa tsh as draw agent in the fo process fo ssa tsh using a commercially available thin film composite membrane sterlitech were also investigated the results indicated that fo ssa tsh achieved high removal rates of pollutants cr vi 96 9 97 4 cod 97 1 97 4 tp 97 7 99 6 and nh4 n 76 8 77 9 in various cr vi concentrations 0 40 mg l due to the high rejection rate of fo membrane and notable adsorption capacity of the hydrogel moreover the average water flux of fo ssa tsh 1 95 2 02 lmh was nearly twice as much as that of the fo with pure temperature sensitive hydrogel as draw agent fo tsh 1 33 1 42 lmh in 24 h chromium containing wastewater treatment in addition ssa tsh with excellent deswelling property exhibited high water recovery performance and good reusability in low cost and energy consumption after the fo permeation process for wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords chromium containing wastewater temperature sensitive hydrogel sewage sludge ash forward osmosis draw agent data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction forward osmosis fo as an emerging osmotic pressure driven membrane separation technology has been demonstrated great potential for desalination and wastewater treatment to produce high quality effluent 1 this membrane based separation process is driven by the osmotic pressure difference between the draw agent and feed solution 2 therefore the draw agent with high osmotic pressure can greatly promote the efficiency of fo water treatment besides high osmotic pressure easy separation from water reusable non toxic and harmless should be the characteristics of an ideal draw agent 3 especially the water recovery and the diluted draw agent regeneration account for the main energy requirements in most fo applications 4 therefore to justify the sustainability of the fo process it is imperative to develop a new class of draw agents with high osmotic pressure and low regenerative energy consumption 5 in our previous research after the incineration treatment of the surplus sewage sludge ss from the wastewater treatment plant the residue sewage sludge ash ssa with abundant silica as the additive was prepared for the temperature sensitive hydrogel as draw agent for fo application 6 it not only alleviated the environmental problems caused by the increasing excess ss and ssa but also increased the water flux of the fo and lowered the energy consumption for water recovery and draw agent regeneration the ssa based temperature sensitive hydrogel was employed as the draw agent in fo process and the average water fluxes achieved 2 33 lmh with di water as feed solution which is nearly twice as much as the hydrogel without adding ssa 1 18 lmh the ssa based hydrogel also had excellent performance when different concentrations of nacl 2000 5000 8000 ppm were used as feed solution as compared with the unmodified hydrogel in addition after 4 times of regeneration dewatering at 60 c water bath after 10 min the water flux of ssa based temperature sensitive hydrogel was restored to 94 4 of the initial value 7 chromium cr which is one of the well known poisonous and toxic heavy metals generally exists in the form of trivalent cr iii and hexavalent cr vi oxidized species in many wastewater of industries including metallurgy tanneries petroleum refining electroplating textiles and pigments 8 9 the cr iii is not toxic and relatively immobile but it can be oxidized into cr vi in the presence of mild oxidants 10 while cr vi is far more toxic than cr iii and can seriously affect human health by evoking diarrhea nausea epigastric pain hemorrhage and even digestive tract and lung cancer 9 11 13 furthermore other pollutants such as organic materials chemical oxygen demand cod total phosphorus tp and ammonium nh4 n are also found in chromium containing wastewater with extremely high amounts 2 13 14 due to the efficient separation of the hazardous pollutants from industrial wastewater fo with salt solutions as draw agent has been widely investigated for chromium containing wastewater reclamation 2 8 14 however the regeneration of salt solutions and water resource recovery generally needs nanofiltration nf 15 16 membrane distillation md 17 or even reverse osmosis ro 18 process with high energy consumption therefore as discussed above it is considered that the ssa based temperature sensitive hydrogel might be suitably used as draw agent in fo progress for chromium containing wastewater treatment in order to reclaim water resource and regenerate draw agent with lower cost and energy consumption furthermore the fo with hydrogel as draw agent might achieve high removal rate of pollutants in chromium containing wastewater due to excellent rejection rate of fo membrane 8 and relatively high adsorption rate of hydrogel 19 however according to research in the past decade the fo system with temperature sensitive hydrogel as draw agent still stayed in the filtration process of desalination 20 22 while the treatment of wastewater containing various substances including organic and inorganic contaminants has not yet been reported therefore in this study the temperature sensitive hydrogel modified by ssa was used as the draw agent for verifying the feasibility of the chromium containing wastewater treatment by the fo process the hydrogel characterization swelling and deswelling and adsorption and desorption of pollutants cr vi cod tp and nh4 n and the fo performance including water flux water recovery draw agent regeneration were investigated moreover the pollutants removal mechanism of fo system through fo membrane rejection and the hydrogel adsorption would be studied in this way it not only achieves waste recycling but also meets the requirements of a sustainable growth strategy and improves the sustainability of wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials n isopropyl acrylamide nipam and the accelerant n n n n tetramethylethylenediamine temed were purchased from macklin acrylic acid aa was purchased from tianjin zhiyuan chemical reagent the cross linker n n methylenebisacrylamide mba and the initiator ammonium persulfate aps were purchased from tianjin damao chemical reagent factory sodium alginate naalg was provided by aladdin the dewatered ss from guangzhou lijiao wastewater treatment plant was used as raw material after being dried for 3 days the ss was burned in a muffle furnace at 800 c for 1 h subsequently the obtained ssa was ground into 100 150 meshes after cooling at room temperature and washed with deionized di water 5 times finally the sample was dried in an oven at 103 c for 24 h the oxides contents contained in ss and ssa including the elements silicon alumina and iron are shown in table s1 it can be seen that the ssa 43 9 possessed higher content of silica than its precursor ss 39 0 which would be profitable to the enhancement of the hydrogel s swelling ability for fo process 6 the fo experiments were carried out by using a commercial flat thin film composite tfc fo membrane which belongs to aquaporin flat sheet membrane manufactured by aquaporin a s denmark and provided by sterlitech corporation usa as the supplier this membrane was selected as it had been widely used for several wastewater studies due to its extremely high rejection rate superior hydrophilicity and great water flux 8 23 24 and its basic information from the company s report is shown in table s2 the results of the membrane characterization zeta potential zs90 malvern uk and contact angle sl200a kino usa of the active and supportive layers are detailed in table 1 as shown in table 1 both sides of the fo membrane possessed negatively charged as their zeta potential values were negative in addition the fo membrane exhibited highly hydrophilic property which facilitated water transferring through the membrane and thus increased the water flux during fo process 23 24 furthermore the morphology and configuration of the pristine membrane were observed by scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 7001f jeol japan and the result is shown in fig 1 it can be found that the supportive layer s surface of the fo membrane showed a porous structure with the pore size range of 0 1 1 Î¼m while the active layer exhibited a dense pore structure that guaranteed the rejection of pollutant and provided the diffusion channels of water molecules before using the membrane it was soaked in di water overnight at room temperature to ensure complete wettability feed solution of fo was prepared by dissolving the required amount of potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 glucose monohydrate c6h12o6 h2o potassium dihydrogen phosphate kh2po4 and ammonium chloride nh4cl which acquired from tianjin zhiyuan chemical reagent 2 2 preparation and characterization of hydrogels 2 2 1 preparation of the hydrogels in this study the temperature sensitive hydrogels were prepared by following the method described in our previous study 7 in short ssa 0 or 2 5 wt in relation to nipam was dispersed in a solution in which naalg 0 04 g aa 0 0606 ml neutralized to 70 and nipam 2 0 g were dissolved after that the cross linking agent mba initiator aps and accelerant temed were added to the well stirred mixture under the protection of nitrogen and the monomers would be quickly polymerized into hydrogel then the obtained hydrogels were cut into small pieces and followed by 2 days of di water soaking and 1 day of 60 c drying in an oven the temperature sensitive hydrogel without adding ssa was named tsh and the hydrogel modified with 2 5 of ssa was denoted as ssa tsh 2 2 2 characterization of the hydrogels morphologies of the hydrogels were evaluated with sem jsm 7001f jeol japan the functional groups of these hydrogels were confirmed with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir tensor 27 bruker germany using a kbr pellet method 25 2 2 3 swelling and deswelling properties to study the swelling property 0 3 g of the prepared hydrogel was put in a nylon mesh bag and sealed before immersing into 500 ml of di water at 20 c the weight changes of hydrogel were recorded at regular time intervals the following eq 1 was used to calculate the swelling ratio of the hydrogel at certain time t 1 swelling ratio w t w d w d 100 where w d g is the weight of the initial dry hydrogel and w t g is the weight of the hydrogel at water adsorption time t min the deswelling behavior of the prepared hydrogel was also measured by the weighed method the equilibrated swollen hydrogel in di water at 20 c was transferred into di water at 60 c the weight changes of hydrogel were recorded at regular time intervals water retention ratio at desorption time t was defined in eq 2 2 water retention ratio w t w d w e w d 100 where w e g is the weight of equilibrated swollen hydrogel at 20 c and w t g is the weight of the hydrogel at water desorption time t min to measure the pollutants released from the hydrogels the cr vi concentration of the dehydrated water was determined based on the diphenylcarbazide method 26 other pollutants cod tp and nh4 n were measured with potassium dichromate method ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method and nessler s reagent spectrophotometry method respectively 2 2 2 4 adsorption and desorption of pollutants from aqueous solution k2cr2o7 cr vi c6h12o6 h2o cod kh2po4 tp and nh4cl nh4 n which were employed as pollutants in chromium containing wastewater were respectively prepared the stock solutions for adsorption experiments the four groups of adsorption solutions were diluted with the corresponding stock solution and the initial adsorption concentration of cr vi cod tp and nh4 n were 10 mg l 500 mg l 20 mg l and 20 mg l respectively subsequently 50 mg tsh and ssa tsh were respectively immersed in each of the pollutants solutions 50 ml the mixture was shaken in a thermostatic shaker cha s a chenghui china at 20 c and 120 r min for 12 h to ensure the equilibrium adsorption afterward the swollen hydrogels were heated at 60 c to release the adsorbed water and pollutants adsorption ratio and desorption ratio by the hydrogels were calculated using the following eqs 3 and 4 respectively 3 adsorption ratio c 0 v 0 c e v e c 0 v 0 100 4 desorption ratio c d v d c 0 v 0 c e v e 100 where c 0 mg l and c e mg l are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of aqueous solutions respectively v 0 l and v e l are the volume of the aqueous solutions in initial and equilibrium respectively and c d mg l and v d l are the concentration and the volume of solution released from the hydrogel dehydrated at 60 c 2 3 fo process the decontamination performance of the fo process with the prepared hydrogels as draw agents was carried out in a homemade fo setup fig 2 at room temperature the fo setup was assembled by a plastic centrifugal tube providing an effective membrane area of 6 605 cm2 membrane diameter 2 90 cm when the infiltration started the feed solution was added to the calibration line of 150 ml in a 250 ml beaker and then 0 3 g hydrogel tsh or ssa tsh as draw agent was placed on the supportive layer of the fo membrane a peristaltic pump was used to recirculate the feed to create the cross flow flow rate 0 057 l min in order to reduce the impact of external concentration polarization during the fo process the variation of feed solution weight was obtained by an analytical balance ps 4500 r2 radwag wagi elektroniczne poland max 4500 g d 0 01 g which was linked with a computer for real time data recording the two fos with tsh and ssa tsh as draw agents were denoted as fo tsh and fo ssa tsh respectively to investigate the removal rate of the pollutants by the fo system the experiments were conducted using synthetic chromium containing wastewater with various concentrations of cr vi 0 10 20 40 mg l and fixed concentrations of cod 500 mg l tp 20 mg l and nh4 n 20 mg l as feed solution and their properties were shown in table s3 after the fo process the effluent from the hydrogels was extracted by heating the hydrogel on an electromagnetic heating plate ms h280 pro dlab china at 60 c the dehydrated water was collected and measured its pollutants concentrations c d the total removal rate of various pollutants by fo system t removal rate by fo membrane m and removal rate by hydrogel h are respectively calculated by eqs 5 7 as followed 5 t c f c d c f 100 6 m 1 c f v f c f v f c f v f v f 100 7 h t m where c f c f and c d are the concentrations of the feed solution before and after filtration and the dehydrated water from the hydrogel respectively v f and v f are the volume of the feed solution before and after filtration respectively water flux l m2 h lmh of the fo process is determined by measuring the weight changes of feed solution with time and calculated from eq 8 8 water flux w Ïa t where w g and Ï g l are respectively decreasing water weight and the density of the feed solution and a m2 and t h are respectively the effective membrane area and the predetermined interval during the fo process 2 4 regeneration and reusability of hydrogels for fo process after the fo permeation was completed a temperature heating stimulus of 60 c water bath for 10 min was employed to dehydrate the swollen hydrogel then the regenerated hydrogel was used as draw agent directly in the next cycle of the fo process the above operation was repeated for 3 cycles the reuse ratio of the hydrogel was calculated by eq 9 9 reuse ratio j vn j v 0 100 where j v0 is the average water flux of the initial run lmh j vn is the average water flux after the nth n stands for 0 1 2 and 3 time of regeneration lmh 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 ftir to investigate the surface functional groups of the prepared polymer hydrogels the ftir spectra of tsh and ssa tsh were analyzed and the results are exhibited in fig s1 according to the ftir spectra of both hydrogels the characteristic absorption peaks of nh bending of amide ii bond and secondary co stretching of amide i bond in nipam respectively appeared at 1557 cm 1 and 1653 cm 1 in ftir spectra of tsh and ssa tsh 27 and the characteristic peaks of ch2 deformation vibration and ch2 ch stretching vibration of another raw material aa for hydrogel preparation could be respectively observed at 1457 cm 1 and 2933 cm 1 28 moreover the peak that emerged at 3431 cm 1 in the ftir spectrum of ssa tsh was assigned to stretching vibrations sioh group originated from ssa 7 3 1 2 sem the surface morphology of the two hydrogels was observed by sem and the result is presented in fig s2 as can be seen in fig s2 both prepared hydrogels exhibited a 3d continuous porous network with different sizes of pores such porous structure inside hydrogels would facilitate the rapid water molecules diffusion and thus improve the water adsorption 29 30 in addition the ssa tsh with additional physical cross linking inside its matrix showed a higher reticulated network than the pure hydrogel tsh indicating that it would be helpful to enhance the water adsorption ability due to the more specific surface area inside the hydrogel which was consistent with the swelling performance result as further discussed in section 3 2 3 2 swelling and deswelling properties both swelling and deswelling properties are the critical factors of the hydrogels as draw agent for fo application 4 21 the hydrogel with good swelling ability could enhance the osmosis pressure and thus increase the water flux of fo while the hydrogel with excellent deswelling performance would be easily regenerated in low energy consumption during the fo process therefore the swelling and deswelling kinetics of the hydrogels were measured in this work and the results are shown in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the swelling ratio of the two hydrogels increased rapidly in the initial 20 min followed by a slow rising stage until the maximum water absorption equilibrium was reached at 180 min it was observed that the hydrogel with ssa modification ssa tsh exhibited a higher swelling ratio of 65 5 g g than tsh of 53 0 g g at equilibrium time this would be attributed to the additional effect through forming hydrogen bonding between the silanol group sioh of ssa and the amino group nh and or hydroxyl group oh of the hydrogel leading to higher osmosis pressure 213 9 atm for tsh and 589 9 atm ssa tsh which was investigated in our previous work 7 for more water adsorption 31 furthermore the higher reticulated and porous network inside ssa tsh as shown in fig s2 increased the contact surface area between water molecule and hydrogel and thus enhanced the swelling ratio of the hydrogel 29 31 the ssa tsh with a higher swelling ratio was supposed to produce higher water flux during the fo process which would be further discussed in section 3 4 2 in addition the deswelling performance of the hydrogels can be also observed in fig 3 that both tsh and ssa tsh presented relatively fast deswelling rates at 60 c water bath and their water retention ratios dropped to similar values of 4 7 and 5 3 within 5 min respectively afterward they reached an equilibrium state at 10 min the water retention ratios of both hydrogels were 0 therefore the ssa tsh not only showed a great swelling performance but also displayed a comparable dewatering property with the pure temperature sensitive hydrogel tsh it implied that the hydrogel with ssa modification could both improve the water flux and alleviate the cost of water recovery and draw agent regeneration during the fo process which would be further discussed in section 3 4 3 the result of the pollutants contents of the dehydrated water from the two hydrogels is shown in table 2 as can be seen in table 2 none of the pollutants except for nh4 n 4 26 Î¼g g and 3 44 Î¼g g respectively could be found in the dehydrated water from the hydrogels the nh4 n in the hydrogel might be originated from the unreacted nipam inside the hydrogel as shown in ftir analysis in section 3 1 1 after the deswelling process through 60 c heating stimuli the nh4 n from the nipam might release into the dehydrated water 3 3 absorption and desorption abilities the effects of two hydrogels on the adsorption and desorption ratios of cr vi cod tp and nh4 n are shown in fig 4 as observed in fig 4 compared with tsh ssa tsh had better performances in adsorbing the cr vi cod tp and nh4 n with higher adsorption ratios from aqueous solutions however the desorption ratios of the ssa tsh for all the pollutants were less than those of tsh as depicted in fig 4 a the cr vi adsorption ratio of ssa tsh reached 6 27 which was higher than that of tsh merely 1 33 the result could be attributed to the higher swelling ratio of ssa tsh as shown in fig 3 and thus more water molecules accompanied by a certain amount of cr vi could permeate into the hydrogel during the adsorption process furthermore the aluminum oxide al2o3 and ferric oxide fe2o3 originated from the ssa which is shown in table s1 inside ssa tsh can combine with cr vi through surface complexation between the negatively charged cr vi cro4 2 and the hydroxyl compounds formed by the hydroxylation of al iii and fe iii in solution 32 33 therefore as the strong chemical interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate ssa tsh had more difficulty in desorbing cr vi under the same dehydration condition resulting in a far lower desorption ratio 6 81 than that of tsh 67 7 as shown in fig 4 a comparing the effects of the two hydrogels tsh and ssa tsh on adsorption of cod in fig 4 b it was found that they had similar adsorption ratios of 14 2 and 14 4 respectively it might be that the temperature sensitive hydrogel itself can achieve cod removal through chemical adsorption such as the electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding interactions 34 on the other hand as highly reactive activity of the metal hydroxo with the organic matter 35 the metallic oxides originated from ssa inside ssa tsh were also effective in reducing cod however the effect was not very significant furthermore owing to such strong chemical interaction between the hydrogels and organic compounds desorbing cod from the hydrogels under the heating condition became difficult thus resulting in low desorption ratios 1 06 and 0 61 for tsh and ssa tsh respectively as for tp adsorption both adsorption ratios of the two hydrogels can reach approximately 10 as found in fig 4 c it could be that the hydroxyl oh and amine nh2 groups inside hydrogel itself which served as reaction sites possibly made strong interactions with anion po4 3 through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic attraction 36 furthermore the tp adsorption ratio of ssa tsh 10 9 was a little higher than that of tsh 9 19 it might be mainly attributed to the extra chemical adsorption between the phosphate and the aluminum and iron hydroxo formed by the metallic oxides inside ssa 37 however the chemical interactions evoked by the ssa and phosphorus might be too weak to be easily broken during the desorption process therefore this part of the adsorbed phosphorus was not difficult to desorb resulting in the negligible difference between the desorption ratios of the two hydrogels 11 1 and 10 6 for tsh and ssa tsh respectively as shown in fig 4 c in addition such low desorption ratios of the two hydrogels for tp would be ascribed to the strong interactions caused by the surface functional groups of the hydrogels themselves and the phosphorus compared with the nh4 n adsorption ratios of the two hydrogels in fig 4 d a lower adsorption ratio can be observed for the pure hydrogel tsh 3 3 on the other hand the nh4 n adsorption ratio of ssa tsh reached 6 9 which was twice as high as that of tsh besides the cooh groups of aa originating from the hydrogel itself the additive ssa inside ssa tsh provided more adsorption sites especially silanol groups sioh which enhanced the nh4 n adsorption through hydrogen bonding 38 thus promoting the adsorption capacity of the modified hydrogel for nh4 n as revealed in fig 4 d 46 8 of nh4 n had been desorbed from tsh during the desorption process while the nh4 n desorption ratio of ssa tsh 32 1 was 14 7 less than that of tsh after a 10 min 60 c water bath process indicating that the hydrogen bonding between the silanol groups of ssa and nh groups of nh4 n was so strong that the ammonia nitrogen molecules was hard to escape from ssa tsh furthermore compared with other pollutants the nh4 n desorption ratios of both hydrogels were higher than 21 0 46 3 except for cr vi desorption ratio of tsh it might be mainly attributed to the nh4 n releasing behavior of the two hydrogels as shown in table 2 3 4 fo performance 3 4 1 effect of initial cr vi concentration on pollutants removal the effects of cr vi concentration on pollutants cr vi cod tp and nh4 n removal rates of the two fos with tsh or ssa tsh as draw agent are shown in figs 5 8 respectively as illustrated in fig 5 the total cr vi removal rates of fo tsh and fo ssa tsh with hydrogels as draw agents were extremely high t 96 4 97 9 and 96 9 97 4 respectively and stable with increasing cr vi concentration 0 40 mg l in the feed solution this could be attributed to the following reasons firstly the aquaporin flat sheet membrane as fo membrane had a dense active layer as presented in sem characterization fig 1 the membrane was manufactured to reject salts such as na and cl ions in seawater 24 39 and its rejection efficiency can be proved from the merchant s instructions as shown in table s2 on the other hand in neutral ph of the aqueous solution cr vi generally existed in the form of hcro4 or cro4 2 with a large hydrated ionic radius which was larger than that of most monovalent ions in seawater 2 second as shown in table 1 the zeta potential of the active layer was 28 0 mv implying that the fo membrane surface was negatively charged as a result there existed strong electrostatic repulsion between the oxy anionic cr species hcro4 or cro4 2 and the fo membrane 8 13 therefore the high removal rate of cr vi by fo membrane m 94 0 95 3 and 93 7 95 1 respectively was expected in the fo process with such an excellent fo membrane though the fo membrane demonstrated high rejection ability for cr vi there was still a small amount of cr vi that could pass through the fo membrane to the draw agent side as discussed in section 3 3 the hydrogels had adsorption abilities for cr vi and thus the unrejected cr vi by membrane could be removed by the hydrogels tsh and ssa tsh through adsorption h 1 09 3 95 and 1 73 3 71 respectively in addition increasing the cr vi concentration in the feed solution simultaneously promoted the cr vi solute flux to pass through the fo membrane resulting in a continuous decline in cr vi removal rate by the fo membrane in both fos nevertheless due to the high adsorption effects on the cr vi by the hydrogels the total removal rates of the two fos still kept stable regardless of the cr vi concentrations according to fig 6 both fos fo tsh and fo ssa tsh kept acquiring high total cod removal rates t 96 8 97 7 and 97 1 97 4 respectively and removal rates by the membranes m 95 1 95 9 and 94 0 95 8 respectively with the increase of cr vi concentration 0 40 mg l this was ascribed to the macromolecular compounds glucose 198 17 g mol as the organic source for preparing the wastewater the organic material with high molecular weight was easily rejected by the dense fo membrane leading to a high rejection rate of cod during the fo process 14 in addition the small amounts of cod that leaked into the draw agents can be further removed by the two hydrogels h 0 89 2 60 for tsh and 1 33 3 18 for ssa tsh respectively through chemical adsorption as discussed in section 3 3 the tp removal of fo tsh and fo ssa tsh with varying cr vi concentrations of wastewater as feed can be observed in fig 7 from fig 7 it could be seen that tp removal rates by fo membrane were high m 94 6 96 8 and 94 3 95 5 in two fos respectively due to its large hydrated ion diameter 18 40 rejected by fo membrane with the dense porous structure and negatively charged dissociated species h2po4 which formed strong electrostatic repulsion with negative fo membrane surface in ph 5 13 furthermore with the assistance of the two hydrogels tsh and ssa tsh with high tp adsorption abilities h 2 81 4 45 and 2 78 4 97 respectively the total removal rates of tp t were extraordinarily high as 99 1 100 and 97 7 99 6 respectively however compared with other pollutants the total nh4 n removal rates of fo tsh and fo ssa tsh were relatively low t 75 1 80 1 and 76 8 78 0 respectively in various cr vi concentrations 0 40 mg l as shown in fig 8 the result might be attributed to the low molecular weight 18 01 g mol and small hydrated ion diameter 0 25 nm 18 40 which made it easy for the pollutants to enter the holes of the membrane and reach the side of the draw agent resulting in low removal rates by fo membrane m 83 9 85 7 and 82 9 85 7 respectively besides as revealed in section 3 2 that the nh4 n would release from the hydrogels during the dehydrated process the values of removal rate by the hydrogels tsh and ssa tsh were negative h 8 72 to 4 38 and 8 24 to 4 88 respectively therefore despite the nh4 n content of effluent of the two fos meeting the requirements of most industrial wastewater treatment the hydrogels should be further studied for their cleaning procure to remove the unreacted nipam for reducing the leached content of nh4 n such as the hydrogel was washed three times continuously with di water in 72 h changing di water every 24 h 41 and washed with ethanol 42 or methanol 43 furthermore fo ssa tsh showed better performances for pollutants cr vi cod tp and nh4 n removal than fo tsh despite they possessed the same fo membranes and fo reactors construction it was mainly attributed that ssa tsh had a higher affinity with pollutants through chemical interaction as discussed in section 3 3 and thus more pollutants were unable to desorb even though undergoing dehydration after the fo permeating process 3 4 2 water flux fig 9 exhibited the effect of cr vi concentration 0 40 mg l in feed solution on the water flux of 24 h fo tsh and fo ssa tsh process it can be observed from the figure that both fos had a similar tendency towards water permeation performance at different cr vi concentrations during the first running hour due to the initially high osmosis pressure of the hydrogels as discussed in section 3 2 and the excellent hydrophilicity of the fo membrane shown in table 1 the water flux of fo tsh and fo ssa tsh can reach 2 05 2 36 lmh and 2 89 3 20 lmh respectively as the fo process proceeded the water fluxes of both fos slowly declined and then remained stable at respectively 1 28 1 40 lmh and 1 86 1 91 lmh after about 12 h until the end of each operation moreover fo ssa tsh 1 992 2 044 lmh generated significantly higher average water fluxes than fo tsh 1 402 1 433 lmh at different cr vi concentrations which was similar to our previous studies that the fo ssa tsh 2 23 lmh obtained average water flux nearly twice as much as fo tsh 1 12 lmh with 2000 ppm nacl solution as feed 6 as shown in fig 3 and discussed in section 3 2 the hydrogel modified with ssa ssa tsh showed a higher swelling ability than the unmodified tsh indicating its higher osmotic pressure 44 hence the fo process with ssa tsh as draw agent could obtain higher water flux than that with tsh as draw agent furthermore with the increment of cr vi concentration from 0 to 40 mg l the corresponding average water fluxes of fo tsh and fo ssa tsh slightly decreased by 2 2 from 1 433 lmh to 1 402 lmh and 2 5 from 2 044 lmh to 1 992 lmh respectively the reduction of water fluxes would be ascribed to the reason that the osmotic pressure difference between the feed solution and draw agent decreased with the increment of the concentration of feed solution 7 3 4 3 regeneration and reusability nowadays the high cost in energy consumption of regeneration has restricted the draw agent s application in the fo process for instance although the fo system in the previous study used the same fo membrane tfc fo membrane sterlitech corporation us and 0 5 2 m nacl as draw solution and 10 100 mg l cr vi containing solution as feed solution could generate more than twice of average water flux 5 3 lmh 8 as that of fo ssa tsh 1 95 2 02 lmh in this study the fo system not only appeared the reverse draw solute diffusion problem 18 but also required high energy consumption or high pressure for water recovery and salt draw solution regeneration 18 nevertheless the performances of the hydrogels regeneration low cost and energy consumption for regeneration high water flux and slight reduction of reuse ratio in three cycles of fo permeation regeneration process employing 40 mg l cr vi concentration solution as feed in this study were acceptable and the results are presented in fig 10 and table s4 as shown in fig 10 with low cost and energy consumption regeneration condition 60 c water bath for 10 min both temperature sensitive hydrogels presented great recyclability during three cycles of regeneration due to their excellent dewatering abilities as shown in fig 3 moreover the average water fluxes of the two fos respectively maintained at 1 326 1 357 lmh and 1 952 1 983 lmh as shown in table s4 and their reuse ratios slightly reduced and respectively reached 93 5 95 5 and 96 6 98 1 indicating that the hydrogels could regenerate in low cost and energy consumption and maintain their high osmosis pressure and water fluxes during three cycles of fo process therefore they had the potential to be used in industrial fo applications for wastewater treatment in addition the reuse ratios of ssa tsh were better than those of tsh indicating that the hydrogel with ssa modification could maintain the higher swelling ability and osmosis pressure for water adsorption it could be attributed to that the hydrogel with ssa modification could induce more physical crosslinking effect inside of the hydrogel leading to the polymer chain segment being stronger to withstand the high pressure originated from the absorbed water molecules 29 4 conclusion in this study ssa was used to enhance the temperature sensitive hydrogel ssa tsh as draw agent for fo application in chromium containing wastewater treatment the following conclusions could be draw swelling and deswelling experiments suggested that ssa tsh possessed not only a great water adsorption capacity swelling ratio was 65 5 g g but also an excellent dewatering ability water retention ratio dropped to 5 3 for 5 min in 60 c water bath moreover owing to the aluminum and iron hydroxo and silanol group sioh formed inside ssa ssa tsh exhibited better adsorption performance and lower desorption property for cr vi cod tp and nh4 n from aqueous solutions than the pure temperature sensitive hydrogel tsh due to high rejection rate of the fo membrane dense pore structure and negatively charged of the membrane and the notable adsorption capacity of the hydrogel fo ssa tsh showed excellent performance of pollutants removal cr vi 96 9 97 4 cod 97 1 97 4 tp 97 7 99 6 and nh4 n 76 8 77 9 in different cr vi concentrations 0 40 mg l in addition as the result of the high pressure osmosis of the ssa tsh and the hydrophilicity of the membrane fo ssa tsh presented extremely higher water flux 1 95 2 02 lmh than that of fo tsh 1 33 1 42 lmh besides the water recovery and hydrogel regeneration and reusability experiments revealed that most of the water could be easily retrieved from the hydrogel and the reuse ratio of the hydrogel still maintained 95 0 after 3 cycles of fo permeation regeneration process indicating low energy consumption in fo application with ssa tsh as draw agent therefore the proposed temperature sensitive hydrogel modified with ssa showed to be a suitable candidate as draw agent for chromium containing wastewater treatment during fo process credit authorship contribution statement zhihui pan xiongrui yang writing methodology yilun liang

12681,a temperature sensitive hydrogel modified with sewage sludge ash ssa was used as an advanced draw agent for forward osmosis fo application in treating chromium containing wastewater the performance of the modified hydrogel ssa tsh was measured in terms of the swelling and deswelling properties as well as adsorption and desorption effects on cr vi chemical oxygen demand cod total phosphorous tp and ammonium nh4 n in chromium containing wastewater furthermore the efficiencies of wastewater treatment water flux and the reusability of the ssa tsh as draw agent in the fo process fo ssa tsh using a commercially available thin film composite membrane sterlitech were also investigated the results indicated that fo ssa tsh achieved high removal rates of pollutants cr vi 96 9 97 4 cod 97 1 97 4 tp 97 7 99 6 and nh4 n 76 8 77 9 in various cr vi concentrations 0 40 mg l due to the high rejection rate of fo membrane and notable adsorption capacity of the hydrogel moreover the average water flux of fo ssa tsh 1 95 2 02 lmh was nearly twice as much as that of the fo with pure temperature sensitive hydrogel as draw agent fo tsh 1 33 1 42 lmh in 24 h chromium containing wastewater treatment in addition ssa tsh with excellent deswelling property exhibited high water recovery performance and good reusability in low cost and energy consumption after the fo permeation process for wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords chromium containing wastewater temperature sensitive hydrogel sewage sludge ash forward osmosis draw agent data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction forward osmosis fo as an emerging osmotic pressure driven membrane separation technology has been demonstrated great potential for desalination and wastewater treatment to produce high quality effluent 1 this membrane based separation process is driven by the osmotic pressure difference between the draw agent and feed solution 2 therefore the draw agent with high osmotic pressure can greatly promote the efficiency of fo water treatment besides high osmotic pressure easy separation from water reusable non toxic and harmless should be the characteristics of an ideal draw agent 3 especially the water recovery and the diluted draw agent regeneration account for the main energy requirements in most fo applications 4 therefore to justify the sustainability of the fo process it is imperative to develop a new class of draw agents with high osmotic pressure and low regenerative energy consumption 5 in our previous research after the incineration treatment of the surplus sewage sludge ss from the wastewater treatment plant the residue sewage sludge ash ssa with abundant silica as the additive was prepared for the temperature sensitive hydrogel as draw agent for fo application 6 it not only alleviated the environmental problems caused by the increasing excess ss and ssa but also increased the water flux of the fo and lowered the energy consumption for water recovery and draw agent regeneration the ssa based temperature sensitive hydrogel was employed as the draw agent in fo process and the average water fluxes achieved 2 33 lmh with di water as feed solution which is nearly twice as much as the hydrogel without adding ssa 1 18 lmh the ssa based hydrogel also had excellent performance when different concentrations of nacl 2000 5000 8000 ppm were used as feed solution as compared with the unmodified hydrogel in addition after 4 times of regeneration dewatering at 60 c water bath after 10 min the water flux of ssa based temperature sensitive hydrogel was restored to 94 4 of the initial value 7 chromium cr which is one of the well known poisonous and toxic heavy metals generally exists in the form of trivalent cr iii and hexavalent cr vi oxidized species in many wastewater of industries including metallurgy tanneries petroleum refining electroplating textiles and pigments 8 9 the cr iii is not toxic and relatively immobile but it can be oxidized into cr vi in the presence of mild oxidants 10 while cr vi is far more toxic than cr iii and can seriously affect human health by evoking diarrhea nausea epigastric pain hemorrhage and even digestive tract and lung cancer 9 11 13 furthermore other pollutants such as organic materials chemical oxygen demand cod total phosphorus tp and ammonium nh4 n are also found in chromium containing wastewater with extremely high amounts 2 13 14 due to the efficient separation of the hazardous pollutants from industrial wastewater fo with salt solutions as draw agent has been widely investigated for chromium containing wastewater reclamation 2 8 14 however the regeneration of salt solutions and water resource recovery generally needs nanofiltration nf 15 16 membrane distillation md 17 or even reverse osmosis ro 18 process with high energy consumption therefore as discussed above it is considered that the ssa based temperature sensitive hydrogel might be suitably used as draw agent in fo progress for chromium containing wastewater treatment in order to reclaim water resource and regenerate draw agent with lower cost and energy consumption furthermore the fo with hydrogel as draw agent might achieve high removal rate of pollutants in chromium containing wastewater due to excellent rejection rate of fo membrane 8 and relatively high adsorption rate of hydrogel 19 however according to research in the past decade the fo system with temperature sensitive hydrogel as draw agent still stayed in the filtration process of desalination 20 22 while the treatment of wastewater containing various substances including organic and inorganic contaminants has not yet been reported therefore in this study the temperature sensitive hydrogel modified by ssa was used as the draw agent for verifying the feasibility of the chromium containing wastewater treatment by the fo process the hydrogel characterization swelling and deswelling and adsorption and desorption of pollutants cr vi cod tp and nh4 n and the fo performance including water flux water recovery draw agent regeneration were investigated moreover the pollutants removal mechanism of fo system through fo membrane rejection and the hydrogel adsorption would be studied in this way it not only achieves waste recycling but also meets the requirements of a sustainable growth strategy and improves the sustainability of wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials n isopropyl acrylamide nipam and the accelerant n n n n tetramethylethylenediamine temed were purchased from macklin acrylic acid aa was purchased from tianjin zhiyuan chemical reagent the cross linker n n methylenebisacrylamide mba and the initiator ammonium persulfate aps were purchased from tianjin damao chemical reagent factory sodium alginate naalg was provided by aladdin the dewatered ss from guangzhou lijiao wastewater treatment plant was used as raw material after being dried for 3 days the ss was burned in a muffle furnace at 800 c for 1 h subsequently the obtained ssa was ground into 100 150 meshes after cooling at room temperature and washed with deionized di water 5 times finally the sample was dried in an oven at 103 c for 24 h the oxides contents contained in ss and ssa including the elements silicon alumina and iron are shown in table s1 it can be seen that the ssa 43 9 possessed higher content of silica than its precursor ss 39 0 which would be profitable to the enhancement of the hydrogel s swelling ability for fo process 6 the fo experiments were carried out by using a commercial flat thin film composite tfc fo membrane which belongs to aquaporin flat sheet membrane manufactured by aquaporin a s denmark and provided by sterlitech corporation usa as the supplier this membrane was selected as it had been widely used for several wastewater studies due to its extremely high rejection rate superior hydrophilicity and great water flux 8 23 24 and its basic information from the company s report is shown in table s2 the results of the membrane characterization zeta potential zs90 malvern uk and contact angle sl200a kino usa of the active and supportive layers are detailed in table 1 as shown in table 1 both sides of the fo membrane possessed negatively charged as their zeta potential values were negative in addition the fo membrane exhibited highly hydrophilic property which facilitated water transferring through the membrane and thus increased the water flux during fo process 23 24 furthermore the morphology and configuration of the pristine membrane were observed by scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 7001f jeol japan and the result is shown in fig 1 it can be found that the supportive layer s surface of the fo membrane showed a porous structure with the pore size range of 0 1 1 Î¼m while the active layer exhibited a dense pore structure that guaranteed the rejection of pollutant and provided the diffusion channels of water molecules before using the membrane it was soaked in di water overnight at room temperature to ensure complete wettability feed solution of fo was prepared by dissolving the required amount of potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 glucose monohydrate c6h12o6 h2o potassium dihydrogen phosphate kh2po4 and ammonium chloride nh4cl which acquired from tianjin zhiyuan chemical reagent 2 2 preparation and characterization of hydrogels 2 2 1 preparation of the hydrogels in this study the temperature sensitive hydrogels were prepared by following the method described in our previous study 7 in short ssa 0 or 2 5 wt in relation to nipam was dispersed in a solution in which naalg 0 04 g aa 0 0606 ml neutralized to 70 and nipam 2 0 g were dissolved after that the cross linking agent mba initiator aps and accelerant temed were added to the well stirred mixture under the protection of nitrogen and the monomers would be quickly polymerized into hydrogel then the obtained hydrogels were cut into small pieces and followed by 2 days of di water soaking and 1 day of 60 c drying in an oven the temperature sensitive hydrogel without adding ssa was named tsh and the hydrogel modified with 2 5 of ssa was denoted as ssa tsh 2 2 2 characterization of the hydrogels morphologies of the hydrogels were evaluated with sem jsm 7001f jeol japan the functional groups of these hydrogels were confirmed with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir tensor 27 bruker germany using a kbr pellet method 25 2 2 3 swelling and deswelling properties to study the swelling property 0 3 g of the prepared hydrogel was put in a nylon mesh bag and sealed before immersing into 500 ml of di water at 20 c the weight changes of hydrogel were recorded at regular time intervals the following eq 1 was used to calculate the swelling ratio of the hydrogel at certain time t 1 swelling ratio w t w d w d 100 where w d g is the weight of the initial dry hydrogel and w t g is the weight of the hydrogel at water adsorption time t min the deswelling behavior of the prepared hydrogel was also measured by the weighed method the equilibrated swollen hydrogel in di water at 20 c was transferred into di water at 60 c the weight changes of hydrogel were recorded at regular time intervals water retention ratio at desorption time t was defined in eq 2 2 water retention ratio w t w d w e w d 100 where w e g is the weight of equilibrated swollen hydrogel at 20 c and w t g is the weight of the hydrogel at water desorption time t min to measure the pollutants released from the hydrogels the cr vi concentration of the dehydrated water was determined based on the diphenylcarbazide method 26 other pollutants cod tp and nh4 n were measured with potassium dichromate method ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method and nessler s reagent spectrophotometry method respectively 2 2 2 4 adsorption and desorption of pollutants from aqueous solution k2cr2o7 cr vi c6h12o6 h2o cod kh2po4 tp and nh4cl nh4 n which were employed as pollutants in chromium containing wastewater were respectively prepared the stock solutions for adsorption experiments the four groups of adsorption solutions were diluted with the corresponding stock solution and the initial adsorption concentration of cr vi cod tp and nh4 n were 10 mg l 500 mg l 20 mg l and 20 mg l respectively subsequently 50 mg tsh and ssa tsh were respectively immersed in each of the pollutants solutions 50 ml the mixture was shaken in a thermostatic shaker cha s a chenghui china at 20 c and 120 r min for 12 h to ensure the equilibrium adsorption afterward the swollen hydrogels were heated at 60 c to release the adsorbed water and pollutants adsorption ratio and desorption ratio by the hydrogels were calculated using the following eqs 3 and 4 respectively 3 adsorption ratio c 0 v 0 c e v e c 0 v 0 100 4 desorption ratio c d v d c 0 v 0 c e v e 100 where c 0 mg l and c e mg l are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of aqueous solutions respectively v 0 l and v e l are the volume of the aqueous solutions in initial and equilibrium respectively and c d mg l and v d l are the concentration and the volume of solution released from the hydrogel dehydrated at 60 c 2 3 fo process the decontamination performance of the fo process with the prepared hydrogels as draw agents was carried out in a homemade fo setup fig 2 at room temperature the fo setup was assembled by a plastic centrifugal tube providing an effective membrane area of 6 605 cm2 membrane diameter 2 90 cm when the infiltration started the feed solution was added to the calibration line of 150 ml in a 250 ml beaker and then 0 3 g hydrogel tsh or ssa tsh as draw agent was placed on the supportive layer of the fo membrane a peristaltic pump was used to recirculate the feed to create the cross flow flow rate 0 057 l min in order to reduce the impact of external concentration polarization during the fo process the variation of feed solution weight was obtained by an analytical balance ps 4500 r2 radwag wagi elektroniczne poland max 4500 g d 0 01 g which was linked with a computer for real time data recording the two fos with tsh and ssa tsh as draw agents were denoted as fo tsh and fo ssa tsh respectively to investigate the removal rate of the pollutants by the fo system the experiments were conducted using synthetic chromium containing wastewater with various concentrations of cr vi 0 10 20 40 mg l and fixed concentrations of cod 500 mg l tp 20 mg l and nh4 n 20 mg l as feed solution and their properties were shown in table s3 after the fo process the effluent from the hydrogels was extracted by heating the hydrogel on an electromagnetic heating plate ms h280 pro dlab china at 60 c the dehydrated water was collected and measured its pollutants concentrations c d the total removal rate of various pollutants by fo system t removal rate by fo membrane m and removal rate by hydrogel h are respectively calculated by eqs 5 7 as followed 5 t c f c d c f 100 6 m 1 c f v f c f v f c f v f v f 100 7 h t m where c f c f and c d are the concentrations of the feed solution before and after filtration and the dehydrated water from the hydrogel respectively v f and v f are the volume of the feed solution before and after filtration respectively water flux l m2 h lmh of the fo process is determined by measuring the weight changes of feed solution with time and calculated from eq 8 8 water flux w Ïa t where w g and Ï g l are respectively decreasing water weight and the density of the feed solution and a m2 and t h are respectively the effective membrane area and the predetermined interval during the fo process 2 4 regeneration and reusability of hydrogels for fo process after the fo permeation was completed a temperature heating stimulus of 60 c water bath for 10 min was employed to dehydrate the swollen hydrogel then the regenerated hydrogel was used as draw agent directly in the next cycle of the fo process the above operation was repeated for 3 cycles the reuse ratio of the hydrogel was calculated by eq 9 9 reuse ratio j vn j v 0 100 where j v0 is the average water flux of the initial run lmh j vn is the average water flux after the nth n stands for 0 1 2 and 3 time of regeneration lmh 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 ftir to investigate the surface functional groups of the prepared polymer hydrogels the ftir spectra of tsh and ssa tsh were analyzed and the results are exhibited in fig s1 according to the ftir spectra of both hydrogels the characteristic absorption peaks of nh bending of amide ii bond and secondary co stretching of amide i bond in nipam respectively appeared at 1557 cm 1 and 1653 cm 1 in ftir spectra of tsh and ssa tsh 27 and the characteristic peaks of ch2 deformation vibration and ch2 ch stretching vibration of another raw material aa for hydrogel preparation could be respectively observed at 1457 cm 1 and 2933 cm 1 28 moreover the peak that emerged at 3431 cm 1 in the ftir spectrum of ssa tsh was assigned to stretching vibrations sioh group originated from ssa 7 3 1 2 sem the surface morphology of the two hydrogels was observed by sem and the result is presented in fig s2 as can be seen in fig s2 both prepared hydrogels exhibited a 3d continuous porous network with different sizes of pores such porous structure inside hydrogels would facilitate the rapid water molecules diffusion and thus improve the water adsorption 29 30 in addition the ssa tsh with additional physical cross linking inside its matrix showed a higher reticulated network than the pure hydrogel tsh indicating that it would be helpful to enhance the water adsorption ability due to the more specific surface area inside the hydrogel which was consistent with the swelling performance result as further discussed in section 3 2 3 2 swelling and deswelling properties both swelling and deswelling properties are the critical factors of the hydrogels as draw agent for fo application 4 21 the hydrogel with good swelling ability could enhance the osmosis pressure and thus increase the water flux of fo while the hydrogel with excellent deswelling performance would be easily regenerated in low energy consumption during the fo process therefore the swelling and deswelling kinetics of the hydrogels were measured in this work and the results are shown in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the swelling ratio of the two hydrogels increased rapidly in the initial 20 min followed by a slow rising stage until the maximum water absorption equilibrium was reached at 180 min it was observed that the hydrogel with ssa modification ssa tsh exhibited a higher swelling ratio of 65 5 g g than tsh of 53 0 g g at equilibrium time this would be attributed to the additional effect through forming hydrogen bonding between the silanol group sioh of ssa and the amino group nh and or hydroxyl group oh of the hydrogel leading to higher osmosis pressure 213 9 atm for tsh and 589 9 atm ssa tsh which was investigated in our previous work 7 for more water adsorption 31 furthermore the higher reticulated and porous network inside ssa tsh as shown in fig s2 increased the contact surface area between water molecule and hydrogel and thus enhanced the swelling ratio of the hydrogel 29 31 the ssa tsh with a higher swelling ratio was supposed to produce higher water flux during the fo process which would be further discussed in section 3 4 2 in addition the deswelling performance of the hydrogels can be also observed in fig 3 that both tsh and ssa tsh presented relatively fast deswelling rates at 60 c water bath and their water retention ratios dropped to similar values of 4 7 and 5 3 within 5 min respectively afterward they reached an equilibrium state at 10 min the water retention ratios of both hydrogels were 0 therefore the ssa tsh not only showed a great swelling performance but also displayed a comparable dewatering property with the pure temperature sensitive hydrogel tsh it implied that the hydrogel with ssa modification could both improve the water flux and alleviate the cost of water recovery and draw agent regeneration during the fo process which would be further discussed in section 3 4 3 the result of the pollutants contents of the dehydrated water from the two hydrogels is shown in table 2 as can be seen in table 2 none of the pollutants except for nh4 n 4 26 Î¼g g and 3 44 Î¼g g respectively could be found in the dehydrated water from the hydrogels the nh4 n in the hydrogel might be originated from the unreacted nipam inside the hydrogel as shown in ftir analysis in section 3 1 1 after the deswelling process through 60 c heating stimuli the nh4 n from the nipam might release into the dehydrated water 3 3 absorption and desorption abilities the effects of two hydrogels on the adsorption and desorption ratios of cr vi cod tp and nh4 n are shown in fig 4 as observed in fig 4 compared with tsh ssa tsh had better performances in adsorbing the cr vi cod tp and nh4 n with higher adsorption ratios from aqueous solutions however the desorption ratios of the ssa tsh for all the pollutants were less than those of tsh as depicted in fig 4 a the cr vi adsorption ratio of ssa tsh reached 6 27 which was higher than that of tsh merely 1 33 the result could be attributed to the higher swelling ratio of ssa tsh as shown in fig 3 and thus more water molecules accompanied by a certain amount of cr vi could permeate into the hydrogel during the adsorption process furthermore the aluminum oxide al2o3 and ferric oxide fe2o3 originated from the ssa which is shown in table s1 inside ssa tsh can combine with cr vi through surface complexation between the negatively charged cr vi cro4 2 and the hydroxyl compounds formed by the hydroxylation of al iii and fe iii in solution 32 33 therefore as the strong chemical interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate ssa tsh had more difficulty in desorbing cr vi under the same dehydration condition resulting in a far lower desorption ratio 6 81 than that of tsh 67 7 as shown in fig 4 a comparing the effects of the two hydrogels tsh and ssa tsh on adsorption of cod in fig 4 b it was found that they had similar adsorption ratios of 14 2 and 14 4 respectively it might be that the temperature sensitive hydrogel itself can achieve cod removal through chemical adsorption such as the electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding interactions 34 on the other hand as highly reactive activity of the metal hydroxo with the organic matter 35 the metallic oxides originated from ssa inside ssa tsh were also effective in reducing cod however the effect was not very significant furthermore owing to such strong chemical interaction between the hydrogels and organic compounds desorbing cod from the hydrogels under the heating condition became difficult thus resulting in low desorption ratios 1 06 and 0 61 for tsh and ssa tsh respectively as for tp adsorption both adsorption ratios of the two hydrogels can reach approximately 10 as found in fig 4 c it could be that the hydroxyl oh and amine nh2 groups inside hydrogel itself which served as reaction sites possibly made strong interactions with anion po4 3 through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic attraction 36 furthermore the tp adsorption ratio of ssa tsh 10 9 was a little higher than that of tsh 9 19 it might be mainly attributed to the extra chemical adsorption between the phosphate and the aluminum and iron hydroxo formed by the metallic oxides inside ssa 37 however the chemical interactions evoked by the ssa and phosphorus might be too weak to be easily broken during the desorption process therefore this part of the adsorbed phosphorus was not difficult to desorb resulting in the negligible difference between the desorption ratios of the two hydrogels 11 1 and 10 6 for tsh and ssa tsh respectively as shown in fig 4 c in addition such low desorption ratios of the two hydrogels for tp would be ascribed to the strong interactions caused by the surface functional groups of the hydrogels themselves and the phosphorus compared with the nh4 n adsorption ratios of the two hydrogels in fig 4 d a lower adsorption ratio can be observed for the pure hydrogel tsh 3 3 on the other hand the nh4 n adsorption ratio of ssa tsh reached 6 9 which was twice as high as that of tsh besides the cooh groups of aa originating from the hydrogel itself the additive ssa inside ssa tsh provided more adsorption sites especially silanol groups sioh which enhanced the nh4 n adsorption through hydrogen bonding 38 thus promoting the adsorption capacity of the modified hydrogel for nh4 n as revealed in fig 4 d 46 8 of nh4 n had been desorbed from tsh during the desorption process while the nh4 n desorption ratio of ssa tsh 32 1 was 14 7 less than that of tsh after a 10 min 60 c water bath process indicating that the hydrogen bonding between the silanol groups of ssa and nh groups of nh4 n was so strong that the ammonia nitrogen molecules was hard to escape from ssa tsh furthermore compared with other pollutants the nh4 n desorption ratios of both hydrogels were higher than 21 0 46 3 except for cr vi desorption ratio of tsh it might be mainly attributed to the nh4 n releasing behavior of the two hydrogels as shown in table 2 3 4 fo performance 3 4 1 effect of initial cr vi concentration on pollutants removal the effects of cr vi concentration on pollutants cr vi cod tp and nh4 n removal rates of the two fos with tsh or ssa tsh as draw agent are shown in figs 5 8 respectively as illustrated in fig 5 the total cr vi removal rates of fo tsh and fo ssa tsh with hydrogels as draw agents were extremely high t 96 4 97 9 and 96 9 97 4 respectively and stable with increasing cr vi concentration 0 40 mg l in the feed solution this could be attributed to the following reasons firstly the aquaporin flat sheet membrane as fo membrane had a dense active layer as presented in sem characterization fig 1 the membrane was manufactured to reject salts such as na and cl ions in seawater 24 39 and its rejection efficiency can be proved from the merchant s instructions as shown in table s2 on the other hand in neutral ph of the aqueous solution cr vi generally existed in the form of hcro4 or cro4 2 with a large hydrated ionic radius which was larger than that of most monovalent ions in seawater 2 second as shown in table 1 the zeta potential of the active layer was 28 0 mv implying that the fo membrane surface was negatively charged as a result there existed strong electrostatic repulsion between the oxy anionic cr species hcro4 or cro4 2 and the fo membrane 8 13 therefore the high removal rate of cr vi by fo membrane m 94 0 95 3 and 93 7 95 1 respectively was expected in the fo process with such an excellent fo membrane though the fo membrane demonstrated high rejection ability for cr vi there was still a small amount of cr vi that could pass through the fo membrane to the draw agent side as discussed in section 3 3 the hydrogels had adsorption abilities for cr vi and thus the unrejected cr vi by membrane could be removed by the hydrogels tsh and ssa tsh through adsorption h 1 09 3 95 and 1 73 3 71 respectively in addition increasing the cr vi concentration in the feed solution simultaneously promoted the cr vi solute flux to pass through the fo membrane resulting in a continuous decline in cr vi removal rate by the fo membrane in both fos nevertheless due to the high adsorption effects on the cr vi by the hydrogels the total removal rates of the two fos still kept stable regardless of the cr vi concentrations according to fig 6 both fos fo tsh and fo ssa tsh kept acquiring high total cod removal rates t 96 8 97 7 and 97 1 97 4 respectively and removal rates by the membranes m 95 1 95 9 and 94 0 95 8 respectively with the increase of cr vi concentration 0 40 mg l this was ascribed to the macromolecular compounds glucose 198 17 g mol as the organic source for preparing the wastewater the organic material with high molecular weight was easily rejected by the dense fo membrane leading to a high rejection rate of cod during the fo process 14 in addition the small amounts of cod that leaked into the draw agents can be further removed by the two hydrogels h 0 89 2 60 for tsh and 1 33 3 18 for ssa tsh respectively through chemical adsorption as discussed in section 3 3 the tp removal of fo tsh and fo ssa tsh with varying cr vi concentrations of wastewater as feed can be observed in fig 7 from fig 7 it could be seen that tp removal rates by fo membrane were high m 94 6 96 8 and 94 3 95 5 in two fos respectively due to its large hydrated ion diameter 18 40 rejected by fo membrane with the dense porous structure and negatively charged dissociated species h2po4 which formed strong electrostatic repulsion with negative fo membrane surface in ph 5 13 furthermore with the assistance of the two hydrogels tsh and ssa tsh with high tp adsorption abilities h 2 81 4 45 and 2 78 4 97 respectively the total removal rates of tp t were extraordinarily high as 99 1 100 and 97 7 99 6 respectively however compared with other pollutants the total nh4 n removal rates of fo tsh and fo ssa tsh were relatively low t 75 1 80 1 and 76 8 78 0 respectively in various cr vi concentrations 0 40 mg l as shown in fig 8 the result might be attributed to the low molecular weight 18 01 g mol and small hydrated ion diameter 0 25 nm 18 40 which made it easy for the pollutants to enter the holes of the membrane and reach the side of the draw agent resulting in low removal rates by fo membrane m 83 9 85 7 and 82 9 85 7 respectively besides as revealed in section 3 2 that the nh4 n would release from the hydrogels during the dehydrated process the values of removal rate by the hydrogels tsh and ssa tsh were negative h 8 72 to 4 38 and 8 24 to 4 88 respectively therefore despite the nh4 n content of effluent of the two fos meeting the requirements of most industrial wastewater treatment the hydrogels should be further studied for their cleaning procure to remove the unreacted nipam for reducing the leached content of nh4 n such as the hydrogel was washed three times continuously with di water in 72 h changing di water every 24 h 41 and washed with ethanol 42 or methanol 43 furthermore fo ssa tsh showed better performances for pollutants cr vi cod tp and nh4 n removal than fo tsh despite they possessed the same fo membranes and fo reactors construction it was mainly attributed that ssa tsh had a higher affinity with pollutants through chemical interaction as discussed in section 3 3 and thus more pollutants were unable to desorb even though undergoing dehydration after the fo permeating process 3 4 2 water flux fig 9 exhibited the effect of cr vi concentration 0 40 mg l in feed solution on the water flux of 24 h fo tsh and fo ssa tsh process it can be observed from the figure that both fos had a similar tendency towards water permeation performance at different cr vi concentrations during the first running hour due to the initially high osmosis pressure of the hydrogels as discussed in section 3 2 and the excellent hydrophilicity of the fo membrane shown in table 1 the water flux of fo tsh and fo ssa tsh can reach 2 05 2 36 lmh and 2 89 3 20 lmh respectively as the fo process proceeded the water fluxes of both fos slowly declined and then remained stable at respectively 1 28 1 40 lmh and 1 86 1 91 lmh after about 12 h until the end of each operation moreover fo ssa tsh 1 992 2 044 lmh generated significantly higher average water fluxes than fo tsh 1 402 1 433 lmh at different cr vi concentrations which was similar to our previous studies that the fo ssa tsh 2 23 lmh obtained average water flux nearly twice as much as fo tsh 1 12 lmh with 2000 ppm nacl solution as feed 6 as shown in fig 3 and discussed in section 3 2 the hydrogel modified with ssa ssa tsh showed a higher swelling ability than the unmodified tsh indicating its higher osmotic pressure 44 hence the fo process with ssa tsh as draw agent could obtain higher water flux than that with tsh as draw agent furthermore with the increment of cr vi concentration from 0 to 40 mg l the corresponding average water fluxes of fo tsh and fo ssa tsh slightly decreased by 2 2 from 1 433 lmh to 1 402 lmh and 2 5 from 2 044 lmh to 1 992 lmh respectively the reduction of water fluxes would be ascribed to the reason that the osmotic pressure difference between the feed solution and draw agent decreased with the increment of the concentration of feed solution 7 3 4 3 regeneration and reusability nowadays the high cost in energy consumption of regeneration has restricted the draw agent s application in the fo process for instance although the fo system in the previous study used the same fo membrane tfc fo membrane sterlitech corporation us and 0 5 2 m nacl as draw solution and 10 100 mg l cr vi containing solution as feed solution could generate more than twice of average water flux 5 3 lmh 8 as that of fo ssa tsh 1 95 2 02 lmh in this study the fo system not only appeared the reverse draw solute diffusion problem 18 but also required high energy consumption or high pressure for water recovery and salt draw solution regeneration 18 nevertheless the performances of the hydrogels regeneration low cost and energy consumption for regeneration high water flux and slight reduction of reuse ratio in three cycles of fo permeation regeneration process employing 40 mg l cr vi concentration solution as feed in this study were acceptable and the results are presented in fig 10 and table s4 as shown in fig 10 with low cost and energy consumption regeneration condition 60 c water bath for 10 min both temperature sensitive hydrogels presented great recyclability during three cycles of regeneration due to their excellent dewatering abilities as shown in fig 3 moreover the average water fluxes of the two fos respectively maintained at 1 326 1 357 lmh and 1 952 1 983 lmh as shown in table s4 and their reuse ratios slightly reduced and respectively reached 93 5 95 5 and 96 6 98 1 indicating that the hydrogels could regenerate in low cost and energy consumption and maintain their high osmosis pressure and water fluxes during three cycles of fo process therefore they had the potential to be used in industrial fo applications for wastewater treatment in addition the reuse ratios of ssa tsh were better than those of tsh indicating that the hydrogel with ssa modification could maintain the higher swelling ability and osmosis pressure for water adsorption it could be attributed to that the hydrogel with ssa modification could induce more physical crosslinking effect inside of the hydrogel leading to the polymer chain segment being stronger to withstand the high pressure originated from the absorbed water molecules 29 4 conclusion in this study ssa was used to enhance the temperature sensitive hydrogel ssa tsh as draw agent for fo application in chromium containing wastewater treatment the following conclusions could be draw swelling and deswelling experiments suggested that ssa tsh possessed not only a great water adsorption capacity swelling ratio was 65 5 g g but also an excellent dewatering ability water retention ratio dropped to 5 3 for 5 min in 60 c water bath moreover owing to the aluminum and iron hydroxo and silanol group sioh formed inside ssa ssa tsh exhibited better adsorption performance and lower desorption property for cr vi cod tp and nh4 n from aqueous solutions than the pure temperature sensitive hydrogel tsh due to high rejection rate of the fo membrane dense pore structure and negatively charged of the membrane and the notable adsorption capacity of the hydrogel fo ssa tsh showed excellent performance of pollutants removal cr vi 96 9 97 4 cod 97 1 97 4 tp 97 7 99 6 and nh4 n 76 8 77 9 in different cr vi concentrations 0 40 mg l in addition as the result of the high pressure osmosis of the ssa tsh and the hydrophilicity of the membrane fo ssa tsh presented extremely higher water flux 1 95 2 02 lmh than that of fo tsh 1 33 1 42 lmh besides the water recovery and hydrogel regeneration and reusability experiments revealed that most of the water could be easily retrieved from the hydrogel and the reuse ratio of the hydrogel still maintained 95 0 after 3 cycles of fo permeation regeneration process indicating low energy consumption in fo application with ssa tsh as draw agent therefore the proposed temperature sensitive hydrogel modified with ssa showed to be a suitable candidate as draw agent for chromium containing wastewater treatment during fo process credit authorship contribution statement zhihui pan xiongrui yang writing methodology yilun liang

12682,the feasibility of simultaneous removal of indium selenite and tellurite using biological reduction by aspergillus niger fungal pellets is explored initially batch experiments were conducted to study the capability of a niger pellets to remove indium selenium and tellurium in different combinations the indium removal efficiency ranged between 52 3 and 65 6 at 10 mg l with a maximum removal 65 in incubations with only indium or indium with tellurite the tellurium removal efficiency was maximum 76 7 in experiments with indium but dropped drastically to 47 2 and 33 7 respectively when selenite and indium were incubated together the selenite removal efficiencies of the a niger pellets were more consistent 50 2 59 5 for different experimental combinations and were not affected by either indium or tellurium further characterization of fungal biomass showed accumulation of mainly elemental se and te nanoparticles within the pellets in addition xrd analysis showed the formation of indium selenide and indium telluride during their simultaneous removal the eps production by a niger increased in the presence of these elements along with changes in the polysaccharide and protein content of the eps the fluorescence eem spectra revealed that the eps produced by a niger during pollutant removal was mostly composed of soluble microbial products and humic acid like substances this study demonstrated recovery of elemental chalcogen and indium chalcogenide nanoparticles can be achieved using fungal pelleted systems graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aspergillus niger indium fungal pellet indium selenide indium telluride extracellular polymeric substances data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction indium is an element with high demand due to its use in advanced technological instruments 1 for its most important applications indium is used in the form of indium tin oxide ito as optoconductive coating in the touch screens of mobile phones computers televisions and other smart devices photovoltaics instruments and solar panels 2 in the environment indium is found associated with zinc bearing ores 3 on average the indium content of the earth crust is quite minimal 0 1 ppm however in certain indium rich regions it can be as high as 200 ppm 4 the european union eu has categorized indium as a critical raw material 5 which means that this is one of the important raw materials of high economic and strategic importance for the european economic development but its supply chain is endangered with many potential risks 6 due to this high supply risk the eu has provided many suggestions to ensure its steady supply including recovery of indium from alternative sources such as indium containing wastes and end of use products 7 hence owing to such high demand and low availability of indium its recovery from non traditional sources including from indium containing waste materials should be explored the waste resources such as mine dumping 8 metallurgical processing by products or waste 9 end of use products mostly electronics and electronic industry wastes can be valorised by extracting indium from them 10 the extraction of indium from these waste materials has mostly used traditional hydrometallurgical processes such as acid leaching 11 12 to further separate indium from the leachate solution precipitation 13 solvent extraction 14 membrane separation or adsorption including ion exchange resins 15 16 can be used biological methods for metal recovery have gained increased attention in the recent past due to many advantages over conventional metallurgical methods such as low process cost less corrosive nature and environmental friendliness 17 although biological methods such as bioleaching bioprecipitation biomineralization biosorption and bioaccumulation have been successfully used for various metals 18 19 there are only a few studies in case of indium among the biological methods bioleaching is the most explored biological route for indium recovery both bacteria acidithiobacillus thiooxidans and fungi aspergillus niger have been used 17 20 for leaching indium in addition biosorption using shewanella algae bacterium was used for indium recovery from aqueous solution 21 the other biological methods such as biomineralization and bioprecipitation are thus far unexplored for indium recovery these two methods can not only be important for indium recovery from mine drainage but can also serve as a post treatment to indium containing leachates obtained by either acid or biological leaching as they convert the soluble indium to solid precipitates however to the best of our knowledge no microorganisms so far are reported to be capable of directly precipitating indium from solution in this regard there is a need for developing novel methodology for recovery of indium this study examined a new approach using biomineralization of indium as selenide and telluride for its recovery from aqueous solution selenite and tellurite are pollutants of aquatic ecosystems with detrimental impact on the environment 22 there are various technologies available for their removal from the environment including biological reduction 23 in the biological reduction microbes reduce these chalcogens to their elemental or chalcogenide forms which also facilitate their recovery 23 the chalcogenide forms i e selenide and telluride of these pollutants can precipitate with cations such as metal ions to form metal chalcogenides 24 25 these metal chalcogenides are often in the nano size range with various unique properties for wide ranging applications in many fields 25 26 there are quite a few studies on metal chalcogenide nanoparticle synthesis using this method 24 25 but none so far on indium moreover there are no previous reports of biological mineralization of indium using either bacteria or fungi in this study a selenite and tellurite tolerant fungal species of a niger was chosen as biocatalyst to examine the feasibility of biological synthesis of indium chalcogenide nanoparticles a niger was chosen for this study as this fungus has a tolerance towards toxic compounds including metals 27 can reduce se and te 28 and has ability to form pellets 28 29 the objective of this study was to remove indium in the presence of different combinations of selenite and tellurite the effect of indium on selenite and tellurite reduction by a niger was also examined this was done to evaluate if there is any preferential removal of indium by a niger with either selenite or tellurite moreover the concentrations were varied to understand the change in elemental speciation of these compounds during biological reduction and if these played a role on the indium removal performance the fungal biomass was characterized using different instrumental techniques namely x ray diffraction analysis xrd and fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy to understand the mechanism involved in the process the fungal pellets were further characterized by the estimation of the cell surface charge and cell surface hydrophobicity along with qualitative and quantitative analysis of the extracellular polymeric substances 2 materials and methods 2 1 fungal strain and inoculum preparation the a niger strain used in this study was isolated from a lab scale bioreactor treating selenite containing wastewater and its identification and characterization has been described previously 29 the fungal spores were obtained after incubating the strain on a potato dextrose agar plate for 5 days at 30 c the spores were harvested in sterile distilled water and stored in a refrigerator 4 c for further use during different experiments to prepare the fungal pellets initially media were prepared without any pollutants indium selenite or tellurite and 1 ml of spore solution was added to it before being incubated for 24 h in an orbital shaker maintained at 30 c once fungal pellets had formed they were used as inoculum at 5 v v in the experiments to study the indium removal by a niger for each experiment fresh fungal pellets were prepared as inoculum 2 2 experimental set up the experiments for assessing indium removal by a niger fungal pellets under selenite and tellurite reducing conditions were conducted in batch mode using 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing mineral salt media msm 28 the composition of the msm used was as follows g l glucose 10 potassium phosphate 2 magnesium sulfate 0 5 ammonium chloride 0 1 calcium chloride 0 1 and thiamine 0 001 glucose 10 g l was used in the medium as the carbon source 29 the ph of the media was adjusted to 3 5 with the help of 0 1 n naoh or hcl prior to use media were autoclaved at 121 c and 15 psi pressure for 30 min indium selenite and tellurite were added from their respective stock solution 1000 mg l of indium chloride sodium selenite and potassium tellurite as per the requirement in the initial experiments these elements were kept at 10 mg l each to study their removal at different combinations in the subsequent step the effect of the indium concentration was examined by reducing its concentration to 5 mg l and by keeping the selenite and tellurite concentration fixed at 10 mg l to study the effect of the selenite and tellurite concentration on indium removal the selenite and tellurite concentrations were reduced to 5 mg l the conical flasks containing 100 ml msm with fungal pellets in se and te were incubated in an orbital shaker at 30 c for 15 days the liquid samples were withdrawn daily and analysed for in se and te concentrations all experiments are conducted in triplicate and the results are reported as mean standard deviation 2 3 fungal biomass and nanoparticles characterization the fungal biomass obtained upon completion of the shake flask incubations was observed by sem hitachi s 4700 tokyo japan to check any morphological changes due to exposure to in se or te the fungal pellets were placed on a glass cover slip individually and dried overnight at a constant temperature of 30 c the pellets were gold coated with sputter coater before they were examined under sem combined with edx hitachi s 4700 tokyo japan as described by sinharoy and lens 28 edx spectra of the samples were also recorded to examine the elemental composition of the pellets for xrd analysis fungal pellets obtained after experiments with different incubation conditions were dried at constant temperature 60 c and made into powdered form using a mortar and pestle such prepared fungal biomass powder was analysed using xrd fitted with a panalytical empyrean diffractometer almelo the netherlands as described by sinharoy and lens 28 the dried biomass was also analysed using a ftir spectrometer thermo scientific nicolet is5 wisconsin usa as described by sinharoy and lens 28 and the spectra were obtained in between 4000 and 400cm 1 2 4 extracellular polymeric substances extraction and characterization extracellular polymeric substances eps from the fungal pellets were extracted using the method described by hou et al 30 briefly fungal pellets 15 ml obtained from different incubations were washed first with deionised water to remove residual substrate following which they were heated at 60 c for 15 min they were then centrifuged at 12 000 g at 4 c for 20 min to separate the supernatant from the pellet and the supernatant obtained after centrifugation is considered as eps 30 the eps was further analysed for its total organic carbon toc polysaccharides and protein content toc was measured using a toc l shimadzu tokyo japan as described in jacob et al 31 the polysaccharides and protein content were measured using the phenol sulfuric acid and lowry method respectively 32 the eps was also analysed using fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy shimadzu rf 6000 tokyo japan to obtain their 3d eem plots as described by sinharoy and lens 28 2 5 zeta potential and cell surface hydrophobicity analysis the zeta potential of the fungal cells was analysed using light scattering particle analyser litesizer 500 graz austria as described by cao et al 32 fungal pellets were homogenised in a phosphate urea magnesium sulfate pum buffer of ph 7 1 composition in g l dipotassium phosphate 22 2 potassium dihydrogen phosphate 7 26 urea 1 8 and magnesium sulfate 0 2 after allowing the cell suspension to settle at room temperature uniformly dispersed cells 1 ml from the top were used to analyse their zeta potential value zeta potential values were estimated for both eps extracted and control non extracted fungal pellets cell surface hydrophobicity of the fungal cells was estimated using the method described by rosenberg et al 33 this method uses a microbial attachment to hydrocarbon math test with fungal cell suspensions prepared similarly as for the zeta potential measurements the cell suspension is mixed with n hexane in a vortex mixture for 2 min and then allowed to settle for 30 min once the aqueous and solvent phases separate the absorbance value of the aqueous phase was recorded at 600 nm the cell surface hydrophobicity was calculated using the following formula 1 cell surface hydrophobicity initial absorbance of cells absorbance of hexane treated cells initial absorbance of cells 2 6 analytical methods selenite and tellurite concentrations were measured using spectrophotometric methods described in sinharoy et al 34 and molina et al 35 respectively total soluble indium selenium and tellurium concentrations were measured using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp oes agilent 5110 santa clara usa as described by sinharoy and lens 28 the samples were filtered using a 0 2 Î¼m pore size syringe filter and acidified with 2 hno3 prior to the measurement the selenide and telluride concentrations were calculated by subtracting the respective selenite and tellurite concentrations from the total soluble selenium and tellurium 3 results 3 1 simultaneous removal of indium selenium and tellurium by aspergillus niger fig 1 shows the indium selenium and tellurium removal by a niger at their different initial concentrations in the first experiment where all the elements were at 10 mg l the indium removal efficiency ranged in between 52 3 and 65 6 with a maximum removal 65 in incubations with only indium or indium with tellurite fig 1a selenite removal was more or less unaffected with selenite removal efficiencies of 50 2 59 5 and 52 1 in experiments where along with selenite respectively indium tellurite and both of these elements were present fig 1b the tellurium removal efficiency showed drastic change with values dropping from 76 7 in incubations with indium to 47 2 and 33 7 when respectively selenite or both selenite and indium were present fig 1c the effects of a low indium concentration 5 mg l on indium selenium and tellurium removal by a niger pellets are depicted in fig 1 d f the maximum indium removal efficiency of 80 8 was obtained for 5 mg l of indium in the absence of selenite or tellurite fig 1d the indium removal efficiency decreased to 59 8 78 and 68 in the case of selenite tellurite or both were present the selenite removal at low indium concentration 5 mg l was higher than that obtained in the experiments with 10 mg l indium fig 1e also in this case the selenium removal was the lowest 47 8 when all the three elements were present simultaneously in comparison to the binary combinations tellurium removal was higher than selenium removal efficiencies in all the different combinations except for the experiment with only selenium and tellurium where the tellurium removal efficiency was merely 42 7 fig 1f the maximum tellurium removal efficiency of 72 3 was obtained in experiments with 10 mg l of tellurite along with 5 mg l indium the tellurium removal efficiency was quite high 69 2 even in the experiments with the three elements present together the effect of a low selenium and tellurium concentration 5 mg l and a high indium concentration 10 mg l on their removal is shown in fig 1 g i the indium removal values in this case were consistent with the first experiment where all the pollutants were supplemented at a high concentration 10 mg l the indium removal efficiencies were 69 5 52 9 56 3 and 41 5 respectively for the experiments with only indium indium and selenite indium and tellurite and when all three elements were present fig 1g the selenium removal efficiency was much affected at its lower concentration with values ranging from 22 5 to 44 5 under different experimental combinations fig 1h in contrast tellurium showed the highest removal efficiencies 95 7 84 2 and 83 1 among the three elements at 5 mg l fig 1i 3 2 selenium and tellurium speciation during their removal by aspergillus niger along with indium fig 2 shows the different selenium and tellurium species under the various experimental combinations for both selenium and tellurium the majority of the removed compounds had accumulated within the biomass among the remaining selenium and tellurium compounds in solution after 15 days of incubation respectively the selenite and tellurite fractions were maximum however there was a lot of variation in their respective concentrations depending on the initial oxyanion concentration and the combination of compounds the selenium concentration in the biomass ranged between 43 7 55 3 and 45 6 49 3 in the presence of 5 and 10 mg l of indium respectively fig 2a c the tellurium concentration in the fungal biomass amounted to 60 1 68 8 and 24 4 69 9 respectively for the parallel incubations fig 2b d at low initial selenium and tellurium concentration 5 mg l the variation in their accumulation within the biomass was larger with 23 4 30 8 and 35 6 71 8 for selenium and tellurium respectively fig 2e f the concentration of the other product of fungal metabolism of selenite and tellurite i e selenide and telluride soluble fraction was much lower 1 mg l than the other fractions 3 3 effect of indium selenite and tellurite on a niger pellets the shape and size of the fungal pellets significantly differed in the different incubations figs 3 and 4 the pellets formed in the presence of only indium have a consistent size distribution and more pellets of a larger 0 5 cm size were formed fig 3 these pellets had a more or less similar shape to the control pellets with star like hyphal growth protruding out of the pellet structure fig 4 the fungal pellets formed in the presence of either selenite tellurite or in any combination with indium had smaller sizes compared with pellets formed when only indium was present in the incubation in all cases the majority of the pellets were 0 3 0 4 cm and much less some cases nil pellets that are 0 5 cm in size had formed fig 3 the appearance of the pellets exposed to selenite and tellurite differed noticeably with orange and black coloured pellets formation in the presence of respectively selenite and tellurite fig 4 the pellets formed in the presence of both selenite and tellurite were black but their colour intensity was low almost grey in appearance in comparison to the pellets exposed to tellurite and indium without selenite present the pellets formed in these four experimental conditions were of smooth and rounded shape compared with pellets formed in the presence of indium only fig 4 fig 5 shows the sem images of the a niger fungal pellets incubated in different combinations of in se and te as well as the control pellets grown without any of these elements at the microstructure level there was not much difference in terms of width and appearance in between the fungal hyphae obtained from different incubations however the pellet structure appears to be more compact in the presence of indium and oxyanions particularly the samples obtained from incubations with selenite tellurite and indium selenite tellurite appear tightly packed without much of a gap in between individual hypha fig 6 shows the indium chalcogenide nanoparticles that have precipitated onto the fungal hyphae for incubations with indium and se te oxyanions the nanoparticles formed are 10 nm in size furthermore the edx spectra depicted in fig 7 shows the presence of in se and te in the respective fungal samples obtained from incubations with these elements the control pellet does not have any of these elements the other elements such as mg k p c and o are attributed to either media constituents or the fungal biomass 3 4 characterization of the extra cellular polymeric matrix the zeta potential values of the intact and eps extracted fungal cells were negative and ranged between 4 7 to 9 3 mv fig 8a for most of the samples the zeta potential values of intact fungal pellets were higher in comparison to the eps extracted pellets the maximum zeta potential value was for fungal biomass exposed to tellurium and indium the pellets obtained from different incubations with indium selenite and tellurite had higher zeta potential values 6 4 to 9 3 mv compared with the control pellets 5 7 and 5 9 mv except for eps extracted fungal pellets obtained from incubation with selenite and indium 4 7 mv the cell surface hydrophobicity values varied greatly depending on the indium selenite and tellurite combinations fig 8b this value was the lowest 33 2 and 34 7 for the control fungal pellets which were incubated with more of the elements the eps extracted fungal pellets had higher cell surface hydrophobicity 5 6 26 2 higher in comparison to the intact fungal pellets the maximum cell surface hydrophobicity 64 1 was for eps extracted fungal pellets incubated in the presence of indium fig 8b table 1 gives the composition of the eps extracted from the fungal biomass collected at the end of the different incubations the amount of total organic carbon varied between 275 and 394 g l with the maximum value for pellets incubated with tellurite and indium among the polysaccharides and protein the polysaccharide content was much higher 318 2 430 0 mg g of eps than the protein content 140 1 194 4 mg g of eps the control fungal pellets had relatively lower amounts of toc polysaccharides and protein content than the pellets exposed to different combinations of indium and oxyanions eem spectra were obtained for the extracted eps samples from different incubations fig 9 the spectra are categorized into five zones i v each representing one or more specific compounds most of the eps samples including the control showed peaks in zone iv excitation emission 250 380 280 380 indicating the presence of soluble microbial product like compounds fig 9 36 among the different samples samples obtained from fungal pellets incubated in the presence of only indium tellurite and indium and all the three elements showed most prominent peaks for zone iv the eps sample obtained from pellets exposed to tellurite and indium has another peak in zone v excitation emission 250 380 380 460 which shows the presence of humic acid like substances 36 there were no other prominent peaks in zone i zone ii and zone iii for any of the samples indicating the absence of tyrosine tryptophan and fluvic acid like compounds in the eps samples fig 9 3 5 characterization of the

37 4 discussion 4 1 simultaneous removal of indium selenium and tellurium by aspergillus niger this study for the first time demonstrated fungal removal of indium in the presence of selenium and tellurium in batch conditions at ph 7 0 and 30 c the indium removal varied depending on the indium concentration presence of co pollutants selenite and tellurite and their concentrations fig 1 the maximum amount of indium was removed when it was present in media without selenite and tellurite fig 1 this is due to the toxicity exerted by these oxyanions on a niger the toxic effect of selenite and tellurite on bacteria and fungi is well known 38 39 hence it is understandable why indium removal plummeted in their presence fig 1 among the two oxyanions the presence of selenite more negatively impacted indium removal than tellurite indicating selenite is more toxic to a niger the initial indium concentration also had a significant impact on its removal with maximum indium removal at lower 5 mg l than at higher 10 mg l concentrations fig 1 lowering the selenite and tellurite concentrations did not increase the indium removal performance of a niger however when these results are compared with the indium removal achieved in the absence of selenite and tellurite the improvement of indium removal in the absence of the oxyanions can be clearly seen these observations indicate that selenite and tellurite have a toxic effect on a niger which in turn lowered the indium removal in their presence the indium concentration affected the selenite removal with a maximum selenite removal at low indium concentrations 5 mg l this indicates that there is an inhibitory effect of indium on selenite reduction by a niger although no such effect on a niger or any other fungal species has thus far been reported the reduction in selenite concentration from 10 mg l to 5 mg l did not positively impact its removal this contrasts our previous work 28 29 where the selenite removal was better at low initial selenite concentrations this could be due to the combined effect of other pollutants which was not investigated in our previous studies 28 29 the tellurite removal values were much higher than the other two elements for almost all the experimental conditions fig 1 this was also observed in our earlier work where tellurite removal by a niger pellets was better than selenite removal 28 29 this relative removal capability for selenite and tellurite is species specific with different fungal species showing preferential removal efficiencies 39 40 similar to the selenite removal the indium concentration affected the tellurite removal with maximum tellurite removal at the low indium concentration 5 mg l however the effect of selenite on tellurite removal was more prominent than indium as in all the different experimental combinations the tellurium removal was always better when it was treated only in the presence of indium rather than selenium fig 1 contrary to selenite removal lowering the initial tellurite concentration showed a positive effect on its removal with values reaching as high as 95 7 at its low initial concentration fig 1 among the three elements tested the results clearly show that tellurite is preferentially removed by a niger pellets 4 2 mechanism of indium selenium and tellurium removal by aspergillus niger fig 12 depicts the possible mechanism involved in the simultaneous removal of indium selenium and tellurium the mechanism involved in selenite and tellurite removal by fungal species has been reported in previous studies 29 39 selenite or tellurite are generally taken up within the fungal cell where due to different enzymatic reduction processes they are reduced to their elemental forms the oxyanions interact with different active groups present on the surface of the fungal cells the change in peak intensities of various active groups such as hydroxyl amine amides alkynyl alkyl and alkanes groups in the ftir spectra fig 11 indicates the role of these functional groups in interacting with the oxyanions elemental selenium or tellurium formed within the fungal cells are often stabilized and capped by proteins or other biomolecules 29 41 and the elemental selenium and tellurium nanoparticles can either be excreted out of the cell or retained within the fungal cells 41 in this study the elemental selenium and tellurium nanoparticles were retained within the fungal biomass as indicated by the colour change of the resulting fungal pellets to characteristic orange and black colour for respectively elemental selenium and tellurium nanoparticles fig 4 furthermore the xrd spectra of the fungal pelleted biomass exposed to various combinations of selenium and tellurium always showed the presence of these compounds indicating their presence in the respective biomass fig 10 in the experiments where both selenite and tellurite were present synthesis of sete nanoparticles in addition to their respective elemental nanoparticles were also confirmed by xrd analysis fig 10 this finding correlates well with a previous study where sete nanoparticles were synthesized by phanerochaete chrysosporium in the presence of selenite and tellurite 39 the mechanism by which indium was removed by a niger pellets is difficult to determine and may have involved a combination of different mechanisms fig 12 this hypothesis for indium removal is derived from other similar studies involving base metals such as zinc cadmium and lead 25 31 42 it can be assumed that indium too is taken up inside the fungal cell where it was either detoxified by storing it into cellular vacuoles or reduced to indium chalcogenide compounds by reacting with selenide or telluride produced by fungal selenite and tellurite reduction 31 this reaction of indium with selenide or telluride to produce indium chalcogenide nanoparticles can occur in both the intracellular and extracellular space sem imaging confirmed indium chalcogenide particles had precipitated on the fungal hyphal structures fig 6 the presence of these indium chalcogenide nanoparticles within the biomass could be explained by the fact that these particles tend to precipitate 25 43 which caused them to accumulate onto the fungal pellets xrd analysis confirmed the presence of indium selenide or indium telluride in the biomass exposed to the respective combinations of selenite indium and tellurite indium fig 10 no such indium chalcogenide compounds were detected in the biomass treating indium along with both selenite and tellurite this might be due to the higher preference for formation of sete over selenide and telluride formation in the presence of selenite and tellurite another reason could be as the overall removal of indium selenite and tellurite was comparatively low in the incubations when all the three elements were present this resulted in further lower amounts of indium selenide or indium telluride formation that were below the detection limit of the xrd instrument 4 3 effect of in se and te exposure on fungal pellets the shape size and colour of the fungal pellets varied depending upon the elements or combinations of them they were exposed to figs 3 4 the fungal pellets treating selenite and tellurite in any combination formed more compact and perfectly rounded pellets whereas the control pellets are more irregularly shaped and formed a star like structure fig 4 this is similar to the observations made in previous studies with a niger 29 and other fungal species such as phanerochaete chrysosporium 44 the reason is that selenite and tellurite cause the fungal species to form more compact pellets as part of their stress tolerance mechanism 44 45 nutrient limiting conditions can also cause pellets to form such compact shape 46 but in this study nutrients particularly the carbon substrate 10 g l glucose was provided in excess to avoid any such condition the average size of the pellets treating selenite and tellurite was much smaller 0 3 0 4 cm compared to control pellets or pellets only exposed to indium 0 5 cm fig 3 this reduction in size due to exposure to selenite or tellurite can also be explained by the toxicity induced by these compounds 44 the change in pellets colour to orange and black were due to accumulation of elemental selenium and tellurium nanoparticles respectively within the pellets which provide these characteristic colours 29 39 exposure to indium only did not affect the fungal pellets and they showed similar features to the control pellets with white colour and star like irregular shape this indicates that indium does not have similar toxic effects on this a niger species as selenite or tellurite the analysis of the eps from fungal pellets exposed to different combinations of indium selenite and tellurite showed that production of eps increased upon exposure to these pollutants in comparison to the control pellets table 1 the increase in eps concentration confirms eps is acting as a first line of protection for the fungi against stress induced by these pollutants 32 the zeta potential values of the fungal cells changed as the negative surface charge increased upon addition of the elements in the growth medium fig 8a furthermore the presence of indium selenite and tellurite resulted in increase in cell surface hydrophobicity fig 8b this indicates that the eps on the cell surface provides the cells with negative charges and helps in interacting with the metals or metalloids 32 a similar increase in cell surface hydrophobicity due to interaction with elements such as ni ca and mg has been reported previously for both fungi and bacteria and supports this finding in the current study 32 47 the compositional analysis of the eps in the presence of the elements in various combinations shows that mainly the soluble microbial byproducts for indium indium selenite and indium selenite tellurite and humic acid for indium selenite content increased compared to the control fig 9 soluble microbial products are produced from microbial metabolism and decay and are able to flocculate pollutants in wastewater 48 the increase in production of polysaccharides and protein can be also due to their role in metal removal 49 both the polysaccharide and proteins can act as metal binding compounds 32 which is evidenced by the decrease in peak intensities of key functional groups hydroxyl carboxyl amine and amide related to these biomolecules in the ftir spectra fig 11 although such an increase in biomolecules has been previously reported during interactions of metals with fungi 32 or yeast 50 the relative change in their composition was species depended and related to the stress tolerance mechanism employed by that particular microorganism 4 4 practical implication and future perspective resource recovery has in recent times become a major focus of wastewater treatment and waste management 51 52 this not only helps in pollution mitigation but also supports in achieving the sustainable development goals under the concept of circular economy 53 the findings from this study show strong potential of fungal pelleted systems for simultaneous removal and recovery of indium selenium and tellurium as elemental chalcogen and indium chalcogenide nanoparticles the a niger strain was efficient in removing these pollutants even when they are present in combination this method can provide an alternative process to recover indium from mining industry waste streams or leachate of waste mining residues such type of mining wastes are low in ph 19 and as fungi thrive at low ph it is an additional advantage of using fungal based methods for recovering indium another point to be noted here is that these waste streams contain many other pollutants including various heavy metals 19 23 54 the effect of these co pollutants on the process efficiency should be studied in detail in order to make this method applicable at industrial scale although the indium removal was best when it was treated in the absence of any other co pollutant conversion of indium to indium selenide or indium telluride in the presence of selenite and tellurite can be of more interest due to the higher commercial value of these compounds 55 real wastewater may not contain these pollutants along with indium in such cases addition of selenite and tellurite in the fungal growth media can be considered future research should focus on selective recovery of these nanoparticles from fungal biomass after the treatment which is a challenging task even if the target of the treatment is only to remove these pollutants from wastewater this method using fungal pellets can be successfully applied as the pollutants are mostly concentrated within the fungal biomass and the fungal pellets have good settling properties and can thus be easily separated from the treated effluent for reuse one of the major costs of fungal treatment is the cost of carbon substrate to maintain their proper biological activity and pellet formation the process cost reduction by using alternative substrates such as carbonaceous wastes or leachates from the acid pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials e g brewery spent grains 28 can be an area for future studies the life span of fungal pellets can be quite short and it is mostly limited within 40 60 days during continuous bioreactor operation 29 56 considering such short life span special focus needs to be given towards developing a continuous bioprocess where reactor operation could be maintained for a longer duration in this regard further studies should be conducted on optimizing pellet harvesting and refill strategies the main limitations of this study include difficulty of maintaining pure cultures in an open type treatment systems where chances of contamination with other microbial strains are high low handling capacity of fungal systems and challenges of separating the indium chalcogenide and elemental chalcogen nanoparticles from the fungal biomass without considerable loss of materials at low cost 5 conclusion efficient removal of indium selenium and tellurium was obtained using fungal a niger pellets at 30 c and ph 3 5 a niger showed high tolerance towards these pollutants even when these pollutants were present simultaneously the maximum indium removal efficiency of 80 8 was obtained for 5 mg l of indium in the absence of selenite or tellurite the indium removal efficiency dropped in these elements with higher impact at their elevated concentrations 10 mg l selenite had a more inhibitory effect on the removal of the two other compounds with indium and tellurite removal values lowering to 52 3 68 and 33 7 69 2 respectively at different initial concentrations among the three elements selenite showed least removal efficiency 47 8 59 5 consistently under different incubations the speciation of selenite and tellurite revealed their conversion to respectively elemental selenium 23 4 55 3 and tellurium 24 4 71 8 nanoparticles which accumulated within the fungal pellets showing potential for their recovery after treatment the indium was removed as either indium selenide or indium telluride in the presence of selenite and tellurite in the medium metal fungi interactions and stress tolerance mechanisms exerted by in se and te induced changes in eps composition surface charge and cell surface hydrophobicity of the fungal pellets exposure to selenite and tellurite affected the

12682,the feasibility of simultaneous removal of indium selenite and tellurite using biological reduction by aspergillus niger fungal pellets is explored initially batch experiments were conducted to study the capability of a niger pellets to remove indium selenium and tellurium in different combinations the indium removal efficiency ranged between 52 3 and 65 6 at 10 mg l with a maximum removal 65 in incubations with only indium or indium with tellurite the tellurium removal efficiency was maximum 76 7 in experiments with indium but dropped drastically to 47 2 and 33 7 respectively when selenite and indium were incubated together the selenite removal efficiencies of the a niger pellets were more consistent 50 2 59 5 for different experimental combinations and were not affected by either indium or tellurium further characterization of fungal biomass showed accumulation of mainly elemental se and te nanoparticles within the pellets in addition xrd analysis showed the formation of indium selenide and indium telluride during their simultaneous removal the eps production by a niger increased in the presence of these elements along with changes in the polysaccharide and protein content of the eps the fluorescence eem spectra revealed that the eps produced by a niger during pollutant removal was mostly composed of soluble microbial products and humic acid like substances this study demonstrated recovery of elemental chalcogen and indium chalcogenide nanoparticles can be achieved using fungal pelleted systems graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aspergillus niger indium fungal pellet indium selenide indium telluride extracellular polymeric substances data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction indium is an element with high demand due to its use in advanced technological instruments 1 for its most important applications indium is used in the form of indium tin oxide ito as optoconductive coating in the touch screens of mobile phones computers televisions and other smart devices photovoltaics instruments and solar panels 2 in the environment indium is found associated with zinc bearing ores 3 on average the indium content of the earth crust is quite minimal 0 1 ppm however in certain indium rich regions it can be as high as 200 ppm 4 the european union eu has categorized indium as a critical raw material 5 which means that this is one of the important raw materials of high economic and strategic importance for the european economic development but its supply chain is endangered with many potential risks 6 due to this high supply risk the eu has provided many suggestions to ensure its steady supply including recovery of indium from alternative sources such as indium containing wastes and end of use products 7 hence owing to such high demand and low availability of indium its recovery from non traditional sources including from indium containing waste materials should be explored the waste resources such as mine dumping 8 metallurgical processing by products or waste 9 end of use products mostly electronics and electronic industry wastes can be valorised by extracting indium from them 10 the extraction of indium from these waste materials has mostly used traditional hydrometallurgical processes such as acid leaching 11 12 to further separate indium from the leachate solution precipitation 13 solvent extraction 14 membrane separation or adsorption including ion exchange resins 15 16 can be used biological methods for metal recovery have gained increased attention in the recent past due to many advantages over conventional metallurgical methods such as low process cost less corrosive nature and environmental friendliness 17 although biological methods such as bioleaching bioprecipitation biomineralization biosorption and bioaccumulation have been successfully used for various metals 18 19 there are only a few studies in case of indium among the biological methods bioleaching is the most explored biological route for indium recovery both bacteria acidithiobacillus thiooxidans and fungi aspergillus niger have been used 17 20 for leaching indium in addition biosorption using shewanella algae bacterium was used for indium recovery from aqueous solution 21 the other biological methods such as biomineralization and bioprecipitation are thus far unexplored for indium recovery these two methods can not only be important for indium recovery from mine drainage but can also serve as a post treatment to indium containing leachates obtained by either acid or biological leaching as they convert the soluble indium to solid precipitates however to the best of our knowledge no microorganisms so far are reported to be capable of directly precipitating indium from solution in this regard there is a need for developing novel methodology for recovery of indium this study examined a new approach using biomineralization of indium as selenide and telluride for its recovery from aqueous solution selenite and tellurite are pollutants of aquatic ecosystems with detrimental impact on the environment 22 there are various technologies available for their removal from the environment including biological reduction 23 in the biological reduction microbes reduce these chalcogens to their elemental or chalcogenide forms which also facilitate their recovery 23 the chalcogenide forms i e selenide and telluride of these pollutants can precipitate with cations such as metal ions to form metal chalcogenides 24 25 these metal chalcogenides are often in the nano size range with various unique properties for wide ranging applications in many fields 25 26 there are quite a few studies on metal chalcogenide nanoparticle synthesis using this method 24 25 but none so far on indium moreover there are no previous reports of biological mineralization of indium using either bacteria or fungi in this study a selenite and tellurite tolerant fungal species of a niger was chosen as biocatalyst to examine the feasibility of biological synthesis of indium chalcogenide nanoparticles a niger was chosen for this study as this fungus has a tolerance towards toxic compounds including metals 27 can reduce se and te 28 and has ability to form pellets 28 29 the objective of this study was to remove indium in the presence of different combinations of selenite and tellurite the effect of indium on selenite and tellurite reduction by a niger was also examined this was done to evaluate if there is any preferential removal of indium by a niger with either selenite or tellurite moreover the concentrations were varied to understand the change in elemental speciation of these compounds during biological reduction and if these played a role on the indium removal performance the fungal biomass was characterized using different instrumental techniques namely x ray diffraction analysis xrd and fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy to understand the mechanism involved in the process the fungal pellets were further characterized by the estimation of the cell surface charge and cell surface hydrophobicity along with qualitative and quantitative analysis of the extracellular polymeric substances 2 materials and methods 2 1 fungal strain and inoculum preparation the a niger strain used in this study was isolated from a lab scale bioreactor treating selenite containing wastewater and its identification and characterization has been described previously 29 the fungal spores were obtained after incubating the strain on a potato dextrose agar plate for 5 days at 30 c the spores were harvested in sterile distilled water and stored in a refrigerator 4 c for further use during different experiments to prepare the fungal pellets initially media were prepared without any pollutants indium selenite or tellurite and 1 ml of spore solution was added to it before being incubated for 24 h in an orbital shaker maintained at 30 c once fungal pellets had formed they were used as inoculum at 5 v v in the experiments to study the indium removal by a niger for each experiment fresh fungal pellets were prepared as inoculum 2 2 experimental set up the experiments for assessing indium removal by a niger fungal pellets under selenite and tellurite reducing conditions were conducted in batch mode using 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing mineral salt media msm 28 the composition of the msm used was as follows g l glucose 10 potassium phosphate 2 magnesium sulfate 0 5 ammonium chloride 0 1 calcium chloride 0 1 and thiamine 0 001 glucose 10 g l was used in the medium as the carbon source 29 the ph of the media was adjusted to 3 5 with the help of 0 1 n naoh or hcl prior to use media were autoclaved at 121 c and 15 psi pressure for 30 min indium selenite and tellurite were added from their respective stock solution 1000 mg l of indium chloride sodium selenite and potassium tellurite as per the requirement in the initial experiments these elements were kept at 10 mg l each to study their removal at different combinations in the subsequent step the effect of the indium concentration was examined by reducing its concentration to 5 mg l and by keeping the selenite and tellurite concentration fixed at 10 mg l to study the effect of the selenite and tellurite concentration on indium removal the selenite and tellurite concentrations were reduced to 5 mg l the conical flasks containing 100 ml msm with fungal pellets in se and te were incubated in an orbital shaker at 30 c for 15 days the liquid samples were withdrawn daily and analysed for in se and te concentrations all experiments are conducted in triplicate and the results are reported as mean standard deviation 2 3 fungal biomass and nanoparticles characterization the fungal biomass obtained upon completion of the shake flask incubations was observed by sem hitachi s 4700 tokyo japan to check any morphological changes due to

they were examined under sem combined with edx hitachi s 4700 tokyo japan as described by sinharoy and lens 28 edx spectra of the samples were also recorded to examine the elemental composition of the pellets for xrd analysis fungal pellets obtained after experiments with different incubation conditions were dried at constant temperature 60 c and made into powdered form using a mortar and pestle such prepared fungal biomass powder was analysed using xrd fitted with a panalytical empyrean diffractometer almelo the netherlands as described by sinharoy and lens 28 the dried biomass was also analysed using a ftir spectrometer thermo scientific nicolet is5 wisconsin usa as described by sinharoy and lens 28 and the spectra were obtained in between 4000 and 400cm 1 2 4 extracellular polymeric substances extraction and characterization extracellular polymeric substances eps from the fungal pellets were extracted using the method described by hou et al 30 briefly fungal pellets 15 ml obtained from different incubations were washed first with deionised water to remove residual substrate following which they were heated at 60 c for 15 min they were then centrifuged at 12 000 g at 4 c for 20 min to separate the supernatant from the pellet and the supernatant obtained after centrifugation is considered as eps 30 the eps was further analysed for its total organic carbon toc polysaccharides and protein content toc was measured using a toc l shimadzu tokyo japan as described in jacob et al 31 the polysaccharides and protein content were measured using the phenol sulfuric acid and lowry method respectively 32 the eps was also analysed using fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy shimadzu rf 6000 tokyo japan to obtain their 3d eem plots as described by sinharoy and lens 28 2 5 zeta potential and cell surface hydrophobicity analysis the zeta potential of the fungal cells was analysed using light scattering particle analyser litesizer 500 graz austria as described by cao et al 32 fungal pellets were homogenised in a phosphate urea magnesium sulfate pum buffer of ph 7 1 composition in g l dipotassium phosphate 22 2 potassium dihydrogen phosphate 7

2 Î¼m pore size syringe filter and acidified with 2 hno3 prior to the measurement the selenide and telluride concentrations were calculated by subtracting the respective selenite and tellurite concentrations from the total soluble selenium and tellurium 3 results 3 1 simultaneous removal of indium selenium and tellurium by aspergillus niger fig 1 shows the indium selenium and tellurium removal by a niger at their different initial concentrations in the first experiment where all the elements were at 10 mg l the indium removal efficiency ranged in between 52 3 and 65 6 with a maximum removal 65 in incubations with only indium or indium with tellurite fig 1a selenite removal was more or less unaffected with selenite removal efficiencies of 50 2 59 5 and 52 1 in experiments where along with selenite respectively indium tellurite and both of these elements were present fig 1b the tellurium removal efficiency showed drastic change with values dropping from 76 7 in incubations with indium to 47 2 and 33 7 when respectively selenite or both selenite and indium were present fig 1c the effects of a low indium concentration 5 mg l on indium selenium and tellurium removal by a niger pellets are depicted in fig 1 d f the maximum indium removal efficiency of 80 8 was obtained for 5 mg l of indium in the absence of selenite or tellurite fig 1d the indium removal efficiency decreased to 59 8 78 and 68 in the case of selenite tellurite or both were present the selenite removal at low indium concentration 5 mg l was higher than that obtained in the experiments with 10 mg l indium fig 1e also in this case the selenium removal was the lowest 47 8 when all the three elements were present simultaneously in comparison to the binary combinations tellurium removal was higher than selenium removal efficiencies in all the different combinations except for the experiment with only selenium and tellurium where the tellurium removal efficiency was merely 42 7 fig 1f the maximum tellurium removal efficiency of 72 3 was obtained in experiments with 10 mg l of tellurite along with 5 mg l indium the tellurium removal efficiency was quite high 69 2 even in the experiments with the three elements present together the effect of a low selenium and tellurium concentration 5 mg l and a high indium concentration 10 mg l on their removal is shown in fig 1 g i the indium removal values in this case were consistent with the first experiment where all the pollutants were supplemented at a high concentration 10 mg l the indium removal efficiencies were 69 5 52 9 56 3 and 41 5 respectively for the experiments with only indium indium and selenite indium and tellurite and when all three elements were present fig 1g the selenium removal efficiency was much affected at its lower concentration with values ranging from 22 5 to 44 5 under different experimental combinations fig 1h in contrast tellurium showed the highest removal efficiencies 95 7 84 2 and 83 1 among the three elements at 5 mg l fig 1i 3 2 selenium and tellurium speciation during their removal by aspergillus niger along with indium fig 2 shows the different selenium and tellurium species under the various experimental combinations for both selenium and tellurium the majority of the removed compounds had accumulated within the biomass among the remaining selenium and tellurium compounds in solution after 15 days of incubation respectively the selenite and tellurite fractions were maximum however there was a lot of variation in their respective concentrations depending on the initial oxyanion concentration and the combination of compounds the selenium concentration in the biomass ranged between 43 7 55 3 and 45 6 49 3 in the presence of 5 and 10 mg l of indium respectively fig 2a c the tellurium concentration in the fungal biomass amounted to 60 1 68 8 and 24 4 69 9 respectively for the parallel incubations fig 2b d at low initial selenium and tellurium concentration 5 mg l the variation in their accumulation within the biomass was larger with 23 4 30 8 and 35 6 71 8 for selenium and tellurium respectively fig 2e f the concentration of the other product of fungal metabolism of selenite and tellurite i e selenide and telluride soluble fraction was much lower 1 mg l than the other fractions 3 3 effect of indium selenite and tellurite on a niger pellets the shape and size of the fungal pellets significantly differed in the different incubations figs 3 and 4 the pellets formed in the presence of only indium have a consistent size distribution and more pellets of a larger 0 5 cm size were formed fig 3 these pellets had a more or less similar shape to the control pellets with star like hyphal growth protruding out of the pellet structure fig 4 the fungal pellets formed in the presence of either selenite tellurite or in any combination with indium had smaller sizes compared with pellets formed when only indium was present in the incubation in all cases the majority of the pellets were 0 3 0 4 cm and much less some cases nil pellets that are 0 5 cm in size had formed fig 3 the appearance of the pellets exposed to selenite and tellurite differed noticeably with orange and black coloured pellets formation in the presence of respectively selenite and tellurite fig 4 the pellets formed in the presence of both selenite and tellurite were black but their colour intensity was low almost grey in appearance in comparison to the pellets exposed to tellurite and indium without selenite present the pellets formed in these four experimental conditions were of smooth and rounded shape compared with pellets formed in the presence of indium only fig 4 fig 5 shows the sem images of the a niger fungal pellets incubated in different combinations of in se and te as well as the control pellets grown without any of these elements at the microstructure level there was not much difference in terms of width and appearance in between the fungal hyphae obtained from different incubations however the pellet structure appears to be more compact in the presence of indium and oxyanions particularly the samples obtained from incubations with selenite tellurite and indium selenite tellurite appear tightly packed without much of a gap in between individual hypha fig 6 shows the indium chalcogenide nanoparticles that have precipitated onto the fungal hyphae for incubations with indium and se te oxyanions the nanoparticles formed are 10 nm in size furthermore the edx spectra depicted in fig 7 shows the presence of in se and te in the respective fungal samples obtained from incubations with these elements the control pellet does not have any of these elements the other elements such as mg k p c and o are attributed to either media constituents or the fungal biomass 3 4 characterization of the extra cellular polymeric matrix the zeta potential values of the intact and eps extracted fungal cells were negative and ranged between 4 7 to 9 3 mv fig 8a for most of the samples the zeta potential values of intact fungal pellets were higher in comparison to the eps extracted pellets the maximum zeta potential value was for fungal biomass exposed to tellurium and indium the pellets obtained from different incubations with indium selenite and tellurite had higher zeta potential values 6 4 to 9 3 mv compared with the control pellets 5 7 and 5 9 mv except for eps extracted fungal pellets obtained from incubation with selenite and indium 4 7 mv the cell surface hydrophobicity values varied greatly depending on the indium selenite and tellurite combinations fig 8b this value was the lowest 33 2 and 34 7 for the control fungal pellets which were incubated with more of the elements the eps extracted fungal pellets had higher cell surface hydrophobicity 5 6 26 2 higher in comparison to the intact fungal pellets the maximum cell surface hydrophobicity 64 1 was for eps extracted fungal pellets incubated in the presence of indium fig 8b table 1 gives the composition of the eps extracted from the fungal biomass collected at the end of the different incubations the amount of total organic carbon varied between 275 and 394 g l with the maximum value for pellets incubated with tellurite and indium among the polysaccharides and protein the polysaccharide content was much higher 318 2 430 0 mg g of eps than the protein content 140 1 194 4 mg g of eps the control fungal pellets had relatively lower amounts of toc polysaccharides and protein content than the pellets exposed to different combinations of indium and oxyanions eem spectra were obtained for the extracted eps samples from different incubations fig 9 the spectra are categorized into five zones i v each representing one or more specific compounds most of the eps samples including the control showed peaks in zone iv excitation emission 250 380 280 380 indicating the presence of soluble microbial product like compounds fig 9 36 among the different samples samples obtained from fungal pellets incubated in the presence of only indium tellurite and indium and all the three elements showed most prominent peaks for zone iv the eps sample obtained from pellets exposed to tellurite and indium has another peak in zone v excitation emission 250 380 380 460 which shows the presence of humic acid like substances 36 there were no other prominent peaks in zone i zone ii and zone iii for any of the samples indicating the absence of tyrosine tryptophan and fluvic acid like compounds in the eps samples fig 9 3 5 characterization of the

37 4 discussion 4 1 simultaneous removal of indium selenium and tellurium by aspergillus niger this study for the first time demonstrated fungal removal of indium in the presence of selenium and tellurium in batch conditions at ph 7 0 and 30 c the indium removal varied depending on the indium concentration presence of co pollutants selenite and tellurite and their concentrations fig 1 the maximum amount of indium was removed when it was present in media without selenite and tellurite fig 1 this is due to the toxicity exerted by these oxyanions on a niger the toxic effect of selenite and tellurite on bacteria and fungi is well known 38 39 hence it is understandable why indium removal plummeted in their presence fig 1 among the two oxyanions the presence of selenite more negatively impacted indium removal than tellurite indicating selenite is more toxic to a niger the initial indium concentration also had a significant impact on its removal with maximum indium removal at lower 5 mg l than at higher 10 mg l concentrations fig 1 lowering the selenite and tellurite concentrations did not increase the indium removal performance of a niger however when these results are compared with the indium removal achieved in the absence of selenite and tellurite the improvement of indium removal in the absence of the oxyanions can be clearly seen these observations indicate that selenite and tellurite have a toxic effect on a niger which in turn lowered the indium removal in their presence the indium concentration affected the selenite removal with a maximum selenite removal at low indium concentrations 5 mg l this indicates that there is an inhibitory effect of indium on selenite reduction by a niger although no such effect on a niger or any other fungal species has thus far been reported the reduction in selenite concentration from 10 mg l to 5 mg l did not positively impact its removal this contrasts our previous work 28 29 where the selenite removal was better at low initial selenite concentrations this could be due to the combined effect of other pollutants which was not investigated in our previous studies 28 29 the tellurite removal values were much higher than the other two elements for almost all the experimental conditions fig 1 this was also observed in our earlier work where tellurite removal by a niger pellets was better than selenite removal 28 29 this relative removal capability for selenite and tellurite is species specific with different fungal species showing preferential removal efficiencies 39 40 similar to the selenite removal the indium concentration affected the tellurite removal with maximum tellurite removal at the low indium concentration 5 mg l however the effect of selenite on tellurite removal was more prominent than indium as in all the different experimental combinations the tellurium removal was always better when it was treated only in the presence of indium rather than selenium fig 1 contrary to selenite removal lowering the initial tellurite concentration showed a positive effect on its removal with values reaching as high as 95 7 at its low initial concentration fig 1 among the three elements tested the results clearly show that tellurite is preferentially removed by a niger pellets 4 2 mechanism of indium selenium and tellurium removal by aspergillus niger fig 12 depicts the possible mechanism involved in the simultaneous removal of indium selenium and tellurium the mechanism involved in selenite and tellurite removal by fungal species has been reported in previous studies 29 39 selenite or tellurite are generally taken up within the fungal cell where due to different enzymatic reduction processes they are reduced to their elemental forms the oxyanions interact with different active groups present on the surface of the fungal cells the change in peak intensities of various active groups such as hydroxyl amine amides alkynyl alkyl and alkanes groups in the ftir spectra fig 11 indicates the role of these functional groups in interacting with the oxyanions elemental selenium or tellurium formed within the fungal cells are often stabilized and capped by proteins or other biomolecules 29 41 and the elemental selenium and tellurium nanoparticles can either be excreted out of the cell or retained within the fungal cells 41 in this study the elemental selenium and tellurium nanoparticles were retained within the fungal biomass as indicated by the colour change of the resulting fungal pellets to characteristic orange and black colour for respectively elemental selenium and tellurium nanoparticles fig 4 furthermore the xrd spectra of the fungal pelleted biomass exposed to various combinations of selenium and tellurium always showed the presence of these compounds indicating their presence in the respective biomass fig 10 in the experiments where both selenite and tellurite were present synthesis of sete nanoparticles in addition to their respective elemental nanoparticles were also confirmed by xrd analysis fig 10 this finding correlates well with a previous study where sete nanoparticles were synthesized by phanerochaete chrysosporium in the presence of selenite and tellurite 39 the mechanism by which indium was removed by a niger pellets is difficult to determine and may have involved a combination of different mechanisms fig 12 this hypothesis for indium removal is derived from other similar studies involving base metals such as zinc cadmium and lead 25 31 42 it can be assumed that indium too is taken up inside the fungal cell where it was either detoxified by storing it into cellular vacuoles or reduced to indium chalcogenide compounds by reacting with selenide or telluride produced by fungal selenite and tellurite reduction 31 this reaction of indium with selenide or telluride to produce indium chalcogenide nanoparticles can occur in both the intracellular and extracellular space sem imaging confirmed indium chalcogenide particles had precipitated on the fungal hyphal structures fig 6 the presence of these indium chalcogenide nanoparticles within the biomass could be explained by the fact that these particles tend to precipitate 25 43 which caused them to accumulate onto the fungal pellets xrd analysis confirmed the presence of indium selenide or indium telluride in the biomass exposed to the respective combinations of selenite indium and tellurite indium fig 10 no such indium chalcogenide compounds were detected in the biomass treating indium along with both selenite and tellurite this might be due to the higher preference for formation of sete over selenide and telluride formation in the presence of selenite and tellurite another reason could be as the overall removal of indium selenite and tellurite was comparatively low in the incubations when all the three elements were present this resulted in further lower amounts of indium selenide or indium telluride formation that were below the detection limit of the xrd instrument 4 3 effect of in se and te exposure on fungal pellets the shape size and colour of the fungal pellets varied depending upon the elements or combinations of them they were exposed to figs 3 4 the fungal pellets treating selenite and tellurite in any combination formed more compact and perfectly rounded pellets whereas the control pellets are more irregularly shaped and formed a star like structure fig 4 this is similar to the observations made in previous studies with a niger 29 and other fungal species such as phanerochaete chrysosporium 44 the reason is that selenite and tellurite cause the fungal species to form more compact pellets as part of their stress tolerance mechanism 44 45 nutrient limiting conditions can also cause pellets to form such compact shape 46 but in this study nutrients particularly the carbon substrate 10 g l glucose was provided in excess to avoid any such condition the average size of the pellets treating selenite and tellurite was much smaller 0 3 0 4 cm compared to control pellets or pellets only exposed to indium 0 5 cm fig 3 this reduction in size due to exposure to selenite or tellurite can also be explained by the toxicity induced by these compounds 44 the change in pellets colour to orange and black were due to accumulation of elemental selenium and tellurium nanoparticles respectively within the pellets which provide these characteristic colours 29 39 exposure to indium only did not affect the fungal pellets and they showed similar features to the control pellets with white colour and star like irregular shape this indicates that indium does not have similar toxic effects on this a niger species as selenite or tellurite the analysis of the eps from fungal pellets exposed to different combinations of indium selenite and tellurite showed that production of eps increased upon exposure to these pollutants in comparison to the control pellets table 1 the increase in eps concentration confirms eps is acting as a first line of protection for the fungi against stress induced by these pollutants 32 the zeta potential values of the fungal cells changed as the negative surface charge increased upon addition of the elements in the growth medium fig 8a furthermore the presence of indium selenite and tellurite resulted in increase in cell surface hydrophobicity fig 8b this indicates that the eps on the cell surface provides the cells with negative charges and helps in interacting with the metals or metalloids 32 a similar increase in cell surface hydrophobicity due to interaction with elements such as ni ca and mg has been reported previously for both fungi and bacteria and supports this finding in the current study 32 47 the compositional analysis of the eps in the presence of the elements in various combinations shows that mainly the soluble microbial byproducts for indium indium selenite and indium selenite tellurite and humic acid for indium selenite content increased compared to the control fig 9 soluble microbial products are produced from microbial metabolism and decay and are able to flocculate pollutants in wastewater 48 the increase in production of polysaccharides and protein can be also due to their role in metal removal 49 both the polysaccharide and proteins can act as metal binding compounds 32 which is evidenced by the decrease in peak intensities of key functional groups hydroxyl carboxyl amine and amide related to these biomolecules in the ftir spectra fig 11 although such an increase in biomolecules has been previously reported during interactions of metals with fungi 32 or yeast 50 the relative change in their composition was species depended and related to the stress tolerance mechanism employed by that particular microorganism 4 4 practical implication and future perspective resource recovery has in recent times become a major focus of wastewater treatment and waste management 51 52 this not only helps in pollution mitigation but also supports in achieving the sustainable development goals under the concept of circular economy 53 the findings from this study show strong potential of fungal pelleted systems for simultaneous removal and recovery of indium selenium and tellurium as elemental chalcogen and indium chalcogenide nanoparticles the a niger strain was efficient in removing these pollutants even when they are present in combination this method can provide an alternative process to recover indium from mining industry waste streams or leachate of waste mining residues such type of mining wastes are low in ph 19 and as fungi thrive at low ph it is an additional advantage of using fungal based methods for recovering indium another point to be noted here is that these waste streams contain many other pollutants including various heavy metals 19 23 54 the effect of these co pollutants on the process efficiency should be studied in detail in order to make this method applicable at industrial scale although the indium removal was best when it was treated in the absence of any other co pollutant conversion of indium to indium selenide or indium telluride in the presence of selenite and tellurite can be of more interest due to the higher commercial value of these compounds 55 real wastewater may not contain these pollutants along with indium in such cases addition of selenite and tellurite in the fungal growth media can be considered future research should focus on selective recovery of these nanoparticles from fungal biomass after the treatment which is a challenging task even if the target of the treatment is only to remove these pollutants from wastewater this method using fungal pellets can be successfully applied as the pollutants are mostly concentrated within the fungal biomass and the fungal pellets have good settling properties and can thus be easily separated from the treated effluent for reuse one of the major costs of fungal treatment is the cost of carbon substrate to maintain their proper biological activity and pellet formation the process cost reduction by using alternative substrates such as carbonaceous wastes or leachates from the acid pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials e g brewery spent grains 28 can be an area for future studies the life span of fungal pellets can be quite short and it is mostly limited within 40 60 days during continuous bioreactor operation 29 56 considering such short life span special focus needs to be given towards developing a continuous bioprocess where reactor operation could be maintained for a longer duration in this regard further studies should be conducted on optimizing pellet harvesting and refill strategies the main limitations of this study include difficulty of maintaining pure cultures in an open type treatment systems where chances of contamination with other microbial strains are high low handling capacity of fungal systems and challenges of separating the indium chalcogenide and elemental chalcogen nanoparticles from the fungal biomass without considerable loss of materials at low cost 5 conclusion efficient removal of indium selenium and tellurium was obtained using fungal a niger pellets at 30 c and ph 3 5 a niger showed high tolerance towards these pollutants even when these pollutants were present simultaneously the maximum indium removal efficiency of 80 8 was obtained for 5 mg l of indium in the absence of selenite or tellurite the indium removal efficiency dropped in these elements with higher impact at their elevated concentrations 10 mg l selenite had a more inhibitory effect on the removal of the two other compounds with indium and tellurite removal values lowering to 52 3 68 and 33 7 69 2 respectively at different initial concentrations among the three elements selenite showed least removal efficiency 47 8 59 5 consistently under different incubations the speciation of selenite and tellurite revealed their conversion to respectively elemental selenium 23 4 55 3 and tellurium 24 4 71 8 nanoparticles which accumulated within the fungal pellets showing potential for their recovery after treatment the indium was removed as either indium selenide or indium telluride in the presence of selenite and tellurite in the medium metal fungi interactions and stress tolerance mechanisms exerted by in se and te induced changes in eps composition surface charge and cell surface hydrophobicity of the fungal pellets exposure to selenite and tellurite affected the morphology of the fungal pellets with formation of smooth rounded and dense pellets whereas the pellets exposed to indium only remained similar as the control without any changes in their shape and

the change in living style and state of being comfort leads to rapid industrialization and in turn affects the environment significantly in various ways among various industries paint industries also play a major role in polluting the environment through effluent discharge gas emission and waste disposal in the form of organic and inorganic substances the important role of paint coatings is decoration and protection a large variety of pigments and extenders of different grades are used for different functional requirements and they vary widely from synthetic to natural minerals organic inorganic to metallic and depending upon the source of raw materials 1 the epoxy based coating is widely preferred due to their heavy corrosion protection property at low 2 aniline is the raw material for the synthesis of polyaniline which is used as a pigment in the paint industry conducting polymer polyaniline is synthesized in paint industries by chemical polymerization for their application in epoxy coating 3 besides many toxic substances the pigments developing industry also releases unreactive monomer and dimer of aniline compounds which on inhalation or ingestion creates severe health problems 4 5 aniline and its derivatives are typically removed from wastewater by physical biological and advanced oxidation process aop adsorption 6 membrane filtration 7 and thermal incineration 8 are preferred for physical removal of aniline these removal methods mostly generate secondary pollutant and are cost expensive thermal incineration leads to emission of nox and contributes to air pollution 9 aniline tolerant microorganisms in the form of bioreactors are employed to mineralize aniline in cost effective and eco friendly manner 10 11 however their selectivity and sluggish reaction kinetics hinder their long term application 12 the aops employing oh radicals generated via chemical and photo oxidation process such as electro fenton chemical fenton photo fenton are employed for complete mineralization of aniline to co2 13 15 electrochemical process is one of the best techniques for wastewater treatment 16 20 and recovery of useful products from industrial wastes 21 23 in alignment to the process of recovery of wealth from waste here we have experimented the recovery of polyaniline by electrochemical methods and applied it for effective removal of 2 4 dichlorophenoxy acetic acid 2 4 d aniline is prone to polymerize on the anode surface during electro oxidation electrochemical polymerization of aniline is routinely carried out in strongly acidic aqueous electrolytes by the formation of anilinium radical cation by aniline on the electrode 24 the low ph is almost always needed for preparation of the conductive polyaniline in the form of emeraldine salt since it is evidenced that at higher ph the deposited film is consisted of low chain oligomeric material 25 however only few researches have reported the application of electro polymerization as a method to remove aniline monomers from wastewater li et al 26 have reported the formation of polyaniline in the electrolyte containing 0 1 mol l 1 nacl employing pbo2 electrode 26 matsushita et al 27 employed electro polymerization on carbon fiber to depollute low concentrated aniline wastewater 27 shang et al 28 has studied the electro polymerization of aniline on ti sb sno2

wastewaters to the best of our knowledge no literatures have reported on the electro polymerization of polyaniline from the paint industry effluents recovery of polyaniline from aniline containing wastewaters is a sustainable approach to handle high toxic paint industry effluents in this context this work aims to recover polyaniline from paint industry effluent via electro polymerization and thereby reducing the toxicity of the wastewater the recovered polyaniline was characterized and converted into functional carbon for ecofriendly removal of 2 4 d by adsorption the 2 4 d was chosen for the study as it is one of the majorly used pesticide to kill broadleaf weeds in both agricultural and non agricultural practices above 1500 commercial herbicide products contain 2 4 d as active ingredient the ionizable form of 2 4 d easily percolates the environment causing major disruption to endocrine and the immune system of human beings 29 the limiting level of 2 4 d is 70 Î¼gl 1 in drinking water so far in drinking and surface waters 2 4 d at trace concentrations ranging from 62 ng l 1 to 12 Î¼g l 1 have been only reported 30 the activated carbon derived from polyaniline has

p chloro mxylenol by adsorption 31 32 herbicides such as atrazine and diuron have been removed by pani derived carbon 33 for the first time this study reports the application of polyaniline based carbon as efficient adsorbent for removal of 2 4 d herbicide from aqueous matrix thereby this article testifies the successful electrochemical technology for recovering reusable polyaniline thus reducing the toxicity of aniline wastewaters this research further conceptualizes recovery of wealth polyaniline derived carbon adsorbent from waste pigment effluent which is critically evolving as a complementary remediation approach 2 experimental method 2 1 sample collection effluent was collected from paint industry near dindugal 10 3624 n 77 9695 e tamil nadu and stored at 4 c to prevent

preparation of pani based ac to prepare pani activated carbon the recovered pani was completely grinded with potassium hydroxide koh pellets in a ratio of 1 2 the pani koh mixture was then subjected to pyrolysis at 800 c in tubular furnace for 2 h at 20 c min 35 the obtained powder was then washed with 1 m hcl to remove the koh and finally washed with distilled water by vacuum filtration the product was then dried in hot air oven at 70 c for 5 h and labeled as pani ac the surface morphology of the prepared pani ac and the c ac was analyzed by fe sem supra 55vp gemini column 2 7 adsorption the ability of pani ac to remove 2 4 d via adsorption was studied under batch conditions at room temperature in a 50 ml of 2 4 d the concentration of 2 4 d 50 mg l 1 was kept constant and the concentration of the adsorbent i e pani ac was varied 25 100 150 300 and 500 mg l 1 during the experiments the performance of the pani ac was compared with that of commercial activated carbon c ac the teflon sealed glass bottles containing the adsorbents pani ac and c ac and the 2 4 d solution were continuously stirred at 250 rpm to ensure sufficient contact of the pollutant on the adsorbent to examine the efficiency of pani ac in removing trace concentrations in natural water matrices the adsorption experiments was performed in tap water spiked with low concentration of 2 4 d 100 250 500 and 1000 Î¼g l 1 for the above mentioned experiments the 25 ppm of pani ac concentration was used the 2 4 d removal efficiency by pani ac and c ac was analyzed via high performance liquid chromatography hplc shimadzu germany the samples were collected at different time intervals of 0 5 1 2 3 and 4 h and centrifuged at 1200 rpm the clear supernatant samples were quantified for 2 4 d in

where k2 min mg 1 is the pseudo second order rate constant and qe is the amount adsorbed at equilibrium mg g 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 pani recovery from paint effluent the recovery of pani from the paint effluent containing monomers was established by electro polymerization the electro polymerization at a constant voltage of 1 8 v resulted in oxidation of aniline monomers to polymers over the graphite electrode during which the anode potential was about 0 6 v to 0 68 v this favored the polymerization of emeraldine base form of polyaniline if the anodic potential reaches above 0 8 v the emeraldine form will further oxidized and get converted to highly oxidized form of perdraniline a non conductive polymer 38 all aniline monomers can be completely converted into polymer but dimer of aniline can t be converted as polymer the acidic ph 2 3 of the effluent supported the polymerization of polyaniline in emeraldine form at basic ph the conducting polymer was not formed polyaniline was deposited at anode surface cathode side due to electrostatic interaction between the electrodes fig 2 the settling of green precipitates in the container and formation of green froth above the electrolyte was observed the precipitates and the forth were made up of the polymers of aniline during the polymerization current gradually increased and at a particular time current was stable this indicated the termination of polymerization reaction due to un availability of electrode surface for the growth of polymers the graphite dissolution potential is near 1 2 v but the graphite potential was below 0 7 v during the polymerization process hence the graphite dissolution at the applied voltage of 1 8 v was not observed under the applied potential the oxidation of aniline to a radical cation which exists in three resonance forms takes place as the initial step this is the slowest step of the electro polymerization reaction hence it s deemed as the rate determining step 25 in aniline polymerization head to tail coupling of the n and para radical cations takes place yielding a dicationic dimer species 39 this dimer further undergoes the process of re aromatisation which causes it to revert to its neutral state yielding an intermediate referred to as p aminodiphenylamine padpa these processes are also accompanied by the elimination of two protons 28 cations and radicals were involved propagation step to form the chain polymerization the uv vis spectra of the paint effluent during electro polymerization at different time intervals were shown in fig 3 the commercial aniline peak of 243 nm was noticed for the pigment effluent before electro polymerization during electro polymerization the peak at 243 nm decreased gradually by 32 h a peak at 290 nm was formed during the process this suggests the formation of hypochlorite ions in during electro polymerization the table 1 reports the characteristics of the effluent before and after electropolymerization the concentration of aniline 0 114 mol l 1 decreased by 98 in 32 h of electro polymerization 0 0017 mol l 1 the concentration of chloride and sulfate remained the same as 8 32 g l 1 and 5 g l 1 this describes the removal of aniline to useable polyaniline form by electro polymerization 3 2 characterization of the pani the fe sem image fig 4a of the recovered pani exhibited uniform shape morphology conductivity of the recovered polymer was about 1 2 10 2 ms the pani displayed micro rod like structures as the one synthesized by chemical polymerization 40 the uv spectra fig 4b of polyaniline shows absorption peak at about 350 nm and the other at about 600 nm the 350 nm absorption band was assigned to the Ï Ï transition and the 600 nm absorption band was assigned to the quinoid ring or polarant bond transition in the chain of emeraldine base of pani 41 the ftir spectra of the recovered pani is shown in fig 4c the peaks observed at 3683 cm 1 is due to nh stretching at 1242 cm 1 and 1297 cm 1 indicate that aromatic amine cn stretching at 1130 due to aromatic ch stretching 1563 cm 1 and 1484 cm 1 peaks indicated the quinoid cc and benzonoid cc ring vibration frequency 814 cm 1 stretching peak represents the out of plane ch motion the peak at 1130 cm 1 corresponds to aromatic ch vibration 42 thermo gravimetric curves of the polyaniline is shown in fig 4d in general the thermal behavior of the pani showed a three step weight loss process the first weight loss from 50 to 100 c was attributed to the loss of water and low molecular weight oligomers the second weight loss ranging from 150 to 300 c was believed to be due to the elimination of acid dopant hcl and the third weight loss starting at about 400 c corresponded to the thermal decomposition of pani backbone chains 22 35 three step weight losses were exhibited for the recovered pani the typical x ray powder diffraction pattern of the recovered pani is shown in fig 4e the diffraction peaks at 2Î¸ 15 1 20 7 and 25 5 can be attributed to the 011 020 and 200 crystal planes of pani in its es form respectively the cv curve fig 4f shows two sets of distinct redox activity as indicated by the two pairs of anodic and cathodic current peaks the first set of a redox 43 couple which appears between 0 and 0 25 v vs sce is associated with the conversion of the fully reduced leucoemeraldine base to the partially oxidized emeraldine and the second set of redox current peaks occurring between 0 6 and 0 8 v vs sce pertains to the conversion of emeraldine to the fully oxidized pernigraniline form the potential of the first redox couple is largely independent of the ph whereas the potential for the second redox is strongly dependent on the ph value this indicates that protons are involved in the redox reaction associated with the second peaks while the redox reaction related to the first anodic peak does not require protons as part of the reaction another point to note is that polyaniline is more easily oxidized in less acidic solutions and this can be experimentally verified where the second redox couple 40 peaks shift to the left as the ph increases irreversible degradation also occurs at the second oxidation peak especially in strong acids a linear relationship has been observed between peak height of the redox current and scan rate in a solution containing aniline and sulfuric acid solution which is indicative of an electron transfer limited process 3 3 adsorption of 2 4 d by pani ac the pani is now gearing attention as a precursor for carbon materials the functional carbon i e the activated carbon derived from polyaniline has higher porosity and n content 44 the surface morphology of the recovered pani after carbonization and activation is shown in fig 5 the pani ac exhibited the same rod shape structure with higher surface roughness compared to that of the recovered pani the ability of pani ac to remove 50 ppm of 2 4 d from aqueous matrix is shown in fig 6 as the concentration of the adsorbent increases the 2 4 d removal efficiency also increased in case of 25 ppm of pani ac about 32 of 2 4 d was adsorbed in 30 min and above that the adsorption was not evidenced for 25 ppm of c ac 12 of 2 4 d was removed in 30 min and the adsorption reached equilibrium in 3 h with 22 of 2 4 d removal at 100 ppm of pani ac above 71 of 2 4 d was removed in 2 h whereas 100 ppm of c ac was able to remove about 50 of 2 4 d in 2 h in 150 ppm of pani ac and c ac around 91 and 82 of 2 4 d removal was observed in 2 h at 300 ppm of pani ac and c ac about 95 and 85 of 2 4 d removal was calculated in 1 h a 100 removal of 2 4 d was noticed in 30 min while employing 500 ppm of pani ac and c ac the adsorption capacity of the c ac and pani ac decreased with increase in adsorbent concentration fig 6f the pani ac has adsorption capacity of 68 08 0 17 mg g 1 whereas c ac had 61 7 0 14 mg g 1 when using 25 ppm of the adsorbent the adsorption capacity of the pani ac at 100 150 300 and 500 ppm were of 19 4 10 2 15 5 3 5 8 24 0 14 and 5 mg g 1 respectively the c ac has adsorption capacity of 61 7 0 14 18 5 1 0 15 2 1 3 7 7 1 8 4 96 mg g 1 at 100 150 300 and 500 ppm concentrations these results shows that the activated carbon derived from pani has similar adsorption capacity as that of commercial activated carbon in removing 2 4 d at 25 ppm concentration the adsorption capacity of pani ac was slightly higher than the c ac this may be due to the higher n content of the pani ac 41 the application of pani ac to remove trace concentrations of 2 4 d spiked in tap water is shown in fig 7 the adsorbent concentration of 25 ppm was employed and the concentration of adsorbate 2 4 d was varied 100 250 500 and 1000 Î¼g l 1 the removal percentage was higher for lower concentration of 2 4 d the 25 ppm of pani ac was able to remove 100 of 100 Î¼g l 1 of 2 4 d in 15 min at higher concentrations such as 500 250 and 1000 Î¼g l 1 of 2 4 d the maximum pollutant removal was 57 15 min 85 30 min and 29 30 min respectively this shows that the pani ac was able to remove trace concentrations of 2 4 d in tap water 3 4 mechanism of the 2 4 d adsorption by pani ac the calculated value of pseudo second order listed in table 2 the linear correlation co efficient of r2 values are higher in all experiments the qe experiment value and qe calculation values are very closer which is clearly represent that the pseudo second order model kinetics is good at describing the sorption process the similar kind of pseudo second order kinetic model has been reported for activated carbon derived from orange peel and canola stalk 37 45 the adsorption mechanism of 2 4 d was explained by two different isotherm model such as langmuir and freundlich isotherm 3 4 1 langmuir isotherm langmuir model explained the uniform monolayer coverage on adsorbent 46 the linear form of the langmuir isotherm model is 4 c e q e 1 q m b c e q m qe is amount adsorbed at equilibrium concentration ce qm is maximum monolayer adsorption capacity b is langmuir constant related to energy of adsorption 5 q e q max k l c e k l c e 1 6 r l 1 1 b c o qmax mg g 1 is maximum adsorption capacity and kl l mg is the langmuir constant the langmuir isotherm parameters such as rl kl and qmax values were calculated from linear plot of 1 ce vs 1 qe which is listed out in the table 3 the rl value comes between 0 and 1 which indicates that the adsorption process is favourable while using pani ac as adsorbent 45 3 4 2 freundlich isotherm freundlich isotherm model explained the multilayer coverage on adsorbent adsorbate molecules not only interact with adsorbents but also interact itself the following equation is used to calculate the constant of freundlich adsorption isotherm kf model and adsorption heterogeneity factor n q e k f c e 1 n freundlich adsorption parameter value of 1 n and kf were given in the table 3 the kf value used to determine the adsorption capacities of the adsorbent the 1 n value is below one which clearly denote that pani ac has heterogeneous surface and it is more favourable condition for adsorption process 47 from this result it is concluded that the pani ac act as potential adsorbent for the adsorption of organic pollutant of 2 4 d 3 4 3 comparison of the adsorbents used for the removal of 2 4 d the 2 4 d being a common and widely reported pollutant has been chosen as a model pollutant by various researchers to study the adsorption capacity of their newly synthesized adsorbents the performance of the pani ac recovered from the paint effluent in removing 2 4 d was compared with previous reports and listed in table 4 the functional carbons derived from biowaste such as agricultural waste rice hull corn cob biochar showed qe of 25 90 76 9 and 37 4 mg g 1 respectively 48 49 the composite carbons such as fe3o4 graphene nanocomposite fe pd zif mesoporous ni co ld showed qe of 32 31 149 3 and 36 95 mg g 1 respectively 50 52 et al reported 2 4 d adsorption employing carbon from polyaniline cellulose biomass with qe of 34 48 mg g 1 53 this study reports qe of 34 48 mg g 1 as per langmuir isotherm employing 25 ppm of pani ac derived from paint industry pigment effluent 3 4 4 energy consumption the energy consumption of the electro oxidation of aniline contained pigment effluent is calculated by the following equation 54 energy consumption w kwh l 1 uit 1000 v where v is the volume of the pigment effluent u is the voltage v i is current am and t is time h w is the energy consumption for recovery process kwhl 1 in the present study of electro polymerization process energy consumption is about 9 2 10 3 kwhl 1 4 conclusion to align in the process of wealth recovery from waste this paper has fruitfully reported the recovery of pani from paint industry pigment effluent the pani was recovered via electrochemical polymerization employing graphite anode the recovered pani has similar characteristics as that of pani synthesized from usual chemical electrochemical polymerization the pani exhibited rod shaped morphology and existed in emeraldine form the functional carbon derived from recovered pani was used as a adsorbent for removal of 2 4 d herbicide from water the maximum langmuir adsorption capacity of the pani ac was 34 4 mg g 1 the adsorption studies followed pseudo second order kinetics and obeyed langmuir and freundlich isotherms the energy consumption for treatment and recovery of the polyaniline from the paint pigment effluent was about 9 2 10 3 kwhl 1 thus this finding uplifts the idea of effective use of pani ac as a novel adsorbent derived from paint industry pigment effluent for its removal of 2 4 d further this work concentrates on water remediation

preparation of pani based ac to prepare pani activated carbon the recovered pani was completely grinded with potassium hydroxide koh pellets in a ratio of 1 2 the pani koh mixture was then subjected

product was then dried in hot air oven at 70 c for 5 h and labeled as pani ac the surface morphology of the prepared pani ac and the c ac was analyzed by fe sem supra 55vp gemini column 2 7 adsorption the ability of pani ac to remove 2 4 d via adsorption was studied under batch conditions at room temperature in a 50 ml of 2 4 d the concentration of 2 4 d 50 mg l 1 was kept constant and the concentration of the adsorbent i e pani ac was varied 25 100 150 300 and 500 mg l 1 during the experiments the performance of the pani ac was compared with that of commercial activated carbon c ac the teflon sealed glass bottles containing the adsorbents pani ac and c ac and the 2 4 d solution were continuously stirred at 250 rpm to ensure sufficient contact of the pollutant on the adsorbent to examine the efficiency of pani ac in removing trace concentrations in natural water matrices the adsorption experiments was performed in tap water spiked with low concentration of 2 4 d 100 250 500 and 1000 Î¼g l 1 for the above mentioned experiments the 25 ppm of pani ac concentration was used the 2 4 d removal efficiency by pani ac and c ac was analyzed via high performance liquid chromatography hplc shimadzu germany the samples were collected at different time intervals of 0 5 1 2 3 and 4 h and centrifuged at 1200 rpm the clear supernatant samples were quantified for 2 4 d in

where k2 min mg 1 is the pseudo second order rate constant and qe is the amount adsorbed at equilibrium mg g 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 pani recovery from paint effluent the recovery of pani from the paint effluent containing monomers was established by electro polymerization the electro polymerization at a constant voltage of 1 8 v resulted in oxidation of aniline monomers to polymers over the graphite electrode during which the anode potential was about 0 6 v to 0 68 v this favored the polymerization of emeraldine base form of polyaniline if the anodic potential reaches above 0 8 v the emeraldine form will further oxidized and get converted to highly oxidized form of perdraniline a non conductive polymer 38 all aniline monomers can be completely converted into polymer but dimer of aniline can t be converted as polymer the acidic ph 2 3 of the effluent supported the polymerization of polyaniline in emeraldine form at basic ph the conducting polymer was not formed polyaniline was deposited at anode surface cathode side due to electrostatic interaction between the electrodes fig 2 the settling of green precipitates in the container and formation of green froth above the electrolyte was observed the precipitates and the forth were made up of the polymers of aniline during the polymerization current gradually increased and at a particular time current was stable this indicated the termination of polymerization reaction due to un availability of electrode surface for the growth of polymers the graphite dissolution potential is near 1 2 v but the graphite potential was below 0 7 v during the polymerization process hence the graphite dissolution at the applied voltage of 1 8 v was not observed under the applied potential the oxidation of aniline to a radical cation which exists in three resonance forms takes place as the initial step this is the slowest step of the electro polymerization reaction hence it s deemed as the rate determining step 25 in aniline polymerization head to tail coupling of the n and para radical cations takes place yielding a dicationic dimer species 39 this dimer further undergoes the process of re aromatisation which causes it to revert to its neutral state yielding an intermediate referred to as p aminodiphenylamine padpa these processes are also accompanied by the elimination of two protons 28 cations and radicals were involved propagation step to form the chain polymerization the uv vis spectra of the paint effluent during electro polymerization at different time intervals were shown in fig 3 the commercial aniline peak of 243 nm was noticed for the pigment effluent before electro polymerization during electro polymerization the peak at 243 nm decreased gradually by 32 h a peak at 290 nm was formed during the process this suggests the formation of hypochlorite ions in during electro polymerization the table 1 reports the characteristics of the effluent before and after electropolymerization the concentration of aniline 0 114 mol l 1 decreased by 98 in 32 h of electro polymerization 0 0017 mol l 1 the concentration of chloride and sulfate remained the same as 8 32 g l 1 and 5 g l 1 this describes the removal of aniline to useable polyaniline form by electro polymerization 3 2 characterization of the pani the fe sem image fig 4a of the recovered pani exhibited uniform shape morphology conductivity of the recovered polymer was about 1 2 10 2 ms the pani displayed micro rod like structures as the one synthesized by chemical polymerization 40 the uv spectra fig 4b of polyaniline shows absorption peak at about 350 nm and the other at about 600 nm the 350 nm absorption band was assigned to the Ï Ï transition and the 600 nm absorption band was assigned to the quinoid ring or polarant bond transition in the chain of emeraldine base of pani 41 the ftir spectra of the recovered pani is shown in fig 4c the peaks observed at 3683 cm 1 is due to nh stretching at 1242 cm 1 and 1297 cm 1 indicate that aromatic amine cn stretching at 1130 due to aromatic ch stretching 1563 cm 1 and 1484 cm 1 peaks indicated the quinoid cc and benzonoid cc ring vibration frequency 814 cm 1 stretching peak represents the out of plane ch motion the peak at 1130 cm 1 corresponds to aromatic ch vibration 42 thermo gravimetric curves of the polyaniline is shown in fig 4d in general the thermal behavior of the pani showed a three step weight loss process the first weight loss from 50 to 100 c was attributed to the loss of water and low molecular weight oligomers the second weight loss ranging from 150 to 300 c was believed to be due to the elimination of acid dopant hcl and the third weight loss starting at about 400 c corresponded to the thermal decomposition of pani backbone chains 22 35 three step weight losses were exhibited for the recovered pani the typical x ray powder diffraction pattern of the recovered pani is shown in fig 4e the diffraction peaks at 2Î¸ 15 1 20 7 and 25 5 can be attributed to the 011 020 and 200 crystal planes of pani in its es form respectively the cv curve fig 4f shows two sets of distinct redox activity as indicated by the two pairs of anodic and cathodic current peaks the first set of a redox 43 couple which appears between 0 and 0 25 v vs sce is associated with the conversion of the fully reduced leucoemeraldine base to the partially oxidized emeraldine and the second set of redox current peaks occurring between 0 6 and 0 8 v vs sce pertains to the conversion of emeraldine to the fully oxidized pernigraniline form the potential of the first redox couple is largely independent of the ph whereas the potential for the second redox is strongly dependent on the ph value this indicates that protons are involved in the redox reaction associated with the second peaks while the redox reaction related to the first anodic peak does not require protons as part of the reaction another point to note is that polyaniline is more easily oxidized in less acidic solutions and this can be experimentally verified where the second redox couple 40 peaks shift to the left as the ph increases irreversible degradation also occurs at the second oxidation peak especially in strong acids a linear relationship has been observed between peak height of the redox current and scan rate in a solution containing aniline and sulfuric acid solution which is indicative of an electron transfer limited process 3 3 adsorption of 2 4 d by pani ac the pani is now gearing attention as a precursor for carbon materials the functional carbon i e the activated carbon derived from polyaniline has higher porosity and n content 44 the surface morphology of the recovered pani after carbonization and activation is shown in fig 5 the pani ac exhibited the same rod shape structure with higher surface roughness compared to that of the recovered pani the ability of pani ac to remove 50 ppm of 2 4 d from aqueous matrix is shown in fig 6 as the concentration of the adsorbent increases the 2 4 d removal efficiency also increased in case of 25 ppm of pani ac about 32 of 2 4 d was adsorbed in 30 min and above that the adsorption was not evidenced for 25 ppm of c ac 12 of 2 4 d was removed in 30 min and the adsorption reached equilibrium in 3 h with 22 of 2 4 d removal at 100 ppm of pani ac above 71 of 2 4 d was removed in 2 h whereas 100 ppm of c ac was able to remove about 50 of 2 4 d in 2 h in 150 ppm of pani ac and c ac around 91 and 82 of 2 4 d removal was observed in 2 h at 300 ppm of pani ac and c ac about 95 and 85 of 2 4 d removal was calculated in 1 h a 100 removal of 2 4 d was noticed in 30 min while employing 500 ppm of pani ac and c ac the adsorption capacity of the c ac and pani ac decreased with increase in adsorbent concentration fig 6f the pani ac has adsorption capacity of 68 08 0 17 mg g 1 whereas c ac had 61 7 0 14 mg g 1 when using 25 ppm of the adsorbent the adsorption capacity of the pani ac at 100 150 300 and 500 ppm were of 19 4 10 2 15 5 3 5 8 24 0 14 and 5 mg g 1 respectively the c ac has adsorption capacity of 61 7 0 14 18 5 1 0 15 2 1 3 7 7 1 8 4 96 mg g 1 at 100 150 300 and 500 ppm concentrations these results shows that the activated carbon derived from pani has similar adsorption capacity as that of commercial activated carbon in removing 2 4 d at 25 ppm concentration the adsorption capacity of pani ac was slightly higher than the c ac this may be due to the higher n content of the pani ac 41 the application of pani ac to remove trace concentrations of 2 4 d spiked in tap water is shown in fig 7 the adsorbent concentration of 25 ppm was employed and the concentration of adsorbate 2 4 d was varied 100 250 500 and 1000 Î¼g l 1 the removal percentage was higher for lower concentration of 2 4 d the 25 ppm of pani ac was able to remove 100 of 100 Î¼g l 1 of 2 4 d in 15 min at higher concentrations such as 500 250 and 1000 Î¼g l 1 of 2 4 d the maximum pollutant removal was 57 15 min 85 30 min and 29 30 min respectively this shows that the pani ac was able to remove trace concentrations of 2 4 d in tap water 3 4 mechanism of the 2 4 d adsorption by pani ac the calculated value of pseudo second order listed in table 2 the linear correlation co efficient of r2 values are higher in all experiments the qe experiment value and qe calculation values are very closer which is clearly represent that the pseudo second order model kinetics is good at describing the sorption process the similar kind of pseudo second order kinetic model has been reported for activated carbon derived from orange peel and canola stalk 37 45 the adsorption mechanism of 2 4 d was explained by two different isotherm model such as langmuir and freundlich isotherm 3 4 1 langmuir isotherm langmuir model explained the uniform monolayer coverage on adsorbent 46 the linear form of the langmuir isotherm model is 4 c e q e 1 q m b c e q m qe is amount adsorbed at equilibrium concentration ce qm is maximum monolayer adsorption capacity b is langmuir constant related to energy of adsorption 5 q e q max k l c e k l c e 1 6 r l 1 1 b c o qmax mg g 1 is maximum adsorption capacity and kl l mg is the langmuir constant the langmuir isotherm parameters such as rl kl and qmax values were calculated from linear plot of 1 ce vs 1 qe which is listed out in the table 3 the rl value comes between 0 and 1 which indicates that the adsorption process is favourable while using pani ac as adsorbent 45 3 4 2 freundlich isotherm freundlich isotherm model explained the multilayer coverage on adsorbent adsorbate molecules not only interact with adsorbents but also interact itself the following equation is used to calculate the constant of freundlich adsorption isotherm kf model and adsorption heterogeneity factor n q e k f c e 1 n freundlich adsorption parameter value of 1 n and kf were given in the table 3 the kf value used to determine the adsorption capacities of the adsorbent the 1 n value is below one which clearly denote that pani ac has heterogeneous surface and it is more favourable condition for adsorption process 47 from this result it is concluded that the pani ac act as potential adsorbent for the adsorption of organic pollutant of 2 4 d 3 4 3 comparison of the adsorbents used for the removal of 2 4 d the 2 4 d being a common and widely reported pollutant has been chosen as a model pollutant by various researchers to study the adsorption capacity of their newly synthesized adsorbents the performance of the pani ac recovered from the paint effluent in removing 2 4 d was compared with previous reports and listed in table 4 the functional carbons derived from biowaste such as agricultural waste rice hull corn cob biochar showed qe of 25 90 76 9 and 37 4 mg g 1 respectively 48 49 the composite carbons such as fe3o4 graphene nanocomposite fe pd zif mesoporous ni co ld showed qe of 32 31 149 3 and 36 95 mg g 1 respectively 50 52 et al reported 2 4 d adsorption employing carbon from polyaniline cellulose biomass with qe of 34 48 mg g 1 53 this study reports qe of 34 48 mg g 1 as per langmuir isotherm employing 25 ppm of pani ac derived from paint industry pigment effluent 3 4 4 energy consumption the energy consumption of the electro oxidation of aniline contained pigment effluent is calculated by the following equation 54 energy consumption w kwh l 1 uit 1000 v where v is the volume of the pigment effluent u is the voltage v i is current am and t is time h w is the energy consumption for recovery process kwhl 1 in the present study of electro polymerization process energy consumption is about 9 2 10 3 kwhl 1 4 conclusion to align in the process of wealth recovery from waste this paper has fruitfully reported the recovery of pani from paint industry pigment effluent the pani was recovered via electrochemical polymerization employing graphite anode the recovered pani has similar characteristics as that of pani synthesized from usual chemical electrochemical polymerization the pani exhibited rod shaped morphology and existed in emeraldine form the functional carbon derived from recovered pani was used as a adsorbent for removal of 2 4 d herbicide from water the maximum langmuir adsorption capacity of the pani ac was 34 4 mg g 1 the adsorption studies followed pseudo second order kinetics and obeyed langmuir and freundlich isotherms the energy consumption for treatment and recovery of the polyaniline from the paint pigment effluent was about 9 2 10 3 kwhl 1 thus this finding uplifts the idea of effective use of pani ac as a novel adsorbent derived from paint industry pigment effluent for its removal of 2 4 d further this work concentrates on water remediation by reducing pollutant load in paint industry effluent and simultaneously for the removal of herbicide from water matrix declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

12684,a novel cuo chrysotile thin membrane catalyst was prepared by simple impregnation calcination route which provided new insights of catalytic membranes by natural mineral fiber for the degradation of organic contaminants in wastewater treatment through intermittent and continuous catalytic degradation experiments peroxymonosulfate pms was efficiently activated by the membrane to degrade p nitrophenol pnp and the effects of experimental parameters including initial solution ph value pms dosage catalyst dosage reaction temperature membrane mass and flow rate on pnp degradation were systematically studied the results showed that the catalytic membrane had great catalytic performance and long term stability it could completely degrade 10 mg l of pnp within 60 min and its degradation ratio could remain above 90 after 5 cycles meanwhile it was worth noting that 0 15 g of cuo chrysotile catalytic membrane used as fixed bed could continuously degrade 12 5 l of pnp solution with gratifying performance which proved that the catalytic membrane had convenient use method and great application effect the mechanism study found that 1o2 produced in this process played a key role in the degradation of pnp from the aspects of manufacturing cost catalytic performance and service life the novel cuo chrysotile catalytic membrane has excellent industrial application potential graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords cuo chrysotile catalyst membrane catalysis advanced oxidation processes peroxymonosulfate p nitrophenol data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction as a typical nitroaromatic compound p nitrophenol pnp is an important organic chemical raw material and intermediate which is widely used in explosives azo dyes pesticides and so on 1 however because pnp has the characteristics of high toxicity degradation resistance and persistence its treatment is difficult and there is an urgent need for an efficient and green wastewater treatment technology 2 compared with traditional physical and chemical methods advanced oxidation processes aops have the advantages of fast speed complete degradation and low secondary pollution in the past few years aops have been widely studied in the degradation of phenolic wastewater 3 5 in recent years peroxymonosulfate pms has attracted extensive attention because of its stability easy operation and high standard oxidation potential sulfate radical up to 3 1 v 6 7 pms can be activated by various catalysts including alkali transition metal ions and their oxides non metal minerals and so on 8 13 and the formed reactive oxygen species ros such as sulfate radical so4 hydroxyl radical oh superoxide anion radical o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 can effectively degrade and even fully mineralize organic pollutants 14 recently catalysis by transition metal oxides has been proved to be an effective method to activate pms which has attracted much attention because of its relatively low energy demand chemical stability and easy operation in particular cuo have great application potential due to its high efficiency economy and low toxicity 15 although cuo has good catalytic performance using cuo as catalyst alone requires a large amount of cuo and pms to effectively degrade pollutants 16 furthermore cuo can cooperate with other metals to increase surface active sites and change properties of active sites so that polymetallic catalysts have higher redox and catalytic activities 17 18 meanwhile cuo can also be loaded on the carriers with high specific surface area to prevent aggregation and increase the number of active sites so as to improve the catalytic performance 19 21 these explorations provide new insights into the performance of cuo based catalysts and their potential application in wastewater treatment however due to the disadvantages of high cost and difficult recovery the practical application of the above powdered cuo catalysts is limited therefore it is necessary to develop new kinds of cuo based composites with high performance long term stability convenient usability and low cost to meet the application needs of actual organic wastewater degradation studies have shown that natural minerals have great potential in the field of pms activation and are often used as carrier materials to synergistically catalyze pms 22 23 for example chrysotile with rich surface hydroxyl groups a large number of adsorption sites and nanoscale fibers can well activate pms to degrade organic pollutants 12 although chrysotile is a good carrier if it is used to prepare traditional powdered composites it is still facing the problem of difficult application this is because chrysotile composites will exist in the form of micro nano fibers and short fiber bundles in water which is very difficult to separate and recycle in order to overcome the difficulty of separating the powdered catalyst from water after the reaction and inhibit the release of nanoparticles in catalyst into the environment it is a feasible method to prepare the catalyst into a fixed thin membrane membrane reactor has attracted great attention to immobilized nano catalysts because of its small volume simple operation and low energy consumption 24 25 combining aops with membrane filtration not only provides support for the catalyst but also confines the reaction in the pores which helps to make close contact between pollutants and active sites so as to realize the efficient utilization of pms 26 27 at the same time the fluid can bring the reactants to the surface of the catalyst and continuously remove the products from the reaction zone 28 in reported studies the active components have often been loaded on polypropylene pp fiber membrane polyvinyl pyrrolidone pvp fiber membrane polyacrylonitrile pan fiber membrane and al2o3 based ceramic membrane to prepare catalytic membrane for example li et al 29 used in situ self assembly to prepare poly dopamine and zeolitic imidazolate framework 67 zif 67 decorative pp membrane which was further used for visible light and pms activation and dyes degradation lu et al 30 synthesized a catalytic membrane for the catalytic degradation of antibiotics by in situ growth and pyrolysis reduction of zif 67 on interfacial crosslinked nanofiber membrane of pvp and pan bao et al 31 used a urea assisted one step combustion method to prepare cofe2o4 impregnated al2o3 ceramic membrane sulfamethoxazole smx degradation via pms activation however there has never been a study on the preparation of catalytic membrane by loading the active components on mineral fibers in this study chrysotile a natural layered silicate mineral can be used as a carrier due to its nanofiber morphology excellent physical and chemical stability susceptible to film formation and ability to activate pms well 32 33 combined with the excellent adsorption performance for copper ions and the characteristics of easy to form membrane of chrysotile fibers through the adsorption of copper ions forming membrane by filtration drying and calcination process a cuo chrysotile thin membrane catalyst is obtained which shows excellent activation performance for pms to degrade pnp this novel thin membrane catalyst provides a new idea and research example for realizing the continuous degradation of organic wastewater by aops and shows excellent application potential due to its advantages of economy efficiency and ease of operation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the chrysotile used in this study was taken from the previously highly purified qilian asbestos mine in qinghai province china 34 pms khso5 0 5khso4 0 5k2so4 containing 42 46 of khso5 was purchased from

tert butyl alcohol tba methanol ma l histidine lh and p benzoquinone p bq were purchased from shanghai sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd all reagents were analytical grade without further purification 2 2 catalyst preparation cuo chrysotile thin membrane catalyst was prepared by the impregnation calcination method typically 0 3 g high purity chrysotile sample was poured into 30 ml of 200 mmol l cu no3 2 solution after magnetic stirring at 30 c for 3 h the mixed suspension was filtrated through polyethylene pe microfiltration membrane 0 45 Î¼m and dried at 60 c for 12 h to obtain film precursor then the precursor was removed from the pe membrane and calcined in a muffle furnace at 600 c for 2 h to obtain the final brown thin membrane catalyst named as cuo chrysotile membrane the calcined film is cut into round pieces with a diameter of 50 mm and then weighed for future experiments the mass of the membrane sample can be adjusted by enlarging the mass of the chrysotile and the volume of copper nitrate solution in equal proportion for comparison cu oh 2 or chrysotile were treated separately according to the same procedure to prepare the reference samples 2 3 characterization the crystal structures of samples were detected by an x ray diffractometer xrd empyrean panalytical netherlands with cu kÎ± radiation the surface chemical state was characterized by x ray photo electron spectroscopy xps k alpha 1063 thermo fisher uk the morphological images were analyzed by scanning electron microscope sem mira3 xmu xmh tescan czech the images of surface morphology microstructure and elemental distribution of the materials were observed and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy sem mira3 xmu xmh tescan czech with an energy dispersive spectra eds one max 20 the specific surface area of the samples was determined by the brunauer emmett teller bet zq200c beijing jwgb sci tech china the zeta potential of samples was determined by the zeta potential analyzer zetasizer nano zs malvern uk the absorbance of the solution was measured by ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer uv vis uv 2100 braic china the concentration of ions leaching during the catalytic process and cu content in the samples were quantified by the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes optima 8300 perkinelmer usa the active radicals in the reaction process were determined by electron paramagnetic resonance epr bruker emxplus germany 2 4 intermittent catalytic degradation experiment the reactions were conducted in the 250 ml beaker containing 100 ml of a specific concentration of pnp at a specific temperature initially an appropriate amount of 0 2 mol l of naoh solution was added to adjust the ph value and then catalyst was introduced into the beaker the mixture was magnetically stirred for 30 min to make the catalyst dispersed in the pollutant solution and to achieve the adsorption balance between pollutants and catalyst and then pms was added to start degradation during the experiment the suspension sample was taken out by a syringe every 10 min and filtrated by 0 45 Î¼m needle filter after uv vis spectrophotometer was used to measure the absorbance at 400 nm wavelength the effects of different catalytic system amount of catalyst dosage of pms ph value reaction temperature and initial concentration of pnp on the catalytic reaction were investigated under the same experimental procedure for the cycle performance test the used catalyst was collected by filtration dried at 60 c for 12 h and then the same catalytic reaction was carried out 2 5 continuous catalytic degradation experiment the fixed bed membrane reactor is shown in fig s1 firstly the calcined membrane was cut into a round piece with a diameter of 50 mm and then filled into a replaceable membrane filter secondly many beakers of pnp solution with concentration of 10 mg l ph of 11 and volume of 200 ml were prepared as organic wastewater before the reaction 0 4 g l of pms was added into a beaker of pnp solution with stirring and then the beaker of mixed solution was quickly poured into the cylindrical container above the membrane reactor the water outlet under the membrane reactor was connected with a peristaltic pump with the peristaltic pump pnp solution flowed through the catalytic membrane from top to bottom at a certain flow rate and then the effluent was collected to determine the concentration of residual pnp the pnp solution mixed with pms was poured beaker by beaker to carry out the continuous catalytic degradation reaction under the same experimental steps the effects of different systems membrane mass and flow rate on the catalytic reaction were investigated it can be seen from fig s1 that sufficient degradation can turn the yellow pnp solution on the left into a colorless and transparent liquid like water on the right 3 results and discussions 3 1 membrane morphology and structure as shown in fig 1a and fig 1c both chrysotile fiber and cuo chrysotile fiber can form a flexible thin membrane the morphologies of chrysotile and cuo chrysotile thin membrane were observed by sem fig 1b and fig 1d in these two samples some fibers are closely gathered to form fiber bundles and the fibers and fiber bundles are intertwined to form a multi channel network structure the porosity of chrysotile and cuo chrysotile thin membranes measured by the dry wet weight method 35 are 44 26 and 51 20 respectively and the measured water flux are 2181 8 l h 1m 2bar 1and 2518 6 l h 1m 2bar 1 respectively shown in fig s2 this shows that the prepared thin membrane catalyst has rich pore structure which is conducive to the contact of pollutants and the activation of pms 36 moreover the high water flux ensures the permeability of the membrane which helps to achieve continuous degradation in contrast the fibers in cuo chrysotile thin membrane are rougher and there are more tiny particles mixed in the network structure the eds results fig 1e show that cuo is dispersed on the existing surface of chrysotile and between the fibers in the form of particles of different sizes this hierarchical structure is beneficial to the activation of pms 37 and also improves the porosity and water flux of the thin membrane fig 2 shows the xrd patterns of calcined chrysotile and cuo chrysotile which are very similar and match well with the pure chrysotile however compared with pure calcined chrysotile cuo chrysotile can be observed the additional characteristic peaks of 35 5 and 38 7 corresponding to the 111 and 111 plane of cuo which proves that cu loaded on chrysotile exists in the form of cuo the cuo diffraction peaks are not obvious due to the low cuo content in cuo chrysotile which is determined by icp as 6 15 shown in table s1 the retention of chrysotile structure and the loading of highly dispersed cuo make the composite have higher specific surface area shown in table s2 more hydroxyl groups and more active sites than pure cuo particles which will greatly enhance the catalytic performance of cuo 38 3 2 intermittent catalytic degradation 3 2 1 advantage of cuo chrysotile pnp degradation experiments under different systems are shown in fig 3 because 2 of pnp is adsorbed by chrysotile and cuo chrysotile the influence of adsorption is not considered in the study the pnp degradation ratio of the cuo chrysotile pms system is 96 within 60 min which is much higher than that of the chrysotile pms system 52 6 and cuo pms system 34 79 furthermore the degradation data of pnp in different systems fitted with the pseudo second order kinetic model are shown in fig 3b the degradation rate constant k of pnp for cuo chrysotile pms system was 0 04512 min 1 which was 24 38 and 42 17 times higher than that of chrysotile pms system and cuo pms system these indicate that cuo chrysotile is an efficient pms activator which can effectively realize the catalytic degradation of pnp the following two aspects may be the main reasons on the one hand cuo is uniformly fixed on chrysotile resulting in more accessible reaction sites on the other hand the abundant surficial and structural hydroxyl groups of chrysotile may contribute to the synergistic pms activation process 12 22 because the combination of hso5 and chrysotile s surface hydroxyl may form sulfate radical so4 3 2 2 effect of concentrations of cu ion and pnp on catalytic degradation fig 4a shows that the catalytic performance increases with the increase of impregnation concentration of cu ion which is due to the increase of loading amount of cuo and active sites when the impregnation concentration increases to 200 mmol l or more the catalytic performance of the composite tends to remain unchanged which is because the adsorption of copper ions on chrysotile has reached saturation so the amount of cuo produced has also reached a constant as presented in table s1 the loading amount of cuo almost remains unchanged when the impregnation concentration of cu ion reaches or exceeds 200 mmol l the effect of different pnp concentration on catalytic degradation in cuo chrysotile pms was investigated fig 4b with the increase of initial pnp concentration from 0 mg l to 50 mg l the degradation ratio of pnp decreased from 96 5 to 37 0 this can be attributed to the fact that a large number of organic molecules in the solution with high pnp concentration are adsorbed on the surface of 850cc which hinders the contact between pms and surface active sites 39 however with the increase of initial pnp concentration the actual removal amount of pnp is increasing from 0 965 mg to 2 185 mg this means that the cuo chrysotile asbestos pms system can be used to treat pnp of different concentrations 3 2 3 effects of ph and temperature on catalytic degradation the catalytic ability of cuo chrysotile to pms was tested under different reaction parameters the initial ph plays an important role in the activation of pms different ph values are selected in the range of 6 to 12 fig 5a the results show that the degradation ratio of pnp increases with the increase of ph when the ph is 6 11 and decreases sharply when the ph is 11 although pnp is well catalytically degraded in the ph range of 6 11 this does not mean that cuo chrysotile membrane has a wide ph adaptation range according to the cyclic catalytic performance of the membrane at different initial ph values as shown in fig s3a the catalyst has good degradation performance and catalytic stability only when the ph value is 11 by detecting the concentration of leached cu ions fig s3b and monitoring the ph change in the reaction process fig s3c it can be found that although cu ions are hardly leached under different ph values in the first cycle however in the second and third cycles the cu leaching is serious when the ph is 11 this is because in the first cycle chrysotile is rich in a large amount of hydroxyl so that the solution can be maintained alkaline thus preventing the dissolution of cuo however in the subsequent cycles chrysotile no longer has the ability to adjust ph due to the massive dissolution of hydroxyl group so cu begins to leach and leads to the decline of catalytic performance under strong alkaline conditions ph 11 the degradation ratio drops sharply because a large amount of so5 2 are generated from pms which prevents the generation of so4 and oh in the reaction system 40 as shown in the fig s4 the zeta potential is maintained at a relatively stable value in different ph values so the electrical property of the cuo chrysotile surface has no significant effect on the reaction fig 5b shows the effect of reaction temperature on pnp degradation it can be found that the degradation ratio of pnp is gradually accelerated with the increase of reaction temperature when the reaction temperature reaches 30 c 95 degradation ratio can be achieved within 60 min the reaction conforms to the pseudo second order kinetic fig s5 it is calculated that activation energy required for cuo chrysotile activated pms to degrade pnp is 15 36865 kj mol 1 which is higher than that of general diffusion control reaction 10 13 kj mol 1 this shows that the essence of this reaction is not a simple material transfer but a chemical reaction on the surface of the oxide 41 in addition the low activation energy of the reaction system indicates that cuo chrysotile needs to overcome a low potential barrier in the pms catalytic reaction process and is an efficient heterogeneous catalyst 42 3 2 4 effects of catalyst dosage and pms dosage on catalytic degradation the catalyst plays an important role in the reaction system therefore it is necessary to explore the influence of catalyst dosage on pnp degradation as shown in fig 6a pnp degradation efficiency continued to increase with catalyst dosage from 0 25 to 1 0 g l with the increase of cuo chrysotile the number of active sites increases and then reactive oxygen species are produced faster thereby improving the degradation efficiency fig 6b shows that the degradation of pnp by cuo chrysotile pms depends on the dosage of pms when the dosage of pms increased in the range of 0 0 6 g l the degradation rate of pnp increased however when the pms dosage increased to 0 8 g l the degradation rate of pnp decreased this is because excessive pms will compete with pnp for active substances 43 the degradation rate of 0 6 g l pms is almost the same as 0 4 g l pms but the cost is obviously increased therefore 0 4 g l pms is considered to be the appropriate dosage 3 2 5 influence of inevitable substances and ability to degrade other organic pollutants many inevitable substances including some inorganic anions and organic substances usually exist in actual wastewater and have an impact on wastewater degradation therefore we studied the influence of various substances on catalytic degradation of pnp in cuo chrysotile pms system as shown in fig 7a in general cl so4 2 and hco3 very slightly reduce the degradation ratio while co3 2 and ha have obvious influence on the degradation process according to previous reports cl can be oxidized by oh and so4 to produce secondary chlorine radicals with low redox potential such as cl cl2 and cloh 44 the addition of hco3 will slow down the reaction rate but increase the final degradation ratio which may be due to the buffer for ph and reduce of the consumption rate of pms co3 2 will increase the alkalinity of the solution resulting in a large amount of so5 2 which prevents the generation of so4 and oh in the reaction system hco3 and co3 2 may react with so4 to form co3 with low oxidation capacity 40 in addition the addition of 10 mg l of humic acid ha decreases the degradation effect because the ha may react with radicals 45 in a word cuo chrysotile pms has good adaptability to complex environments which is conducive to the application in the degradation of practical wastewater in order to explore the universality of cuo chrysotile pms system a variety of representative pollutants were selected for degradation experiments including rhb cationic dye mb and acid ar73 anionic dye and tc antibiotics as shown in fig 7b it is obvious that cuo chrysotile pms system shows excellent catalytic degradation performance for different dyes while the degradation of antibiotics is slightly weaker than that of pnp the results show that cuo chrysotile has good versatility and can well degrade various organic compounds and is suitable for treatment of practical wastewater with the coexistence of multiple organic pollutants 3 3 continuous catalytic degradation experiment in order to simulate the industrial application and explore the performance change law of the membrane catalyst under long term operation the cuo chrysotile membrane was loaded into a self made fixed bed reactor for continuous degradation of pnp solution the optimum reaction conditions in the continuous experiment are the same as those of intermittent experiment fig 8 intuitively points out that the catalytic degradation performance is pure pms system chrysotile pms system cuo pe pms system cuo chrysotile pms system the results show the removal efficiency of pnp in cuo chrysotile pms system is close to 90 at a flow rate of 5 ml min which is much higher than other reaction systems it is worth noting that the mass ratio of cuo in cuo chrysotile membrane is only 6 15 so there is only 9 2 mg of cuo in the thin membrane with a diameter of 50 mm according to the pnp degradation results shown in fig 8 it is obvious that under the same reaction conditions the catalytic degradation effect of the cuo pms system is still far weaker than that of the cuo chrysotile pms system even if the cuo dosage in cuo pms is 40 mg that is much larger than the dosage of 9 2 mg in cuo chrysotile pms at the same time the degradation effect of chrysotile loaded with cuo is much better than the pure chrysotile membrane the above shows that after combination there is a meaningful synergistic effect between chrysotile and cuo which greatly enhances the catalytic degradation performance of the composite in addition with the decrease of flow rate the degradation ratio of each system increases to varying degrees which is attributed to that the lower flow rate increases the time of pnp passing through the catalytic membrane and improves the degradation ratio the influence of the membrane mass on the degradation effect was studied as shown in fig 9 the membranes with different mass showed excellent degradation efficiency in general the degradation ratio increases with the increase of the membrane mass on the one hand the increase in thickness leads to the extension of the time for pollutants to pass through the catalyst thus enhancing the reaction on the other hand the increase of the catalyst has fully improved the utilization of pms however it can be found from the data of membrane flux the higher the membrane mass is the faster the water flux decreases and the faster the membrane resistance increases as shown in fig s2 the thin membrane with a mass of 0 15 g can degrade nearly 90 of pnp at 5 ml min with a high water flux 2518 629 l h 1m 2bar 1 when the membrane mass is 0 225 g although the degradation ratio increases by only 5 percentage points compared with 0 15 g membrane at 5 ml min the water flux significantly reduces to 1024 233 l h 1m 2bar 1 therefore it is considered that the best degradation condition are membrane mass of 0 15 g and flow rate of 5 ml min in addition to excellent catalytic activity good stability and reusability are also the key to the practical application of catalysts therefore cuo chrysotile membrane with a mass of 0 15 g was used as a fixed bed for long term catalytic degradation experiments fig 10 shows the real time degradation ratio and cumulative degradation amount of pnp when a catalytic membrane is continuously degraded for 4000 min under a flow rate of 5 ml min from the figure it can be seen that the initial degradation effect is relatively stable and the catalytic degradation ratio decreases slowly with the increase of time at 2000 min the degradation ratio still exceeds 75 which indicates that the stability of the catalytic material is very good when the treatment time reaches 2500 min the catalytic effect of cuo chrysotile membrane begins to decline sharply and a total of 100 mg of pnp is degraded at this time when the treatment time exceeds 3200 min the degradation ratio decreases to 10 and tends to be stable which indicates that the catalytic membrane has completely failed and the existing degradation at this time is due to the oxidation of pms itself above experimental data show that before failure the 0 15 g catalytic membrane continuously treats about 12 5 l of pnp solution with a concentration of 10 mg l and cumulatively degrades about 100 mg of pnp according to the calculation in this experiment the cuo chrysotile membrane continuously and effectively treats pnp solution 80 000 times its own mass and achieves about 80 of the total degradation ratio of pnp this amazing catalytic degradation performance means that cuo catalyst has excellent and stable effect and great practical value in order to explore the failure reason of the catalytic membrane the concentration of leached cu ions fig s6 and the xrd patterns of the samples before and after the failure fig s7 were detected it can be found that the concentration of leached cu ions is far lower than the cu content in the membrane and the diffraction peaks corresponding to cuo are almost unchanged while the intensity of diffraction peaks corresponding to chrysotile decreases significantly this may be because after long term washing with pnp solution mg and si in chrysotile are partially dissolved which leads to the destruction of the its structure and weakens the synergistic effect between cuo and chrysotile as shown in fig s8 the fiber surface of the failed cuo chrysotile membrane is significantly roughened and some sheet substances in it which may be caused by the dissolution of mg from the fiber and precipitating into mg oh 2 in an alkaline environment at the same time the destruction of chrysotile structure will further damage the pore structure of the catalytic membrane reducing the effective contact between oxidants pollutants and active sites which results in the reduction of catalytic degradation efficiency 3 4 catalytic mechanism in order to further explore the mechanism of pnp degradation in the cuo chrysotile pms system methanol ma tert butyl alcohol tba p benzoquinone p bq and histidine lh were used as radical quenchers to verify the existence of so4 oh o2 and 1o2 it is reported that the second order reaction rate of ma with oh and so4 is very high which can quench oh and so4 at the same time 46 the second order reaction rate constant of tba with oh is 3 orders of magnitude faster than that of tba with so4 which can be used to selectively quench the oh 47 p bq and lh are often used to quench o2 48 49 and 1o2 33 respectively in the quenching experiment the degradation efficiency of pnp decreases with the increase of the dosage of the quenchers as a result the dosage of quenchers is increased to ensure that the corresponding free radicals are completely quenched as much as possible fig s9 the comparison of the final quenching effect is shown in fig 11a the results show that 1o2 plays a major role in pnp degradation and so4 oh and o2 also participate in the degradation ros generated in cuo chrysotile pms system were further detected via epr as shown in fig 12b the epr signals of dmpo oh cannot be observed in cuo chrysotile pms system instead an obvious seven peak signal can be recorded which attributed to the hyperfine splitting of dmpo oxidation product which is dmpox formed by dmpo through oh 50 the existence of dmpox indicates that strong oxidation of the system leads to rapid oxidation of dmpo 51 in addition the standard characteristic peaks of dmpo so4 fig 12b dmpo o2 fig 12c and temp 1o2 fig 12d prove the existence of so4 o2 and 1o2 in the cuo chrysotile pms system xps spectra before and after the catalytic reaction were compared fig 12 the results show that cu mainly exists in the form of cu ii before the reaction then 33 6 of cu ii is converted to cu i after the catalytic reaction o exists in cuo chrysotile in the form of lattice oxygen hydroxyl and adsorbed oxygen after the reaction part of the hydroxyl is converted to lattice oxygen indicating that hydroxyl participates in pms activation as a ligand in the system based on the previous study of radical quenching the activation mechanism of cuo chrysotile is proposed fig 13 since hso5 and o2 have a higher redox potential than cu ii cu i hso5 and o2 are responsible for the reduction of cu ii eqs 1 2 52 53 cu i will provide an electron to pms so that hso5 is decomposed to produce so4 and oh eqs 3 4 54 to realize the oxidation reduction cycle of cu so as to have continuous catalytic performance o2 can be formed by adsorbing oxygen and oxygen eq 5 55 the alkaline environment and the presence of a large number of hydroxyl groups on the surface of chrysotile make eq 1 easier to proceed to the right which further promotes the production of oxygen or singlet oxygen eqs 6 7 53 56 1o2 can also be generated by o2 eq 8 50 so4 is also easy to generate oh due to its stronger oxidation eq 9 57 finally so4 oh o2 and 1o2 synergistically degrade pnp eq 10 1 cu ii hso 5 cu i so 5 h 2 cu ii o 2 cu i o 2 3 cu i hso 5 cu ii so 4 oh 4 cu i hso 5 cu ii so 4 2 oh 5 cu i o 2 cu ii o 2 6 2 so 5 2 so 4 o 2 7 2 so 5 2 so 4 1 o 2 8 o 2 oh oh 1 o 2 9 so 4 oh so 4 2 oh 10 so 4 oh o 2 1 o 2 pnp degraded products h 2 o co 2 4 conclusion in conclusion a novel cuo chrysotile catalytic membrane was synthesized by simple impregnation calcination route based on the fibrous characteristics of natural mineral chrysotile for the first time the synergistic effect of cuo and chrysotile effectively promoted the activation of pms to decompose pnp the results of intermittent experimental showed that the cuo chrysotile could well activate pms to efficiently and completely degrade pnp under the optimized conditions and ph value temperature catalyst amount and pms dosage had varying degrees of influence on the degradation performance the continuous experimental results showed that the cuo chrysotile catalytic membrane used as a fixed bed could continuously work for 2500 min and efficiently degrade pnp solution of 10 mg l 80 000 times its own mass to achieve an overall degradation ratio of about 80 in addition 1o2 was confirmed to be the most important ros produced in the cuo chrysotile pms system and so4 oh and o2 were involved in the degradation of pnp in a word chrysotile can support cuo and form a solid membrane due to its special fiber characteristics and surface properties so as to obtain a membrane type catalyst with long term performance this kind of catalyst has the advantages of simple preparation low cost convenient use great catalytic performance and long service life which is a new strategy for activating pms to degrade organic wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

12684,a novel cuo chrysotile thin membrane catalyst was prepared by simple impregnation calcination route which provided new insights of catalytic membranes by natural mineral fiber for the degradation of organic contaminants in wastewater treatment through intermittent and continuous catalytic degradation experiments peroxymonosulfate pms was efficiently activated by the membrane to degrade p nitrophenol pnp and the effects of experimental parameters including initial solution ph value pms dosage catalyst dosage reaction temperature membrane mass and flow rate on pnp degradation were systematically studied the results showed that the catalytic membrane had great catalytic performance and long term stability it could completely degrade 10 mg l of pnp within 60 min and its degradation ratio could remain above 90 after 5 cycles meanwhile it was worth noting that 0 15 g of cuo chrysotile catalytic membrane used as fixed bed could continuously degrade 12 5 l of pnp solution with gratifying performance which proved that the catalytic membrane had convenient use method and great application effect the mechanism study found that 1o2 produced in this process played a key role in the degradation of pnp from the aspects of manufacturing cost catalytic performance and service life the novel cuo chrysotile catalytic membrane has excellent industrial application potential graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords cuo chrysotile catalyst membrane catalysis advanced oxidation processes peroxymonosulfate p nitrophenol data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction as a typical nitroaromatic compound p nitrophenol pnp is an important organic chemical raw material and intermediate which is widely used in explosives azo dyes pesticides and so on 1 however because pnp has the characteristics of high toxicity degradation resistance and persistence its treatment is difficult and there is an urgent need for an efficient and green wastewater treatment technology 2 compared with traditional physical and chemical methods advanced oxidation processes aops have the advantages of fast speed complete degradation and low secondary pollution in the past few years aops have been widely studied in the degradation of phenolic wastewater 3 5 in recent years peroxymonosulfate pms has attracted extensive attention because of its stability easy operation and high standard oxidation potential sulfate radical up to 3 1 v 6 7 pms can be activated by various catalysts including alkali transition metal ions and their oxides non metal minerals and so on 8 13 and the formed reactive oxygen species ros such as sulfate radical so4 hydroxyl radical oh superoxide anion radical o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 can effectively degrade and even fully mineralize organic pollutants 14 recently catalysis by transition metal oxides has been proved to be an effective method to activate pms which has attracted much attention because of its relatively low energy demand chemical stability and easy operation in particular cuo have great application potential due to its high efficiency economy and low toxicity 15 although cuo has good catalytic performance using cuo as catalyst alone requires a large amount of cuo and pms to effectively degrade pollutants 16 furthermore cuo can cooperate with other metals to increase surface active sites and change properties of active sites so that polymetallic catalysts have higher redox and catalytic activities 17 18 meanwhile cuo can also be loaded on the carriers with high specific surface area to prevent aggregation and increase the number of active sites so as to improve the catalytic performance 19 21 these explorations provide new insights into the performance of cuo based catalysts and their potential application in wastewater treatment however due to the disadvantages of high cost and difficult recovery the practical application of the above powdered cuo catalysts is limited therefore it is necessary to develop new kinds of cuo based composites with high performance long term stability convenient usability and low cost to meet the application needs of actual organic wastewater degradation studies have shown that natural minerals have great potential in the field of pms activation and are often used as carrier materials to synergistically catalyze pms 22 23 for example chrysotile with rich surface hydroxyl groups a large number of adsorption sites and nanoscale fibers can well activate pms to degrade organic pollutants 12 although chrysotile is a good carrier if it is used to prepare traditional powdered composites it is still facing the problem of difficult application this is because chrysotile composites will exist in the form of micro nano fibers and short fiber bundles in water which is very difficult to separate and recycle in order to overcome the difficulty of separating the powdered catalyst from water after the reaction and inhibit the release of nanoparticles in catalyst into the environment it is a feasible method to prepare the catalyst into a fixed thin membrane membrane reactor has attracted great attention to immobilized nano catalysts because of its small volume simple operation and low energy consumption 24 25 combining aops with membrane filtration not only provides support for the catalyst but also confines the reaction in the pores which helps to make close contact between pollutants and active sites so as to realize the efficient utilization of pms 26 27 at the same time the fluid can bring the reactants to the surface of the catalyst and continuously remove the products from the reaction zone 28 in reported studies the active components have often been loaded on polypropylene pp fiber membrane polyvinyl pyrrolidone pvp fiber membrane polyacrylonitrile pan fiber membrane and al2o3 based ceramic membrane to prepare catalytic membrane for example li et al 29 used in situ self assembly to prepare poly dopamine and zeolitic imidazolate framework 67 zif 67 decorative pp membrane which was further used for visible light and pms activation and dyes degradation lu et al 30 synthesized a catalytic membrane for the catalytic degradation of antibiotics by in situ growth and pyrolysis reduction of zif 67 on interfacial crosslinked nanofiber membrane of pvp and pan bao et al 31 used a urea assisted one step combustion method to prepare cofe2o4 impregnated al2o3 ceramic membrane sulfamethoxazole smx degradation via pms activation however there has never been a study on the preparation of catalytic membrane by loading the active components on mineral fibers in this study chrysotile a natural layered silicate mineral can be used as a carrier due to its nanofiber morphology excellent physical and chemical stability susceptible to film formation and ability to activate pms well 32 33 combined with the excellent adsorption performance for copper ions and the characteristics of easy to form membrane of chrysotile fibers through the adsorption of copper ions forming membrane by filtration drying and calcination process a cuo chrysotile thin membrane catalyst is obtained which shows excellent activation performance for pms to degrade pnp this novel thin membrane catalyst provides a new idea and research example for realizing the continuous degradation of organic wastewater by aops and shows excellent application potential due to its advantages of economy efficiency and ease of operation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the chrysotile used in this study was taken from the previously highly purified qilian asbestos mine in qinghai province china 34 pms khso5 0 5khso4 0 5k2so4 containing 42 46 of khso5 was purchased from aladdin biochemical technology co ltd shanghai china copper nitrate trihydrate cu no3 2 3h2o p nitrophenol pnp acid red 73 ar73 tetracycline tc rhodamine b rhb methylene blue mb sodium hydroxide naoh tert butyl alcohol tba methanol ma l histidine lh and p benzoquinone p bq were purchased from shanghai sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd all reagents were analytical grade without further purification 2 2 catalyst preparation cuo chrysotile thin membrane catalyst was prepared by the impregnation calcination method typically 0 3 g high purity chrysotile sample was poured into 30 ml of 200 mmol l cu no3 2 solution after magnetic stirring at 30 c for 3 h the mixed suspension was filtrated through polyethylene pe microfiltration membrane 0 45 Î¼m and dried at 60 c for 12 h to obtain film precursor then the precursor was removed from the pe membrane and calcined in a muffle furnace at 600 c for 2 h to obtain the final brown thin membrane catalyst named as cuo chrysotile membrane the calcined film is cut into round pieces with a diameter of 50 mm and then weighed for future experiments the mass of the membrane sample can be adjusted by enlarging the mass of the chrysotile and the volume of copper nitrate solution in equal proportion for comparison cu oh 2 or chrysotile were treated separately according to the same procedure to prepare the reference samples 2 3 characterization the crystal structures of samples were detected by an x ray diffractometer xrd empyrean panalytical netherlands with cu kÎ± radiation the surface chemical state was characterized by x ray photo electron spectroscopy xps k alpha 1063 thermo fisher uk the morphological images were analyzed by scanning electron microscope sem mira3 xmu xmh tescan czech the images of surface morphology microstructure and elemental distribution of the materials were observed and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy sem mira3 xmu xmh tescan czech with an energy dispersive spectra eds one max 20 the specific surface area of the samples was determined by the brunauer emmett teller bet zq200c beijing jwgb sci tech china the zeta potential of samples was determined by the zeta potential analyzer zetasizer nano zs malvern uk the absorbance of the solution was measured by ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer uv vis uv 2100 braic china the concentration of ions leaching during the catalytic process and cu content in the samples were quantified by the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes optima 8300 perkinelmer usa the active radicals in the reaction process were determined by electron paramagnetic resonance epr bruker emxplus germany 2 4 intermittent catalytic degradation experiment the reactions were conducted in the 250 ml beaker containing 100 ml of a specific concentration of pnp at a specific temperature initially an appropriate amount of 0 2 mol l of naoh solution was added to adjust the ph value and then catalyst was introduced into the beaker the mixture was magnetically stirred for 30 min to make the catalyst dispersed in the pollutant solution and to achieve the adsorption balance between pollutants and catalyst and then pms was added to start degradation during the experiment the suspension sample was taken out by a syringe every 10 min and filtrated by 0 45 Î¼m needle filter after uv vis spectrophotometer was used to measure the absorbance at 400 nm wavelength the effects of different catalytic system amount of catalyst dosage of pms ph value reaction temperature and initial concentration of pnp on the catalytic reaction were investigated under the same experimental procedure for the cycle performance test the used catalyst was collected by filtration dried at 60 c for 12 h and then the same catalytic reaction was carried out 2 5 continuous catalytic degradation experiment the fixed bed membrane reactor is shown in fig s1 firstly the calcined membrane was cut into a round piece with a diameter of 50 mm and then filled into a replaceable membrane filter secondly many beakers of pnp solution with concentration of 10 mg l ph of 11 and volume of 200 ml were prepared as organic wastewater before the reaction 0 4 g l of pms was added into a beaker of pnp solution with stirring and then the beaker of mixed solution was quickly poured into the cylindrical container above the membrane reactor the water outlet under the membrane reactor was connected with a peristaltic pump with the peristaltic pump pnp solution flowed through the catalytic membrane from top to bottom at a certain flow rate and then the effluent was collected to determine the concentration of residual pnp the pnp solution mixed with pms was poured beaker by beaker to carry out the continuous catalytic degradation reaction under the same experimental steps the effects of different systems membrane mass and flow rate on the catalytic reaction were investigated it can be seen from fig s1 that sufficient degradation can turn the yellow pnp solution on the left into a colorless and transparent liquid like water on the right 3 results and discussions 3 1 membrane morphology and structure as shown in fig 1a and fig 1c both chrysotile fiber and cuo chrysotile fiber can form a flexible thin membrane the morphologies of chrysotile and cuo chrysotile thin membrane were observed by sem fig 1b and fig 1d in these two samples some fibers are closely gathered to form fiber bundles and the fibers and fiber bundles are intertwined to form a multi channel network structure the porosity of chrysotile and cuo chrysotile thin membranes measured by the dry wet weight method 35 are 44 26 and 51 20 respectively and the measured water flux are 2181 8 l h 1m 2bar 1and 2518 6 l h 1m 2bar 1 respectively shown in fig s2 this shows that the prepared thin membrane catalyst has rich pore structure which is conducive to the contact of pollutants and the activation of pms 36 moreover the high water flux ensures the permeability of the membrane which helps to achieve continuous degradation in contrast the fibers in cuo chrysotile thin membrane are rougher and there are more tiny particles mixed in the network structure the eds results fig 1e show that cuo is dispersed on the existing surface of chrysotile and between the fibers in the form of particles of different sizes this hierarchical structure is beneficial to the activation of pms 37 and also improves the porosity and water flux of the thin membrane fig 2 shows the xrd patterns of calcined chrysotile and cuo chrysotile which are very similar and match well with the pure chrysotile however compared with pure calcined chrysotile cuo chrysotile can be observed the additional characteristic peaks of 35 5 and 38 7 corresponding to the 111 and 111 plane of cuo which proves that cu loaded on chrysotile exists in the form of cuo the cuo diffraction peaks are not obvious due to the low cuo content in cuo chrysotile which is determined by icp as 6 15 shown in table s1 the retention of chrysotile structure and the loading of highly dispersed cuo make the composite have higher specific surface area shown in table s2 more hydroxyl groups and more active sites than pure cuo particles which will greatly enhance the catalytic performance of cuo 38 3 2 intermittent catalytic degradation 3 2 1 advantage of cuo chrysotile pnp degradation experiments under different systems are shown in fig 3 because 2 of pnp is adsorbed by chrysotile and cuo chrysotile the influence of adsorption is not considered in the study the pnp degradation ratio of the cuo chrysotile pms system is 96 within 60 min which is much higher than that of the chrysotile pms system 52 6 and cuo pms system 34 79 furthermore the degradation data of pnp in different systems fitted with the pseudo second order kinetic model are shown in fig 3b the degradation rate constant k of pnp for cuo chrysotile pms system was 0 04512 min 1 which was 24 38 and 42 17 times higher than that of chrysotile pms system and cuo pms system these indicate that cuo chrysotile is an efficient pms activator which can effectively realize the catalytic degradation of pnp the following two aspects may be the main reasons on the one hand cuo is uniformly fixed on chrysotile resulting in more accessible reaction sites on the other hand the abundant surficial and structural hydroxyl groups of chrysotile may contribute to the synergistic pms activation process 12 22 because the combination of hso5 and chrysotile s surface hydroxyl may form sulfate radical so4 3 2 2 effect of concentrations of cu ion and pnp on catalytic degradation fig 4a shows that the catalytic performance increases with the increase of impregnation concentration of cu ion which is due to the increase of loading amount of cuo and active sites when the impregnation concentration increases to 200 mmol l or more the catalytic performance of the composite tends to remain unchanged which is because the adsorption of copper ions on chrysotile has reached saturation so the amount of cuo produced has also reached a constant as presented in table s1 the loading amount of cuo almost remains unchanged when the impregnation concentration of cu ion reaches or exceeds 200 mmol l the effect of different pnp concentration on catalytic degradation in cuo chrysotile pms was investigated fig 4b with the increase of initial pnp concentration from 0 mg l to 50 mg l the degradation ratio of pnp decreased from 96 5 to 37 0 this can be attributed to the fact that a large number of organic molecules in the solution with high pnp concentration are adsorbed on the surface of 850cc which hinders the contact between pms and surface active sites 39 however with the increase of initial pnp concentration the actual removal amount of pnp is increasing from 0 965 mg to 2 185 mg this means that the cuo chrysotile asbestos pms system can be used to treat pnp of different concentrations 3 2 3 effects of ph and temperature on catalytic degradation the catalytic ability of cuo chrysotile to pms was tested under different reaction parameters the initial ph plays an important role in the activation of pms different ph values are selected in the range of 6 to 12 fig 5a the results show that the degradation ratio of pnp increases with the increase of ph when the ph is 6 11 and decreases sharply when the ph is 11 although pnp is well catalytically degraded in the ph range of 6 11 this does not mean that cuo chrysotile membrane has a wide ph adaptation range according to the cyclic catalytic performance of the membrane at different initial ph values as shown in fig s3a the catalyst has good degradation performance and catalytic stability only when the ph value is 11 by detecting the concentration of leached cu ions fig s3b and monitoring the ph change in the reaction process fig s3c it can be found that although cu ions are hardly leached under different ph values in the first cycle however in the second and third cycles the cu leaching is serious when the ph is 11 this is because in the first cycle chrysotile is rich in a large amount of hydroxyl so that the solution can be maintained alkaline thus preventing the dissolution of cuo however in the subsequent cycles chrysotile no longer has the ability to adjust ph due to the massive dissolution of hydroxyl group so cu begins to leach and leads to the decline of catalytic performance under strong alkaline conditions ph 11 the degradation ratio drops sharply because a large amount of so5 2 are generated from pms which prevents the generation of so4 and oh in the reaction system 40 as shown in the fig s4 the zeta potential is maintained at a relatively stable value in different ph values so the electrical property of the cuo chrysotile surface has no significant effect on the reaction fig 5b shows the effect of reaction temperature on pnp degradation it can be found that the degradation ratio of pnp is gradually accelerated with the increase of reaction temperature when the reaction temperature reaches 30 c 95 degradation ratio can be achieved within 60 min the reaction conforms to the pseudo second order kinetic fig s5 it is calculated that activation energy required for cuo chrysotile activated pms to degrade pnp is 15 36865 kj mol 1 which is higher than that of general diffusion control reaction 10 13 kj mol 1 this shows that the essence of this reaction is not a simple material transfer but a chemical reaction on the surface of the oxide 41 in addition the low activation energy of the reaction system indicates that cuo chrysotile needs to overcome a low potential barrier in the pms catalytic reaction process and is an efficient heterogeneous catalyst 42 3 2 4 effects of catalyst dosage and pms dosage on catalytic degradation the catalyst plays an important role in the reaction system therefore it is necessary to explore the influence of catalyst dosage on pnp degradation as shown in fig 6a pnp degradation efficiency continued to increase with catalyst dosage from 0 25 to 1 0 g l with the increase of cuo chrysotile the number of active sites increases and then reactive oxygen species are produced faster thereby improving the degradation efficiency fig 6b shows that the degradation of pnp by cuo chrysotile pms depends on the dosage of pms when the dosage of pms increased in the range of 0 0 6 g l the degradation rate of pnp increased however when the pms dosage increased to 0 8 g l the degradation rate of pnp decreased this is because excessive pms will compete with pnp for active substances 43 the degradation rate of 0 6 g l pms is almost the same as 0 4 g l pms but the cost is obviously increased therefore 0 4 g l pms is considered to be the appropriate dosage 3 2 5 influence of inevitable substances and ability to degrade other organic pollutants many inevitable substances including some inorganic anions and organic substances usually exist in actual wastewater and have an impact on wastewater degradation therefore we studied the influence of various substances on catalytic degradation of pnp in cuo chrysotile pms system as shown in fig 7a in general cl so4 2 and hco3 very slightly reduce the degradation ratio while co3 2 and ha have obvious influence on the degradation process according to previous reports cl can be oxidized by oh and so4 to produce secondary chlorine radicals with low redox potential such as cl cl2 and cloh 44 the addition of hco3 will slow down the reaction rate but increase the final degradation ratio which may be due to the buffer for ph and reduce of the consumption rate of pms co3 2 will increase the alkalinity of the solution resulting in a large amount of so5 2 which prevents the generation of so4 and oh in the reaction system hco3 and co3 2 may react with so4 to form co3 with low oxidation capacity 40 in addition the addition of 10 mg l of humic acid ha decreases the degradation effect because the ha may react with radicals 45 in a word cuo chrysotile pms has good adaptability to complex environments which is conducive to the application in the degradation of practical wastewater in order to explore the universality of cuo chrysotile pms system a variety of representative pollutants were selected for degradation experiments including rhb cationic dye mb and acid ar73 anionic dye and tc antibiotics as shown in fig 7b it is obvious that cuo chrysotile pms system shows excellent catalytic degradation performance for different dyes while the degradation of antibiotics is slightly weaker than that of pnp the results show that cuo chrysotile has good versatility and can well degrade various organic compounds and is suitable for treatment of practical wastewater with the coexistence of multiple organic pollutants 3 3 continuous catalytic degradation experiment in order to simulate the industrial application and explore the performance change law of the membrane catalyst under long term operation the cuo chrysotile membrane was loaded into a self made fixed bed reactor for continuous degradation of pnp solution the optimum reaction conditions in the continuous experiment are the same as those of intermittent experiment fig 8 intuitively points out that the catalytic degradation performance is pure pms system chrysotile pms system cuo pe pms system cuo chrysotile pms system the results show the removal efficiency of pnp in cuo chrysotile pms system is close to 90 at a flow rate of 5 ml min which is much higher than other reaction systems it is worth noting that the mass ratio of cuo in cuo chrysotile membrane is only 6 15 so there is only 9 2 mg of cuo in the thin membrane with a diameter of 50 mm according to the pnp degradation results shown in fig 8 it is obvious that under the same reaction conditions the catalytic degradation effect of the cuo pms system is still far weaker than that of the cuo chrysotile pms system even if the cuo dosage in cuo pms is 40 mg that is much larger than the dosage of 9 2 mg in cuo chrysotile pms at the same time the degradation effect of chrysotile loaded with cuo is much better than the pure chrysotile membrane the above shows that after combination there is a meaningful synergistic effect between chrysotile and cuo which greatly enhances the catalytic degradation performance of the composite in addition with the decrease of flow rate the degradation ratio of each system increases to varying degrees which is attributed to that the lower flow rate increases the time of pnp passing through the catalytic membrane and improves the degradation ratio the influence of the membrane mass on the degradation effect was studied as shown in fig 9 the membranes with different mass showed excellent degradation efficiency in general the degradation ratio increases with the increase of the membrane mass on the one hand the increase in thickness leads to the extension of the time for pollutants to pass through the catalyst thus enhancing the reaction on the other hand the increase of the catalyst has fully improved the utilization of pms however it can be found from the data of membrane flux the higher the membrane mass is the faster the water flux decreases and the faster the membrane resistance increases as shown in fig s2 the thin membrane with a mass of 0 15 g can degrade nearly 90 of pnp at 5 ml min with a high water flux 2518 629 l h 1m 2bar 1 when the membrane mass is 0 225 g although the degradation ratio increases by only 5 percentage points compared with 0 15 g membrane at 5 ml min the water flux significantly reduces to 1024 233 l h 1m 2bar 1 therefore it is considered that the best degradation condition are membrane mass of 0 15 g and flow rate of 5 ml min in addition to excellent catalytic activity good stability and reusability are also the key to the practical application of catalysts therefore cuo chrysotile membrane with a mass of 0 15 g was used as a fixed bed for long term catalytic degradation experiments fig 10 shows the real time degradation ratio and cumulative degradation amount of pnp when a catalytic membrane is continuously degraded for 4000 min under a flow rate of 5 ml min from the figure it can be seen that the initial degradation effect is relatively stable and the catalytic degradation ratio decreases slowly with the increase of time at 2000 min the degradation ratio still exceeds 75 which indicates that the stability of the catalytic material is very good when the treatment time reaches 2500 min the catalytic effect of cuo chrysotile membrane begins to decline sharply and a total of 100 mg of pnp is degraded at this time when the treatment time exceeds 3200 min the degradation ratio decreases to 10 and tends to be stable which indicates that the catalytic membrane has completely failed and the existing degradation at this time is due to the oxidation of pms itself above experimental data show that before failure the 0 15 g catalytic membrane continuously treats about 12 5 l of pnp solution with a concentration of 10 mg l and cumulatively degrades about 100 mg of pnp according to the calculation in this experiment the cuo chrysotile membrane continuously and effectively treats pnp solution 80 000 times its own mass and achieves about 80 of the total degradation ratio of pnp this amazing catalytic degradation performance means that cuo catalyst has excellent and stable effect and great practical value in order to explore the failure reason of the catalytic membrane the concentration of leached cu ions fig s6 and the xrd patterns of the samples before and after the failure fig s7 were detected it can be found that the concentration of leached cu ions is far lower than the cu content in the membrane and the diffraction peaks corresponding to cuo are almost unchanged while the intensity of diffraction peaks corresponding to chrysotile decreases significantly this may be because after long term washing with pnp solution mg and si in chrysotile are partially dissolved which leads to the destruction of the its structure and weakens the synergistic effect between cuo and chrysotile as shown in fig s8 the fiber surface of the failed cuo chrysotile membrane is significantly roughened and some sheet substances in it which may be caused by the dissolution of mg from the fiber and precipitating into mg oh 2 in an alkaline environment at the same time the destruction of chrysotile structure will further damage the pore structure of the catalytic membrane reducing the effective contact between oxidants pollutants and active sites which results in the reduction of catalytic degradation efficiency 3 4 catalytic mechanism in order to further explore the mechanism of pnp degradation in the cuo chrysotile pms system methanol ma tert butyl alcohol tba p benzoquinone p bq and histidine lh were used as radical quenchers to verify the existence of so4 oh o2 and 1o2 it is reported that the second order reaction rate of ma with oh and so4 is very high which can quench oh and so4 at the same time 46 the second order reaction rate constant of tba with oh is 3 orders of magnitude faster than that of tba with so4 which can be used to selectively quench the oh 47 p bq and lh are often used to quench o2 48 49 and 1o2 33 respectively in the quenching experiment the degradation efficiency of pnp decreases with the increase of the dosage of the quenchers as a result the dosage of quenchers is increased to ensure that the corresponding free radicals are completely quenched as much as possible fig s9 the comparison of the final quenching effect is shown in fig 11a the results show that 1o2 plays a major role in pnp degradation and so4 oh and o2 also participate in the degradation ros generated in cuo chrysotile pms system were further detected via epr as shown in fig 12b the epr signals of dmpo oh cannot be observed in cuo chrysotile pms system instead an obvious seven peak signal can be recorded which attributed to the hyperfine splitting of dmpo oxidation product which is dmpox formed by dmpo through oh 50 the existence of dmpox indicates that strong oxidation of the system leads to rapid oxidation of dmpo 51 in addition the standard characteristic peaks of dmpo so4 fig 12b dmpo o2 fig 12c and temp 1o2 fig 12d prove the existence of so4 o2 and 1o2 in the cuo chrysotile pms system xps spectra before and after the catalytic reaction were compared fig 12 the results show that cu mainly exists in the form of cu ii before the reaction then 33 6 of cu ii is converted to cu i after the catalytic reaction o exists in cuo chrysotile in the form of lattice oxygen hydroxyl and adsorbed oxygen after the reaction part of the hydroxyl is converted to lattice oxygen indicating that hydroxyl participates in pms activation as a ligand in the system based on the previous study of radical quenching the activation mechanism of cuo chrysotile is proposed fig 13 since hso5 and o2 have a higher redox potential than cu ii cu i hso5 and o2 are responsible for the reduction of cu ii eqs 1 2 52 53 cu i will provide an electron to pms so that hso5 is decomposed to produce so4 and oh eqs 3 4 54 to realize the oxidation reduction cycle of cu so as to have continuous catalytic performance o2 can be formed by adsorbing oxygen and oxygen eq 5 55 the alkaline environment and the presence of a large number of hydroxyl groups on the surface of chrysotile make eq 1 easier to proceed to the right which further promotes the production of oxygen or singlet oxygen eqs 6 7 53 56 1o2 can also be generated by o2 eq 8 50 so4 is also easy to generate oh due to its stronger oxidation eq 9 57 finally so4 oh o2 and 1o2 synergistically degrade pnp eq 10 1 cu ii hso 5 cu i so 5 h 2 cu ii o 2 cu i o 2 3 cu i hso 5 cu ii so 4 oh 4 cu i hso 5 cu ii so 4 2 oh 5 cu i o 2 cu ii o 2 6 2 so 5 2 so 4 o 2 7 2 so 5 2 so 4 1 o 2 8 o 2 oh oh 1 o 2 9 so 4 oh so 4 2 oh 10 so 4 oh o 2 1 o 2 pnp degraded products h 2 o co 2 4 conclusion in conclusion a novel cuo chrysotile catalytic membrane was synthesized by simple impregnation calcination route based on the fibrous characteristics of natural mineral chrysotile for the first time the synergistic effect of cuo and chrysotile effectively promoted the activation of pms to decompose pnp the results of intermittent experimental showed that the cuo chrysotile could well activate pms to efficiently and completely degrade pnp under the optimized conditions and ph value temperature catalyst amount and pms dosage had varying degrees of influence on the degradation performance the continuous experimental results showed that the cuo chrysotile catalytic membrane used as a fixed bed could continuously work for 2500 min and efficiently degrade pnp solution of 10 mg l 80 000 times its own mass to achieve an overall degradation ratio of about 80 in addition 1o2 was confirmed to be the most important ros produced in the cuo chrysotile pms system and so4 oh and o2 were involved in the degradation of pnp in a word chrysotile can support cuo and form a solid membrane due to its special fiber characteristics and surface properties so as to obtain a membrane type catalyst with long term performance this kind of catalyst has the advantages of simple preparation low cost convenient use great catalytic performance and long service life which is a new strategy for activating pms to degrade organic wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
