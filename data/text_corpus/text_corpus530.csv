2650,pumping events are often conducted in the alluvial fan due to its considerable amount of water if pumping events occur in the nearby vicinity of the streams it will inevitably influence the complex microbial ecosystems in both the river and the aquifer induce the issue of water rights permits and affect the development of the water resource management therefore it becomes necessary to accurately predict groundwater flow as a result of pumping in the wedge shaped aquifer in this paper we propose an analytical solution to describe the drawdown distribution and the stream depletion rate sdr due to pumping in a wedge shaped aquifer which represents the shape of the alluvial fan bounded by two streams moreover we adopt the lagging theory into the model by introducing two lagging parameters in darcy s law to allow the water flow and the hydraulic gradient to occur at different times this measure facilitates the reflection of the inertial force because of a higher pumping rate and the microstructural interaction resulting from the water transfer between the primary pores and secondary pores e g dead end pores and very small pores it leads to the predicted result being closer to reality when these effects are profound we found that the drawdown and sdr curves will behave like waves when the flux lagging dominates the sdr value can be over unit due to the additional recharge driven by inertial force the drawdown and sdr acts more like an unconfined or dual porosity flow if storage lagging governs the system moreover lagging parameters have the largest effect on drawdown and sdr when the times are close to the corresponding values of lagging parameters the case of wedge shaped domain bounded by two impervious barriers is considered to further explore the boundary effects on aquifer response to pumping keywords lagging theory dual phase lag model aquifer pumping stream depletion rate analytical solution wedge shaped aquifer data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction in a natural geological structural setting pairs of randomly oriented streams can intersect to draw the lateral boundaries of wedge shaped aquifers see fig 1 a typical alluvial aquifer is usually bounded by streams in radial directions with different angles displaying a sector area of a circle mahdavi 2022 in general the alluvial fans in arid or semiarid areas play the role of groundwater reservoirs when the water in the stream gradually percolates downwards this often results in many decentralized pumping activities in such regions and it will cause issues not only in the water resources management but also in the adjudication of water rights moreover a great deal of pumping activity may occur in the alluvial fan in some countries that receive abundant rainfall but suffer regional precipitation with high spatiotemporal variability between the dry and wet seasons as in taiwan chen and chen 2003 therefore understanding the groundwater flow behavior due to pumping in the wedge shaped aquifer becomes a challenging issue for hydrologists many mathematical models have emerged to study the pump induced hydraulic response in the wedge shaped aquifer apart from those devoted to the image well method chan et al 1978 may be the first to solve the equations for the confined flow due to pumping in a wedge shaped aquifer by the integral transform method the pumping well was treated as a point source and they implemented finite fourier sine hankel and mellin transforms techniques to derive the drawdown solution to their model yeh and chang 2006 further extends the model of chan et al 1978 by considering the effects of a gentle slope and rolling topography on streams the similar integral methods mentioned in chan et al 1978 solved their flow equations with the aid of shanks method to accelerate the convergence rate of infinite summation terms later yeh et al 2008 not only concentrated on the drawdown distribution due to pumping in the wedge shaped aquifer also they studied the pump induced stream depletion volume and stream depletion rate problem through the chan et al 1978 solution after that plenty of mathematical models associated with pump induced groundwater flow have been developed in a wedge shaped aquifer with various configurations e g confined aquifer unconfined aquifer fractured aquifer or their combination sedghi et al 2009 2012 samani and sedghi 2015 sedghi and zhan 2018 2022 mahdavi and seyyedian 2014 mahdavi 2020 2021 2022 however the mathematical models mentioned above were developed on the basis of darcy s law implying that the specific flux is linearly proportional to the hydraulic gradient these models are valid when groundwater flow is laminar bear 2012 however difficulties arise when the flow velocity is moderately high due to a high pumping rate or flow in the large fracture inducing the inertial effect on the flow pascal 1986 löfqvist and rehbinder 1993 or microstructural interaction due to secondary pores e g dead end very small pores or in a fracture matrix system are abundant in the medium fatt 1959 bear and cheng 2010 these effects would result in additional head loss and recharge to the pumping well and models developed based on darcy s law will no longer be suitable for analyzing the hydraulic response under the foregoing conditions lin and yeh 2017 then lag theory was developed to cope with these two phenomena the concept is to add two time lags to the darcy law causing the specific flux and the hydraulic gradient to occur at different times two lagging parameters separately represent the effects of inertial force due to high flow speed and dead end pores due to structural interaction lin and yeh 2017 found that the lagging parameters correspond to the lumped hydraulic parameters in the dual porosity model barenblatt et al 1960 the difference between the two models is that the lagging model can reflect the inertial effect whereas the dual porosity model restricts itself from the properties of the secondary formation furthermore the lagging model has proven to be efficient in estimating the parameters of field tests in the madison aquifer in south dakota usa conducted by greene 1993 which consists of solutional openings and fracture rocks that can induce a profound inertial effect on the pumped flow however in the context of lagging theory to the best of authors knowledge there exists no mathematical model for pumping in a wedge shaped aquifer bounded by two streams in this study we aim to incorporate the lagging theory into the mathematical model for the pump induced confined flow in a wedge shaped aquifer the withdrawal of water from the aquifer is formulated by a point source which appends the dirac delta function to the governing equation the two streams or two impermeable barriers extend from the apex of the wedge shaped aquifer to the infinitely far location on the basis of lagging theory two lagging parameters are introduced in the model to reflect the joint effects of the inertial force as a result of the higher pumping rate and the microstructural interaction due to storage and release from secondary pores the governing equation is solved by the method of successive transformations combining the laplace the finite fourier sine and the hankel transform techniques without the lagging effects the present solution reduces to the existing model the impacts of lagging parameters on the drawdown distribution are investigated by changing their values moreover the sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are performed to assess the drawdown in response to the model parameters 2 methodology 2 1 mathematical model and analytical solution fig 2 shows the schematic diagram of the wedge shaped aquifer where the groundwater experiences the effects of the pumping well and two nearby streams the governing equation for confined flow in a wedge shaped aquifer can be expressed as 1 s h t q 0 r δ r r 0 δ θ θ 0 1 r r r q 1 r θ q where h is the hydraulic head l s is the storage coefficient t is the transmissivity l 2 t 1 q 0 is the pumping rate l 3 t 1 r 0 θ 0 is the spatial location of the pumping well and q is the specific flow according to darcy s law q is defined as 2 q t t h t on the basis of the lagging theory eq 2 can be expressed as 3 q t τ q t h t τ h where τ q and τ h are the flux lagging and storage lagging t the parameter τ q represents the time lag due to the inertial force resulting from the high velocity flow due to pumping or flow in a greater permeability formation on the other hand τ h is the time lag induced by the microstructural interaction such as dead end or very small pores when τ q τ h it means that the hydraulic gradient is the cause of the specific flux when τ q τ h it implies the specific flux that causes the hydraulic gradient note that τ q τ h indicates that the lagging effects are immaterial lin and yeh 2017 expanding eq 3 by the taylor series results in 4 j 0 τ q j j 1 t j 1 q t t j 0 τ h j j 1 t j 1 h t the first order approximation is adopted i e j 1 as follows 5 q t τ q q t t t h t τ h h t t combining eq 5 with 1 one can obtain the following result 6 1 τ q t s h t q 0 r δ r r 0 δ θ θ 0 t 1 τ h t 2 h r 2 1 r h r 1 r 2 2 h θ 2 according to the definition of drawdown s h 0 h l wherein h 0 is the initial hydraulic head l eq 6 can be recast as 7 1 τ q t s s t q 0 r δ r r 0 δ θ θ 0 t 1 τ h t 2 s r 2 1 r s r 1 r 2 2 s θ 2 prior to pumping the groundwater is assumed to be stationary therefore the initial conditions can be expressed as 8 s s t 0 t 0 the boundary conditions in the r direction are the following 9 r s r 0 r 0 2 2 physical meaning behind τ q and τ h lin and yeh 2017 first proposed a mathematical model for describing the pump induced leaky confined flow with incorporating the lagging theory the governing equations for describing the dual porosity flow in fracture and matrix can be respectively expressed as barenblatt et al 1960 10 s f s f t q 0 r δ r r 0 δ θ θ 0 β s f s m t 2 s f r 2 1 r s f r 1 r 2 2 s f θ 2 11 s m s m t β s f s m where the subscripts f and m denotes fracture and matrix respectively β is the first order water transfer rate coefficient t 1 and s f s m s rearranging eqs 10 and 11 the flow equation in terms of s f can be expressed as 12 s 1 s f s m β s t s f t q 0 r δ r r 0 δ θ θ 0 t 1 s m β t 2 s f r 2 1 r s f r 1 r 2 2 s f θ 2 comparing eqs 12 with 7 one can obtain the following relationships 13 τ q s m s f β s f s m 14 τ h s m β the dual porosity model assumed groundwater to flow in the fracture due to its high permeability and the matrix plays the role of water storage and release however one can conclude from 13 and 14 that s m s f β s f s m s m β implying that the effect of the secondary pore water always dominates the flow system however the main difference between the lagging and dual porosity models is that the lagging theory allows τ q to be greater than τ h to reflect the inertial effect on the hydraulic response therefore head loss due to inertia can be explained by the lagging flow model but failed by the dual porosity model it should be noted that τ q and τ h must be estimated as constant representative values of the aquifer in the work of lin and yeh 2017 the values of τ q and τ h corresponding to τ s in their study are constantly estimated from several pumping tests conducted in the madison aquifer in the western rapid city area south dakota greene 1993 the results of parameter estimation show the scale dependent properties that extending the observation distance would give higher estimates of τ h and τ q it implies that a longer distance could include many large fissures increasing the possibilities of occurrences of the inertial force due to high flow rate and structural interaction due to more water exchanging between two continua this fact also reflects in their estimates of t which display scale dependent properties in their analysis showing that the madison aquifer is highly heterogeneous it also implies that the estimates of τ q and τ h provided information similar to t if the storage lagging is neglected τ h 0 the flux lagging is identical to the inertial term as advocated by pascal 1986 for the flow equation in terms of pressure 15 τ q ρ 0 κ μ n where ρ 0 is the reference pressure ml 1t 2 κ is permeability l 2 μ is viscosity ml 1t 1 and n is the effective porosity given the pump induced time drawdown curve when storage lagging dominates i e τ h τ q the time drawdown curve will behave in an s shaped pattern such a pattern is similar to the time drawdown curve generated by the dual porosity or unconfined aquifer models on the other hand if the flux lagging governs the flow system τ q τ h the time drawdown pattern will reveal wavelike behavior due to inertia for forward modeling τ q and τ h are unknown thus these two lagging parameters should be determined by performing the aquifer tests and analyzing the data with a proper model such as the lag model for the pumping test lin and yeh 2017 in the study area to estimate these values in a way similar to the aquifer test that identifies t and s 2 3 stream stream wedge shaped aquifer the boundaries in the θ direction are subject to the zero drawdown condition i e constant head condition as shown in fig 2 that gives 16 s 0 θ 0 ϕ as a first step to derive the drawdown solution the laplace transform method eliminates t the transformed governing equation and associated boundary conditions take the form of 17 1 p τ q s p s q 0 p r δ r r 0 δ θ θ 0 t 1 τ h p 2 s r 2 1 r s r 1 r 2 2 s θ 2 18 r s r 0 r 0 19 s 0 θ 0 ϕ where s s r θ p ℒ s 0 e p t s r θ t d t stands for the drawdown in the laplace domain and p t 1 is the laplace parameter next the finite fourier sine transform eliminates the θ dependency converting the above expressions to 20 1 p τ q s p s q 0 p r δ r r 0 sin θ 0 ξ k t 1 τ h p d 2 s d r 2 1 r d s d r ξ k 2 r 2 s 21 r d s d r 0 r 0 where s denotes the drawdown in the fourier sine domain s s r ξ k p ℱ s s 0 ϕ sin ξ k θ s d θ with the fourier parameter ξ k defined as k π ϕ finally the hankel transform method removes the r dependency and the transformed equations become 22 1 τ q p s p s ˆ q 0 p j ξ k a r 0 sin θ 0 ξ k a 2 t s ˆ 1 τ h p where s ˆ represents the drawdown in the hankel domain s ˆ s ˆ a ξ k p ℋ ξ k s 0 j ξ k a r s r d r and a l 1 is the hankel parameter eq 22 can be rearranged as 23 s ˆ q 0 τ q p 1 sin ξ k θ 0 j ξ k a r 0 p s τ q p 2 a 2 t τ h s p a 2 t then the resulting drawdown can be converted back to physical space through the successive inversions of the laplace fourier and hankel transforms the laplace inverse s ˆ a ξ k t ℒ 1 s ˆ

sin ξ k θ s r ξ k t one obtains the drawdown in physical space 28 s 2 ϕ k 1 sin ξ k θ 0 s ˆ j ξ k a r a d a when the lagging effects are minor i e τ h τ q 0 eq 24 becomes 29 s ˆ q 0 1 e a 2 t t s sin

evaluated by means of the quadgk function which implements the high order global adaptive quadrature technique the absolute error tolerance is set to approximately 12 decimal places of accuracy by the observation eq 28 possesses a steady state solution and eq 25 simplifies to ω 2 γ when t this results in 30 s ˆ q 0 sin ξ k θ 0 j ξ k a r 0 a 2 t 2 4 barrier barrier wedge shaped aquifer natural hydrogeological settings reveal formation of alluvial fans that are bounded laterally by impervious barriers across which the condition of zero flux can be imposed as 31 1 r s θ 0 θ 0 ϕ the so called barrier barrier wedge can be treated by proceeding as before but now with fourier cosine transform s ℱ c s 0 ϕ cos ξ k θ s d θ to account for the boundary conditions eq 31 this may be achieved by replacing all sine functions in eqs 20 22 23 by respective cosine functions leading to the drawdown in the fourier cosine hankel space as follows 32 s ˆ q 0 2 a 2 t γ cos ξ k θ 0 j ξ k a r 0 ω all parameters appearing in eq 32 are defined as before similarly the joint inverse of fourier cosine hankel transforms is stated by ℱ c 1 ℋ ξ k 1 s ˆ with 33 s ℋ ξ k 1 s ˆ 0 j ξ k a r s ˆ a ξ k t a d a 34 s ℱ c 1 s 1 ϕ s r 0 t 2 ϕ k 1 cos ξ k θ s r ξ k t the drawdown can be expressed in a more compact form as 35 s 2 ϕ k 0 ϵ k cos ξ k θ 0 s ˆ j ξ k a r a d a where the factor ϵ k takes 1 2 if k 0 and 1 if k 0 2 5 infinite extent aquifer if the boundary effects in θ direction e g the stream or impermeable layer are negligible the proposed model can reduce to the case of pumping in an infinite extent aquifer the governing equation of the flow becomes 36 1 τ q t s s t q 0 2 π r δ r t 1 τ h t 2 s r 2 1 r s r with r measured from the well axis taking the laplace transform s s r p ℒ s

wellbore storage are ignored 2 6 stream depletion rate contributed from two streams near wedge shaped aquifer stream depletion rate sdr is defined as the ratio of volumetric flow rate of the streams to the pumping rate for the water resource management purposes sdr usually serves as a measure to characterize the water contribution from the streams induced by pumping typically the sdr can range from 0 to 1 0 100 if sdr 0 it implies that there is no pumped water recharged from the stream on the other hand if sdr 1 it means that the pumped water comes entirely from the stream moreover when the sdr value is between 0 and 1 it indicates that the pumped water comes partially from the stream and the rest of the water comes from the aquifer the sdr formulas for the streams at θ 0 and θ ϕ can be written as follows respectively 41 q r q 0 0 t q 0 1 r s θ θ 0 d r k 1 2 t ϕ 0 s ˆ a d a and 42 q l q 0 0 t q 0 1 r s θ θ ϕ d r k 1 2 t 1 k ϕ 0 s ˆ a d a where q r and q l are fluxes l 3 t 1 from the streams at θ 0 and θ ϕ respectively once the sdr value reaches 1 or 100 the pumped water is completely supplemented by the streams 2 7 sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to know how and when the aquifer parameters influence the aquifer drawdown performing a sensitivity analysis can facilitate the assessment of the impact of parameter sensitivity on the system output dell oca et al 2020 knabe et al 2021 kabala 2001 defined the normalized sensitivity coefficient as follows 43 x k p k o p k in which x k represents the normalized sensitivity of the output o i e s to the k th input aquifer parameter p k the forward finite difference approximates 43 as follows 44 x k p k o p k δ p k o p k δ p k where δ p k is often set to 1 0 3 p k note that a positive value of x means that a small increase in an aquifer parameter causes an increase in s in contrast negative x implies that a small increase in a parameter yields a decrease in s on the other hand the multivariate first order variance estimation method serves as a simple but reliable tool to perform the uncertainty analysis in hydrological studies tung and yen 2005 mahdavi 2022 based on the variance v ar the percentage contribution of uncertainty η k of the parameter p k is defined as 45 η k o p k 2 v ar p k v ar o the partial derivatives in 45 are known as sensitivity factors the variance v ar p k can be calculated by c k p k 2 where c k is the coefficient of variation set at 0 05 and p k is the mean of the k th parameter the variance v ar o is given by k o p k 2 v ar p k thence eq 45 can be expressed as 46 η k o p k 2 c k p k 2 k o p k 2 c k p k 2 a higher η k means that the k th parameter has a greater uncertainty while a lower η k represents that the parameter has a smaller uncertainty 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of τ q and τ h on the pump induced drawdown the flux lagging τ q and storage τ h are the key factors that influence the groundwater system the hypothetical aquifer assumes properties of t 10 m 2 d and s 1 1 0 4 fig 3 shows the time drawdown curves for the cases of τ h τ q 1 d 0 5 d 1 d 1 d and 1 d 1 5 d with ϕ 40 80 and 120 in the a stream stream and b barrier barrier wedge shaped aquifers moreover we plot the drawdown curves predicted by the drawdown solution of infinite extent aquifer as references dashed lines in each case the pumping well is situated at r 0 500 m and θ 0 3 ϕ 4 with a discharge rate of q 100 m 3 d the observation point is near the pumping well that is r θ 0 9 r 0 θ 0 note that the cases of τ h τ q 1 mean the lagging effects are negligible as can be observed in fig 3 a a greater ϕ has the effect of increasing the drawdown value it is because a larger ϕ implies that the distances between two streams and the pumping well become longer the water from the streams requires more time to recharge the pumping well however as fig 3 b indicates the increase in ϕ has the effect of decreasing the drawdown value this is attributed to the fact that in the barrier barrier wedge shaped aquifer the pumped water is mainly from aquifer storage therefore a greater ϕ means a larger aquifer region serving as a huge water reservoir in addition for the case of the stream stream aquifer after around t 9 d the drawdown curves for all cases reach steady state flattening patterns because all the pumped water is from the streams when τ q τ h the drawdown curves show slighter increases in the intermediate portion due to the recharge of the water in the secondary pore on the other hand when τ q τ h the drawdown curves show humps at intermediate times because the inertial force resists the water moving toward the pumping well momentarily leading to a higher drawdown value than in other cases such behaviors reflect the lagging effect and are consistent with the findings revealed by lin and yeh 2017 for the case of the barrier barrier aquifer the drawdown continues to increase over time because there are no water resources to recharge the pumping well the dashed lines representing the drawdown without the boundary effect merge with the curves for stream stream and barrier barrier aquifers at early times these curves start to depart from each other when the boundary effect influences the aquifer system in general pumping wells operate with intermittent discharge depending on water demand fig 4 illustrates the time drawdown curves for τ q 0 5 1 1 5 d with a fixed τ h value of 1 d and a fixed ϕ value of 40 as the pumping ceases at 0 5 d in the a stream stream and b barrier barrier wedge shaped aquifers the case of infinite extent aquifer is also included for the comparison the results are generated based on the superposition principle for the present solution as we have already discussed a greater τ q will result in a higher drawdown value when the well is still operating i e t 0 5 d after that time an increase in τ q yields a lower drawdown value finally all drawdown curves are steady at zero i e the initial drawdown s 0 as indicated in fig 4 a the curve for the case of τ q 1 5 d produces a negative value after t 0 5 d however it is certain that the inertia causes groundwater to suddenly pull back to the pumping well resulting in the recharge of large amounts of water to the well this is a classical phenomenon of the inertial wave and can be found in several studies related to the slug test performed in a fractured aquifer or near the water table kipp 1985 mcelwee and zenner 1998 malama et al 2011 liu et al 2020 lin and yeh 2022 in the modeling of the slug test the response to the water level induced by the instantaneous pulse of water in a high permeability formation exhibited an oscillatory behavior due to the effect of inertial force on the movement of the water in the test well butler 2019 apparently τ q in the lagging model exhibits an inertia related pattern when the pumping well is suddenly shut off be aware that as indicated in fig 4 b the inertial related wave behavior would not occur in the cases of a barrier barrier wedge shaped aquifer and an infinite extent aquifer because there is no stream water to supply the aquifer flow to oscillate the groundwater flow fig 5 shows the contour maps of drawdown in a stream stream wedge shaped aquifer at t 0 5 d for the cases of a τ h 1 d τ q 0 5 d b τ h 1 d τ q 1 d and c τ h 1 d τ q 1 5 d according to fig 3 the significant change in drawdown for different combinations of the lagging parameters is around 0 1 d therefore we set t 0 5 d to generate the contour maps as the figure indicates a higher τ q leads to higher spatial drawdown values the reason is the same as that discussed in fig 3 on the other hand fig 6 shows a plot similar to fig 5 but for the barrier barrier wedge shaped aquifer the drawdown also increases with τ q for the same reason the drawdown values shown in fig 6 are much higher than those of fig 5 this is because one is subject to the effect of the constant head condition imposed on the stream boundaries while the other one is subject to the no flux condition the former condition provides water to the pumping well but the latter does not overall the type of boundary condition can exert a significantly different effect on the drawdown distribution in the wedge shaped aquifer 3 2 effects of τ q and τ h on sdr sdr reflects the measure of how much pump induced water flows from the stream to the pumping well fig 7 shows the sdr curves for the two streams i e θ 0 and ϕ and the total sdr of both streams for different values of lagging parameter τ q the effect of the lagging on the drawdown is similar to its sdr counterpart that is a greater τ q would result in a higher sdr value the sdr value for the case of θ ϕ is higher than that of θ 0 because the pumping well is much closer to the stream at the angle of ϕ more notable are the total sdr curves for the cases of τ q 0 5 d and 1 d the total sdr of both streams will finally reach 100 that is the pumped water from the pumping well is all from the stream water however the total sdr for the case of τ q 1 5 d increases by 100 in the approximate interval of 0 2 d 5 d this is not to conclude that a nonphysical phenomenon occurs or rather some amount of stream water flowing to the well is not induced by the pumping but driven by inertia it may be seldom seen in practical observation because the inertial force may not exert such a significant effect as the figure shows however if the inertial force dominates the groundwater flow system the total sdr curve is likely to reach a value greater than 100 3 3 results of sensitivity and uncertainty analyses to evaluate the sensitivity curve we consider that the parameters have default values of t 2 m 2 d s 1 1 0 4 ϕ 120 q 0 100 m 3 d r 0 500 m and τ q τ h 1 d with the observation point at r θ 0 9 r 0 0 75 ϕ fig 8 illustrates the sensitivity coefficient curves of t s τ q and τ h in the a stream stream wedge shaped aquifer and b barrier barrier wedge shaped aquifer with the sensitivity curves predicted by infinite extent aquifer solution the results in fig 8 a show that t is the most sensitive parameter followed by s τ q and τ s two sensitivity curves of t and τ h match each other at the beginning i e before about 0 2 d or 4 8 h the parameters t and τ h have a similar effect on the response to the drawdown at the beginning of the process then both curves are separated the curves of t s and τ h are negative because increasing these values will result in a smaller drawdown for example a higher t means a higher water transfer rate in the aquifer a higher s represents more water stored in the pores that can be released and a higher τ h signifies a higher transfer rate between the primarily pores and the secondary pores however the match portion of the curves t and τ h is positive initially due to the effect of τ q exerting a wave effect on the other hand the τ h curve remains negative most of the time it is attributed to a larger τ h that recharge more water resulting in lower drawdown after 100 d all curves reach a flat plateau because the water from both streams starts to recharge the pumping well the sensitivity curves of τ h and τ q show the same pattern but with a different sign both lagging parameter curves reach the peak in a time of 1 d that is the default value assigned to τ q and τ h the maximal effect of the lagging parameter apparently in the period is correlated with the value assigned to it similar findings are also reported in lin and yeh 2017 and lin et al 2019 however fig 8 b exhibits the similar results with the curves shown in fig 8 a the main differences are that the sensitivity curves of t and s continue to decrease with elapsed time this is because of the effects of the no flux boundary in the θ direction other effects of the parameters show very close patterns to corresponding curves for the case of stream stream wedge shaped aquifer furthermore the sensitivity curves for the case of infinite extent aquifer also produce similar results as the other two cases but the curve of s levels out a constant value and the curve of t falls right down in short the sensitivity curves of the lagging parameters for three cases show a similar effect on the change in drawdown the curve of s may be insensitive for the case of stream stream aquifer due to the domination of the stream flow the parameter s shows a profound effect at late times for the case of barrier barrier aquifer because all the pumped water comes from the storage of the aquifer fig 9 shows the temporal distribution of η k for the same set of input parameters as in fig 8 it clarifies how and to what extent the stochastic nature of the input parameters p t s τ h τ q propagates through the model and disperses the model output i e drawdown s at the observation point at the earlier stage of pumping s appears to be the most uncertain parameter among the other three input parameters showing η s 100 before approximately 0 1 d where the sensitivity factors of τ h and τ q immediately vanish as fig 9 a indicates for stream stream wedge shaped aquifer even though var s var τ h and var τ q the magnitude of the sensitivity factor of s is comparatively large so that η s η τ h and η τ q at that instant of time the uncertainty curves η τ h and η τ q coincide and fall below the curve of t at each moment of time however the contribution of t to the overall uncertainty of drawdown gradually grows with time reaching η t 100 on the steady state plateau this is because the flow model loses dependence on s τ h and τ q as t in 28 overall a similar pattern of uncertainty curves can be observed for barrier barrier wedge shaped and infinite extent aquifers in fig 9 b except that convergences are drastically slow and occur around 1 0 15 d in these cases not shown here at late times transmissivity t becomes the only source of uncertainty affecting model output in the context of first order variance estimation method in fact input parameters with a relatively lower value of η can be treated as deterministic rather than stochastic 4 conclusions and limitations this study is the first attempt to incorporate lagging theory into the mathematical model to describe pump induced drawdown in a wedge shaped confined aquifer the lagging theory mainly aims at improving darcy s law by introducing two parameters τ q and τ h to reflect the inertial force e g resulting from the flow due to higher pumping rate or in a larger flow channel and microstructural interaction e g caused by the water in the secondary pore like the dead end pores and very small pores on the hydraulic response i e drawdown and stream depletion rate this inclusion makes the model more flexible to depict the groundwater flow affected by these two effects similarly to the work studied by lin and yeh 2017 we found that an increase in τ q has the effect of increasing the drawdown value when τ h τ q the time drawdown curve shows an s shaped pattern because the water in the secondary pores recharges to the well particularly in the intermediate time on the other hand for τ h τ q the time drawdown curve shows a hump in the middle period due to the wave induced by inertia for τ q τ h the lagging effects are negligible moreover the values of the stream depletion rate are considered reasonable in the range of 0 to 100 i e sdr 0 1 however the results show that the total sdr value under the condition of τ q τ h will produce a value greater than 100 it seems that there are two main forcings to drive the stream water to the pumping well the pump induced stream flow and inertia induced stream flow the latter leads to the additional stream water recharges toward the pumping well the main limitation of this work is that the values of τ q and τ h are indeterministic due to the lack of studies on the lagging theory moreover the present solution constitutes the terms of summation and integral making the solution inapplicable to performing parameter estimation not to mention the data from the aquifer tests performed in the wedge shaped aquifer sandwiched by two streams thus we suggest that the lagging parameters can be determined by the lin and yeh 2017 model along with other aquifer properties such as t and s in such an area if the drawdown data are available note that the data portion at late times may be excluded to ensure the effect of the stream on the drawdown response to better determine the hydraulic parameters including τ h and τ s we provide a strategy for the parameter identification by following steps i collecting the time series of drawdown data from the observation wells due to well pumping with constant pumping rate ii removing the flattened portion of drawdown data results from the stream infiltration to eliminate the stream effect iii applying the lin and yeh 2017 solution to analyzing the drawdown data coupled with the optimization methods and iv determining the estimates of the hydraulic parameters i e t s τ h and τ q in general the present model serves as a preliminary screening tool for the management of water resources furthermore it can be a benchmark solution to verify

2650,pumping events are often conducted in the alluvial fan due to its considerable amount of water if pumping events occur in the nearby vicinity of the streams it will inevitably influence the complex microbial ecosystems in both the river and the aquifer induce the issue of water rights permits and affect the development of the water resource management therefore it becomes necessary to accurately predict groundwater flow as a result of pumping in the wedge shaped aquifer in this paper we propose an analytical solution to describe the drawdown distribution and the stream depletion rate sdr due to pumping in a wedge shaped aquifer which represents the shape of the alluvial fan bounded by two streams moreover we adopt the lagging theory into the model by introducing two lagging parameters in darcy s law to allow the water flow and the hydraulic gradient to occur at different times this measure facilitates the reflection of the inertial force because of a higher pumping rate and the microstructural interaction resulting from the water transfer between the primary pores and secondary pores e g dead end pores and very small pores it leads to the predicted result being closer to reality when these effects are profound we found that the drawdown and sdr curves will behave like waves when the flux lagging dominates the sdr value can be over unit due to the additional recharge driven by inertial force the drawdown and sdr acts more like an unconfined or dual porosity flow if storage lagging governs the system moreover lagging parameters have the largest effect on drawdown and sdr when the times are close to the corresponding values of lagging parameters the case of wedge shaped domain bounded by two impervious barriers is considered to further explore the boundary effects on aquifer response to pumping keywords lagging theory dual phase lag model aquifer pumping stream depletion rate analytical solution wedge shaped aquifer data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction in a natural geological structural setting pairs of randomly oriented streams can intersect to draw the lateral boundaries of wedge shaped aquifers see fig 1 a typical alluvial aquifer is usually bounded by streams in radial directions with different angles displaying a sector area of a circle mahdavi 2022 in general the alluvial fans in arid or semiarid areas play the role of groundwater reservoirs when the water in the stream gradually percolates downwards this often results in many decentralized pumping activities in such regions and it will cause issues not only in the water resources management but also in the adjudication of water rights moreover a great deal of pumping activity may occur in the alluvial fan in some countries that receive abundant rainfall but suffer regional precipitation with high spatiotemporal variability between the dry and wet seasons as in taiwan chen and chen 2003 therefore understanding the groundwater flow behavior due to pumping in the wedge shaped aquifer becomes a challenging issue for hydrologists many mathematical models have emerged to study the pump induced hydraulic response in the wedge shaped aquifer apart from those devoted to the image well method chan et al 1978 may be the first to solve the equations for the confined flow due to pumping in a wedge shaped aquifer by the integral transform method the pumping well was treated as a point source and they implemented finite fourier sine hankel and mellin transforms techniques to derive the drawdown solution to their model yeh and chang 2006 further extends the model of chan et al 1978 by considering the effects of a gentle slope and rolling topography on streams the similar integral methods mentioned in chan et al 1978 solved their flow equations with the aid of shanks method to accelerate the convergence rate of infinite summation terms later yeh et al 2008 not only concentrated on the drawdown distribution due to pumping in the wedge shaped aquifer also they studied the pump induced stream depletion volume and stream depletion rate problem through the chan et al 1978 solution after that plenty of mathematical models associated with pump induced groundwater flow have been developed in a wedge shaped aquifer with various configurations e g confined aquifer unconfined aquifer fractured aquifer or their combination sedghi et al 2009 2012 samani and sedghi 2015 sedghi and zhan 2018 2022 mahdavi and seyyedian 2014 mahdavi 2020 2021 2022 however the mathematical models mentioned above were developed on the basis of darcy s law implying that the specific flux is linearly proportional to the hydraulic gradient these models are valid when groundwater flow is laminar bear 2012 however difficulties arise when the flow velocity is moderately high due to a high pumping rate or flow in the large fracture inducing the inertial effect on the flow pascal 1986 löfqvist and rehbinder 1993 or microstructural interaction due to secondary pores e g dead end very small pores or in a fracture matrix system are abundant in the medium fatt 1959 bear and cheng 2010 these effects would result in additional head loss and recharge to the pumping well and models developed based on darcy s law will no longer be suitable for analyzing the hydraulic response under the foregoing conditions lin and yeh 2017 then lag theory was developed to cope with these two phenomena the concept is to add two time lags to the darcy law causing the specific flux and the hydraulic gradient to occur at different times two lagging parameters separately represent the effects of inertial force due to high flow speed and dead end pores due to structural interaction lin and yeh 2017 found that the lagging parameters correspond to the lumped hydraulic parameters in the dual porosity model barenblatt et al 1960 the difference between the two models is that the lagging model can reflect the inertial effect whereas the dual porosity model restricts itself from the properties of the secondary formation furthermore the lagging model has proven to be efficient in estimating the parameters of field tests in the madison aquifer in south dakota usa conducted by greene 1993 which consists of solutional openings and fracture rocks that can induce a profound inertial effect on the pumped flow however in the context of lagging theory to the best of authors knowledge there exists no mathematical model for pumping in a wedge shaped aquifer bounded by two streams in this study we aim to incorporate the lagging theory into the mathematical model for the pump induced confined flow in a wedge shaped aquifer the withdrawal of water from the aquifer is formulated by a point source which appends the dirac delta function to the governing equation the two streams or two impermeable barriers extend from the apex of the wedge shaped aquifer to the infinitely far location on the basis of lagging theory two lagging parameters are introduced in the model to reflect the joint effects of the inertial force as a result of the higher pumping rate and the microstructural interaction due to storage and release from secondary pores the governing equation is solved by the method of successive transformations combining the laplace the finite fourier sine and the hankel transform techniques without the lagging effects the present solution reduces to the existing model the impacts of lagging parameters on the drawdown distribution are investigated by changing their values moreover the sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are performed to assess the drawdown in response to the model parameters 2 methodology 2 1 mathematical model and analytical solution fig 2 shows the schematic diagram of the wedge shaped aquifer where the groundwater experiences the effects of the pumping well and two nearby streams the governing equation for confined flow in a wedge shaped aquifer can be expressed as 1 s h t q 0 r δ r r 0 δ θ θ 0 1 r r r q 1 r θ q where h is the hydraulic head l s is the storage coefficient t is the transmissivity l 2 t 1 q 0 is the pumping rate l 3 t 1 r 0 θ 0 is the spatial location of the pumping well and q is the specific flow according to darcy s law q is defined as 2 q t t h t on the basis of the lagging theory eq 2 can be expressed as 3 q t τ q t h t τ h where τ q and τ h are the flux lagging and storage lagging t the parameter τ q represents the time lag due to the inertial force resulting from the high velocity flow due to pumping or flow in a greater permeability formation on the other hand τ h is the time lag induced by the microstructural interaction such as dead end or very small pores when τ q τ h it means that the hydraulic gradient is the cause of the specific flux when τ q τ h it implies the specific flux that causes the hydraulic gradient note that τ q τ h indicates that the lagging effects are immaterial lin and yeh 2017 expanding eq 3 by the taylor series results in 4 j 0 τ q j j 1 t j 1 q t t j 0 τ h j j 1 t j 1 h t the first order approximation is adopted i e j 1 as follows 5 q t τ q q t t t h t τ h h t t combining eq 5 with 1 one can obtain the following result 6 1 τ q t s h t q 0 r δ r r 0 δ θ θ 0 t 1 τ h t 2 h r 2 1 r h r 1 r 2 2 h θ 2 according to the definition of drawdown s h 0 h l wherein h 0 is the initial hydraulic head l eq 6 can be recast as 7 1 τ q t s s t q 0 r δ r r 0 δ θ θ 0 t 1 τ h t 2 s r 2 1 r s r 1 r 2 2 s θ 2 prior to pumping the groundwater is assumed to be stationary therefore the initial conditions can be expressed as 8 s s t 0 t 0 the boundary conditions in the r direction are the following 9 r s r 0 r 0 2 2 physical meaning behind τ q and τ h lin and yeh 2017 first proposed a mathematical model for describing the pump induced leaky confined flow with incorporating the lagging theory the governing equations for describing the dual porosity flow in fracture and matrix can be respectively expressed as barenblatt et al 1960 10 s f s f t q 0 r δ r r 0 δ θ θ 0 β s f s m t 2 s f r 2 1 r s f r 1 r 2 2 s f θ 2 11 s m s m t β s f s m where the subscripts f and m denotes fracture and matrix respectively β is the first order water transfer rate coefficient t 1 and s f s m s rearranging eqs 10 and 11 the flow equation in terms of s f can be expressed as 12 s 1 s f s m β s t s f t q 0 r δ r r 0 δ θ θ 0 t 1 s m β t 2 s f r 2 1 r s f r 1 r 2 2 s f θ 2 comparing eqs 12 with 7 one can obtain the following relationships 13 τ q s m s f β s f s m 14 τ h s m β the dual porosity model assumed groundwater to flow in the fracture due to its high permeability and the matrix plays the role of water storage and release however one can conclude from 13 and 14 that s m s f β s f s m s m β implying that the effect of the secondary pore water always dominates the flow system however the main difference between the lagging and dual porosity models is that the lagging theory allows τ q to be greater than τ h to reflect the inertial effect on the hydraulic response therefore head loss due to inertia can be explained by the lagging flow model but failed by the dual porosity model it should be noted that τ q and τ h must be estimated as constant representative values of the aquifer in the work of lin and yeh 2017 the values of τ q and τ h corresponding to τ s in their study are constantly estimated from several pumping tests conducted in the madison aquifer in the western rapid city area south dakota greene 1993 the results of parameter estimation show the scale dependent properties that extending the observation distance would give higher estimates of τ h and τ q it implies that a longer distance could include many large fissures increasing the possibilities of occurrences of the inertial force due to high flow rate and structural interaction due to more water exchanging between two continua this fact also reflects in their estimates of t which display scale dependent properties in their analysis showing that the madison aquifer is highly heterogeneous it also implies that the estimates of τ q and τ h provided information similar to t if the storage lagging is neglected τ h 0 the flux lagging is identical to the inertial term as advocated by pascal 1986 for the flow equation in terms of pressure 15 τ q ρ 0 κ μ n where ρ 0 is the reference pressure ml 1t 2 κ is permeability l 2 μ is viscosity ml 1t 1 and n is the effective porosity given the pump induced time drawdown curve when storage lagging dominates i e τ h τ q the time drawdown curve will behave in an s shaped pattern such a pattern is similar to the time drawdown curve generated by the dual porosity or unconfined aquifer models on the other hand if the flux lagging governs the flow system τ q τ h the time drawdown pattern will reveal wavelike behavior due to inertia for forward modeling τ q and τ h are unknown thus these two lagging parameters should be determined by performing the aquifer tests and analyzing the data with a proper model such as the lag model for the pumping test lin and yeh 2017 in the study area to estimate these values in a way similar to the aquifer test that identifies t and s 2 3 stream stream wedge shaped aquifer the boundaries in the θ direction are subject to the zero drawdown condition i e constant head condition as shown in fig 2 that gives 16 s 0 θ 0 ϕ as a first step to derive the drawdown solution the laplace transform method eliminates t the transformed governing equation and associated boundary conditions take the form of 17 1 p τ q s p s q 0 p r δ r r 0 δ θ θ 0 t 1 τ h p 2 s r 2 1 r s r 1 r 2 2 s θ 2 18 r s r 0 r 0 19 s 0 θ 0 ϕ where s s r θ p ℒ s 0 e p t s r θ t d t stands for the drawdown in the laplace domain and p t 1 is the laplace parameter next the finite fourier sine transform eliminates the θ dependency converting the above expressions to 20 1 p τ q s p s q 0 p r δ r r 0 sin θ 0 ξ k t 1 τ h p d 2 s d r 2 1 r d s d r ξ k 2 r 2 s 21 r d s d r 0 r 0 where s denotes the drawdown in the fourier sine domain s s r ξ k p ℱ s s 0 ϕ sin ξ k θ s d θ with the fourier parameter ξ k defined as k π ϕ finally the hankel transform method removes the r dependency and the transformed equations become 22 1 τ q p s p s ˆ q 0 p j ξ k a r 0 sin θ 0 ξ k a 2 t s ˆ 1 τ h p where s ˆ represents the drawdown in the hankel domain s ˆ s ˆ a ξ k p ℋ ξ k s 0 j ξ k a r s r d r and a l 1 is the hankel parameter eq 22 can be rearranged as 23 s ˆ q 0 τ q p 1 sin ξ k θ 0 j ξ k a r 0 p s τ q p 2 a 2 t τ h s p a 2 t then the resulting drawdown can be converted back to physical space through the successive inversions of the laplace fourier and hankel transforms the laplace inverse s ˆ a ξ k t ℒ 1 s ˆ

sin ξ k θ s r ξ k t one obtains the drawdown in physical space 28 s 2 ϕ k 1 sin ξ k θ 0 s ˆ j ξ k a r a d a when the lagging effects are minor i e τ h τ q 0 eq 24 becomes 29 s ˆ q 0 1 e a 2 t t s sin

evaluated by means of the quadgk function which implements the high order global adaptive quadrature technique the absolute error tolerance is set to approximately 12 decimal places of accuracy by the observation eq 28 possesses a steady state solution and eq 25 simplifies to ω 2 γ when t this results in 30 s ˆ q 0 sin ξ k θ 0 j ξ k a r 0 a 2 t 2 4 barrier barrier wedge shaped aquifer natural hydrogeological settings reveal formation of alluvial fans that are bounded laterally by impervious barriers across which the condition of zero flux can be imposed as 31 1 r s θ 0 θ 0 ϕ the so called barrier barrier wedge can be treated by proceeding as before but now with fourier cosine transform s ℱ c s 0 ϕ cos ξ k θ s d θ to account for the boundary conditions eq 31 this may be achieved by replacing all sine functions in eqs 20 22 23 by respective cosine functions leading to the drawdown in the fourier cosine hankel space as follows 32 s ˆ q 0 2 a 2 t γ cos ξ k θ 0 j ξ k a r 0 ω all

34 s ℱ c 1 s 1 ϕ s r 0 t 2 ϕ k 1 cos ξ k θ s r ξ k t the drawdown can be expressed in a more compact form as 35 s 2 ϕ k 0 ϵ k cos ξ k θ 0 s ˆ j ξ k a r a d a where the factor ϵ k takes 1 2 if k 0 and 1 if k 0 2 5 infinite extent aquifer if the boundary effects in θ direction e g the stream or impermeable layer are negligible the proposed model can reduce to the case of pumping in an infinite extent aquifer the governing equation of the flow becomes 36 1 τ q t s s t q 0 2 π r δ r t 1 τ h t 2 s r 2 1 r s r with r measured from the well axis taking the laplace transform s s r p ℒ s

wellbore storage are ignored 2 6 stream depletion rate contributed from two streams near wedge shaped aquifer stream depletion rate sdr is defined as the ratio of volumetric flow rate of the streams to the pumping rate for the water resource management purposes sdr usually serves as a measure to characterize the water contribution from the streams induced by pumping typically the sdr can range from 0 to 1 0 100 if sdr 0 it implies that there is no pumped water recharged from the stream on the other hand if sdr 1 it means that the pumped water comes entirely from the stream moreover when the sdr value is between 0 and 1 it indicates that the pumped water comes partially from the stream and the rest of the water comes from the aquifer the sdr formulas for the streams at θ 0 and θ ϕ can be written as follows respectively 41 q r q 0 0 t q 0 1 r s θ θ 0 d r k 1 2 t ϕ 0 s ˆ a d a and 42 q l q 0 0 t q 0 1 r s θ θ ϕ d r k 1 2 t 1 k ϕ 0 s ˆ a d a where q r and q l are fluxes l 3 t 1 from the streams at θ 0 and θ ϕ respectively once the sdr value reaches 1 or 100 the pumped water is completely supplemented by the streams 2 7 sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to know how and when the aquifer parameters influence the aquifer drawdown performing a sensitivity analysis can facilitate the assessment of the impact of parameter sensitivity on the system output dell oca et al 2020 knabe et al 2021 kabala 2001 defined the normalized sensitivity coefficient as follows 43 x k p k o p k in which x k represents the normalized sensitivity of the output o i e s to the k th input aquifer parameter p k the forward finite difference approximates 43 as follows 44 x k p k o p k δ p k o p k δ p k where δ p k is often set to 1 0 3 p k note that a positive value of x means that a small increase in an aquifer parameter causes an increase in s in contrast negative x implies that a small increase in a parameter yields a decrease in s on the other hand the multivariate first order variance estimation method serves as a simple but reliable tool to perform the uncertainty analysis in hydrological studies tung and yen 2005 mahdavi 2022 based on the variance v ar the percentage contribution of uncertainty η k of the parameter p k is defined as 45 η k o p k 2 v ar p k v ar o the partial derivatives in 45 are known as sensitivity factors the variance v ar p k can be calculated by c k p k 2 where c k is the coefficient of variation set at 0 05 and p k is the mean of the k th parameter the variance v ar o is given by k o p k 2 v ar p k thence eq 45 can be expressed as 46 η k o p k 2 c k p k 2 k o p k 2 c k p k 2 a higher η k means that the k th parameter has a greater uncertainty while a lower η k represents that the parameter has a smaller uncertainty 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of τ q and τ h on the pump induced drawdown the flux lagging τ q and storage τ h are the key factors that influence the groundwater system the hypothetical aquifer assumes properties of t 10 m 2 d and s 1 1 0 4 fig 3 shows the time drawdown curves for the cases of τ h τ q 1 d 0 5 d 1 d 1 d and 1 d 1 5 d with ϕ 40 80 and 120 in the a stream stream and b barrier barrier wedge shaped aquifers moreover we plot the drawdown curves predicted by the drawdown solution of infinite extent aquifer as references dashed lines in each case the pumping well is situated at r 0 500 m and θ 0 3 ϕ 4 with a discharge rate of q 100 m 3 d the observation point is near the pumping well that is r θ 0 9 r 0 θ 0 note that the cases of τ h τ q 1 mean the lagging effects are negligible as can be observed in fig 3 a a greater ϕ has the effect of increasing the drawdown value it is because a larger ϕ implies that the distances between two streams and the pumping well become longer the water from the streams requires more time to recharge the pumping well however as fig 3 b indicates the increase in ϕ has the effect of decreasing the drawdown value this is attributed to the fact that in the barrier barrier wedge shaped aquifer the pumped water is mainly from aquifer storage therefore a greater ϕ means a larger aquifer region serving as a huge water reservoir in addition for the case of the stream stream aquifer after around t 9 d the drawdown curves for all cases reach steady state flattening patterns because all the pumped water is from the streams when τ q τ h the drawdown curves show slighter increases in the intermediate portion due to the recharge of the water in the secondary pore on the other hand when τ q τ h the drawdown curves show humps at intermediate times because the inertial force resists the water moving toward the pumping well momentarily leading to a higher drawdown value than in other cases such behaviors reflect the lagging effect and are consistent with the findings revealed by lin and yeh 2017 for the case of the barrier barrier aquifer the drawdown continues to increase over time because there are no water resources to recharge the pumping well the dashed lines representing the drawdown without the boundary effect merge with the curves for stream stream and barrier barrier aquifers at early times these curves start to depart from each other when the boundary effect influences the aquifer system in general pumping wells operate with intermittent discharge depending on water demand fig 4 illustrates the time drawdown curves for τ q 0 5 1 1 5 d with a fixed τ h value of 1 d and a fixed ϕ value of 40 as the pumping ceases at 0 5 d in the a stream stream and b barrier barrier wedge shaped aquifers the case of infinite extent aquifer is also included for the comparison the results are generated based on the superposition principle for the present solution as we have already discussed a greater τ q will result in a higher drawdown value when the well is still operating i e t 0 5 d after that time an increase in τ q yields a lower drawdown value finally all drawdown curves are steady at zero i e the initial drawdown s 0 as indicated in fig 4 a the curve for the case of τ q 1 5 d produces a negative value after t 0 5 d however it is certain that the inertia causes groundwater to suddenly pull back to the pumping well resulting in the recharge of large amounts of water to the well this is a classical phenomenon of the inertial wave and can be found in several studies related to the slug test performed in a fractured aquifer or near the water table kipp 1985 mcelwee and zenner 1998 malama et al 2011 liu et al 2020 lin and yeh 2022 in the modeling of the slug test the response to the water level induced by the instantaneous pulse of water in a high permeability formation exhibited an oscillatory behavior due to the effect of inertial force on the movement of the water in the test well butler 2019 apparently τ q in the lagging model exhibits an inertia related pattern when the pumping well is suddenly shut off be aware that as indicated in fig 4 b the inertial related wave behavior would not occur in the cases of a barrier barrier wedge shaped aquifer and an infinite extent aquifer because there is no stream water to supply the aquifer flow to oscillate the groundwater flow fig 5 shows the contour maps of drawdown in a stream stream wedge shaped aquifer at t 0 5 d for the cases of a τ h 1 d τ q 0 5 d b τ h 1 d τ q 1 d and c τ h 1 d τ q 1 5 d according to fig 3 the significant change in drawdown for different combinations of the lagging parameters is around 0 1 d therefore we set t 0 5 d to generate the contour maps as the figure indicates a higher τ q leads to higher spatial drawdown values the reason is the same as that discussed in fig 3 on the other hand fig 6 shows a plot similar to fig 5 but for the barrier barrier wedge shaped aquifer the drawdown also increases with τ q for the same reason the drawdown values shown in fig 6 are much higher than those of fig 5 this is because one is subject to the effect of the constant head condition imposed on the stream boundaries while the other one is subject to the no flux condition the former condition provides water to the pumping well but the latter does not overall the type of boundary condition can exert a significantly different effect on the drawdown distribution in the wedge shaped aquifer 3 2 effects of τ q and τ h on sdr sdr reflects the measure of how much pump induced water flows from the stream to the pumping well fig 7 shows the sdr curves for the two streams i e θ 0 and ϕ and the total sdr of both streams for different values of lagging parameter τ q the effect of the lagging on the drawdown is similar to its sdr counterpart that is a greater τ q would result in a higher sdr value the sdr value for the case of θ ϕ is higher than that of θ 0 because the pumping well is much closer to the stream at the angle of ϕ more notable are the total sdr curves for the cases of τ q 0 5 d and 1 d the total sdr of both streams will finally reach 100 that is the pumped water from the pumping well is all from the stream water however the total sdr for the case of τ q 1 5 d increases by 100 in the approximate interval of 0 2 d 5 d this is not to conclude that a nonphysical phenomenon occurs or rather some amount of stream water flowing to the well is not induced by the pumping but driven by inertia it may be seldom seen in practical observation because the inertial force may not exert such a significant effect as the figure shows however if the inertial force dominates the groundwater flow system the total sdr curve is likely to reach a value greater than 100 3 3 results of sensitivity and uncertainty analyses to evaluate the sensitivity curve we consider that the parameters have default values of t 2 m 2 d s 1 1 0 4 ϕ 120 q 0 100 m 3 d r 0 500 m and τ q τ h 1 d with the observation point at r θ 0 9 r 0 0 75 ϕ fig 8 illustrates the sensitivity coefficient curves of t s τ q and τ h in the a stream stream wedge shaped aquifer and b barrier barrier wedge shaped aquifer with the sensitivity curves predicted by infinite extent aquifer solution the results in fig 8 a show that t is the most sensitive parameter followed by s τ q and τ s two sensitivity curves of t and τ h match each other at the beginning i e before about 0 2 d or 4 8 h the parameters t and τ h have a similar effect on the response to the drawdown at the beginning of the process then both curves are separated the curves of t s and τ h are negative because increasing these values will result in a smaller drawdown for example a higher t means a higher water transfer rate in the aquifer a higher s represents more water stored in the pores that can be released and a higher τ h signifies a higher transfer rate between the primarily pores and the secondary pores however the match portion of the curves t and τ h is positive initially due to the effect of τ q exerting a wave effect on the other hand the τ h curve remains negative most of the time it is attributed to a larger τ h that recharge more water resulting in lower drawdown after 100 d all curves reach a flat plateau because the water from both streams starts to recharge the pumping well the sensitivity curves of τ h and τ q show the same pattern but with a different sign both lagging parameter curves reach the peak in a time of 1 d that is the default value assigned to τ q and τ h the maximal effect of the lagging parameter apparently in the period is correlated with the value assigned to it similar findings are also reported in lin and yeh 2017 and lin et al 2019 however fig 8 b exhibits the similar results with the curves shown in fig 8 a the main differences are that the sensitivity curves of t and s continue to decrease with elapsed time this is because of the effects of the no flux boundary in the θ direction other effects of the parameters show very close patterns to corresponding curves for the case of stream stream wedge shaped aquifer furthermore the sensitivity curves for the case of infinite extent aquifer also produce similar results as the other two cases but the curve of s levels out a constant value and the curve of t falls right down in short the sensitivity curves of the lagging parameters for three cases show a similar effect on the change in drawdown the curve of s may be insensitive for the case of stream stream aquifer due to the domination of the stream flow the parameter s shows a profound effect at late times for the case of barrier barrier aquifer because all the pumped water comes from the storage of the aquifer fig 9 shows the temporal distribution of η k for the same set of input parameters as in fig 8 it clarifies how and to what extent the stochastic nature of the input parameters p t s τ h τ q propagates through the model and disperses the model output i e drawdown s at the observation point at the earlier stage of pumping s appears to be the most uncertain parameter among the other three input parameters showing η s 100 before approximately 0 1 d where the sensitivity factors of τ h and τ q immediately vanish as fig 9 a indicates for stream stream wedge shaped aquifer even though var s var τ h and var τ q the magnitude of the sensitivity factor of s is comparatively large so that η s η τ h and η τ q at that instant of time the uncertainty curves η τ h and η τ q coincide and fall below the curve of t at each moment of time however the contribution of t to the overall uncertainty of drawdown gradually grows with time reaching η t 100 on the steady state plateau this is because the flow model loses dependence on s τ h and τ q as t in 28 overall a similar pattern of uncertainty curves can be observed for barrier barrier wedge shaped and infinite extent aquifers in fig 9 b except that convergences are drastically slow and occur around 1 0 15 d in these cases not shown here at late times transmissivity t becomes the only source of uncertainty affecting model output in the context of first order variance estimation method in fact input parameters with a relatively lower value of η can be treated as deterministic rather than stochastic 4 conclusions and limitations this study is the first attempt to incorporate lagging theory into the mathematical model to describe pump induced drawdown in a wedge shaped confined aquifer the lagging theory mainly aims at improving darcy s law by introducing two parameters τ q and τ h to reflect the inertial force e g resulting from the flow due to higher pumping rate or in a larger flow channel and microstructural interaction e g caused by the water in the secondary pore like the dead end pores and very small pores on the hydraulic response i e drawdown and stream depletion rate this inclusion makes the model more flexible to depict the groundwater flow affected by these two effects similarly to the work studied by lin and yeh 2017 we found that an increase in τ q has the effect of increasing the drawdown value when τ h τ q the time drawdown curve shows an s shaped pattern because the water in the secondary pores recharges to the well particularly in the intermediate time on the other hand for τ h τ q the time drawdown curve shows a hump in the middle period due to the wave induced by inertia for τ q τ h the lagging effects are negligible moreover the values of the stream depletion rate are considered reasonable in the range of 0 to 100 i e sdr 0 1 however the results show that the total sdr value under the condition of τ q τ h will produce a value greater than 100 it seems that there are two main forcings to drive the stream water to the pumping well the pump induced stream flow and inertia induced stream flow the latter leads to the additional stream water recharges toward the pumping well the main limitation of this work is that the values of τ q and τ h are indeterministic due to the lack of studies on the lagging theory moreover the present solution constitutes the terms of summation and integral making the solution inapplicable to performing parameter estimation not to mention the data from the aquifer tests performed in the wedge shaped aquifer sandwiched by two streams thus we suggest that the lagging parameters can be determined by the lin and yeh 2017 model along with other aquifer properties such as t and s in such an area if the drawdown data are available note that the data portion at late times may be excluded to ensure the effect of the stream on the drawdown response to better determine the hydraulic parameters including τ h and τ s we provide a strategy for the parameter identification by following steps i collecting the time series of drawdown data from the observation wells due to well pumping with constant pumping rate ii removing the flattened portion of drawdown data results from the stream infiltration to eliminate the stream effect iii applying the lin and yeh 2017 solution to analyzing the drawdown data coupled with the optimization methods and iv determining the estimates of the hydraulic parameters i e t s τ h and τ q in general the present model serves as a preliminary screening tool for the management of water resources furthermore it can be a benchmark solution to verify

2651,the hydrological characterization of the vadose zone remains a major challenge considering the spatiotemporal variability of its properties and the limitations associated with hydrological measurements techniques geophysical methods in particular the dc resistivity and ground penetrating radar can provide large scale images of hydrogeological structures and a non invasive assessment of the subsurface dynamic processes however these approaches rely on the accuracy of the petrophysical relationships connecting the geophysical parameters to hydrogeological ones where the site specific determination of the associated petrophysical parameters is considered crucial the first objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between the water content geological properties and geophysical attributes at the vadose zone of a vulnerable limestone aquifer the second objective aimed to obtain the archie s and complex refractive index model crim petrophysical parameters by using borehole electrical resistivity and cross hole ground penetrating radar data for this purpose we adopted a grid search inversion algorithm where the field geophysical data were integrated with water content profiles simulated by using hydrus 1d the vadose zone profile was divided into three layers and the inversion was carried out for the petrophysical parameters in each of the model layers the electrical resistivity and relative dielectric permittivity data showed a very good correspondence with the simulated and experimental water content distributions along the vadose zone profile the petrophysical parameters estimated by the inversion showed values that fall in the ranges reported in the literature similar values have been observed in the different model layers with slight differences that were attributed to the vertical heterogeneities associated with the alteration and fracturation features of the limestone vadose zone this study showed a very good correlation between geophysical hydrogeological and geological data and highlighted the presence of heterogeneities that can have profound effects on the vadose zone water dynamics keywords electrical resistivity ground penetrating radar archie complex refractive index model water content data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction improved understanding of water flow and transport processes in the vadose zone vz is crucial considering the critical role this compartment of the subsurface plays within the biosphere and in the transmission of water and contaminants from the surface to the groundwater contamination sources mainly originate in the vz where the transfer of contaminants is impacted by the medium heterogeneities e g fractures induced preferential flow and rapid infiltration and by interactions involving a complex interplay between coupled physical geochemical and microbial processes arora et al 2019 stephens 2019 nimmo 2005 therefore a better knowledge of the hydrogeological processes and water content distribution within the vz is essential to protect groundwater resources conventionally water content measurements were carried out by single point techniques such as time domain reflectometry tdr or neutron probes he et al 2021 isch et al 2019 skierucha et al 2012 evett 2008 verhoef et al 2006 evett 2003 advancements in these techniques e g multi tdr systems provided the possibility of time lapse water content monitoring and eventual preferential flow paths detection herkelrath et al 1991 however such measurements are intrusive limited to very shallow depths and provide restricted information at only a series of point locations these measurements are often not representative of the field scale spatial water content distribution robinson et al 2003 the difficulties involved in obtaining 2 d or 3 d hydrologic images by exploiting such sparse local data introduced geophysical methods as alternative ways of monitoring water content distribution and water fluxes within the vz binley et al 2015 vereecken et al 2006 rubin and hubbard 2005 geophysical methods have shown a great potential in providing large scale and high spatial resolution images of the subsurface hydrogeological processes binley et al 2015 binley et al 2010 several surface and cross borehole geophysical methods have been recently used for different hydrological applications these methods include the ground penetrating radar gpr dafflon et al 2011 lunt et al 2005 binley et al 2001 seismic techniques blazevic et al 2020 electrical resistivity er

vilhelmsen et al 2014 additionally geophysical methods have been recently used to characterize and quantify processes and interactions in the soil rhizosphere atmosphere agricultural ecosystem continuum garré et al 2021 in particular the gpr and er methods have been frequently used to investigate water flow dynamics and identify hydrodynamic parameters klotzsche et al 2019 2018 paz et al

porous media these methods can provide valuable information on water flow that can be used to parameterize and constrain hydrogeological models relative variations of water content distribution in vz profiles have been successfully estimated by gpr and er data these observations were used to monitor infiltration experiments and visualize flow patterns quantify petrophysical parameters characterize preferential flow pathways in fractured media de jong et al 2020 gance et al 2016 wehrer and slater 2015 klotzsche et al 2013 steelman and endres 2011 brunet et al 2010 cassiani et al 2009 looms et al 2008b linde et al 2006 kowalsky et al 2005 huisman et al 2003 binley et al 2002 hubbard et al 2001 and even assess the variations of the soil water content associated with root water uptake mary et al 2018 hagrey 2007 generally the water content estimates derived from gpr and er data showed high accuracy and a good reproducibility however geophysical methods cannot directly provide water content values this approach is dependent on the empirical relationships between the sensed physical parameters and the subsurface parameters of interest e g porosity and water saturation especially in complex heterogeneous mediums such as carbonate environments which are often characterized by a complex multiple porosity system consisting of matrix porosity and fissures vugs fractures and karst networks mallet et al 2022 aldana et al 2021 ammar and kamal 2017 mount and comas 2014 lucia 2007 difficulties arise in the need of time consuming and expensive laboratory calibration of the petrophysical relationships that are basically suitable only for homogeneous formations and influenced by properties such as the porosity and tortuosity patterns of the medium under study mohamed and hamada 2017 glover 2016 estimating parameters such as the water content and porosity from geophysical data by using documented literature values of petrophysical parameters can induce a lot of uncertainties in the absence of site specific calibration achieving an efficient determination of site specific petrophysical parameters is expected to reduce such uncertainties and can provide a large scale and time saving estimation of water content by avoiding destructive and time consuming hydrogeological measurements and laboratory calibrations the presented study is carried out within the framework of the observatory of transfers in the vadose zone o zns platform the general objective of the o zns platform is to investigate the water rock biosphere interactions and their associated mass and heat transfer processes in the vz this can provide a better understanding of the vz dynamics and coupled processes by providing physical biogeochemical and spatially resolved hydrodynamic parameters capable of characterizing water flow patterns and parameterizing transport models this study first investigates the relationship between geophysical attributes water content and geological heterogeneities at the vadose zone of a vulnerable limestone aquifer an inversion algorithm is then used to obtain the archie s and crim s petrophysical parameters by integrating borehole electrical resistivity and cross hole ground penetrating radar data with water content profiles simulated by hydrus 1d 2 study site 2 1 description this study was carried out at the o zns observatory located in

of an exceptional well having a depth of 20 m and a diameter of 4 m along with a number of instrumented boreholes and piezometers additionally the observatory will be equipped with innovative complementary environmental sensors such as fiber optic sensors e g distributed acoustic sensing distributed temperature sensing water content monitoring probes e g tdr and samplers these sensors can provide quantitative measurements relative to fluid and heat transfer processes within the vz during its exploitation which is planned for several decades the observatory will allow acquiring original and unique data on the mass water solutes organic and inorganic contaminants gases etc and heat induced by temperature gradients microbiological reactions etc transfer processes across the continuum soil vz capillary fringe aquifer for environmental issues and water management a detailed description of the observatory instrumentation setup can be found in abbar et al 2021 2 2 geology direct observations of undisturbed cores complemented with optical log imagery revealed significant vertical and lateral lithological heterogeneities within the vz units three main lithological units have been identified by the direct core observations fig 1 1 a first top soil unit having a thickness ranging between 0 9 and 1 8 m and a silt loam texture referred to as a hypereutric cambisol iuss

unit of hard limestone rock pithiviers limestone extending from a depth of around 7 m down to 20 m with a clear evolution of alteration fracturation and karstification with depth the water table had an average depth ranging between 16 5 m and 20 5 m over the last decade with observed historical variations ranging between 14 5 m and 22 5 m since 1966 isch et al 2022 3 methods 3 1 geophysical data acquisition the o zns infrastructure allows the combination of different geophysical methods and focuses on integrating borehole cross hole and surface geophysical techniques that are sensitive to transfer and flow processes in this section we present the acquisition protocols of the electrical resistivity tomography ert borehole er and cross hole gpr data used in this study 3 1 1 electrical resistivity a total of 8 ert profiles were acquired on the 18th of april 2019 by using a syscal pro 96 resistivity meter iris instruments france connected to a syscal switch pro 96 the profiles had 48 electrodes each with an inter profile spacing of 5 m fig 1 a 2 5 m electrodes spacing was chosen in order to ensure both an acceptable resolution and a maximum investigation depth of about 23 m the measurements were acquired in dipole dipole and wenner schlumberger configurations basic filtering steps have been conducted on the acquired ert profiles e g exterminating bad data points the profiles were then inverted by res2dinv loke and barker 1996 that uses a smoothness constrained gauss newton least squares inversion technique to obtain a 2d electrical resistivity model of the subsurface from the field apparent resistivity data griffiths and barker 1993 the result is a 2d smoothness constrained distribution of electrical resistivity in the vz the effect of temperature variations was considered negligible on the electrical resistivity data along the first 20 m of the subsurface this was assumed due to the observed low variations of temperature as a function of depth in the vz at this time of the year on the other hand the er borehole data were obtained from three different boreholes logs b1 b2 and b3 cf fig 1 on the 23rd of march 2017 by means of the dual induction laterolog dil method this method consists of focused electrical measurements that rely on transmitter and receiver coils the measurements are based on an alternating current that generate eddy currents which in turn produce a secondary electromagnetic field the latter induces an alternating voltage proportional to the formation electrical conductivity in the receiver coil the transmitter receiver pair which uses a low frequency is designed to minimize the effects of the borehole and optimize the depth of investigation and the measurement vertical resolution a measurement point spacing of 2 cm was used with a maximum penetration depth varying between 18 m and 19 m depending on each of the borehole s maximum accessible depth 3 1 2 ground penetrating radar the cross hole gpr measurements were acquired by using a proex gpr system malå geosciences on the 24th of january 2019 the measurements were done by using 100 mhz borehole antennae with a sampling frequency of 1000 mhz and a measurement period of 240 ns zero offset profiles zop were acquired between the three boreholes b1 b2 and b3 txb2 rxb1 txb1 rxb3 and txb2 rxb3 fig 1 the zop method is a commonly used approach for borehole gpr acquisition surveys klotzsche et al 2019 throughout the zop measurements the transmitting tx and receiving rx antennas are moved simultaneously in two different boreholes with a fixed step size to conduct the zop measurements the antenna were first pushed to the bottom of each of the boreholes where the maximum accessible depth was 18 98 m water table the antennae were then pulled simultaneously towards the surface by using a 0 5 m fixed step size one dimensional velocity profiles were then determined by a standard ray based analysis approach for simplicity the medium was assumed to have no horizontal variation of velocity while obtaining the one dimensional velocity profiles after picking the first arrivals in reflexw the arrival time t and the distance between the boreholes were used to determine the gpr electromagnetic wave velocity v through the following equation 1 v d t t 0 where t 0 is the time zero offset which was obtained by conducting multi offset measurements with the antenna in free space in low loss and non magnetic material such as carbonate formations e g limestone the relative dielectric permittivity ε r can be then determined at different depths by using the following equation 2 ε r c v 2 where c is the velocity of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum 0 3 m ns relative dielectric permittivity profiles were then determined from the obtained velocity profiles by using eq 2 3 2 hydraulic properties measurements and simulation of water flow within the vz 3 2 1 hydraulic properties of the vadose zone samples fifteen undisturbed samples representative of the vz 0 20 m deep were chosen according to the lithological observations made from the three cored boreholes b1 b2 and b3 isch et al 2022 the samples included three soil samples sa sb and sc four soft sediments and powdery limestone samples pa pb pc and pd two calcareous sand samples ia and ib and six limestone rock samples ra rb rc rd re and rf these samples were used to estimate the water retention θ h and hydraulic conductivity k h curves by applying the multistep outflow method aldana et al 2021 the multistep outflow experiments were conducted by using a triaxial system based on the experimental procedure described by eching et al 1994 the hydraulic conductivity was calculated from the outflow data based on the method described by gardner 1956 3 2 2 simulation of water flow in the vadose zone simulation of water flow within the vz was then performed over a 55 years period 1966 2020 on a 23 m deep vz profile borehole b2 composed of fifteen layers and reconstituted with the hydrus 1d software šimůnek et al 2016 the simulation of water flow was based on the one dimensional vertical water flow in the vz described by richards equation richards 1931 3 θ t z k h z 1 s where θ is the volumetric water content cm3 cm3 z is the coordinate along the vertical axis cm t is the time h is the matric head cm k is the hydraulic conductivity cm d and s is a sink source term the mualem van genuchten analytical model mvg was used for the description of the vz hydraulic properties the van genuchten s expression van genuchten 1980 was used to describe the water retention curve θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 4 w i t h m 1 1 n n 1 where θ r and θ s are the residual and saturated volumetric water content cm3 cm3 respectively α is an empirical parameter related to the matric head cm 1 and n is a pore size distribution parameter the statistical pore connection model of mualem 1976 was then used to predict the hydraulic conductivity from the water retention curve k h k s s e l 1 1

1976 the measured water retention and hydraulic conductivity data were fitted to the θ h and k h curves with the mvg model eqs 4 and 5 by using the retc software van genuchten et al 1991 to infer the vz hydraulic properties used in our simulations the representation of the vz profile for b2 the values of experimental and fitted with retc saturated volumetric water content θs and fitted hydraulic conductivity ks in cm d are given in table 1 water table level and meteorological data were collected from monitoring stations located at the villages of poiseaux 4 km from the study site and bricy 20 km from the study site respectively while the weather conditions at the study site may differ slightly during intense and localized rainy events relative to those observed at the bricy station these are however considered to be representative over a period of more than 50 years 4 petrophysical modeling 4 1 relative permittivity the crim is a three phase dielectric mixing model commonly used to describe the relationship between relative dielectric permittivity and subsurface properties such as water content and porosity huisman et al 2003 west et al 2001 roth et al 1990 6 ε r α ϕ s w ε w α 1 ϕ ε s α ϕ 1 s w ε a α where ϕ and s w are the porosity and water saturation respectively ε a is the relative dielectric permittivity of air given a value of 1 ε w is the relative dielectric permittivity of water ε s is the relative dielectric permittivity of the solid phase considered as a source of uncertainty to be accounted for when using the crim besides the ε s the second source of uncertainty to be accounted for is the factor α which describes the orientation of the electrical field with respect to the geological formations geometry west et al 2003 chan and knight 1999 knoll 1996 roth et al 1990 birchak et al 1974 4 2 electrical resistivity in geological formations characterized by medium to coarse grained sediments the grain surface conductivity effect can be neglected and the bulk electrical resistivity ρ 0 can be related to subsurface properties such as porosity and fluid saturation by the following modified form of archie s equation winsauer et al 1952 archie 1942 7 ρ 0 a ρ f ϕ m s w n where ρ f is the fluid or pore water electrical resistivity a is an empirical constant originally referred to as the tortuosity or lithology constant winsauer et al 1952 m is the cementation exponent which is considered to be influenced by the degree of cementation of the rock fabric glover 2010 2009 and n is the saturation exponent which is independent of the rock matrix and describes how the pore water is connected glover 2017 looms et al 2008a hendrickx et al 2002 even though archie s law does not take the surface conduction into account it is considered to be applicable if the pore fluid conductivity is largely greater than the surface conduction especially in the case of low clay content formations such as the limestone rock described within the vz of our study site fig 1 the need of including the surface conductivity arises when other conducting phases such as clay minerals are present in the rock formation therefore during this study we applied our approach to the limestone rock facies located at a depth between 6 61 m and 19 m where geological and mineralogical studies aldana et al 2021 suggested that the surface conduction can be practically neglected 4 3 inversion this study aims to estimate the archie s and crim s parameters that can vary according to the study site conditions and that are considered as sources of uncertainties in the application of these models for the estimation of water content variations the numerical approach used in this study is based on a grid search inversion algorithm fig 2 the inversion workflow is based on testing the possible combinations of the petrophysical parameters that can provide the best fit between the measured and simulated data the estimated data are the electrical resistivity and relative dielectric permittivity values calculated by using the archie s and crim s equations respectively the er measured data are the 1d electrical resistivity data acquired by the borehole s er measurements while the dielectric permittivity measured data are those generated from the 1d velocity profiles obtained from the gpr cross hole measurements the fit between the measured and calculated data is evaluated through calculating the corresponding root mean square error rmse while the algorithm varies the archie s a and m and crim s α and ε s petrophysical parameters to be estimated 8 r m s e i 1 n x i x i 2 n where x i represents the observed data x i represents the data estimated by the model and n is the total number of data points the procedure is done separately for the archie s and crim s models the water content profiles data used to calculate the dielectric permittivity and electrical resistivity in the crim s and archie s equation are those simulated by hydrus 1d software the geophysical data water content and porosity data used for both models are obtained from the geophysical measurements and hydrogeological model of borehole b2 the fluid resistivity in the archie s equation is given a value of 510 µs cm obtained from probes and calibrated by laboratory measurements while the relative dielectric permittivity of water is assumed to be 79 5 at a temperature of 22 0 c buchner et al 1999 the model was divided into three layers and the inversion was carried out for each of the layers separately this step was done to investigate the effect of geological vertical heterogeneities on the obtained petrophysical parameters the model discretization and layering were designed according to the geological characteristics and hydrogeological simulations results see section 5 3 1 the results analysis is based on obtaining the combined values of the varied archie a and m and crim parameters α and ε s that have the minimal observed rmse while the algorithm fits the calculated and the measured data the ranges of variability set for each of the parameters during the inversion were based on common ranges provided in literature for limestone formations however the parameters were set to also have values outside these ranges to avoid directing the inversion towards literature values and to compare our results with those reported in previous studies table 2 shows the ranges of the archie and crim parameters used for this inversion and those most commonly reported in the literature for limestone formations to improve the inversion performance and reduce the different parameters dependencies the saturation exponent n was fixed to a value of 2 and the calculation was done only for the a and m parameters in the archie equation even though values ranging between 1 4 and 2 5 have been previously given to n in the literature for rocks e g schön 2004 sweeney and jennings 1960 rust 1952 in practice the saturation exponent is commonly set to 2 for most types of rocks in the absence of laboratory measurements e g yaramanci 2000 looms et al 2008a b on the other hand α was given a range based on its extreme values which are 1 and 1 the lower boundary 1 represents the harmonic arrangement of dielectric components in series while its upper boundary 1 represents the arithmetic arrangement of dielectric components in parallel chan and knight 2001 1999 5 results and discussion 5 1 geology knowing that a strong coherence was observed between the ert and borehole er profiles throughout this work the ert profiles are only used for the lithological description and 2 d representation while the borehole er data will be used for the water content analysis and as an input in the inversion for its higher resolution 2 cm and larger number of data points in correspondence with the geological description the ert profile p2 in fig 1 showed three main layers corresponding to the three main geological units shown in fig 1 fig 3 the data showed a first low er unit representing the top soil layer the latter is followed by a moderate er layer down to a depth of around 7 m this layer corresponds to the incoherent and altered limestone formation lateral er variations fig 3 and dispersed dielectric permittivity values fig 4 b were observed in this layer which reflects the heterogeneity of this formation a clear transition zone between the incoherent limestone layer and the underlaying hard limestone rock layer is evident in the relative permittivity and er data at depths between 6 5 m and 9 m this is followed by a third relatively higher er layer corresponding to the massive limestone rock layer this layer shows lower dielectric permittivity values which started to increase again as the measurements got closer to the water table level fig 4b 5 2 hydrogeology as shown in fig 5 the simulated water content profile obtained by the model for borehole b2 23 03 2017 showed a good agreement with experimental water content r2 0 885 measured at the same date this model which focused on the simulation of the water movement within the matrix components of the vz seemed to constitute a first simplified but suitable approach for the unidimensional simulation of water flow within the vz of the beauce limestone aquifer the borehole er data 23 03 2017 showed a good global correspondence with the simulated water content distribution at the same date fig 6 a this correspondence is characterized with a global increase in the er values along with the global decrease in the water content this was followed by a decrease in the er values with the increase in the water content close to the water table level similarly the relative permittivity data showed a good correspondence with the water content variations fig 6b a significant coherent decrease in the relative permittivity and water content was observed at a depth between 6 5 m and 9 m located at the transition zone between the incoherent limestone and the hard limestone formations this was followed by a significant increase in the relative dielectric permittivity values along with the increase in water content close to the water table level the water content profiles simulated for the dates of the er fig 6a and gpr fig 6b data showed similar values with slight but noticeable differences in the top 6 m and at a depth between 17 m and 19 m this was expected knowing that these profiles were simulated for two close periods of the year 23rd of march and 24th of january a similar pattern was observed in the three boreholes er data and in the three dielectric permittivity profiles which shows a good repeatability of the field geophysical data this observation also indicates that the zones around and between the boreholes are globally and relatively homogeneous despite the presence of local lateral heterogeneities that were observed in each of the geophysical profiles 5 3 determination of petrophysical parameters to determine the archie a and m and crim α and ε s petrophysical parameters the measured er and relative permittivity data and the simulated water content distributions were used in the inversion algorithm described in section 4 3 5 3 1 model structure as explained previously in section 4 2 the calculation was done for the part of the vz located at a depth between 6 61 m and 19 m where the well cemented microcrystalline texture of the hard limestone rock along with its very low amount of fine grained material aldana et al 2021 permits the neglection of the grains surface conductivity therefore the inversion model was applied on the geological unit number 3 table 1 which was divided into three sub layers according to lithological description the hydrogeological model discretization and the water content variations layer 1 is located at the top of the unit at a depth between 6 61 m and 9 00 m this layer which is considered as the transition zone between the incoherent limestone pd and the massive rock rb materials table 1 showed simulated water content variations ranging between 0 147 and 0 151 cm3 cm3 fig 5 layer 2 is located at a depth ranging between 9 01 m and 14 00 m and is characterized by a limestone rock showing few fissures and slight alterations rd with intercalations of massive limestone rock banks rc mallet et al 2022 which presented a very low porosity table 1 layer 2 showed a simulated water content variation ranging between 0 050 and 0 095 cm3 cm3 layer 3 corresponds to the altered limestone rock that showed a highly heterogeneous structure characterized by an increased evolution towards fracturation and karstification with depth layer 3 is located at a depth ranging between 14 01 m and 19 m and showed the highest water content variation with values ranging between 0 078 and 0 145 cm3 cm3 the simulated water content values described here are those obtained for the er measurements date 23 03 2017 while similar value ranges were also obtained for those of the gpr measurements date 24 01 2019 the inversion was carried out for each of the model s layers separately in order to investigate the effects of vertical heterogeneities on the obtained parameters this gives us a total of 6 inversions 3 for the crim and 3 for the archie s model 5 3 2 inversion results the inversion results of the archie s parameters showed a value of 1 60 for the cementation exponent m in layers 1 and 2 and a value of 1 47 in layer 3 table 3 one can look at the cementation exponent as a measure of connectedness of the pore network which decreases as the m exponent increases glover 2017 most sediments or sedimentary rock consisting partially or completely of sand sized fragments have cementation exponents ranging between 1 5 and 2 5 glover et al 1997 while lower connectedness and vuggy limestone formations are expected to be represented by higher m values a wide range of values have been reported in the literature for limestone formations worthington 1993 values ranging between 1 6 and 2 4 have been reported for carbonates schön 2004 carothers 1968 hill and milburn 1956 while it was also suggested that they can also have higher values ranging between 2 5 and 5 due to their poorly connected pore space tiab and donaldson 2004 however knowing that connectedness is a term which also describes the extent to which transport pathways are available low porosity rocks characterized by relatively direct flow paths due to a well developed fracture network could have lower values or values close to unity reflecting a fairly good connectedness provided by the fractures network therefore the relatively low values obtained in our study could be related to a well developed fracture network which is thought to be present in the study site but not fully characterized yet even though we used a simple porosity model that doesn t take fractures network into account in the porosity parameter the relative effect of the fracturation could be reflected in the field resistivity data that have a major influence on the obtained m value during the inversion layer 3 which showed a lower m value 1 47 relative to layers 1 and 2 has a highly heterogeneous structure characterized by increased alteration fracturation and karstification features relative to the other layers which might explain the relative decrease of m in this layer indeed complex structural formations have been observed in the limestone vz at the o zns site fig 7 where fissures fractures and karst networks were observed at the field scale aldana et al 2021 for example millimetric vugs induced by dissolution processes have been observed in the weathered rock formations located at the water table fluctuation zone and corresponding to layer 3 further dissolution episodes could have increased the vugs diameters and enhanced the permeability at this layer as it is evident in the archie s equation eq 7 the higher is the cementation exponent the higher is the sensitivity of the electrical resistivity values to changes in porosity ellis and singer 2007 the relatively similar m values that were obtained in the three layers indicate a similar sensitivity of the electrical resistivity values to the slight differences in porosity observed in the different layers the inversion results showed a value of 0 8 for the parameter a in layer 1 while it showed a value of 0 7 and 0 6 in layers 2 and 3 respectively table 3 even though no real correlation was found between this parameter and tortuosity or lithology a is an empirical constant which is believed to have a role in the compensation for systematic errors in the porosity electrical resistivity or pore fluid resistivity measurements glover 2016 2015 this empirical factor which appeared in the winsauer et al 1952 modification of the archie s first law usually provided improved fits with experimental data especially when dealing with low quality and sparse types of datasets it is commonly assumed that the size of a is a measure of the extent to which an overall systematic error is present in the measurements recent research suggested that these errors produce non unity values of a while the closer this parameter is to unity the better is the data quality additionally a has an important role in the calculation of a more accurate m value since it compensates for the experimental errors present in the parameters used to calculate m during the fitting procedure glover 2016 throughout the inversion a takes the appropriate fitted value to compensate for the presence of systematic errors and reduce their effects on the obtained m value therefore the value of a obtained from the fit can be considered as an empirical parameter that describes the accuracy of the measured data in the archie equation the observed decreasing behavior value of a from 0 8 in layer 1 to 0 6 in layer 3 could be attributed to the increase in the measurements errors associated with the evolution of alteration fracturation and karstification with depth this phenomenon can increase the medium heterogeneities and produce errors in the field measurements which the fitted value of a compensated for during the inversion even though a was not shown to have an underlying physical meaning few studies suggested a values ranging between 0 4 and 2 3 in the case of limestone formations timur et al 1972 porter and carothers 1970 carothers 1968 in accordance with our inversion results the most recent studies reported values of a ranging between 0 2 and 1 8 for limestone formations glover 2016 2015 the inversion of the crim showed a ε s value of 7 99 in layer 1 7 97 in layer 2 and 8 00 in layer 3 table 4 ε s is mainly influenced by the mineralogy and rock formation characteristics therefore similar values were expected to be observed in the three layers knowing that they are all considered as part of the limestone rock main geological unit table 1 however the slight differences in the ε s values observed in the three layers can be attributed to the differences in the geological characteristics of the layers in terms of materials heterogeneity and degree of alteration which evolved with depth nevertheless these slight differences as small as they are could also be simply induced by the mathematical procedure of the inversion in accordance with our results values ranging between 4 and 13 have been reported in the literature for the solid phase dielectric permittivity of limestone formations which is considered as one of the main sources of uncertainties in the electromagnetic waves application of the crim model mount and comas 2014 reynolds 2011 cassidy 2009 the inversion of the crim showed an α value of 0 50 in layer 1 0 58 in layer 2 and 0 61 in layer 3 table 4 values ranging between 1 and 1 were reported for α over the last few decades which is a geometrical factor connecting the effective layering direction of the components to the applied electric field direction west et al 2003 knoll 1996 roth et al 1990 several gpr studies indicated that most geological facies can take an α value of 0 5 west et al 2003 knoll 1996 values ranging between 0 46 and 0 65 have been previously obtained during laboratory measurements mount and comas 2014 moysey and knight 2004 this approach was shown to produce acceptable results reflected in a very good fit between the measured and calculated data in the three layers and with values that generally fall in the ranges reported in previous studies the degree of accuracy of this approach is defined by the resolution of the hydrogeological model and its capability in capturing the vz water content variations the water content distribution is strongly influenced by the extent of heterogeneities incorporated in the hydrogeological model and in the porosity parameter of the empirical relationships especially in limestone formations with complex porosity patterns characterizing the impact of the observed fissures and fractures networks on the water flow at the field scale of the o zns vz is indeed crucial therefore our future work is focused on the development of a precise description of the water flow through the whole porosity of this highly heterogeneous vz by combining 3d experimental observations and numerical simulations with dual porosity or dual permeability approaches this will form the basis to incorporate the complex multiple porosity patterns in the petrophysical relationships in order to provide an improved estimation of petrophysical parameters the geological heterogeneities encountered at different study sites might explain the wide range of values reported in the literature for the archie s and crim s parameters especially in carbonate geology environments which are complex mediums that can develop different porosity patterns fractures networks and flow paths 6 conclusion this study attempted to investigate the relationship between geophysical properties and water content distribution and determine the archie s and crim s petrophysical parameters by integrating er and dielectric permittivity data with simulated water content data at the scale of a highly heterogeneous limestone vz the simulated and experimental hydrogeological data displayed a very good correspondence with the geophysical data reflected in coherent variations in water content er and relativity permittivity these observations showed a significant sensibility of geophysical methods to water content variations and demonstrated the potential of these methods in investigating hydrogeological processes at our study site the inversion results of the archie model showed values ranging between 0 6 and 0 8 for a and between 1 47 and 1 60 for m on the other hand the inversion results of the crim showed values ranging between 0 50 and 0 61 for α and between 7 97 and 8 00 for ε s similar results were obtained in the three model layers with slight differences that were attributed to the vertical heterogeneities of the limestone rock formation e g degree of alteration fracturation karstification this observation demonstrates the sensitivity of petrophysical parameters to vertical geological heterogeneities that should be taken into account when calculating these parameters given the ranges of variability used in the inversion the obtained values are within the bounds of values found in the literature where a wide range have been reported for carbonate formations due to their complex geological features that might vary greatly among different study sites throughout this study the petrophysical parameters were successfully obtained with a very good fit between the measured and simulated data however the demonstrated approach showed an important sensitivity to the resolution of water content variations captured by the used hydrogeological model and to the geological heterogeneities of the medium therefore the perspectives include further improvements to this approach by conducting extensive studies at larger scales and combining 3d experimental observations and numerical simulations using dual porosity and dual permeability modeling approaches that can capture the water content and geological heterogeneities at a higher resolution in complex and fractured limestone formations in this context our future work is focused on the development of a geological model constrained by laboratory calibrations that can give a better estimation of the limestone complex porosity patterns to be incorporated in the hydrogeological model and empirical relationships credit authorship contribution statement m abbas writing original draft writing review editing conceptualization visualization

2651,the hydrological characterization of the vadose zone remains a major challenge considering the spatiotemporal variability of its properties and the limitations associated with hydrological measurements techniques geophysical methods in particular the dc resistivity and ground penetrating radar can provide large scale images of hydrogeological structures and a non invasive assessment of the subsurface dynamic processes however these approaches rely on the accuracy of the petrophysical relationships connecting the geophysical parameters to hydrogeological ones where the site specific determination of the associated petrophysical parameters is considered crucial the first objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between the water content geological properties and geophysical attributes at the vadose zone of a vulnerable limestone aquifer the second objective aimed to obtain the archie s and complex refractive index model crim petrophysical parameters by using borehole electrical resistivity and cross hole ground penetrating radar data for this purpose we adopted a grid search inversion algorithm where the field geophysical data were integrated with water content profiles simulated by using hydrus 1d the vadose zone profile was divided into three layers and the inversion was carried out for the petrophysical parameters in each of the model layers the electrical resistivity and relative dielectric permittivity data showed a very good correspondence with the simulated and experimental water content distributions along the vadose zone profile the petrophysical parameters estimated by the inversion showed values that fall in the ranges reported in the literature similar values have been observed in the different model layers with slight differences that were attributed to the vertical heterogeneities associated with the alteration and fracturation features of the limestone vadose zone this study showed a very good correlation between geophysical hydrogeological and geological data and highlighted the presence of heterogeneities that can have profound effects on the vadose zone water dynamics keywords electrical resistivity ground penetrating radar archie complex refractive index model water content data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction improved understanding of water flow and transport processes in the vadose zone vz is crucial considering the critical role this compartment of the subsurface plays within the biosphere and in the transmission of water and contaminants from the surface to the groundwater contamination sources mainly originate in the vz where the transfer of contaminants is impacted by the medium heterogeneities e g fractures induced preferential flow and rapid infiltration and by interactions involving a complex interplay between coupled physical geochemical and microbial processes arora et al 2019 stephens 2019 nimmo 2005 therefore a better knowledge of the hydrogeological processes and water content distribution within the vz is essential to protect groundwater resources conventionally water content measurements were carried out by single point techniques such as time domain reflectometry tdr or neutron probes he et al 2021 isch et al 2019 skierucha et al 2012 evett 2008 verhoef et al 2006 evett 2003 advancements in these techniques e g multi tdr systems provided the possibility of time lapse water content monitoring and eventual preferential flow paths detection herkelrath et al 1991 however such measurements are intrusive limited to very shallow depths and provide restricted information at only a series of point locations these measurements are often not representative of the field scale spatial water content distribution robinson et al 2003 the difficulties involved in obtaining 2 d or 3 d hydrologic images by exploiting such sparse local data introduced geophysical methods as alternative ways of monitoring water content distribution and water fluxes within the vz binley et al 2015 vereecken et al 2006 rubin and hubbard 2005 geophysical methods have shown a great potential in providing large scale and high spatial resolution images of the subsurface hydrogeological processes binley et al 2015 binley et al 2010 several surface and cross borehole geophysical methods have been recently used for different hydrological applications these methods include the ground penetrating radar gpr dafflon et al 2011 lunt et al 2005 binley et al 2001 seismic techniques blazevic et al 2020 electrical resistivity er

vilhelmsen et al 2014 additionally geophysical methods have been recently used to characterize and quantify processes and interactions in the soil rhizosphere atmosphere agricultural ecosystem

porous media these methods can provide valuable information on water flow that can be used to parameterize and constrain hydrogeological models relative variations of water content distribution in vz profiles have been successfully estimated by gpr and er data these observations were used to monitor infiltration experiments and visualize flow patterns quantify petrophysical parameters characterize preferential flow pathways in fractured media de jong et al 2020 gance et al 2016 wehrer and slater 2015 klotzsche et al 2013 steelman and endres 2011 brunet et al 2010 cassiani et al 2009 looms et al 2008b linde et al 2006 kowalsky et al 2005 huisman et al 2003 binley et al 2002 hubbard et al 2001 and even assess the variations of the soil water content associated with root water uptake mary et al 2018 hagrey 2007 generally the water content estimates derived from gpr and er data showed high accuracy and a good reproducibility however geophysical methods cannot directly provide water content values this approach is dependent on the empirical relationships between the sensed physical parameters and the subsurface parameters of interest e g porosity and water saturation especially in complex heterogeneous mediums such as carbonate environments which are often characterized by a complex multiple porosity system consisting of matrix porosity and fissures vugs fractures and karst networks mallet et al 2022 aldana et al 2021 ammar and kamal 2017 mount and comas 2014 lucia 2007 difficulties arise in the need of time consuming and expensive laboratory calibration of the petrophysical relationships that are basically suitable only for homogeneous formations and influenced by properties such as the porosity and tortuosity patterns of the medium under study mohamed and hamada 2017 glover 2016 estimating parameters such as the water content and porosity from geophysical data by using documented literature values of petrophysical parameters can induce a lot of uncertainties in the absence of site specific calibration achieving an efficient determination of site specific petrophysical parameters is expected to reduce such uncertainties and can provide a large scale and time saving estimation of water content by avoiding destructive and time consuming hydrogeological measurements and laboratory calibrations the presented study is carried out within the framework of the observatory of transfers in the vadose zone o zns platform the general objective of the o zns platform is to investigate the water rock biosphere interactions and their associated mass and heat transfer processes in the vz this can provide a better understanding of the vz dynamics and coupled processes by providing physical biogeochemical and spatially resolved hydrodynamic parameters capable of characterizing water flow patterns and parameterizing transport models this study first investigates the relationship between geophysical attributes water content and geological heterogeneities at the vadose zone of a vulnerable limestone aquifer an inversion algorithm is then used to obtain the archie s and crim s petrophysical parameters by integrating borehole electrical resistivity and cross hole ground penetrating radar data with water content profiles simulated by hydrus 1d 2 study site 2 1 description this study was carried out at the o zns observatory located in the vicinity of the beauce limestone aquifer at an agricultural site in villamblain france fig 1 dms coordinates x 48 1 5 131 y 1 34 55 333 the observatory offers a unique experimental setup composed of an exceptional well having a depth of 20 m and a diameter of 4 m along with a number of instrumented boreholes and piezometers additionally the observatory will be equipped with innovative complementary environmental sensors such as fiber optic sensors e g distributed acoustic sensing distributed temperature sensing water content monitoring probes e g tdr and samplers these sensors can provide quantitative measurements relative to fluid and heat transfer processes within the vz during its exploitation which is planned for several decades the observatory will allow acquiring original

soil vz capillary fringe aquifer for environmental issues and water management a detailed description of the observatory instrumentation setup can be found in abbar et al 2021 2 2 geology direct observations of undisturbed cores complemented with optical log imagery revealed significant vertical and lateral lithological heterogeneities within the vz units three main lithological units have been identified by the direct core observations fig 1 1 a first top soil unit having a thickness ranging between 0 9 and 1 8 m and a silt loam texture referred to as a hypereutric cambisol iuss

unit of hard limestone rock pithiviers limestone extending from a depth of around 7 m down to 20 m with a clear evolution of alteration fracturation and karstification with depth the water table had an average depth ranging between 16 5 m and 20 5 m over the last decade with observed historical variations ranging between 14 5 m and 22 5 m since 1966 isch et al 2022 3 methods 3 1 geophysical data acquisition the o zns infrastructure allows the combination of different geophysical methods and focuses on integrating borehole cross hole and surface geophysical techniques that are sensitive to transfer and flow processes in this section we present the acquisition protocols of the electrical resistivity tomography ert borehole er and cross hole gpr data used in this study 3 1 1 electrical resistivity a total of 8 ert profiles were acquired on the 18th of april 2019 by using a syscal pro 96 resistivity meter iris instruments france connected to a syscal switch pro 96 the profiles had 48 electrodes each with an inter profile spacing of 5 m fig 1 a 2 5 m electrodes spacing was chosen in order to ensure both an acceptable resolution and a maximum investigation depth of about 23 m the measurements were acquired in dipole dipole and wenner schlumberger configurations basic filtering steps have been conducted on the acquired ert profiles e g exterminating bad data points the profiles were then inverted by res2dinv loke and barker 1996 that uses a smoothness constrained gauss newton least squares inversion technique to obtain a 2d electrical resistivity model of the subsurface from the field apparent resistivity data griffiths and barker 1993 the result is a 2d smoothness constrained distribution of electrical resistivity in the vz the effect of temperature variations was considered negligible on the electrical resistivity data along the first 20 m of the subsurface this was assumed due to the observed low variations of temperature as a function of depth in the vz at this time of the year on the other hand the er borehole data were obtained from three different boreholes logs b1 b2 and b3 cf fig 1 on the 23rd of march 2017 by means of the dual induction laterolog dil method this method consists of focused electrical measurements that rely on transmitter and receiver coils the measurements are based on an alternating current that generate eddy currents which in turn produce a secondary electromagnetic field the latter induces an alternating voltage proportional to the formation electrical conductivity in the receiver coil the transmitter receiver pair which uses a low frequency is designed to minimize the effects of the borehole and optimize the depth of investigation and the measurement vertical resolution a measurement point spacing of 2 cm was used with a maximum penetration depth varying between 18 m and 19 m depending on each of the borehole s maximum accessible depth 3 1 2 ground penetrating radar the cross hole gpr measurements were acquired by using a proex gpr system malå geosciences on the 24th of january 2019 the measurements were done by using 100 mhz borehole antennae with a sampling frequency of 1000 mhz and a measurement period of 240 ns zero offset profiles zop were acquired between the three boreholes b1 b2 and b3 txb2 rxb1 txb1 rxb3 and txb2 rxb3 fig 1 the zop method is a commonly used approach for borehole gpr acquisition surveys klotzsche et al 2019 throughout the zop measurements the transmitting tx and receiving rx antennas are moved simultaneously in two different boreholes with a fixed step size to conduct the zop measurements the antenna were first pushed to the bottom of each of the boreholes where the maximum accessible depth was 18 98 m water table the antennae were then pulled simultaneously towards the surface by using a 0 5 m fixed step size one dimensional velocity profiles were then determined by a standard ray based analysis approach for simplicity the medium was assumed to have no horizontal variation of velocity while obtaining the one dimensional velocity profiles after picking the first arrivals in reflexw the arrival time t and the distance between the boreholes were used to determine the gpr electromagnetic wave velocity v through the following equation 1 v d t t 0 where t 0 is the time zero offset which was obtained by conducting multi offset measurements with the antenna in free space in low loss and non magnetic material such as carbonate formations e g limestone the relative dielectric permittivity ε r can be then determined at different depths by using the following equation 2 ε r c v 2 where c is the velocity of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum 0 3 m ns relative dielectric permittivity profiles were then determined from the obtained velocity profiles by using eq 2 3 2 hydraulic properties measurements and simulation of water flow within the vz 3 2 1 hydraulic properties of the vadose zone samples fifteen undisturbed samples representative of the vz 0 20 m deep were chosen according to the lithological observations made from the three cored boreholes b1 b2 and b3 isch et al 2022 the samples included three soil samples sa sb and sc four soft sediments and powdery limestone samples pa pb pc and pd two calcareous sand samples ia and ib and six limestone rock samples ra rb rc rd re and rf these samples were used to estimate the water retention θ h and hydraulic conductivity k h curves by applying the multistep outflow method aldana et al 2021 the multistep outflow experiments were conducted by using a triaxial system based on the experimental procedure described by eching et al 1994 the hydraulic conductivity was calculated from the outflow data based on the method described by gardner 1956 3 2 2 simulation of water flow in the vadose zone simulation of water flow within the vz was then performed over a 55 years period 1966 2020 on a 23 m deep vz profile borehole b2 composed of fifteen layers and reconstituted with the hydrus 1d software šimůnek et al 2016 the simulation of water flow was based on the one dimensional vertical water flow in the vz described by richards equation richards 1931 3 θ t z k h z 1 s where θ is the volumetric water content cm3 cm3 z is the coordinate along the vertical axis cm t is the time h is the matric head cm k is the hydraulic conductivity cm d and s is a sink source term the mualem van genuchten analytical model mvg was used for the description of the vz hydraulic properties the van genuchten s expression van genuchten 1980 was used to describe the water retention curve θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 4 w i t h m 1 1 n n 1 where θ r and θ s are the residual and saturated volumetric water content cm3 cm3 respectively α is an empirical parameter related to the matric head cm 1 and n is a pore size distribution parameter the statistical pore connection model of mualem 1976 was then used to predict the hydraulic conductivity from the water retention curve k h k s s e l 1 1

1976 the measured water retention and hydraulic conductivity data were fitted to the θ h and k h curves with the mvg model eqs 4 and 5 by using the retc software van genuchten et al 1991 to infer the vz hydraulic properties used in our simulations the representation of the vz profile for b2 the values of experimental and fitted with retc saturated volumetric water content θs and fitted hydraulic conductivity ks in cm d are given in table 1 water table level and meteorological data were collected from monitoring stations located at the villages of poiseaux 4 km from the study site and bricy 20 km from the study site respectively while the weather conditions at the study site may differ slightly during intense and localized rainy events relative to those observed at the bricy station these are however considered to be representative over a period of more than 50 years 4 petrophysical modeling 4 1 relative permittivity the crim is a three phase dielectric mixing model commonly used to describe the relationship between relative dielectric permittivity and subsurface properties such as water content and porosity huisman et al 2003 west et al 2001 roth et al 1990 6 ε r α ϕ s w ε w α 1 ϕ ε s α ϕ 1 s w ε a α where ϕ and s w are the porosity and water saturation respectively ε a is the relative dielectric permittivity of air given a value of 1 ε w is the relative dielectric permittivity of water ε s is the relative dielectric permittivity of the solid phase considered as a source of uncertainty to be accounted for when using the crim besides the ε s the second source of uncertainty to be accounted for is the factor α which describes the orientation of the electrical field with respect to the geological formations geometry west et al 2003 chan and knight 1999 knoll 1996 roth et al 1990 birchak et al 1974 4 2 electrical resistivity in geological formations characterized by medium to coarse grained sediments the grain surface conductivity effect can be neglected and the bulk electrical resistivity ρ 0 can be related to subsurface properties such as porosity and fluid saturation by the following modified form of archie s equation winsauer et al 1952 archie 1942 7 ρ 0 a ρ f ϕ m s w n where ρ f is the fluid or pore water electrical resistivity a is an empirical constant originally referred to as the tortuosity or lithology constant winsauer et al 1952 m is the cementation exponent which is considered to be influenced by the degree of cementation of the rock fabric glover 2010 2009 and n is the saturation exponent which is independent of the rock matrix and describes how the pore water is connected glover 2017 looms et al 2008a hendrickx et al 2002 even though archie s law does not take the surface conduction into account it is considered to be applicable if the pore fluid conductivity is largely greater than the surface conduction especially in the case of low clay content formations such as the limestone rock described within the vz of our study site fig 1 the need of including the surface conductivity arises when other conducting phases such as clay minerals are present in the rock formation therefore during this study we applied our approach to the limestone rock facies located at a depth between 6 61 m and 19 m where geological and mineralogical studies aldana et al 2021 suggested that the surface conduction can be practically neglected 4 3 inversion this study aims to estimate the archie s and crim s parameters that can vary according to the study site conditions and that are considered as sources of uncertainties in the application of these models for the estimation of water content variations the numerical approach used in this study is based on a grid search inversion algorithm fig 2 the inversion workflow is based on testing the possible combinations of the petrophysical parameters that can provide the best fit between the measured and simulated data the estimated data are the electrical resistivity and relative dielectric permittivity values calculated by using the archie s and crim s equations respectively the er measured data are the 1d electrical resistivity data acquired by the borehole s er measurements while the dielectric permittivity measured data are those generated from the 1d velocity profiles obtained from the gpr cross hole measurements the fit between the measured and calculated data is evaluated through calculating the corresponding root mean square error rmse while the algorithm varies the archie s a and m and crim s α and ε s petrophysical parameters to be estimated 8 r m s e i 1 n x i x i 2 n where x i represents the observed data x i represents the data estimated by the model and n is the total number of data points the procedure is done separately for the archie s and crim s models the water content profiles data used to calculate the dielectric permittivity and electrical resistivity in the crim s and archie s equation are those simulated by hydrus 1d software the geophysical data water content and porosity data used for both models are obtained from the geophysical measurements and hydrogeological model of borehole b2 the fluid resistivity in the archie s equation is given a value of 510 µs cm obtained from probes and calibrated by laboratory measurements while the relative dielectric permittivity of water is assumed to be 79 5 at a temperature of 22 0 c buchner et al 1999 the model was divided into three layers and the inversion was carried out for each of the layers separately this step was done to investigate the effect of geological vertical heterogeneities on the obtained petrophysical parameters the model discretization and layering were designed according to the geological characteristics and hydrogeological simulations results see section 5 3 1 the results analysis is based on obtaining the combined values of the varied archie a and m and crim parameters α and ε s that have the minimal observed rmse while the algorithm fits the calculated and the measured data the ranges of variability set for each of the parameters during the inversion were based on common ranges provided in literature for limestone formations however the parameters were set to also have values outside these ranges to avoid directing the inversion towards literature values and to compare our results with those reported in previous studies table 2 shows the ranges of the archie and crim parameters used for this inversion and those most commonly reported in the literature for limestone formations to improve the inversion performance and reduce the different parameters dependencies the saturation exponent n was fixed to a value of 2 and the calculation was done only for the a and m parameters in the archie equation even though values ranging between 1 4 and 2 5 have been previously given to n in the literature for rocks e g schön 2004 sweeney and jennings 1960 rust 1952 in practice the saturation exponent is commonly set to 2 for most types of rocks in the absence of laboratory measurements e g yaramanci 2000 looms et al 2008a b on the other hand α was given a range based on its extreme values which are 1 and 1 the lower boundary 1 represents the harmonic arrangement of dielectric components in series while its upper boundary 1 represents the arithmetic arrangement of dielectric components in parallel chan and knight 2001 1999 5 results and discussion 5 1 geology knowing that a strong coherence was observed between the ert and borehole er profiles throughout this work the ert profiles are only used for the lithological description and 2 d representation while the borehole er data will be used for the water content analysis and as an input in the inversion for its higher resolution 2 cm and larger number of data points in correspondence with the geological description the ert profile p2 in fig 1 showed three main layers corresponding to the three main geological units shown in fig 1 fig 3 the data showed a first low er unit representing the top soil layer the latter is followed by a moderate er layer down to a depth of around 7 m this layer corresponds to the incoherent and altered limestone formation lateral er variations fig 3 and dispersed dielectric permittivity values fig 4 b were observed in this layer which reflects the heterogeneity of this formation a clear transition zone between the incoherent limestone layer and the underlaying hard limestone rock layer is evident in the relative permittivity and er data at depths between 6 5 m and 9 m this is followed by a third relatively higher er layer corresponding to the massive limestone rock layer this layer shows lower dielectric permittivity values which started to increase again as the measurements got closer to the water table level fig 4b 5 2 hydrogeology as shown in fig 5 the simulated water content profile obtained by the model for borehole b2 23 03 2017 showed a good agreement with experimental water content r2 0 885 measured at the same date this model which focused on the simulation of the water movement within the matrix components of the vz seemed to constitute a first simplified but suitable approach for the unidimensional simulation of water flow within the vz of the beauce limestone aquifer the borehole er data 23 03 2017 showed a good global correspondence with the simulated water content distribution at the same date fig 6 a this correspondence is characterized with a global increase in the er values along with the global decrease in the water content this was followed by a decrease in the er values with the increase in the water content close to the water table level similarly the relative permittivity data showed a good correspondence with the water content variations fig 6b a significant coherent decrease in the relative permittivity and water content was observed at a depth between 6 5 m and 9 m located at the transition zone between the incoherent limestone and the hard limestone formations this was followed by a significant increase in the relative dielectric permittivity values along with the increase in water content close to the water table level the water content profiles simulated for the dates of the er fig 6a and gpr fig 6b data showed similar values with slight but noticeable differences in the top 6 m and at a depth between 17 m and 19 m this was expected knowing that these profiles were simulated for two close periods of the year 23rd of march and 24th of january a similar pattern was observed in the three boreholes er data and in the three dielectric permittivity profiles which shows a good repeatability of the field geophysical data this observation also indicates that the zones around and between the boreholes are globally and relatively homogeneous despite the presence of local lateral heterogeneities that were observed in each of the geophysical profiles 5 3 determination of petrophysical parameters to determine the archie a and m and crim α and ε s petrophysical parameters the measured er and relative permittivity data and the simulated water content distributions were used in the inversion algorithm described in section 4 3 5 3 1 model structure as explained previously in section 4 2 the calculation was done for the part of the vz located at a depth between 6 61 m and 19 m where the well cemented microcrystalline texture of the hard limestone rock along with its very low amount of fine grained material aldana et al 2021 permits the neglection of the grains surface conductivity therefore the inversion model was applied on the geological unit number 3 table 1 which was divided into three sub layers according to lithological description the hydrogeological model discretization and the water content variations layer 1 is located at the top of the unit at a depth between 6 61 m and 9 00 m this layer which is considered as the transition zone between the incoherent limestone pd and the massive rock rb materials table 1 showed simulated water content variations ranging between 0 147 and 0 151 cm3 cm3 fig 5 layer 2 is located at a depth ranging between 9 01 m and 14 00 m and is characterized by a limestone rock showing few fissures and slight alterations rd with intercalations of massive limestone rock banks rc mallet et al 2022 which presented a very low porosity table 1 layer 2 showed a simulated water content variation ranging between 0 050 and 0 095 cm3 cm3 layer 3 corresponds to the altered limestone rock that showed a highly heterogeneous structure characterized by an increased evolution towards fracturation and karstification with depth layer 3 is located at a depth ranging between 14 01 m and 19 m and showed the highest water content variation with values ranging between 0 078 and 0 145 cm3 cm3 the simulated water content values described here are those obtained for the er measurements date 23 03 2017 while similar value ranges were also obtained for those of the gpr measurements date 24 01 2019 the inversion was carried out for each of the model s layers separately in order to investigate the effects of vertical heterogeneities on the obtained parameters this gives us a total of 6 inversions 3 for the crim and 3 for the archie s model 5 3 2 inversion results the inversion results of the archie s parameters showed a value of 1 60 for the cementation exponent m in layers 1 and 2 and a value of 1 47 in layer 3 table 3 one can look at the cementation exponent as a measure of connectedness of the pore network which decreases as the m exponent increases glover 2017 most sediments or sedimentary rock consisting partially or completely of sand sized fragments have cementation exponents ranging between 1 5 and 2 5 glover et al 1997 while lower connectedness and vuggy limestone formations are expected to be represented by higher m values a wide range of values have been reported in the literature for limestone formations worthington 1993 values ranging between 1 6 and 2 4 have been reported for carbonates schön 2004 carothers 1968 hill and milburn 1956 while it was also suggested that they can also have higher values ranging between 2 5 and 5 due to their poorly connected pore space tiab and donaldson 2004 however knowing that connectedness is a term which also describes the extent to which transport pathways are available low porosity rocks characterized by relatively direct flow paths due to a well developed fracture network could have lower values or values close to unity reflecting a fairly good connectedness provided by the fractures network therefore the relatively low values obtained in our study could be related to a well developed fracture network which is thought to be present in the study site but not fully characterized yet even though we used a simple porosity model that doesn t take fractures network into account in the porosity parameter the relative effect of the fracturation could be reflected in the field resistivity data that have a major influence on the obtained m value during the inversion layer 3 which showed a lower m value 1 47 relative to layers 1 and 2 has a highly heterogeneous structure characterized by increased alteration fracturation and karstification features relative to the other layers which might explain the relative decrease of m in this layer indeed complex structural formations have been observed in the limestone vz at the o zns site fig 7 where fissures fractures and karst networks were observed at the field scale aldana et al 2021 for example millimetric vugs induced by dissolution processes have been observed in the weathered rock formations located at the water table fluctuation zone and corresponding to layer 3 further dissolution episodes could have increased the vugs diameters and enhanced the permeability at this layer as it is evident in the archie s equation eq 7 the higher is the cementation exponent the higher is the sensitivity of the electrical resistivity values to changes in porosity ellis and singer 2007 the relatively similar m values that were obtained in the three layers indicate a similar sensitivity of the electrical resistivity values to the slight differences in porosity observed in the different layers the inversion results showed a value of 0 8 for the parameter a in layer 1 while it showed a value of 0 7 and 0 6 in layers 2 and 3 respectively table 3 even though no real correlation was found between this parameter and tortuosity or lithology a is an empirical constant which is believed to have a role in the compensation for systematic errors in the porosity electrical resistivity or pore fluid resistivity measurements glover 2016 2015 this empirical factor which appeared in the winsauer et al 1952 modification of the archie s first law usually provided improved fits with experimental data especially when dealing with low quality and sparse types of datasets it is commonly assumed that the size of a is a measure of the extent to which an overall systematic error is present in the measurements recent research suggested that these errors produce non unity values of a while the closer this parameter is to unity the better is the data quality additionally a has an important role in the calculation of a more accurate m value since it compensates for the experimental errors present in the parameters used to calculate m during the fitting procedure glover 2016 throughout the inversion a takes the appropriate fitted value to compensate for the presence of systematic errors and reduce their effects on the obtained m value therefore the value of a obtained from the fit can be considered as an empirical parameter that describes the accuracy of the measured data in the archie equation the observed decreasing behavior value of a from 0 8 in layer 1 to 0 6 in layer 3 could be attributed to the increase in the measurements errors associated with the evolution of alteration fracturation and karstification with depth this phenomenon can increase the medium heterogeneities and produce errors in the field measurements which the fitted value of a compensated for during the inversion even though a was not shown to have an underlying physical meaning few studies suggested a values ranging between 0 4 and 2 3 in the case of limestone formations timur et al 1972 porter and carothers 1970 carothers 1968 in accordance with our inversion results the most recent studies reported values of a ranging between 0 2 and 1 8 for limestone formations glover 2016 2015 the inversion of the crim showed a ε s value of 7 99 in layer 1 7 97 in layer 2 and 8 00 in layer 3 table 4 ε s is mainly influenced by the mineralogy and rock formation characteristics therefore similar values were expected to be observed in the three layers knowing that they are all considered as part of the limestone rock main geological unit table 1 however the slight differences in the ε s values observed in the three layers can be attributed to the differences in the geological characteristics of the layers in terms of materials heterogeneity and degree of alteration which evolved with depth nevertheless these slight differences as small as they are could also be simply induced by the mathematical procedure of the inversion in accordance with our results values ranging between 4 and 13 have been reported in the literature for the solid phase dielectric permittivity of limestone formations which is considered as one of the main sources of uncertainties in the electromagnetic waves application of the crim model mount and comas 2014 reynolds 2011 cassidy 2009 the inversion of the crim showed an α value of 0 50 in layer 1 0 58 in layer 2 and 0 61 in layer 3 table 4 values ranging between 1 and 1 were reported for α over the last few decades which is a geometrical factor connecting the effective layering direction of the components to the applied electric field direction west et al 2003 knoll 1996 roth et al 1990 several gpr studies indicated that most geological facies can take an α value of 0 5 west et al 2003 knoll 1996 values ranging between 0 46 and 0 65 have been previously obtained during laboratory measurements mount and comas 2014 moysey and knight 2004 this approach was shown to produce acceptable results reflected in a very good fit between the measured and calculated data in the three layers and with values that generally fall in the ranges reported in previous studies the degree of accuracy of this approach is defined by the resolution of the hydrogeological model and its capability in capturing the vz water content variations the water content distribution is strongly influenced by the extent of heterogeneities incorporated in the hydrogeological model and in the porosity parameter of the empirical relationships especially in limestone formations with complex porosity patterns characterizing the impact of the observed fissures and fractures networks on the water flow at the field scale of the o zns vz is indeed crucial therefore our future work is focused on the development of a precise description of the water flow through the whole porosity of this highly heterogeneous vz by combining 3d experimental observations and numerical simulations with dual porosity or dual permeability approaches this will form the basis to incorporate the complex multiple porosity patterns in the petrophysical relationships in order to provide an improved estimation of petrophysical parameters the geological heterogeneities encountered at different study sites might explain the wide range of values reported in the literature for the archie s and crim s parameters especially in carbonate geology environments which are complex mediums that can develop different porosity patterns fractures networks and flow paths 6 conclusion this study attempted to investigate the relationship between geophysical properties and water content distribution and determine the archie s and crim s petrophysical parameters by integrating er and dielectric permittivity data with simulated water content data at the scale of a highly heterogeneous limestone vz the simulated and experimental hydrogeological data displayed a very good correspondence with the geophysical data reflected in coherent variations in water content er and relativity permittivity these observations showed a significant sensibility of geophysical methods to water content variations and demonstrated the potential of these methods in investigating hydrogeological processes at our study site the inversion results of the archie model showed values ranging between 0 6 and 0 8 for a and between 1 47 and 1 60 for m on the other hand the inversion results of the crim showed values ranging between 0 50 and 0 61 for α and between 7 97 and 8 00 for ε s similar results were obtained in the three model layers with slight differences that were attributed to the vertical heterogeneities of the limestone rock formation e g degree of alteration fracturation karstification this observation demonstrates the sensitivity of petrophysical parameters to vertical geological heterogeneities that should be taken into account when calculating these parameters given the ranges of variability used in the inversion the obtained values are within the bounds of values found in the literature where a wide range have been reported for carbonate formations due to their complex geological features that might vary greatly among different study sites throughout this study the petrophysical parameters were successfully obtained with a very good fit between the measured and simulated data however the demonstrated approach showed an important sensitivity to the resolution of water content variations captured by the used hydrogeological model and to the geological heterogeneities of the medium therefore the perspectives include further improvements to this approach by conducting extensive studies at larger scales and combining 3d experimental observations and numerical simulations using dual porosity and dual permeability modeling approaches that can capture the water content and geological heterogeneities at a higher resolution in complex and fractured limestone formations in this context our future work is focused on the development of a geological model constrained by laboratory calibrations that can give a better estimation of the limestone complex porosity patterns to be incorporated in the hydrogeological model and empirical relationships credit authorship contribution statement m abbas writing original draft writing review editing conceptualization visualization

2652,an investigation on transport of fine sediment particles in a tidal wetland flow is presented in the current research the model of this work is based on an advection diffusion equation whose solution reveals the water phase based concentration of settling particles using the method of moments a system of moment equations are derived from the governing equation a finite difference implicit scheme is employed to solve the equations of moment the behavior of taylor effective dispersivity due to the variation of settling velocity of fine particles for oscillatory current with or without nonzero mean is predicted the mean concentration distribution along the longitudinal direction is obtained using the hermite polynomial and first four central moments it is shown that for greater settling velocity the dispersion procedure is inhibited some significant effects of vegetation factor time period oscillation parameter on environmental dispersivity skewness and mean concentration profile are shown the results of the present study are very important to understand the process of sedimentation and wastewater treatment in a tidal wetland flow keywords tidal wetland flow settling particles dispersion moment method finite difference scheme data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the tidal wetlands are sporadically located from the tidal flats to salt marshes and mangroves in all the coastal areas of the globe it is well known that all the pollutants of the world transport through the wetland and finally it comes at the estuaries after that the pollutants and sediments are dispersed by the tidal wetland under the joint action of vegetation drag force and oscillatory tidal flow hence the dispersion of fine sediment particles in a tidal wetland is highly significant in the environmental point of view although some research was done on dispersion of solute in depth and width dominated tidal wetland flows the transportation problem of settling particles has paid low attention by the researchers in 1953 taylor 1953 first discussed about the dispersion mechanism of soluble substances spread longitudinally with the combined effect of lateral diffusion and longitudinal velocity flowing through a thin impermeable tube aris 1956 employed the method of moments to study the dispersion process through the tube and removed some limitations applied by taylor 1953 chatwin 1970 discussed the dispersion of tracers under the combined effects of advection and diffusion he showed that for the large time scale the asymptotic series solution for mean concentration approaches to the gaussian distribution to investigate the dispersion in pulsatile flow mazumder and das 1992 used a finite difference scheme and showed the impact of the frequency of pressure pulsation and boundary absorption on the mixing of tracer molecules through a channel a numerical method is employed to solve the convection diffusion equation by mondal and mazumder 2005a in a time independent flow through an annular pipe and showed the influence of shear flow on the transport of solute they also obtained the mean concentration distribution using hermite polynomial representation for steady flow further mondal and mazumder 2005b extended their work in a time dependent channel flow to observe the dispersion phenomena of tracers and discussed how the transport coefficient approaches to the non transient state after a certain critical time recently the study of solute dispersion phenomena in different flow geometry was developed by numerous researchers in various directions see wu and chen 2014 wang and chen 2017a wang and cirpka 2021 poddar et al 2022 jiang et al 2022 and zhang et al 2020 sedimentation is a procedure by which tracer particles tend to fall downwards to the bed surface from the flow due to the effect of gravitational force dispersion of fine settling particles has many important applications in wastewater treatment ecological engineering chemical engineering and biological science mondal and mazumder 2007 studied longitudinal dispersion of settling particles in turbulent open channel flow where the tracers were discharged from an instantaneous point source they observed the influences of log wake law velocity and eddy diffusivity on the spreading of settling particles furthermore mondal and mazumder 2008 extended their work in oscillatory turbulent flow with the help of alternating direction implicit adi scheme an experimental research was conducted by bhuiyan et al 2010 to study the formation of mounds by sedimentation using numerical computation mazumder and paul 2012 studied the influences of various controlling factors on statistical parameters for the different phases namely deposition suspension and composition in addition for the combined flow significant improvement was found in dispersion coefficient and variance due to the eddy diffusivity chernogorova and vulkov 2014 employed finite volume scheme in a time dependent convective diffusion equation and proved that the numerical solution for concentration of the suspended particle is non negative dhar et al 2021 explained transport process of fine settling particles in a wetland flow and used layer adapted meshes to capture the layer phenomena near the source poddar et al 2021a presented the outcome of the effect of settling velocity and some other important parameters on environmental dispersion in a wetland flow in recent time to analyze the sediment bedload particles hop theoretically wu et al 2021 found the relation between the time of travels and average hop distances later the transport of settling particle in a ice covered channel flow was studied by dhar et al 2022a using multi scale homogenization technique wetlands are individual ecological system that is seasonally or permanently replenished by water various researchers fischer 1967 ghisalberti and nepf 2005 nepf 2012 dhar et al 2022b das et al 2022 showed the effect of vegetation on mass transport phenomena in natural flows zhou et al 2009 worked on wastewater treatment in a constructed wetland later zeng et al 2010 obtained the environmental dispersivity using aris s moment method and derived analytic solution to reduce the mean concentration along longitudinal direction whereas chen et al 2010 showed environmental dispersion coefficient with variation of multi scale asymptomatic time with three different stages wu et al 2011 utilized multi scale technique to observe the transport of contaminant concentration in a wetland flow also they illustrated the evolution of solute cloud for some polluted constituents of biochemical oxygen demand chemical oxygen demand total nitrogen total phosphorus and heavy metal further several researchers studied wind effects on hydraulic dispersion of bi component contaminant in a wetland zeng and chen 2011 zeng et al 2012 chen et al 2012 zeng et al 2014 wang and zeng 2019 wu et al 2012 derived the velocity distribution of periodic flow in a wetland and showed the changes on the oscillation of dispersion coefficient for different flow parameters including vegetation later wu et al 2015 studied the longitudinal diminution of solute cloud and the effects of vegetation on concentration contours a theoretical analysis was presented by wang and chen 2015 and wang and zhang 2020 to notice the dispersion phenomena and mean concentration distribution in a tidal wetland flow in presence of sorption and found that environmental dispersivity becomes steady after some increment in the initial stage further first time spatial concentration distribution was determined by wang and chen 2017b with bulk degradation moreover the mean concentration distribution was found more accurately in the initial moment the effect of wind on the environmental dispersion was analyzed by wang and huai 2018 wang et al 2018 described transient dispersion in a wetland and showed temporal evolution of longitudinal displacement vertical concentration distribution kurtosis skewness and transport coefficient for a tracer poddar et al 2021b numerically studied the transport phenomena in wetland flow under the effects of bulk chemical reaction and boundary absorption due to its importance in environmental fluid mechanics several researchers have shown their interest to explore the contaminant transport phenomena in wetland and river flows wang et al 2020 observed the various outcomes of solute transport between bottom and upper layers of fluid flow in a wetland in this work an investigation on settling particles transport in a tidal wetland channel flow is performed the governing equation of the present problem is based on an advection diffusion equation and it is solved using a finite difference implicit scheme some important objectives of this research are i to present a semi analytical method for dispersion of settling particles in a tidal wetland flow ii to notice the variation of transport coefficient for various flow parameters iii to obtain the mean concentration distribution with the help of first four central moments and hermite polynomial iv to illustrate the effects of settling velocity vegetation factor dispersion time dimensionless time period and amplitude parameter on the concentration distribution the analysis of this study may help to understand the basic criteria of sedimentation process wastewater treatment erosion and flood damage control in a tidal wetland 2 mathematical model

criteria for the wetland to smear out the discontinuity between the ambient water phase and phase of the solid structure of settling particle the phase averaged scale id taken in order to account the momentum dispersion law the combination of darcy s law and navier stokes equation is considered with an additional second order derivative term similarly the transport equation for settling particle is the conjunction of a macroscopic dispersion law and convective diffusive equation the transport of settling particles in a unidirectional and fully developed laminar flow with constant values of ϕ f κ and l in a tidal wetland is considered a cartesian coordinate system is taken in the present tidal wetland flow where the origin is situated at the bed of the wetland with x axis along the flow direction and z axis perpendicular to the flow the depth of the wetland is h a line source of concentration of settling particles is situated at x 0 and it is shown in the schematic diagram see fig 1 as a first approximation for a width independent tidal wetland flow the influences of width are considered negligible and then the related terms are adopted as width averaged hence eq 1 can be reduced as 2 ρ u t κ μ l z 2 u z 2 μ f u p x where ρ is the density of the fluid and the pressure gradient for the time period t is given by 3 p x p 1 ɛ e 2 π i t t p and ɛ p are the mean pressure gradient

corresponding dimensionless initial input condition is 13 c x z t t 0 δ x here δ is the dirac delta function since the concentration of settling particles cannot move at infinity the normalized

respectively to study the mass transport phenomena of solute aris 1956 employed his method of moments to rectify the large time evolution of dispersion coefficient as d a p e 192 1 p e in compare to

nonzero values of β 1 and β 2 indicate the deviation from the normality 4 numerical procedure since for ω 0 and p 1 due to some complexity of the analytical solution of system of moment equations an

dispersion time and its range is 1 to n the results are obtained by solving the tri diagonal coefficient matrix applying the thomas algorithm anderson et al 1997 with the corresponding initial and boundary conditions the values of m p are obtained using simpson s one third rule with the known values of u z and c p at the related grid points in eq 20 aris s moment method can provide various significant information of concentration distribution of settling particles along the flow to calculate the mean concentration distribution c m t z of settling particles in tidal wetland the hermite polynomial representation with the help of the central moments ν 2 β 2 and β 3 is used and it can be written as 34 c m t ξ m 0 t e η 2 k 0 a k t h k η where η ξ ξ g 2 ν 2 ξ g x g m 1 m 0 h j x is the hermite polynomial and it follows the recurrence relation 35 h j 1 η 2 η h j η 2 j h j 1 η j 1 2 3 where h 0 η 1 0 the coefficients in eq 34 a k are given by a 0 1 2 π ν 2 a 1 a 2 0 a 3 2 a 0 β 2 24 a 4 a 0 β 3 96 to study the effect of settling velocity on concentration distribution more appropriately gill 1967 method is used to obtain the concentration distribution as 36 c t x z c m t x z k 1 f k

the above system of differential equations for k 1 2 and putting these into eq 36 the two dimensional concentration distribution is determined and depicted in fig 11 for different values of settling velocity 5 result and discussion the variation of velocity distribution for some important dimensionless parameters are illustrated in fig 2 fig 2 a shows the velocity profile for tidal wetland flow with the nonzero mean for the variation in time and depth of the wetland it is seen from the figure that when the depth of the wetland greater than 0 6 the velocity reaches its maximum value for all time in fig 2 b it is noticed that with the increment in time the velocity is spreading in both positive and negative direction alternatively due to the pressure pulsation whereas in fig 2 c the number of oscillation in velocity decreases for the enhancement of the time period moreover the amplitude of the velocity decreases with the raise on the value of reynolds oscillation parameter which is shown in fig 2 d but an opposite phenomena is observed in fig 2 e for different values of ɛ on the fluctuation of velocity furthermore in fig 2 f the velocity reduces due to the increase of the vegetation in the wetland which resists the flow velocity the evolution of transport coefficient for purely tidal flow with the variation in dispersion time 0 t 1 is displayed in fig 3 for various values of vegetation factor α amplitude ɛ and settling velocity ω in fig 3 a the time variation in dispersion coefficient d a for different values of vegetation parameter is shown and it is noticed that the amplitude of dispersivity is unequal for small times after a certain time the stationary state of d a is found and it moves forward moreover as vegetation parameter enhances α 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 the critical times for d a to reach its stationary state advances t c 0 52 0 47 0 42 0 22 this is because vegetation in the tidal wetland creates a resisting drag force which inhibits the flow velocity and consequently the process of mixing of the tracers with the flow reduces significantly thus with the increment of vegetation parameter the critical time for reaching the stationary state of the dispersion coefficients precedes it is also seen from the figures that the oscillation reduces with the enhancement of vegetation the effect of amplitude of pressure pulsation ɛ on the dispersion coefficient is depicted in fig 3 b it shows that as ɛ increases the peak of the dispersivity d a increases due to the domination of oscillatory part u 1 in the velocity profile it is also seen that as time progresses the fluctuation in the profile of the dispersion coefficient reduces and tends to become equal the variation becomes equal for the critical dispersion time t c 0 42 which is independent of ɛ the effect of settling velocity on transport coefficient in the tidal wetland flow is illustrated in fig 3 c for small dispersion times an oscillation is observed in d a for various values of ω and as time goes on the oscillations become stable it is also seen that with the increment of ω the amplitude of the dispersion coefficient drops the cause behind this as ω increases the particle becomes more heavier and it fall down near the bed surface more quickly which reduces the dispersion process also for this reason heavy particle found its stationary state much faster than tiny particle fig 4 a represents the variation of dispersion coefficient for various values of oscillation reynolds number γ at small time for small values of γ the difference between two successive amplitude is smaller in comparison to higher values of γ moreover the dispersion coefficient d a moves cyclically as time progresses and after a critical dispersion time t c it arrives to the stationary state also the dispersion reduces with higher values of frequency because the shear effect is negligible for periodic flow in compare to that of the steady flow velocity the variation of d a for different dimensionless time periods τ is shown in fig 4 b it is observed that as τ increases the amplitude of the dispersion fall down also as time period progresses the number of oscillation enhances the impact of r which is the ratio of sum of mass dispersivity and diffusivity along the longitudinal and vertical directions on d a is shown in fig 4 c it is remarkable to note that as r increases the initial point of dispersion moves upwards due to the increment of r as the longitudinal diffusion increases significantly moreover in all cases the dispersion coefficient moves cyclically by maintaining a similar pattern the influence on dispersion coefficient d a for both steady and combined flow combination of steady u 0 y and oscillatory u 1 y t current is illustrated in figs 5 a 5 f for various values of α ɛ ω γ τ and r respectively fig 5 a shows that the dispersion coefficient decreases prominently for all values of α in both the flows due to the increment of resisting vegetation force for the case of oscillatory flow with nonzero mean the amplitude of the dispersion coefficient suddenly rises for small dispersion times and after a certain time it becomes stable it is significant to note that the dispersion coefficient for steady flow becomes time independent after a certain critical dispersion time it is also seen that as α enhances the critical time to attain the non transient state reduces fig 5 b shows the variation of d a for various values of ɛ it is seen that the dispersion coefficient moves cyclically and after a particular amount of time it attains the steady state for all values of ɛ also it is observed that the amplitude of d a enhances with the increment of ɛ besides this it is also noted that for higher value of ɛ dispersion d a varies initially with a two cycle period that changes to a single cycle period for large time the variation of d a is plotted in fig 5 c for various values of ω for both steady and combined flow it is found that as the settling velocity increases the dispersion coefficient settle down due to gravity it is noted that the initial gradient in the transport coefficient reduces with respect to time and it reaches to its non transient state the similar phenomena is observed on dispersion coefficient for steady flow as of in fig 5 a fig 5 d displays how the dispersion coefficient d a changes with time t for different values of γ it is seen that the amplitude of dispersion increases up to a certain time t then it stabilizes furthermore with the enhancement of γ fluctuation of d a reduces with a right hand shift along the temporal direction the effects of time period τ on dispersion coefficient d a is illustrated in fig 5 e it is seen that the number of oscillation reduces as time period increases moreover as τ increases length of the each oscillation enhances as a result it will fluctuate with higher amplitude for all the cases it is found that the environmental dispersivity for tidal flow with nonzero mean reaches to its stationary state in fig 5 f the impact of r on the transport coefficient for both steady and combined flows are shown it is observed that with the raise on the value of r the longitudinal diffusion is dominated over the vertical diffusion as a result initial position of the dispersion coefficient shifts to a higher value and after a certain time it becomes non transient for both the flows it is significant to note that the oscillation disappears from the transport coefficient when steady flow is considered figs 6 a display the variation of skewness β 2 with different values of α and ω for tidal flow in a wetland it is seen that for both the cases and for small dispersion times the amplitude of the skewness is large further as time progresses the variation of the amplitude becomes negligible and tends to zero i e the contaminant distribution in the wetland becomes symmetric in figs 6 b the temporal variation of skewness for tidal flow with nonzero mean with different values of α and ω are shown it is observed that initially skewness fall down and after a certain time it moves towards the zero value of skewness i e symmetricity of the distribution of the tracer see fig 6 b but from fig 6 d it is seen that as ω increases the degree of asymmetry of the concentration distribution enhances the environmental dispersion of solute under the effect of sorption due to vegetation was investigated by wang and chen 2015 in a depth dominated tidal wetland flow they used the analytical moment method to describe the effects of various flow parameters such as vegetation factor oscillatory parameters time period péclet number etc on different dispersion characteristics of the solute concentration to validate the present model the mean concentration distribution is compared with the work of wang and chen 2015 for different values of vegetation factor α and amplitude parameter ɛ when ω 0 from fig 7 it is observed that the present result of longitudinal distribution of mean concentration is achieved an excellent agreement with wang and chen 2015 for various values of vegetation factor α and amplitude parameter ɛ how the mean concentration distribution effected by the vegetation drag force in a depth dominated wetland for both tidal and combined flows are sketched in figs 8 a respectively it is seen that for both cases with the increment of resisting vegetation force the amplitude of mean concentration profile enhances the cause behind this as α increases the resisting drag force acts more on the distribution of the concentration and the mixing of the tracer with the flow is inhibited thus there is an increment in the amplitude of the contaminant distribution moreover in case of combined flow see fig 8 b the peak of the mean concentration distributions fall down and it is spreading along the longitudinal direction prominently enhances in compare to that of fig 8 a the variation on mean concentration profiles are illustrated with different values of ω in figs 8 c for tidal and tidal flow with nonzero mean respectively in fig 8 c it is very engaging to observe that the effects of settling velocity ω on tidal flow is insignificant the reason behind this the process of mixing of the settling particle with the tidal flow is very slow and consequently the effect of the settling velocity on the mean concentration is negligible in fig 8 d for the case of combined flow it is observed that as settling velocity ω increases the peak of the mean concentration increases the reason is the tracer molecules become heavy and unable to move forward easily with the enhancement of settling velocity and it accumulate on the bed surface of the wetland remarkably an upward pattern of the mean concentration profiles are observed with the introduction of settling velocity fig 9 a depicts the profiles of mean concentration for various values of ɛ for both oscillatory tidal flow and tidal flow with nonzero mean it is seen that with the increment of ɛ the mean concentration peak of the settling particle decreases as well expanded more along the longitudinal direction foe purely oscillatory flow this is because with increase in ɛ the domination of oscillation enhances as a result mixing of tracer with the flow becomes fast moreover a sudden drop in the mean concentration peak is found for combined flow and the effect of ɛ becomes insignificant a reverse trend is obtained on the mean concentration distribution for oscillation reynolds number γ in compare to that of in fig 9 a this is because as frequency grows the process of dispersion becomes slower in fig 9 c it is observed that as dimensionless periodic time increases the frequency decreases as a result the mean concentration profile reduces also the similar phenomena is noticed when r increases see fig 9 d in all cases as shown in fig 9 it is important to note that the effects of the various flow parameters becomes insignificant for tidal flow with nonzero mean the influence of dispersion times on the mean concentration profiles is presented in fig 10 for both tidal and combined flow it is seen from the figures that as time progresses the amplitude of the concentration distribution reduces but the expansion of the distribution along the longitudinal direction enhances this is because as time grows the tracer molecules is assimilated with the flow more and thus the profiles of the mean concentration distribution become flat but it is interesting to note that the strength of the concentration significantly diminishes and the longitudinal expansion of the tracer distribution prominently enhances for tidal flow with nonzero mean in comparison with purely tidal flow the effect of settling velocity on variation of concentration c with spatial variables x x g and z is illustrated in fig 11 it is clearly observed that concentration of the fine particles move towards the bed surface z 0 from the free surface z 1 not only that the strength of the concentration enhances as the fall velocity increases 6 conclusion in this research the transport phenomena of fine settling particles in a tidal wetland flow is investigated a velocity distribution is constructed for a tidal wetland channel flow which is depends on vertical coordinate z and dispersion time t the method of moments due to aris is used to observe the mass transport phenomena of solute in a tidal depth dominated wetland by solving the convection diffusion equation with the aid of a finite difference implicit scheme the impacts of different parameters on environmental dispersion coefficient and longitudinal mean concentration are observed for purely tidal flow and tidal flow with nonzero mean some significant observations are given below a for small dispersion time the amplitude of the taylor dispersivity is fluctuating though after a certain time it achieves its stationary state for both tidal flow and tidal flow with nonzero mean b with the enhancement of vegetation parameter the environmental dispersivity decreases for both the flows c the magnitude of the dispersion coefficient decreases as settling velocity of the tracer particle increases d with the enhancement of r the initial position of the dispersion coefficient shifts upwards and after a certain time it becomes stationary for both the flows since the longitudinal diffusion is dominated over the vertical diffusion e with the increment of γ pulsation in the transport coefficient d a diminishes with a right hand shift along the temporal direction f the mean concentration distribution remain unaltered for purely tidal wetland flow with the increasing values of settling velocity on the other hand peak of the mean concentration profile increases as settling velocity enhances for tidal wetland flow with nonzero mean g the peak of the mean concentration profile enhances for both the flows with the increment of resisting vegetation force h as time progresses the amplitude of the concentration distribution reduces but the expansion of the distribution along the longitudinal direction enhances i the concentration strength of the contaminant remarkably reduces and the longitudinal expansion prominently increases for tidal flow with nonzero mean in compare to that of in purely tidal flow credit

settling velocity the dispersion procedure is inhibited some significant effects of vegetation factor time period oscillation parameter on environmental dispersivity skewness and mean concentration profile are shown the results of the present study are very important to understand the process of sedimentation and wastewater treatment in a tidal wetland flow keywords tidal wetland flow settling particles dispersion moment method finite difference scheme data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the tidal wetlands are sporadically located from the tidal flats to salt marshes and mangroves in all the coastal areas of the globe it is well known that all the pollutants of the world transport through the wetland and finally it comes at the estuaries after that the pollutants and sediments are dispersed by the tidal wetland under the joint action of vegetation drag force and oscillatory tidal flow hence the dispersion of fine sediment particles in a tidal wetland is highly significant in the environmental point of view although some research was done on dispersion of solute in depth and width dominated tidal wetland flows the transportation problem of settling particles has paid low attention by the researchers in 1953 taylor 1953 first discussed about the dispersion mechanism of soluble substances spread longitudinally with the combined effect of lateral diffusion and longitudinal velocity flowing through a thin impermeable tube aris 1956 employed the method of moments to study the dispersion process through the tube and removed some limitations applied by taylor 1953 chatwin 1970 discussed the dispersion of tracers under the combined effects of advection and diffusion he showed that for the large time scale the asymptotic series solution for mean concentration approaches to the gaussian distribution to investigate the dispersion in pulsatile flow mazumder and das 1992 used a finite difference scheme and showed the impact of the frequency of pressure pulsation and boundary absorption on the mixing of tracer molecules through a channel a numerical method is employed to solve the convection diffusion equation by mondal and mazumder 2005a in a time independent flow through an annular pipe and showed the influence of shear flow on the transport of solute they also obtained the mean concentration distribution using hermite polynomial representation for steady flow further mondal and mazumder 2005b extended their work in a time dependent channel flow to observe the dispersion phenomena of tracers and discussed how the transport coefficient approaches to the non transient state after a certain critical time recently the study of solute dispersion phenomena in different flow geometry was developed by numerous researchers in various directions see wu and chen 2014 wang and chen 2017a wang and cirpka 2021 poddar et al 2022 jiang et al 2022 and zhang et al 2020 sedimentation is a procedure by which tracer particles tend to fall downwards to the bed surface from the flow due to the effect of gravitational force dispersion of fine settling particles has many important applications in wastewater treatment ecological engineering chemical engineering and biological science mondal and mazumder 2007 studied longitudinal dispersion of settling particles in turbulent open channel flow where the tracers were discharged from an instantaneous point source they observed the influences of log wake law velocity and eddy diffusivity on the spreading of settling particles furthermore mondal and mazumder 2008 extended their work in oscillatory turbulent flow with the help of alternating direction implicit adi scheme an experimental research was conducted by bhuiyan et al 2010 to study the formation of mounds by sedimentation using numerical computation mazumder and paul 2012 studied the influences of various controlling factors on statistical parameters for the different phases namely deposition suspension and composition in addition for the combined flow significant improvement was found in dispersion coefficient and variance due to the eddy diffusivity chernogorova and vulkov 2014 employed finite volume scheme in a time dependent convective diffusion equation and proved that the numerical solution for concentration of the suspended particle is non negative dhar et al 2021 explained transport process of fine settling particles in a wetland flow and used layer adapted meshes to capture the layer phenomena near the source poddar et al 2021a

theoretically wu et al 2021 found the relation between the time of travels and average hop distances later the transport of settling particle in a ice covered channel flow was studied by dhar et al 2022a using multi scale homogenization technique wetlands are individual ecological system that is seasonally or permanently replenished by water various researchers fischer 1967 ghisalberti and nepf 2005 nepf 2012 dhar et al 2022b das et al 2022 showed the effect of vegetation on mass transport phenomena in natural flows zhou et al 2009 worked on wastewater treatment in a constructed wetland later zeng et al 2010 obtained the environmental dispersivity using aris s moment method and derived analytic solution to reduce the mean concentration along longitudinal direction whereas chen et al 2010 showed environmental dispersion coefficient with variation of multi scale asymptomatic time with three different stages wu et al 2011 utilized multi scale technique to observe the transport of contaminant concentration in a wetland flow also they illustrated the evolution of solute cloud for some polluted constituents of biochemical oxygen demand chemical oxygen demand total nitrogen total phosphorus and heavy metal further several researchers studied wind effects on hydraulic dispersion of bi component contaminant in a wetland zeng and chen 2011 zeng et al 2012 chen et al 2012 zeng et al 2014 wang and zeng 2019 wu et al 2012 derived the velocity distribution of periodic flow in a wetland and showed the changes on the oscillation of dispersion coefficient for different flow parameters including vegetation later wu et al 2015 studied the longitudinal diminution of solute cloud and the effects of vegetation on concentration contours a theoretical analysis was presented by wang and chen 2015 and wang and zhang 2020 to notice the dispersion phenomena and mean concentration distribution in a tidal wetland flow in presence of sorption and found that environmental dispersivity becomes steady after some increment in the initial stage further first time spatial concentration distribution was determined by wang and chen 2017b with bulk degradation moreover the mean concentration distribution was found more accurately in the initial moment the effect of wind on the environmental dispersion was analyzed by wang and huai 2018 wang et al 2018 described transient dispersion in a wetland and showed temporal evolution of longitudinal displacement vertical concentration distribution kurtosis skewness and transport coefficient for a tracer poddar et al 2021b numerically studied the transport phenomena in wetland flow under the effects of bulk chemical reaction and boundary absorption due to its importance in environmental fluid mechanics several researchers have shown their interest to explore the contaminant transport phenomena in wetland and river flows wang et al 2020 observed the various outcomes of solute transport between bottom and upper layers of fluid flow in a wetland in this work an investigation on settling particles transport in a tidal wetland channel flow is performed the governing equation of the present problem is based on an advection diffusion equation and it is solved using a finite difference implicit scheme some important objectives of this research are i to present a semi analytical method for dispersion of settling particles in a tidal wetland flow ii to notice the variation of transport coefficient for various flow parameters iii to obtain the mean concentration distribution with the help of first four central moments and hermite polynomial iv to illustrate the effects of settling velocity vegetation factor dispersion time dimensionless time period and amplitude parameter on the concentration distribution the analysis of this study may help to understand the basic criteria of sedimentation process wastewater treatment erosion and flood damage control in a tidal wetland 2 mathematical model

criteria for the wetland to smear out the discontinuity between the ambient water phase and phase of the solid structure of settling particle the phase averaged scale id taken in order to account the momentum dispersion law the combination of darcy s law and navier stokes equation is considered with an additional second order derivative term similarly the transport equation for settling particle is the conjunction of a macroscopic dispersion law and convective diffusive equation the transport of settling particles in a unidirectional and fully developed laminar flow with constant values of ϕ f κ and l in a tidal wetland is considered a cartesian coordinate system is taken in the present tidal wetland flow where the origin is situated at the bed of the wetland with x axis along the flow direction and z axis perpendicular to the flow the depth of the wetland is h a line source of concentration of settling particles is situated at x 0 and it is shown in the schematic diagram see fig 1 as a first approximation for a width independent tidal wetland flow the influences of width are considered negligible and then the related terms are adopted as width averaged hence eq 1 can be reduced

wetland current a mesh size δ t 0 0001 δ z 1 m 1 is employed for satisfactory result for the present problem we have taken m 41 to prevent the loss of information in the dispersion phenomena for oscillatory flow the smaller time step is needed hence the grid size for purely oscillatory flow and oscillatory flow with nonzero mean δ t is taken as 0 00001 the index n is related with the

the above system of differential equations for k 1 2 and putting these into eq 36 the two dimensional concentration distribution is determined and depicted in fig 11 for different values of settling velocity 5 result and discussion the variation of velocity distribution for some important dimensionless parameters are illustrated in fig 2 fig 2 a shows the velocity profile for tidal wetland flow with the nonzero mean for the variation in time and depth of the wetland it is seen from the figure that when the depth of the wetland greater than 0 6 the velocity reaches its maximum value for all time in fig 2 b it is noticed that with the increment in time the velocity is spreading in both positive and negative direction alternatively due to the pressure pulsation whereas in fig 2 c the number of oscillation in velocity decreases for the enhancement of the time period moreover the amplitude of the velocity decreases with the raise on the value of reynolds oscillation parameter which is shown in fig 2 d but an opposite phenomena is observed in fig 2 e for different values of ɛ on the fluctuation of velocity furthermore in fig 2 f the velocity reduces due to the increase of the vegetation in the wetland which resists the flow velocity the evolution of transport coefficient for purely tidal flow with the variation in dispersion time 0 t 1 is displayed in fig 3 for various values of vegetation factor α amplitude ɛ and settling velocity ω in fig 3 a the time variation in dispersion coefficient d a for different values of vegetation parameter is shown and it is noticed that the amplitude of dispersivity is unequal for small times after a certain time the stationary state of d a is found and it moves forward moreover as vegetation parameter enhances α 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 the critical times for d a to reach its stationary state advances t c 0 52 0 47 0 42 0 22 this is because vegetation in the tidal wetland creates a resisting drag force which inhibits the flow velocity and consequently the process of mixing of the tracers with the flow reduces significantly thus with the increment of vegetation parameter the critical time for reaching the stationary state of the dispersion coefficients precedes it is also seen from the figures that the oscillation reduces with the enhancement of vegetation the effect of amplitude of pressure pulsation ɛ on the dispersion coefficient is depicted in fig 3 b it shows that as ɛ increases the peak of the dispersivity d a increases due to the domination of oscillatory part u 1 in the velocity profile it is also seen that as time progresses the fluctuation in the profile of the dispersion coefficient reduces and tends to become equal the variation becomes equal for the critical dispersion time t c 0 42 which is independent of ɛ the effect of settling velocity on transport coefficient in the tidal wetland flow is illustrated in fig 3 c for small dispersion times an oscillation is observed in d a for various values of ω and as time goes on the oscillations become stable it is also seen that with the increment of ω the amplitude of the dispersion coefficient drops the cause behind this as ω increases the particle becomes more heavier and it fall down near the bed surface more quickly which reduces the dispersion process also for this reason heavy particle found its stationary state much faster than tiny particle fig 4 a represents the variation of dispersion coefficient for various values of oscillation reynolds number γ at small time for small values of γ the difference between two successive amplitude is smaller in comparison to higher values of γ moreover the dispersion coefficient d a moves cyclically as time progresses and after a critical dispersion time t c it arrives to the stationary state also the dispersion reduces with higher values of frequency because the shear effect is negligible for periodic flow in compare to that of the steady flow velocity the variation of d a for different dimensionless time periods τ is shown in fig 4 b it is observed that as τ increases the amplitude of the dispersion fall down also as time period progresses the number of oscillation enhances the impact of r which is the ratio of sum of mass dispersivity and diffusivity along the longitudinal and vertical directions on d a is shown in fig 4 c it is remarkable to note that as r increases the initial point of dispersion moves upwards due to the increment of r as the longitudinal diffusion increases significantly moreover in all cases the dispersion coefficient moves cyclically by maintaining a similar pattern the influence on dispersion coefficient d a for both steady and combined flow combination of steady u 0 y and oscillatory u 1 y t current is illustrated in figs 5 a 5 f for various values of α ɛ ω γ τ and r respectively fig 5 a shows that the dispersion coefficient decreases prominently for all values of α in both the flows due to the increment of resisting vegetation force for the case of oscillatory flow with nonzero mean the amplitude of the dispersion coefficient suddenly rises for small dispersion times and after a certain time it becomes stable it is significant to note that the dispersion coefficient for steady flow becomes time independent after a certain critical dispersion time it is also seen that as α enhances the critical time to attain the non transient state reduces fig 5 b shows the variation of d a for various values of ɛ it is seen that the dispersion coefficient moves cyclically and after a particular amount of time it attains the steady state for all values of ɛ also it is observed that the amplitude of d a enhances with the increment of ɛ besides this it is also noted that for higher value of ɛ dispersion d a varies initially with a two cycle period that changes to a single cycle period for large time the variation of d a is plotted in fig 5 c for various values of ω for both steady and combined flow it is found that as the settling velocity increases the dispersion coefficient settle down due to gravity it is noted that the initial gradient in the transport coefficient reduces with respect to time and it reaches to its non transient state the similar phenomena is observed on dispersion coefficient for steady flow as of in fig 5 a fig 5 d displays how the dispersion coefficient d a changes with time t for different values of γ it is seen that the amplitude of dispersion increases up to a certain time t then it stabilizes furthermore with the enhancement of γ fluctuation of d a reduces with a right hand shift along the temporal direction the effects of time period τ on dispersion coefficient d a is illustrated in fig 5 e it is seen that the number of oscillation reduces as time period increases moreover as τ increases length of the each oscillation enhances as a result it will fluctuate with higher amplitude for all the cases it is found that the environmental dispersivity for tidal flow with nonzero mean reaches to its stationary state in fig 5 f the impact of r on the transport coefficient for both steady and combined flows are shown it is observed that with the raise on the value of r the longitudinal diffusion is dominated over the vertical diffusion as a result initial position of the dispersion coefficient shifts to a higher value and after a certain time it becomes non transient for both the flows it is significant to note that the oscillation disappears from the transport coefficient when steady flow is considered figs 6 a display the variation of skewness β 2 with different values of α and ω for tidal flow in a wetland it is seen that for both the cases and for small dispersion times the amplitude of the skewness is large further as time progresses the variation of the amplitude becomes negligible and tends to zero i e the contaminant distribution in the wetland becomes symmetric in figs 6 b the temporal variation of skewness for tidal flow with nonzero mean with different values of α and ω are shown it is observed that initially skewness fall down and after a certain time it moves towards the zero value of skewness i e symmetricity of the distribution of the tracer see fig 6 b but from fig 6 d it is seen that as ω increases the degree of asymmetry of the concentration distribution enhances the environmental dispersion of solute under the effect of sorption due to vegetation was investigated by wang and chen 2015 in a depth dominated tidal wetland flow they used the analytical moment method to describe the effects of various flow parameters such as vegetation factor oscillatory parameters time period péclet number etc on different dispersion characteristics of the solute concentration to validate the present model the mean concentration distribution is compared with the work of wang and chen 2015 for different values of vegetation factor α and amplitude parameter ɛ when ω 0 from fig 7 it is observed that the present result of longitudinal distribution of mean concentration is achieved an excellent agreement with wang and chen 2015 for various values of vegetation factor α and amplitude parameter ɛ how the mean concentration distribution effected by the vegetation drag force in a depth dominated wetland for both tidal and combined flows are sketched in figs 8 a respectively it is seen that for both cases with the increment of resisting vegetation force the amplitude of mean concentration profile enhances the cause behind this as α increases the resisting drag force acts more on the distribution of the concentration and the mixing of the tracer with the flow is inhibited thus there is an increment in the amplitude of the contaminant distribution moreover in case of combined flow see fig 8 b the peak of the mean concentration distributions fall down and it is spreading along the longitudinal direction prominently enhances in compare to that of fig 8 a the variation on mean concentration profiles are illustrated with different values of ω in figs 8 c for tidal and tidal flow with nonzero mean respectively in fig 8 c it is very engaging to observe that the effects of settling velocity ω on tidal flow is insignificant the reason behind this the process of mixing of the settling particle with the tidal flow is very slow and consequently the effect of the settling velocity on the mean concentration is negligible in fig 8 d for the case of combined flow it is observed that as settling velocity ω increases the peak of the mean concentration increases the reason is the tracer molecules become heavy and unable to move forward easily with the enhancement of settling velocity and it accumulate on the bed surface of the wetland remarkably an upward pattern of the mean concentration profiles are observed with the introduction of settling velocity fig 9 a depicts the profiles of mean concentration for various values of ɛ for both oscillatory tidal flow and tidal flow with nonzero mean it is seen that with the increment of ɛ the mean concentration peak of the settling particle decreases as well expanded more along the longitudinal direction foe purely oscillatory flow this is because with increase in ɛ the domination of oscillation enhances as a result mixing of tracer with the flow becomes fast moreover a sudden drop in the mean concentration peak is found for combined flow and the effect of ɛ becomes insignificant a reverse trend is obtained on the mean concentration distribution for oscillation reynolds number γ in compare to that of in fig 9 a this is because as frequency grows the process of dispersion becomes slower in fig 9 c it is observed that as dimensionless periodic time increases the frequency decreases as a result the mean concentration profile reduces also the similar phenomena is noticed when r increases see fig 9 d in all cases as shown in fig 9 it is important to note that the effects of the various flow parameters becomes insignificant for tidal flow with nonzero mean the influence of dispersion times on the mean concentration profiles is presented in fig 10 for both tidal and combined flow it is seen from the figures that as time progresses the amplitude of the concentration distribution reduces but the expansion of the distribution along the longitudinal direction enhances this is because as time grows the tracer molecules is assimilated with the flow more and thus the profiles of the mean concentration distribution become flat but it is interesting to note that the strength of the concentration significantly diminishes and the longitudinal expansion of the tracer distribution prominently enhances for tidal flow with nonzero mean in comparison with purely tidal flow the effect of settling velocity on variation of concentration c with spatial variables x x g and z is illustrated in fig 11 it is clearly observed that concentration of the fine particles move towards the bed surface z 0 from the free surface z 1 not only that the strength of the concentration enhances as the fall velocity increases 6 conclusion in this research the transport phenomena of fine settling particles in a tidal wetland flow is investigated a velocity distribution is constructed for a tidal wetland channel flow which is depends on vertical coordinate z and dispersion time t the method of moments due to aris is used to observe the mass transport phenomena of solute in a tidal depth dominated wetland by solving the convection diffusion equation with the aid of a finite difference implicit scheme the impacts of different parameters on environmental dispersion coefficient and longitudinal mean concentration are observed for purely tidal flow and tidal flow with nonzero mean some significant observations are given below a for small dispersion time the amplitude of the taylor dispersivity is fluctuating though after a certain time it achieves its stationary state for both tidal flow and tidal flow with nonzero mean b with the enhancement of vegetation parameter the environmental dispersivity decreases for both the flows c the magnitude of the dispersion coefficient decreases as settling velocity of the tracer particle increases d with the enhancement of r the initial position of the dispersion coefficient shifts upwards and after a certain time it becomes stationary for both the flows since the longitudinal diffusion is dominated over the vertical diffusion e with the increment of γ pulsation in the transport coefficient d a diminishes with a right hand shift along the temporal direction f the mean concentration distribution remain unaltered for purely tidal wetland flow with the increasing values of settling velocity on the other hand peak of the mean concentration profile increases as settling velocity enhances for tidal wetland flow with nonzero mean g the peak of the mean concentration profile enhances for both the flows with the increment of resisting vegetation force h as time progresses the amplitude of the concentration distribution reduces but the expansion of the distribution along the longitudinal direction enhances i the concentration strength of the contaminant remarkably reduces and the longitudinal expansion prominently increases for tidal flow with nonzero mean in compare to that of in purely tidal flow credit

2653,during the last decades significant changes in runoff q have been reported in many regions and attributing the changes is of great significance for water resource management the conventionally used elasticity method based on the budyko hypothesis neglects the impacts of climate seasonality on annual q change δq and it is not yet well understood how the climate change and anthropogenic activities influence seasonal q therefore we propose a framework based on the abcd model to explicitly identify the effects of climate change and anthropogenic disturbance on annual and seasonal δq and further apply it in 191 catchments across china from 1960 to 2000 the trend in annual q exhibits a significant α 0 05 decreasing trend in most northern catchments and increasing trend in some catchments of the lower reaches of yangtze river and southeast basin the trend in seasonal q in the northern catchments shows decreasing trend during all seasons while most in the southern catchments shows increasing trend especially in summer regarding the causes for annual δq climate change has positive and negative effects in 60 and 40 catchments respectively and is the dominant factor in the catchments of the yangtze river basin southeast basin and pearl river basin human activities have positive and negative effects in 20 and 80 catchments respectively and are the dominant factor in north china precipitation is the dominant climatic driver in 72 catchments for the causes for seasonal δq climate change increases q in southeastern catchments during all seasons while it decreases q in northern catchments during autumn and winter human activities decrease q in more than half of the catchments except in winter the climate seasonality cannot be ignored and our proposed framework is superior to the elasticity method in capturing the impacts of climate seasonality on δq the elasticity method causes more than 5 deviation of the contribution ratio of climate change to δq in 48 catchments in addition this framework is reliable on multi annual timescales and provides important reference for water resource management keywords runoff change attribution analysis climate change human activities climate seasonality data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction runoff q is the main freshwater resource available for human life and plays a vital role in hydrological cycle remarkable changing trends of recorded q have been detected in different regions worldwide dai 2021 labat et al 2004 mccabe and wolock 2002 zhang et al 2016 climate change such as the variation in precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration e 0 budyko 1974 dooge 1992 and human activities such as land use cover change reservoir operations or direct surface and ground water intakes chang et al 2016 sterling et al 2013 tomer and schilling 2009 are two main factors that alter q ipcc 2013 piao et al 2010 roderick and farquhar 2011 wagener et al 2010 wang and hejazi 2011 attributing the climatic and anthropogenic effects on runoff change δ q is beneficial to understand hydrological processes and facilitate water resources management three categories of methods namely statistical methods process based models and conceptual models have been developed to investigate the effects of climate change and human activities on δ q huang et al 2016 yang et al 2022 the statistical methods depict the relationships among driving variables and q by using a regression model mohammed et al 2016 or machine learning model li et al 2020a based on long term historical data it is noteworthy that this category of methods lies more on the empirical side and is limited to the underlying physical processes yermolaev et al 2021 the process based models generally have strict physical mechanisms chen et al 2019 jiao et al 2017 xu et al 2013 they are superior in depicting the spatiotemporal variability of terrain soil and vegetation devia et al 2015 but often limited to high uncertainties coming from a large number of model parameters li et al 2010 complex model structures chang et al 2016 and high computational costs zhan et al 2014b the conceptual models generalize catchments and hydrological processes with advantages of simple parameterizations low data requirements and computational burdens shahid et al 2017 among the conceptual models the elasticity method schaake 1990 based on the budyko framework budyko 1974 a conceptual bottom up model linking long term mean actual evapotranspiration e to p and e 0 with only one parameter has been widely used due to its simple universal and transparent characteristics liu et al 2021 luo et al 2020 roderick and farquhar 2011 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 yang and yang 2011 however it is noteworthy that the commonly used elasticity method based on the budyko framework neglects the changes in climate seasonality when quantifying annual δ q which causes that the impacts of climate seasonality change are incorrectly embedded into that of human activities yang et al 2012 in fact changes in annual q are not only directly caused by variations of climatic mean but also caused by the climate seasonality i e how p and e 0 interact on seasonal timescales milly 1994 feng et al 2019 feng et al 2012 interpreted that a stronger climate seasonality results in more q and less e due to increasing leakage and deep percolation through soil water storage variation potter et al 2005 also climate seasonality have impacts on co 2 fertilization effect hovenden et al 2019 and soil respiration ru et al 2018 which affect vegetation water use strategies growth and spatial distribution vico et al 2015 and consequently alter the hydrological process through evaporation and interception thus climate seasonality is propagated to q besides many other studies have also confirmed that climate seasonality fairly affects catchment water balance gnann et al 2020 he et al 2021 potter and chiew 2011 liu et al 2018 ning et al 2017 therefore hydrological modeling can be improved with consideration of climate seasonality for example yang et al 2012 improved the estimation of actual evaporation by introducing one climate seasonality index into water energy balance equation de lavenne and andréassian 2018 developed a non parametric index to delineate the synchronicity of p and e 0 and incorporated it into water balance formulas which leads to a significant improvement in investigation of catchment water yield china has a vast territory with diverse climate types and the climate seasonality has changed significantly in recent years ning et al 2021 concurrently human activities such as dam construction water intake and afforestation have become more intensive since the 1980s the effects of climate change and human activities on catchment water balance exhibit regional heterogeneity shen et al 2017 wu et al 2018 previous studies show that human activities are the dominant driver for annual q decline in northern china such as in the songhua river wang et al 2015 liaohe river wang et al 2020a haihe river xu et al 2014 and weihe river basin zhan et al 2014b and their impacts are even in escalation wang et al 2020a conversely climate change especially rainfall variation is the main cause for δ q in southern china such as in the yangtze river piao et al 2010 and dongjiang river basin zhou et al 2018 however previous studies generally focused on regional or annual q while the uneven seasonal distribution of water resources directly affects the divergence of water utilization and management in different months and is highly related to extreme hydrological events li et al 2020b therefore to what extent climate change and human activities affect national and seasonal δ q is worth exploring overall the effects of climate seasonality on annual q should be considered and nationwide investigation on multi timescales is needed here the objectives of this study are to i introduce a simple framework to quantify the climatic and anthropogenic contributions to δ q ii apply this framework to separate the impacts of climate change and human activities on annual and seasonal q over china this framework is based on a monthly conceptual hydrological model i e the abcd model thomas 1981 which implicitly embeds the intra annual meteorological information by taking monthly forcings as inputs the data and methodology are introduced in section 2 the results are shown in section 3 followed by discussion in section 4 the conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 data and methodology 2 1 data precipitation data at 0 25 spatial resolution were obtained from the china gauge based daily precipitation analysis cgdpa shen and xiong 2016 meteorological data including wind speed sunshine hours relative humidity and air temperature were collected from approximately 736 stations from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn en last access 11 november 2021 the in site meteorological data were interpolated into 10 km grid by yang et al 2014 with the inverse distance weighted method to estimate e 0 of each grid we use the penman equation penman 1948 which is widely used in the estimation of of large scale surface evaporation eagleson 2002 all grid data were aggregated and lumped for individual catchments at monthly and annual scale the discharge data covering 1960 to 2000 were collected from the hydrological bureau of the ministry of water resources of china https www mwr gov cn english last access 20 december 2021 selected based on the length of records exceeding 35 years a total of 212 catchments were identified previous studies indicated that abrupt changes in observed runoff occurred around the 1980 s in many catchments across china bao et al 2012 wang et al 2020a xu et al 2014 therefore we split the whole study period into two sub periods the base period from 1960 to 1980 and the disturbed period from 1981 to 2000 a quality control based on simulation using the abcd model was carried out to select catchments with limited impacts from data problems such as measurement errors and hydrological station datum change in the base period since we have little information about the causes for data problems the quality check here relied on the observed runoff data yang et al 2020 therefore it was assumed that the impacts from data problems could be neglected in the catchment where the model performs well with nash sutcliffe efficiency nse greater than 0 6 moriasi et al 2007 in calibration and validation the parameters of the abcd model were calibrated according to the monthly q during 1960 1975 and validated based on that during 1976 1980 for each catchment the nse of the abcd model in 212 catchments is shown in fig a1 finally 191 catchments remained and their outlets are shown in fig 1 the mean annual q from 1960 to 2000 in 191 catchments spans from 29 to 1680 mm with a typical spatial discrepancy between northern and southern china the catchment area spans from 233 to 1 705 383 km2 with a median of 6 420 km2 2 2 the attribution framework based on the abcd model 2 2 1 the abcd model the abcd model is a nonlinear hydrological model with only four parameters i e a b c d which was first introduced by thomas 1981 on annual scale and subsequently extended to the monthly scale alley 1984 fernandez et al 2000 this model can capture the dynamics of the baseflow groundwater soil water e and q simultaneously the abcd model explicitly considers the main hydrological processes and has been widely applied in hydrological analyses sankarasubramanian et al 2001 shahid et al 2017 wang and zhou 2016 xin et al 2019 the model simplifies the catchment as two tanks namely soil layer and groundwater layer and defines two state variables i e available water denoted as w t and evapotranspiration opportunity denoted as y t which can be estimated as 1 w t p t s t 1 2 y t e t s t where pt and et are the precipitation and actual evapotranspiration in period t respectively st 1 and st are the soil moisture storage at the beginning and end of period t respectively yt is assumed to be a nonlinear formula of wt 3 y t w t w t b 2 a w t b 2 a 2 w t b a where parameter a 0 a 1 describes the propensity of runoff to occur before the soil is fully saturated thomas 1981 and parameter b limits the sum of evapotranspiration and soil moisture storage sankarasubramanian et al 2001 the allocation of yt between et and st is determined by postulating that the ratio of loss of soil moisture to evapotranspiration is proportional to the soil moisture storage i e ds dt e 0 s b so we can solve this differential equation with the assumption of st 1 yt and have the following 4 s t y t e x p e 0 t b where e 0 t is the potential evapotranspiration in period t the parameter c allocates the available water for runoff wt yt into groundwater recharge c wt yt and direct runoff 1 c wt yt the groundwater discharge to runoff is estimated as a linear relationship dgt through parameter d where gt is the groundwater storage at the end of period t therefore gt is estimated as 5 g t g t 1 c w t y t d g t finally the total runoff qt can be estimated as the sum of direct runoff and groundwater discharge 6 q t 1 c w t y t d g t in this study the initial soil water and groundwater storage were determined through multiple iterations and model preheating model parameters are optimized by employing genetic algorithm goldberg 1989 the calibration objective is to maximize the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 which can be expressed as 7 n s e 1 i 1 j q o b s i q s i m i 2 i 1 j q o b s i q o b s 2 where j is the recorded length q obs i is the observed runoff q sim i is the simulated runoff by the abcd model and q o b s is the mean observed runoff when the nse is equal to 1 it indicates a perfect match between the estimated runoff and the observed data 2 2 2 the attribution framework estimation according to monthly variables based on the abcd model we propose a simple framework to quantify the contributions of climate change and human activities to mean annual and seasonal δ q the total runoff change δ q t is calculated as the difference of observed runoff in two periods 8 δ q t q o b s 2 q o b s 1 where δ q t is the total runoff change and q o b s 1 and is q o b s 2 the mean observed runoff in the base period and the disturbed period respectively denoting the abcd model as a function f the simulated runoff in the base period can be expressed as 9 q s i m 1 f p 1 e 01 a 1 b 1 c 1 d 1 where q sim1 p 1 and e 01 are the monthly simulated runoff precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in the base period assuming that the topography and soil properties of the catchments do not vary in the two periods i e the parameters of the abcd model remain unchanged the simulated runoff in the disturbed period can be calculated as 10 q s i m 2 f p 2 e 02 a 1 b 1 c 1 d 1 where q sim2 p 2 and e 02 are the monthly simulated runoff precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in the disturbed period therefore the climate induced runoff change δ q c is the difference of the simulated runoff between the two periods 11 δ q c q s i m 2 q s i m 1 where δ q c is the climate change induced runoff change q s i m 1 and q s i m 2 are the mean simulated runoff in the base period and the disturbed period respectively the human activity induced runoff change δ q h is estimated by subtracting the δ q c from the δ q t 12 δ q h δ q t δ q c where δ q h is the human activity induced runoff change the relative contribution ratios of climate change and human activities to runoff change are calculated as 13a η c δ q c δ q c δ q h 100 13b η h δ q h δ q c δ q h 100 where η c and η h are the relative contribution ratios of climate change and human activities to runoff change respectively to further quantify the effects of p and e 0 on δ q we use scenarios p 1 e 01 and p 2 e 02 to represent the climate state in the base period and that in the disturbed period respectively specifically assuming that e 0 does not change during the two periods i e p 1 e 01 and p 2 e 01 the difference between f p 1 e 01 and f p 2 e 01 is the contribution of p to δ q analogously the difference between scenarios f p 1 e 01 and f p 1 e 02 is the contribution of e 0 to δ q the above procedure can be formulated as 14a δ q p f p 2 e 01 f p 1 e 01 14b δ q e 0 f p 1 e 02 f p 1 e 01 where δ q p and δ q e 0 are the precipitation induced runoff change and potential evapotranspiration induced runoff change respectively 2 2 3 the attribution framework estimation according to multi annual monthly variables to investigate the applicability of this proposed framework based on the long term mean hydro meteorological scenario we used multi annual average monthly p e 0 and q instead of the observed monthly series as inputs i e the multi annual average monthly p e 0 and q are repeated every year as new data series the above procedure can be formulated as 15 x m 1 m k 1 m x k m where x m is the average p e 0 and q in month m x k m is the p e 0 and q in year k and month m and m is the number of years the simulated q under the long term mean hydro meteorological scenario then becomes 16a q s i m 1 f p 1 e 01 a 1 b 1 c 1 d 1 16b q s i m 2 f p 2 e 02 a 1 b 1 c 1 d 1 where q s i m 1 and q s i m 2 are monthly simulated runoff under the long term mean hydro meteorological scenario a 1 b 1 c 1 and d 1 are the recalibrated parameters of the abcd model in the base period the contributions of climate change and human activities to annual δ q are calculated as described in section 2 2 2 2 3 the elasticity method based on budyko hypothesis the budyko hypothesis budyko 1974 is acknowledged as a definite and effective approach to depict catchment water balance donohue et al 2007 and various equations have been developed to describe the hypothesis choudhury 1999 fu 1981 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2001 here we combine the budyko equation proposed by choudhury 1999 and yang et al 2008 and the long term water balance to estimate mean annual runoff 17 q p e p p e 0 p n e 0 n 1 n where q is the mean annual runoff p is the mean annual precipitation e is the mean annual actual evapotranspiration e 0 is the mean annual potential evapotranspiration and n is the dimensionless parameter encoding the catchment landscape characteristics such as soil properties topography and vegetation the n can be inverted through eq 17 when we know q p and e 0 postulating p e 0 and n are independent i e there is no covariation between each two paired variables the runoff change induced by climate i e p and e 0 can be calculated as milly and dunne 2002 18 δ q c q p δ p q e 0 δ e 0 where q p and q e 0 are precipitation elasticity and potential evapotranspiration elasticity respectively q p and q e 0 are derived as 19a q p 1 e 0 n 1 p n e 0 n 1 1 n 19b q e 0 p n 1 p n e 0 n 1 1 n δ q t and δ q h are calculated as shown in eq 8 and eq 12 respectively 3 results 3 1 trend analysis of runoff as shown in fig 1 the mean annual q spans from 29 to 1680 mm in 191 catchments the lowest values less than 100 mm appear in most catchments of the yellow river basin and the haihe river basin while the largest values larger than 1000 mm can be found mainly in the southeast basin the nonparametric mann kendall s test mann 1945 kendall 1975 and theil sen median trend analysis theil 2005 were used to detect trends of annual and seasonal q as shown in fig 2 generally the changes in q exhibit an obvious spatial distribution i e increasing trends in most southern catchments and decreasing trends in most northern catchments more specifically a significant decreasing trend α 0 05 can be detected mainly in the yellow river and the upper reaches of yangtze river with a decreasing rate of 0 64 3 18 mm year while a significant increasing trend α 0 05 mainly occurs in some catchments of the lower reaches of yangtze river and southeast basin with an increasing rate of 6 31 12 64 mm year regarding seasonal q trend fig 2 b e most northern catchments show decreasing trend during all seasons with average rate of 0 17 1 0 0 53 and 0 18 mm year in spring summer autumn and winter however some catchments in the source of the yellow river show increasing trend in spring which may be the results of significant increase of snow cover in this region li et al 2021 in the catchments of the yangtze river and south region most present increasing trend especially in summer while the catchments of the upper yangtze river shows decreasing trend which may be related to the opposite change of summer rainfall in the two regions of the yangtze river ye et al 2018 3 2 attribution of annual runoff change the parameters a b c and d of the abcd model in each catchment are shown in fig a2 the estimated δ q c and δ q h based on our proposed framework from the base period 1960 1980 to the disturbed period 1981 2000 are shown in fig 3 climate change decreases q mainly in the catchments of haihe river basin the middle reaches of yangtze river and the pearl river basin the largest contribution of climate change larger than 50 mm can be detected in most catchments of the southeast china meanwhile human activities decrease mean annual q in most catchments where 0 50 mm and more than 50 mm reduction of mean annual q are estimated in 109 57 and 42 22 catchments respectively fig 4 shows the relative contribution ratios of climate change and human activities to annual δ q calculated by our proposed framework climate change is the dominant factor in 106 55 catchments which mainly distributed in the catchments of the yangtze river basin southeast basin and pearl river basin fig 4 a human activities are the dominant factor in north china showing negative effects on annual q mainly in the catchments of the haihe river basin yellow river basin and huaihe river basin fig 4 b notably climate change and human activities jointly decrease q in the catchments of the haihe river basin huaihe river basin and southwest basin fig 5 shows the η c obtained by our framework versus the elasticity method which overall show a good consistency with the coefficient of determination r2 of 0 91 implying the two methodologies can receive similar results however the difference of the η c calculated by our proposed framework and the elasticity method δ η c is more than 10 in 61 32 catchments this may be due to the neglect of climate seasonality changes of the elasticity method and this is discussed in section 4 2 fig 6 clearly shows a distinct spatial heterogeneity in the contributions of p and e 0 to δ q the δ q is controlled by p variation in 137 72 catchments across china the enhancement of p makes a great increase in q with an average of 31 mm in the catchments of the songliao river basin and southeast china on the other hand the p has an average negative contribution of 35 mm to δ q in other catchments especially in the huaihe river basin and pearl river basin fig 6 a e 0 increases annual q across china with an average positive contribution of 20 mm to δ q in 172 90 catchments fig 6 b 3 3 attribution of seasonal runoff change the contributions of climate change and human activities to seasonal δ q show pronounced temporal dynamic and spatial heterogeneity figs 7 and 8 generally the effects of climate change show an obvious difference from east to west and south to north similar pattern can be found in autumn and winter fig 7 c and d i e climate change has more than 50 positive contribution to seasonal δ q in the southeast china and negative contribution in the yellow river the upper middle reaches of yangtze river and the southwest basin in spring and summer fig 7 a and b climate change increases q in catchments of the yellow river regarding the impacts of human activities they have negative effects on seasonal q in more than half of the catchments except in winter specifically human activities reduce q in 160 84 catchments in spring fig 8 a and mainly increase q in southeast china during summer and autumn fig 8 b and c differently they have positive contribution in most catchments in winter especially in the yellow river basin and yangtze river basin fig 8 d 3 4 attribution according to multi annual monthly variables the parameters of the abcd model can be calibrated according to multi annual average monthly p e 0 and q the re calibrated nse is more than 0 7 in all catchments with an median value of 0 94 in addition the estimated η c based on the multi annual average monthly series denoted as η c m e a n is highly consistent with that based on the observed monthly series denoted as η c m o n r2 0 95 as shown in fig 9 this means that our proposed framework is reliable to quantify the impacts of climate change and human activities on annual δ q only based on the long term mean hydro meteorological scenario 4 discussion 4 1 dominant drivers of runoff change across china this study found that climate change contributes more than 50 to annual δ q mainly in the catchments of the yangtze river basin the southeast basin and the pearl river basin while human activities have major contribution in other catchments especially in the north china similarly previous studies reported that climate change plays a dominant role in δ q in south and southeast china such as in the upper hanjiang river sun et al 2014 upper yangtze river ahmed et al 2021 and dongjiang river basin zhou et al 2018 human activities are the main causes for q decline in north china such as in the haihe river xu et al 2014 songhua river wang et al 2020a and weihe river basin zhan et al 2014b different from special regional analyses this study focuses on the whole china and provides a more comprehensive and systematic pattern about the attribution of δ q on a national scale the results imply different focuses in different catchments i e it is more vital to explore future water resources changes under different climate scenarios in the catchments where climate change dominates δ q moreover close attention should be paid to water resources management and operation in the catchments where anthropogenic impacts are more considerable bao et al 2012 regarding the specific meteorological effects our results show that p is the dominant reason for annual δ q in most catchments which is similar to the results of huang et al 2016 and yang and yang 2011 the spatial variation in p found in previous studies piao et al 2010 su et al 2004 is similar to that of the δ q p in this study the decreasing p causes q to decline in the upper reaches of yangtze huaihe and yellow river baisn and increasing p leads to more q in the southeast regions the possible cause for p variation is that more moisture has been transported from southern to northern china in the past four decades owing to the westward movement of south asian high zhang et al 2011 and the shift of east asian summer monsoon gao et al 2015 additionally our results reveal that e 0 has a positive impact on δ q in most catchments which is caused by the overall decreasing trend of e 0 in china during recent decades liu et al 2012 yin et al 2009 for seasonal δ q attribution our results show obvious regional and seasonal divergences climate change makes q increase in south china especially in summer this result is possibly because of more extreme precipitation events and summer rainfall in the middle lower reaches of yangtze river ye et al 2018 as shown in fig 8 seasonal δ q is partly dominated by anthropogenic activities which appears as various forms in different seasons in spring human activities are mainly in the form of water diversion from reservoirs and rivers for irrigating crops such as wheat and rape which directly decrease q in summer and autumn the water and soil conservation measures increase vegetation coverage soil water storage capacity and precipitation interception thus rendering more water consumption and evapotranspiration brown et al 2005 zhang 2015 zhang et al 2001 consequently causing a decrease in q additionally reservoirs buffer flow peaks and increase evaporation due to storage leading to an ensuing decline of q in summer and autumn in winter the influence of reservoir regulation becomes relatively dominant mainly due to low rainfall this means that discrepant climatic and anthropogenic impacts on seasonal δ q require finer intra annual water management 4 2 the strength of the proposed framework although the η c obtained by the elasticity method and our proposed framework show overall consistency the δ η c in 61 32 catchments are more than 10 fig 5 the cause is speculated to be that the elasticity method based on the budyko hypothesis commonly neglects the influence of climate seasonality change which is implicitly encoded by taking monthly p and e 0 as inputs in our proposed framework to assess the rationality of our proposed framework to capture the impacts of climate seasonality we designed a qualitative experiment based on the climate seasonality index si woods 2003 seasonal changes of p and e 0 can be illustrated as sinusoidal function milly 1994 20a p t p 1 δ p sin ω t 20b e 0 t e 0 1 δ e 0 sin ω t where p t and e 0 t are monthly p and e 0 in month t p and e 0 are mean monthly p and e 0 in each year δ p and δ e 0 are amplitudes of the seasonal p and e 0 respectively which range from 1 to 1 larger absolute amplitude values suggest stronger intra annual variability of climatic elements ω is the duration of the seasonal cycle and 2 π ω is equal to one year outside the tropics following milly 1994 woods 2003 defined the climate seasonality index si 21 s i δ p δ e 0 e 0 p si reflects the seasonal fluctuation of the difference between p and e 0 larger values of si indicate larger changes of the synchronicity between p and e 0 during the seasonal cycle so we use si to illustrate the seasonal interaction of p and e 0 and detailed information on the experiment is given in appendix b the change of si δ s i between the base period 1960 1980 and the disturbed period 1981 2000 varies from 0 54 to 0 17 across china fig b2 according to yang et al 2012 the parameter n of the budyko formula will decrease with increasing si further resulting in an increase in q therefore we can speculate a theoretical deduction i e compared to our proposed framework the elasticity method will underestimate the δ q c when si increases and vice versa to test the theoretical deduction the results of the qualitative experiment based on 191 catchments are listed in table 1 the results from more than 70 catchments are identical to the theoretical deduction under six different thresholds of the absolute value of si δ s i and this proportion becomes larger as the threshold of δ s i increases implying that the more significant the climate seasonality varies the more prominent effects of it on δ q presents for example at the threshold of δ s i 0 06 the elasticity method leads to a 10 5 overestimation and 7 3 underestimation of the η c remarkably the results from 16 to 28 catchments do not support the theoretical deduction which might be caused by some factors not included in the proposed framework such as rainfall intensity milly 1994 frozen ground degradation wang et al 2018 and snow fraction liu et al 2022 this result indicates that under the conditions that climatic factors have significant variations in seasonality our proposed framework is superior to the elasticity method in capturing the impacts of climate change on q in previous studies using the elasticity method chang et al 2016 li and zhou 2016 zhan et al 2014a the contribution of human activities was considered as the remainder of the total δ q and the contribution of climate change which leads to the impacts of climate seasonality change being incorrectly attributed into the contribution of human activities according to table 1 there are 161 catchments where si has changed among which 116 catchments support the theoretical deduction the inset panel in fig 10 shows the frequency distribution of the δ η c in these 116 catchments compared with our proposed framework the elasticity method gave rise to more than 5 deviation of η c in 48 catchments among which 28 catchments received more than 10 deviation of η c additionally fig 10 shows that among 116 catchments there are 6 catchments where the elasticity method misjudged the dominant factor of δ q this implies that in catchments with significant climate seasonality change the elasticity method might not accurately identify the dominant driver of q variation also our results show that the proposed framework is reliable to quantify δ q by taking multi annual monthly variables and their changes together with the model parameters this approach greatly inspired a new perspective to study attribution of δ q in poorly gauged catchments where only multi annual hydro meteorological information and their changes are available in poorly gauged catchments the parameters of hydrological models can be determined by the nearest neighbor approach young 2006 catchment attribute similarity and multiple regression yokoo et al 2001 4 3 uncertainties it is noteworthy that the attribution results include some uncertainties in this study one part of the uncertainties come from the model structures and parameters the abcd model does not encode all hydrological processes such as shallow groundwater evaporation chen et al 2020 and snowmelt wang et al 2020b which are significant in the arid and cold regions respectively although the simplification of the conceptual model improves calculation efficiency it loses some concrete meteorology hydrology responses especially in complicated catchments the parameters of the abcd model have not been fully explained for example parameter a is highly related to evapotranspiration and always close to 1 whereas the physical interpretation remains unclear alley 1984 another part of uncertainties come from data processing such as different data interpolation methods and different equations used to estimate e 0 additionally we roughly separate the whole study period by the same time point of 1980 in all catchments however the abrupt changes in q may occur in different years among different catchments the division of different study periods possibly causes divergence in the results in this study we only detected the impacts of climate seasonality by qualitative analysis it is necessary to further explore the quantitative contribution of climate seasonality to hydrological processes in future 5 conclusion the commonly used elasticity method does not consider the impact of climate seasonality change which leads to incorrectly attributing it into the contribution of human activities when quantifying annual δ q yang et al 2012 therefore we proposed a new attribution framework based on the monthly abcd model and conducted a systematic attribution assessment of annual and seasonal δ q from 1960 to 2000 in 191 catchments across china the major conclusions are drawn as follows the trend in annual q exhibits a significant α 0 05 decreasing rate of 0 64 3 18 mm year in most northern catchments and an increasing rate of 6 31 12 64 mm year in some southern catchments respectively regarding seasonal q trend the northern catchments show decreasing trend during all seasons with average rate of 0 17 1 0 0 53 and 0 18 mm year in spring summer autumn and winter in the southern catchments most show increasing trend especially in summer for causes for annual δ q climate change has positive and negative effects in 60 and 40 catchments respectively and is the dominant factor in 106 55 catchments which mainly distributed in the catchments of the yangtze river basin southeast basin and pearl river basin human activities have positive and negative effects in 20 and 80 catchments respectively and are the dominant factor in north china p is the dominant climatic driver of annual δ q in 72 catchments for causes for seasonal δ q climate change increases q in southeastern catchments during all seasons while it decreases q in northern catchments during autumn and winter and in the upper reaches of yangtze river except in summer human activities decrease q in more than half of the catchments except in winter our proposed framework performs well by only using multi annual average monthly variables for attribution and the r2 of the η c obtained by observed and multi annual average monthly data is 0 95 the climate seasonality cannot be ignored and our framework is superior to the elasticity method in capturing the impacts of climate seasonality on runoff changes compared with our framework the elasticity method results in more than 5 deviation of η c in 48 catchments among which 28 catchments received more than 10 deviation of η c the proposed framework takes climate seasonality into account in quantifying δ q and is flexible for studying both annual and seasonal δ q it is also reliable for attribution analysis only based on multi annual monthly variables which indicates that it can be applied in poorly gauged catchments where only multi annual average hydro meteorological data are accessible these findings facilitate the understanding of seasonal hydrological processes and provide more reasonable information for

2653,during the last decades significant changes in runoff q have been reported in many regions and attributing the changes is of great significance for water resource management the conventionally used elasticity method based on the budyko hypothesis neglects the impacts of climate seasonality on annual q change δq and it is not yet well understood how the climate change and anthropogenic activities influence seasonal q therefore we propose a framework based on the abcd model to explicitly identify the effects of climate change and anthropogenic disturbance on annual and seasonal δq and further apply it in 191 catchments across china from 1960 to 2000 the trend in annual q exhibits a significant α 0 05 decreasing trend in most northern catchments and increasing trend in some catchments of the lower reaches of yangtze river and southeast basin the trend in seasonal q in the northern catchments shows decreasing trend during all seasons while most in the southern catchments shows increasing trend especially in summer regarding the causes for annual δq climate change has positive and negative effects in 60 and 40 catchments respectively and is the dominant factor in the catchments of the yangtze river basin southeast basin and pearl river basin human activities have positive and negative effects in 20 and 80 catchments respectively and are the dominant factor in north china precipitation is the dominant climatic driver in 72 catchments for the causes for seasonal δq climate change increases q in southeastern catchments during all seasons while it decreases q in northern catchments during autumn and winter human activities decrease q in more than half of the catchments except in winter the climate seasonality cannot be ignored and our proposed framework is superior to the elasticity method in capturing the impacts of climate seasonality on δq the elasticity method causes more than 5 deviation of the contribution ratio of climate change to δq in 48 catchments in addition this framework is reliable on multi annual timescales and provides important reference for water resource management keywords runoff change attribution analysis climate change human activities climate seasonality data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction runoff q is the main freshwater resource available for human life and plays a vital role in hydrological cycle remarkable changing trends of recorded q have been detected in different regions worldwide dai 2021 labat et al 2004 mccabe and wolock 2002 zhang et al 2016 climate change such as the variation in precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration e 0 budyko 1974 dooge 1992 and human activities such as land use cover change reservoir operations or direct surface and ground water intakes chang et al 2016 sterling et al 2013 tomer and schilling 2009 are two main factors that alter q ipcc 2013 piao et al 2010 roderick and farquhar 2011 wagener et al 2010 wang and hejazi 2011 attributing the climatic and anthropogenic effects on runoff change δ q is beneficial to understand hydrological processes and facilitate water resources management three categories of methods namely statistical methods process based models and conceptual models have been developed to investigate the effects of climate change and human activities on δ q huang et al 2016 yang et al 2022 the statistical methods depict the relationships among driving variables and q by using a regression model mohammed et al 2016 or machine learning model li et al 2020a based on long term historical data it is noteworthy that this category of methods lies more on the empirical side and is limited to the underlying physical processes yermolaev et al 2021 the process based models generally have strict physical mechanisms chen et al 2019 jiao et al 2017 xu et al 2013 they are superior in depicting the spatiotemporal variability of terrain soil and vegetation devia et al 2015 but often limited to high uncertainties coming from a large number of model parameters li et al 2010 complex model structures chang et al 2016 and high computational costs zhan et al 2014b the conceptual models generalize catchments and hydrological processes with advantages of simple parameterizations low data requirements and computational burdens shahid et al 2017 among the conceptual models the elasticity method schaake 1990 based on the budyko framework budyko 1974 a conceptual bottom up model linking long term mean actual evapotranspiration e to p and e 0 with only one parameter has been widely used due to its simple universal and transparent characteristics liu et al 2021 luo et al 2020 roderick and farquhar 2011 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 yang and yang 2011 however it is noteworthy that the commonly used elasticity method based on the budyko framework neglects the changes in climate seasonality when quantifying annual δ q which causes that the impacts of climate seasonality change are incorrectly embedded into that of human activities yang et al 2012 in fact changes in annual q are not only directly caused by variations of climatic mean but also caused by the climate seasonality i e how p and e 0 interact on seasonal timescales milly 1994 feng et al 2019 feng et al 2012 interpreted that a stronger climate seasonality results in more q and less e due to increasing leakage and deep percolation through soil water storage variation potter et al 2005 also climate seasonality have impacts on co 2 fertilization effect hovenden et al 2019 and soil respiration ru et al 2018 which affect vegetation water use strategies growth and spatial distribution vico et al 2015 and consequently alter the hydrological process through evaporation and interception thus climate seasonality is propagated to q besides many other studies have also confirmed that climate seasonality fairly affects catchment water balance gnann et al 2020 he et al 2021 potter and chiew 2011 liu et al 2018 ning et al 2017 therefore hydrological modeling can be improved with consideration of climate seasonality for example yang et al 2012 improved the estimation of actual evaporation by introducing one climate seasonality index into water energy balance equation de lavenne and andréassian 2018 developed a non parametric index to delineate the synchronicity of p and e 0 and incorporated it into water balance formulas which leads to a significant improvement in investigation of catchment water yield china has a vast territory with diverse climate types and the climate seasonality has changed significantly in recent years ning et al 2021 concurrently human activities such as dam construction water intake and afforestation have become more intensive since the 1980s the effects of climate change and human activities on catchment water balance exhibit regional heterogeneity shen et al 2017 wu et al 2018 previous studies show that human activities are the dominant driver for annual q decline in northern china such as in the songhua river wang et al 2015 liaohe river wang et al 2020a haihe river xu et al 2014 and weihe river basin zhan et al 2014b and their impacts are even in escalation wang et al 2020a conversely climate change especially rainfall variation is the main cause for δ q in southern china such as in the yangtze river piao et al 2010 and dongjiang river basin zhou et al 2018 however previous studies generally focused on regional or annual q while the uneven seasonal distribution of water resources directly affects the divergence of water utilization and management in different months and is highly related to extreme hydrological events li et al 2020b therefore to what extent climate change and human activities affect national and seasonal δ q is worth exploring overall the effects of climate seasonality on annual q should be considered and nationwide investigation on multi timescales is needed here the objectives of this study are to i introduce a simple framework to quantify the climatic and anthropogenic contributions to δ q ii apply this framework to separate the impacts of climate change and human activities on annual and seasonal q over china this framework is based on a monthly conceptual hydrological model i e the abcd model thomas 1981 which implicitly embeds the intra annual meteorological information by taking monthly forcings as inputs the data and methodology are introduced in section 2 the results are shown in section 3 followed by discussion in section 4 the conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 data and methodology 2 1 data precipitation data at 0 25 spatial resolution were obtained from the china gauge based daily precipitation analysis cgdpa shen and xiong 2016 meteorological data including wind speed sunshine hours relative humidity and air temperature were collected from approximately 736 stations from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn en last access 11 november 2021 the in site meteorological data were interpolated into 10 km grid by yang et al 2014 with the inverse distance weighted method to estimate e 0 of each grid we use the penman equation penman 1948 which is widely used in the estimation of of large scale surface evaporation eagleson 2002 all grid data were aggregated and lumped for individual catchments at monthly and annual scale the discharge data covering 1960 to 2000 were collected from the hydrological bureau of the ministry of water resources of china https www mwr gov cn english last access 20 december 2021 selected based on the length of records exceeding 35 years a total of 212 catchments were identified previous studies indicated that abrupt changes in observed runoff occurred around the 1980 s in many catchments across china bao et al 2012 wang et al 2020a xu et al 2014 therefore we split the whole study period into two sub periods the base period from 1960 to 1980 and the disturbed period from 1981 to 2000 a quality control based on simulation using the abcd model was carried out to select catchments with limited impacts from data problems such as measurement errors and hydrological station datum change in the base period since we have little information about the causes for data problems the quality check here relied on the observed runoff data yang et al 2020 therefore it was assumed that the impacts from data problems could be neglected in the catchment where the model performs well with nash sutcliffe efficiency nse greater than 0 6 moriasi et al 2007 in calibration and validation the parameters of the abcd model were calibrated according to the monthly q during 1960 1975 and validated based on that during 1976 1980 for each catchment the nse of the abcd model in 212 catchments is shown in fig a1 finally 191 catchments remained and their outlets are shown in fig 1 the mean annual q from 1960 to 2000 in 191 catchments spans from 29 to 1680 mm with a typical spatial discrepancy between northern and southern china the catchment area spans from 233 to 1 705 383 km2 with a median of 6 420 km2 2 2 the attribution framework based on the abcd model 2 2 1 the abcd model the abcd model is a nonlinear hydrological model with only four parameters i e a b c d which was first introduced by thomas 1981 on annual scale and subsequently extended to the monthly scale alley 1984 fernandez et al 2000 this model can capture the dynamics of the baseflow groundwater soil water e and q simultaneously the abcd model explicitly considers the main hydrological processes and has been widely applied in hydrological analyses sankarasubramanian et al 2001 shahid et al 2017 wang and zhou 2016 xin et al 2019 the model simplifies the catchment as two tanks namely soil layer and groundwater layer and defines two state variables i e available water denoted as w t and evapotranspiration opportunity denoted as y t which can be estimated as 1 w t p t s t 1 2 y t e t s t where pt and et are the precipitation and actual evapotranspiration in period t respectively st 1 and st are the soil moisture storage at the beginning and end of period t respectively yt is assumed to be a nonlinear formula of wt 3 y t w t w t b 2 a w t b 2 a 2 w t b a where parameter a 0 a 1 describes the propensity of runoff to occur before the soil is fully saturated thomas 1981 and parameter b limits the sum of evapotranspiration and soil moisture storage sankarasubramanian et al 2001 the allocation of yt between et and st is determined by postulating that the ratio of loss of soil moisture to evapotranspiration is proportional to the soil moisture storage i e ds dt e 0 s b so we can solve this differential equation with the assumption of st 1 yt and have the following 4 s t y t e x p e 0 t b where e 0 t is the potential evapotranspiration in period t the parameter c allocates the available water for runoff wt yt into groundwater recharge c wt yt and direct runoff 1 c wt yt the groundwater discharge to runoff is estimated as a linear relationship dgt through parameter d where gt is the groundwater storage at the end of period t therefore gt is estimated as 5 g t g t 1 c w t y t d g t finally the total runoff qt can be estimated as the sum of direct runoff and groundwater discharge 6 q t 1 c w t y t d g t in this study the initial soil water and groundwater storage were determined through multiple iterations and model preheating model parameters are optimized by employing genetic algorithm goldberg 1989 the calibration objective is to maximize the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 which can be expressed as 7 n s e 1 i 1 j q o b s i q s i m i 2 i 1 j q o b s i q o b s 2 where j is the recorded length q obs i is the observed runoff q sim i is the simulated runoff by the abcd model and q o b s is the mean observed runoff when the nse is equal to 1 it indicates a perfect match between the estimated runoff and the observed data 2 2 2 the attribution framework estimation according to monthly variables based on the abcd model we propose a simple framework to quantify the contributions of climate change and human activities to mean annual and seasonal δ q the total runoff change δ q t is calculated as the difference of observed runoff in two periods 8 δ q t q o b s 2 q o b s 1 where δ q t is the total runoff change and q o b s 1 and is q o b s 2 the mean observed runoff in the base period and the disturbed period respectively denoting the abcd model as a function f the simulated runoff in the base period can be expressed as 9 q s i m 1 f p 1 e 01 a 1 b 1 c 1 d 1 where q sim1 p 1 and e 01 are the monthly simulated runoff precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in the base period assuming that the topography and soil properties of the catchments do not vary in the two periods i e the parameters of the abcd model remain unchanged the simulated runoff in the disturbed period can be calculated as 10 q s i m 2 f p 2 e 02 a 1 b 1 c 1 d 1 where q sim2 p 2 and e 02 are the monthly simulated runoff precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in the disturbed period therefore the climate induced runoff change δ q c is the difference of the simulated runoff between the two periods 11 δ q c q s i m 2 q s i m 1 where δ q c is the climate change induced runoff change q s i m 1 and q s i m 2 are the mean simulated runoff in the base period and the disturbed period respectively the human activity induced runoff change δ q h is estimated by subtracting the δ q c from the δ q t 12 δ q h δ q t δ q c where δ q h is the human activity induced runoff change the relative contribution ratios of climate change and human activities to runoff change are calculated as 13a η c δ q c δ q c δ q h 100 13b η h δ q h δ q c δ q h 100 where η c and η h are the relative contribution ratios of climate change and human activities to runoff change respectively to further quantify the effects of p and e 0 on δ q we use scenarios p 1 e 01 and p 2 e 02 to represent the climate state in the base period and that in the disturbed period respectively specifically assuming that e 0 does not change during the two periods i e p 1 e 01 and p 2 e 01 the difference between f p 1 e 01 and f p 2 e 01 is the contribution of p to δ q analogously the difference between scenarios f p 1 e 01 and f p 1 e 02 is the contribution of e 0 to δ q the above procedure can be formulated as 14a δ q p f p 2 e 01 f p 1 e 01 14b δ q e 0 f p 1 e 02 f p 1 e 01 where δ q p and δ q e 0 are the precipitation induced runoff change and potential evapotranspiration induced runoff change respectively 2 2 3 the attribution framework estimation according to multi annual monthly variables to investigate the applicability of this proposed framework based on the long term mean hydro meteorological scenario we used multi annual average monthly p e 0 and q instead of the observed monthly series as inputs i e the multi annual average monthly p e 0 and q are repeated every year as new data series the above procedure can be formulated as 15 x m 1 m k 1 m x k m where x m is the average p e 0 and q in month m x k m is the p e 0 and q in year k and month m and m is the number of years the simulated q under the long term mean hydro meteorological scenario then becomes 16a q s i m 1 f p 1 e 01 a 1 b 1 c 1 d 1 16b q s i m 2 f p 2 e 02 a 1 b 1 c 1 d 1 where q s i m 1 and q s i m 2 are monthly simulated runoff under the long term mean hydro meteorological scenario a 1 b 1 c 1 and d 1 are the recalibrated parameters of the abcd model in the base period the contributions of climate change and human activities to annual δ q are calculated as described in section 2 2 2 2 3 the elasticity method based on budyko hypothesis the budyko hypothesis budyko 1974 is acknowledged as a definite and effective approach to depict catchment water balance donohue et al 2007 and various equations have been developed to describe the hypothesis choudhury 1999 fu 1981 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2001 here we combine the budyko equation proposed by choudhury 1999 and yang et al 2008 and the long term water balance to estimate mean annual runoff 17 q p e p p e 0 p n e 0 n 1 n where q is the mean annual runoff p is the mean annual precipitation e is the mean annual actual evapotranspiration e 0 is the mean annual potential evapotranspiration and n is the dimensionless parameter encoding the catchment landscape characteristics such as soil properties topography and vegetation the n can be inverted through eq 17 when we know q p and e 0 postulating p e 0 and n are independent i e there is no covariation between each two paired variables the runoff change induced by climate i e p and e 0 can be calculated as milly and dunne 2002 18 δ q c q p δ p q e 0 δ e 0 where q p and q e 0 are precipitation elasticity and potential evapotranspiration elasticity respectively q p and q e 0 are derived as 19a q p 1 e 0 n 1 p n e 0 n 1 1 n 19b q e 0 p n 1 p n e 0 n 1 1 n δ q t and δ q h are calculated as shown in eq 8 and eq 12 respectively 3 results 3 1 trend analysis of runoff as shown in fig 1 the mean annual q spans from 29 to 1680 mm in 191 catchments the lowest values less than 100 mm appear in most catchments of the yellow river basin and the haihe river basin while the largest values larger than 1000 mm can be found mainly in the southeast basin the nonparametric mann kendall s test mann 1945 kendall 1975 and theil sen median trend analysis theil 2005 were used to detect trends of annual and seasonal q as shown in fig 2 generally the changes in q exhibit an obvious spatial distribution i e increasing trends in most southern catchments and decreasing trends in most northern catchments more specifically a significant decreasing trend α 0 05 can be detected mainly in the yellow river and the upper reaches of yangtze river with a decreasing rate of 0 64 3 18 mm year while a significant increasing trend α 0 05 mainly occurs in some catchments of the lower reaches of yangtze river and southeast basin with an increasing rate of 6 31 12 64 mm year regarding seasonal q trend fig 2 b e most northern catchments show decreasing trend during all seasons with average rate of 0 17 1 0 0 53 and 0 18 mm year in spring summer autumn and winter however some catchments in the source of the yellow river show increasing trend in spring which may be the results of significant increase of snow cover in this region li et al 2021 in the catchments of the yangtze river and south region most present increasing trend especially in summer while the catchments of the upper yangtze river shows decreasing trend which may be related to the opposite change of summer rainfall in the two regions of the yangtze river ye et al 2018 3 2 attribution of annual runoff change the parameters a b c and d of the abcd model in each catchment are shown in fig a2 the estimated δ q c and δ q h based on our proposed framework from the base period 1960 1980 to the disturbed period 1981 2000 are shown in fig 3 climate change decreases q mainly in the catchments of haihe river basin the middle reaches of yangtze river and the pearl river basin the largest contribution of climate change larger than 50 mm can be detected in most catchments of the southeast china meanwhile human activities decrease mean annual q in most catchments where 0 50 mm and more than 50 mm reduction of mean annual q are estimated in 109 57 and 42 22 catchments respectively fig 4 shows the relative contribution ratios of climate change and human activities to annual δ q calculated by our proposed framework climate change is the dominant factor in 106 55 catchments which mainly distributed in the catchments of the yangtze river basin southeast basin and pearl river basin fig 4 a human activities are the dominant factor in north china showing negative effects on annual q mainly in the catchments of the haihe river basin yellow river basin and huaihe river basin fig 4 b notably climate change and human activities jointly decrease q in the catchments of the haihe river basin huaihe river basin and southwest basin fig 5 shows the η c obtained by our framework versus the elasticity method which overall show a good consistency with the coefficient of determination r2 of 0 91 implying the two methodologies can receive similar results however the difference of the η c calculated by our proposed framework and the elasticity method δ η c is more than 10 in 61 32 catchments this may be due to the neglect of climate seasonality changes of the elasticity method and this is discussed in section 4 2 fig 6 clearly shows a distinct spatial heterogeneity in the contributions of p and e 0 to δ q the δ q is controlled by p variation in 137 72 catchments across china the enhancement of p makes a great increase in q with an average of 31 mm in the catchments of the songliao river basin and southeast china on the other hand the p has an average negative contribution of 35 mm to δ q in other catchments especially in the huaihe river basin and pearl river basin fig 6 a e 0 increases annual q across china with an average positive contribution of 20 mm to δ q in 172 90 catchments fig 6 b 3 3 attribution of seasonal runoff change the contributions of climate change and human activities to seasonal δ q show pronounced temporal dynamic and spatial heterogeneity figs 7 and 8 generally the effects of climate change show an obvious difference from east to west and south to north similar pattern can be found in autumn and winter fig 7 c and d i e climate change has more than 50 positive contribution to seasonal δ q in the southeast china and negative contribution in the yellow river the upper middle reaches of yangtze river and the southwest basin in spring and summer fig 7 a and b climate change increases q in catchments of the yellow river regarding the impacts of human activities they have negative effects on seasonal q in more than half of the catchments except in winter specifically human activities reduce q in 160 84 catchments in spring fig 8 a and mainly increase q in southeast china during summer and autumn fig 8 b and c differently they have positive contribution in most catchments in winter especially in the yellow river basin and yangtze river basin fig 8 d 3 4 attribution according to multi annual monthly variables the parameters of the abcd model can be calibrated according to multi annual average monthly p e 0 and q the re calibrated nse is more than 0 7 in all catchments with an median value of 0 94 in addition the estimated η c based on the multi annual average monthly series denoted as η c m e a n is highly consistent with that based on the observed monthly series denoted as η c m o n r2 0 95 as shown in fig 9 this means that our proposed framework is reliable to quantify the impacts of climate change and human activities on annual δ q only based on the long term mean hydro meteorological scenario 4 discussion 4 1 dominant drivers of runoff change across china this study found that climate change contributes more than 50 to annual δ q mainly in the catchments of the yangtze river basin the southeast basin and the pearl river basin while human activities have major contribution in other catchments especially in the north china similarly previous studies reported that climate change plays a dominant role in δ q in south and southeast china such as in the upper hanjiang river sun et al 2014 upper yangtze river ahmed et al 2021 and dongjiang river basin zhou et al 2018 human activities are the main causes for q decline in north china such as in the haihe river xu et al 2014 songhua river wang et al 2020a and weihe river basin zhan et al 2014b different from special regional analyses this study focuses on the whole china and provides a more comprehensive and systematic pattern about the attribution of δ q on a national scale the results imply different focuses in different catchments i e it is more vital to explore future water resources changes under different climate scenarios in the catchments where climate change dominates δ q moreover close attention should be paid to water resources management and operation in the catchments where anthropogenic impacts are more considerable bao et al 2012 regarding the specific meteorological effects our results show that p is the dominant reason for annual δ q in most catchments which is similar to the results of huang et al 2016 and yang and yang 2011 the spatial variation in p found in previous studies piao et al 2010 su et al 2004 is similar to that of the δ q p in this study the decreasing p causes q to decline in the upper reaches of yangtze huaihe and yellow river baisn and increasing p leads to more q in the southeast regions the possible cause for p variation is that more moisture has been transported from southern to northern china in the past four decades owing to the westward movement of south asian high zhang et al 2011 and the shift of east asian summer monsoon gao et al 2015 additionally our results reveal that e 0 has a positive impact on δ q in most catchments which is caused by the overall decreasing trend of e 0 in china during recent decades liu et al 2012 yin et al 2009 for seasonal δ q attribution our results show obvious regional and seasonal divergences climate change makes q increase in south china especially in summer this result is possibly because of more extreme precipitation events and summer rainfall in the middle lower reaches of yangtze river ye et al 2018 as shown in fig 8 seasonal δ q is partly dominated by anthropogenic activities which appears as various forms in different seasons in spring human activities are mainly in the form of water diversion from reservoirs and rivers for irrigating crops such as wheat and rape which directly decrease q in summer and autumn the water and soil conservation measures increase vegetation coverage soil water storage capacity and precipitation interception thus rendering more water consumption and evapotranspiration brown et al 2005 zhang 2015 zhang et al 2001 consequently causing a decrease in q additionally reservoirs buffer flow peaks and increase evaporation due to storage leading to an ensuing decline of q in summer and autumn in winter the influence of reservoir regulation becomes relatively dominant mainly due to low rainfall this means that discrepant climatic and anthropogenic impacts on seasonal δ q require finer intra annual water management 4 2 the strength of the proposed framework although the η c obtained by the elasticity method and our proposed framework show overall consistency the δ η c in 61 32 catchments are more than 10 fig 5 the cause is speculated to be that the elasticity method based on the budyko hypothesis commonly neglects the influence of climate seasonality change which is implicitly encoded by taking monthly p and e 0 as inputs in our proposed framework to assess the rationality of our proposed framework to capture the impacts of climate seasonality we designed a qualitative experiment based on the climate seasonality index si woods 2003 seasonal changes of p and e 0 can be illustrated as sinusoidal function milly 1994 20a p t p 1 δ p sin ω t 20b e 0 t e 0 1 δ e 0 sin ω t where p t and e 0 t are monthly p and e 0 in month t p and e 0 are mean monthly p and e 0 in each year δ p and δ e 0 are amplitudes of the seasonal p and e 0 respectively which range from 1 to 1 larger absolute amplitude values suggest stronger intra annual variability of climatic elements ω is the duration of the seasonal cycle and 2 π ω is equal to one year outside the tropics following milly 1994 woods 2003 defined the climate seasonality index si 21 s i δ p δ e 0 e 0 p si reflects the seasonal fluctuation of the difference between p and e 0 larger values of si indicate larger changes of the synchronicity between p and e 0 during the seasonal cycle so we use si to illustrate the seasonal interaction of p and e 0 and detailed information on the experiment is given in appendix b the change of si δ s i between the base period 1960 1980 and the disturbed period 1981 2000 varies from 0 54 to 0 17 across china fig b2 according to yang et al 2012 the parameter n of the budyko formula will decrease with increasing si further resulting in an increase in q therefore we can speculate a theoretical deduction i e compared to our proposed framework the elasticity method will underestimate the δ q c when si increases and vice versa to test the theoretical deduction the results of the qualitative experiment based on 191 catchments are listed in table 1 the results from more than 70 catchments are identical to the theoretical deduction under six different thresholds of the absolute value of si δ s i and this proportion becomes larger as the threshold of δ s i increases implying that the more significant the climate seasonality varies the more prominent effects of it on δ q presents for example at the threshold of δ s i 0 06 the elasticity method leads to a 10 5 overestimation and 7 3 underestimation of the η c remarkably the results from 16 to 28 catchments do not support the theoretical deduction which might be caused by some factors not included in the proposed framework such as rainfall intensity milly 1994 frozen ground degradation wang et al 2018 and snow fraction liu et al 2022 this result indicates that under the conditions that climatic factors have significant variations in seasonality our proposed framework is superior to the elasticity method in capturing the impacts of climate change on q in previous studies using the elasticity method chang et al 2016 li and zhou 2016 zhan et al 2014a the contribution of human activities was considered as the remainder of the total δ q and the contribution of climate change which leads to the impacts of climate seasonality change being incorrectly attributed into the contribution of human activities according to table 1 there are 161 catchments where si has changed among which 116 catchments support the theoretical deduction the inset panel in fig 10 shows the frequency distribution of the δ η c in these 116 catchments compared with our proposed framework the elasticity method gave rise to more than 5 deviation of η c in 48 catchments among which 28 catchments received more than 10 deviation of η c additionally fig 10 shows that among 116 catchments there are 6 catchments where the elasticity method misjudged the dominant factor of δ q this implies that in catchments with significant climate seasonality change the elasticity method might not accurately identify the dominant driver of q variation also our results show that the proposed framework is reliable to quantify δ q by taking multi annual monthly variables and their changes together with the model parameters this approach greatly inspired a new perspective to study attribution of δ q in poorly gauged catchments where only multi annual hydro meteorological information and their changes are available in poorly gauged catchments the parameters of hydrological models can be determined by the nearest neighbor approach young 2006 catchment attribute similarity and multiple regression yokoo et al 2001 4 3 uncertainties it is noteworthy that the attribution results include some uncertainties in this study one part of the uncertainties come from the model structures and parameters the abcd model does not encode all hydrological processes such as shallow groundwater evaporation chen et al 2020 and snowmelt wang et al 2020b which are significant in the arid and cold regions respectively although the simplification of the conceptual model improves calculation efficiency it loses some concrete meteorology hydrology responses especially in complicated catchments the parameters of the abcd model have not been fully explained for example parameter a is highly related to evapotranspiration and always close to 1 whereas the physical interpretation remains unclear alley 1984 another part of uncertainties come from data processing such as different data interpolation methods and different equations used to estimate e 0 additionally we roughly separate the whole study period by the same time point of 1980 in all catchments however the abrupt changes in q may occur in different years among different catchments the division of different study periods possibly causes divergence in the results in this study we only detected the impacts of climate seasonality by qualitative analysis it is necessary to further explore the quantitative contribution of climate seasonality to hydrological processes in future 5 conclusion the commonly used elasticity method does not consider the impact of climate seasonality change which leads to incorrectly attributing it into the contribution of human activities when quantifying annual δ q yang et al 2012 therefore we proposed a new attribution framework based on the monthly abcd model and conducted a systematic attribution assessment of annual and seasonal δ q from 1960 to 2000 in 191 catchments across china the major conclusions are drawn as follows the trend in annual q exhibits a significant α 0 05 decreasing rate of 0 64 3 18 mm year in most northern catchments and an increasing rate of 6 31 12 64 mm year in some southern catchments respectively regarding seasonal q trend the northern catchments show decreasing trend during all seasons with average rate of 0 17 1 0 0 53 and 0 18 mm year in spring summer autumn and winter in the southern catchments most show increasing trend especially in summer for causes for annual δ q climate change has positive and negative effects in 60 and 40 catchments respectively and is the dominant factor in 106 55 catchments which mainly distributed in the catchments of the yangtze river basin southeast basin and pearl river basin human activities have positive and negative effects in 20 and 80 catchments respectively and are the dominant factor in north china p is the dominant climatic driver of annual δ q in 72 catchments for causes for seasonal δ q climate change increases q in southeastern catchments during all seasons while it decreases q in northern catchments during autumn and winter and in the upper reaches of yangtze river except in summer human activities decrease q in more than half of the catchments except in winter our proposed framework performs well by only using multi annual average monthly variables for attribution and the r2 of the η c obtained by observed and multi annual average monthly data is 0 95 the climate seasonality cannot be ignored and our framework is superior to the elasticity method in capturing the impacts of climate seasonality on runoff changes compared with our framework the elasticity method results in more than 5 deviation of η c in 48 catchments among which 28 catchments received more than 10 deviation of η c the proposed framework takes climate seasonality into account in quantifying δ q and is flexible for studying both annual and seasonal δ q it is also reliable for attribution analysis only based on multi annual monthly variables which indicates that it can be applied in poorly gauged catchments where only multi annual average hydro meteorological data are accessible these findings facilitate the understanding of seasonal hydrological processes and provide more reasonable information for

2654,understanding the morphological erraticism for large braided river systems is still a challenging issue in the present era of fluvial geomorphology the present paper reports thorough spatio temporal variability of sand bar dynamics 2000 2019 and their influence on the braided belt disorderness in the large braided brahmaputra river the sand bar area is detected using the modified normalized difference water index mndwi and an entropy based intensity disorder index idi is further proposed to measure the spatio temporal disorderness in the post monsoon period the idi varies at a lowest value of less than 0 5 to a highest value of more than 0 9 for the selected study reach interestingly idi displays a declining trend for the first decade followed by an increasing trend in the subsequent time slice which signals the large scale heterogeneity in process form interactions for the brahmaputra an attempt was made to establish relationship between idi stream power derivatives monsoon peak flood and post monsoon and bar area classes in order to facilitate a process based understanding of the geomorphic adjustments in comparison with other stream power derivatives the peak flood stream power showed a better correlation with the disorderness measure of the reach finally this study has highlighted that smaller highly immobile bars have significant control on the idi variations and govern the yearly planform disorderness of the brahmaputra further the findings of this study can be used to construct a process form interaction framework for large braided river systems keywords morphological disorderness braided river intensity disorder index stream power energy dissipation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction braided rivers consist of complex network of channels or branches and bars leopold and wolman 1957 which are further characterised by large sediment loads considerable discharge fluctuation and steep topographic gradients charlton 2007 morphological processes like erosion deposition channel migration and irregular planform formation pertaining to high stream power variability are crucial processes in understanding a braided river system bridge 1993 ferguson 1993 klaassen et al 1993 pradhan et al 2021b these processes in braided systems are recurrent and hasty enough to be measured over a short period there are numerous studies available on understanding the form process interactions of braided rivers majority of the studies are focused on integrating the flume based experiments ashmore 1982

georgiou 1996 1997 walsh hicks 2002 and advanced equipment like digital photogrammetry and laser altimetry lane et al 2003 westaway et al 2000 2001 2003 the brahmaputra river is an ideal study region for assessment of morphological sandbar disorderness as it is one of the largest sand bed braided river systems in the world coleman 1969 mosselman et al 1995 thorne et al 1993 the brahmaputra ranks fourth in terms of the annual flow discharge close to 20 000 cumecs goswami 1985 in addition the brahmaputra is distinct from other large braided rivers owing to the extreme inter seasonal variability of flow sediment load and spatio temporal variations in morphological activities chembolu and dutta 2018 dubey et al 2020 goswami 1985 karmaker et al 2017 a series of large and long duration flood events along with tectonic activities have generated a complex morphodynamics response in this river system goswami 1985 sarker et al 2014 valdiya 1999 the morphodynamics of this extensive braided river system is accredited for high rates of bank erosion unstable braided belt and fluctuating channel courses dutta et al 2010 more than 30 million people relying on the brahmaputra river are severely affected by these morphological changes almost every year nayak and panda 2016 therefore understanding the spatio temporal variability of complex morphodynamics is necessary to differentiate the stable and unstable reaches and develop sustainable engineering or nature based solutions satellite remote sensing has proven its utility in many morphological studies where in situ survey is difficult or of costly affair bertoldi et al 2011 dubey et al 2020 fotherby 2009 piégay et al 2005 surian 1999 li et al 2020 characterize the braided rivers in high elevation environments by using long term satellite image analysis furthermore the influence of comprehensive human activities such as construction of dam farming practices afforestation deforestation and mining etc on river morphology has been investigated using high resolution satellite images you et al 2022 gao et al 2022 also utilized the google earth engine resources for accessing specific set of landsat images that helps them in their study to characterize the functional behaviour of upper lancang river located in the qinghai tibet plateau china 3400 m elevation similarly lu et al 2022 examined the altered water and sediment flux due to the glacier melting in the source region of yangtze river using unmanned aerial vehicle uav surveys and dem data several researches on morphological changes utilizing the remote sensing techniques have been conducted for the brahmaputra river with an emphasis on bank migration and complex erosion deposition processes alam et al 2007 baki and gan 2012 gilfellon et al 2003 khan and islam 2003 klaassen et al 1993 sarker et al 2014 sarma 2005 sarma and phukan 2006 thorne et al 1993 estimation of braiding parameters and their relation with stream power akhtar et al 2011 gilfellon et al 2003 karmaker et al 2017 takagi et al 2007 the synthesis of all these literatures provides an adequate understanding of the morphology of the brahmaputra however there are still challenges persisting in the poorly gauged brahmaputra river owing to the high degree of morphological variability and associated processes chembolu and dutta 2018 utilized selective satellite imagery and digitization approaches to study the sand bars islands disorderness however the authors believe methods involving satellite based multiband water index and semi automatic surface water classifications are more capable due to their high detection accuracy low implementation cost and ease of use the normalized difference water index ndwi is extensively used as an efficient land water classification parameter ji et al 2009 lira 2006 mcfeeters 1996 ouma and tateishi 2006 however in some instances ndwi misclassifies the water surface which led to the development of a further derivative called modified normalized difference water index mndwi han qiu 2005 xu 2006 2007 therefore in the present study mndwi is used to identify the spatio temporal variability of the sand bar area and associated disorderness integrating the optical imagery entropy is defined as the measure of molecular disorder or randomness in the system this concept is a thermodynamic based principle and it was first used in the field of fluvial geomorphology by leopold and langbein 1962 yang 1971c demonstrated a relationship in a river system between potential energy and elevation that is analogous to the relationship between heat energy and temperature in a thermodynamic system as discussed by leopold and langbein 1962 since then the entropy concept has been used conveniently in several studies primarily focused on the energy dissipation rate to explain the equilibrium in natural stream network brebner and wilson 1967 leopold and langbein 1962 sarker et al 2019 yang 1971a 1971b 1971c the entropy defined by shannon 1948 and its different derivatives have been widely used in the morphological characterization few studies on fractal river networks use shannon entropy based derivation in developing the relationships between mean drainage elevation and river profiles claps et al 1996 fiorentino et al 1993 tejedor et al 2017 distributed optimal water sediment in self organized deltas by using the information entropy several studies have also focused on forecasting the equilibrium morphology bed profile fluctuations fluvial process based evaluation stream bank erosion modeling bridge pier scouring and river recovery potential using the entropy concept bandyopadhyay et al 2014 nield 2006 pitchford et al 2015 pizarro et al 2017 pradhan et al 2021c 2022 sarker 2021a sarker 2021b xu and yang 2012 xu and zhao 2013 the application of entropy in large braided river morphodynamics is still an uncharted area which is the motivation behind this study in the brahmaputra large variability in discharge and sediment load results in extensive erosion deposition process and instigate complex bar dynamics this spatio temporal variability in bar dynamics must be explored in order to comprehend the braided hydrodynamics further it is also important to investigate the effect of bar dimension on the morphological changes of a braided reach consequently the focus of this article is based on the interpretations indicated by change detection and variability of sand bar adjustment through the following steps i quantification of different classes of sand bars and their surface area using mndwi ii analysis of temporal disorderness of the sand bars using the entropy concept iii understanding the self organized behaviour of different bar area classes and its response to the available stream energy and finally iv ascertaining the relation between stream power and yearly idi variation using multi regression analysis 2 study area and data preparation 2 1 study area the braided reach from tezpur to jogighopa of the brahmaputra river is selected for this study fig 1 this stretch is approximately 240 km long and is made up of varied braided formations with three nodal locations tezpur guwahati and jogighopa having the narrowest channel width the study reach is further divided into two different zones upstream reach and downstream reach based on the nodal point for analysis purposes nodal points are important physiographic location and have a greater impact on the morphology of the river the nodal points govern the distribution of discharge and sediment flux as these locations are the converging points of upstream channels and subsequently diverges towards downstream furthermore the riverbank is composed of highly erodible sand and silt composites that instigate additional dynamic characteristics to the braided brahmaputra river karmaker and dutta 2011 the braided belt width variability of selected river reach is about 1 2 km to 18 km with an average bed slope in order of 1 10 000 daily discharge hydrograph is highly erratic in nature and the mean daily discharge value varies from 4420 cumecs in low flow to 51 156 cumecs in flooding conditions singh et al 2004 2 1 1 geological description the study area encompasses the middle reach of the mighty brahmaputra river this river originates from southern tibet and is primarily a snow fed trans himalayan river as far as its geological aspect is concerned the brahmaputra is considered the youngest of all major river systems sarma 2004 the river has a total length of 2880 km and drainage basin area about 520 000 km2 which runs through china 1625 km 293 000 km2 india 918 km 195 000 km2 and bangladesh 337 km 47 000 km2 in assam region of indian part of brahmaputra the alluvium formation consists of clay silt sand and pebbles and is approximately 200 300 m thick geological survey of india 1974 the adjacent highlands to the brahmaputra valley are extremely unstable seismically the magnitudes of earthquake in 1897 and 1950 have been recorded as 8 7 in richter scale the severe earthquake caused massive land failures and rockfalls on hill slopes as well as ground collapse and fractures furthermore this leads to alteration in the course of many tributaries of brahmaputra and ultimately affected the morphology of the river a wider braided belt width and flow sediment variability create favourable circumstances for dynamic morphological activities in the river system wider braided belt width and flow sediment variability together create favourable circumstances for morphological activities in the river system the bed material composition is very fine exposing the river to morphological activities in response to changes in fluvial parameters such as channel shifting chembolu and dutta 2018 karmaker and dutta 2011 sarma 2005 that eventually results in flow partition and the formation of the mid channel bar and a further increase in the braiding of the reach richardson and thorne 2001 inconsistent morphological activities like thalweg shifting bank erosion and bar migration are commonly seen in this river descriptive information about the study area is given in table 1 there are three major tributaries in the north bank kameng dhansiri and manas and one major tributary in the south bank kopili that contribute flow and sediment to the study reach 2 2 data preparation the post monsoon season october to december for the year from 2000 to 2019 is chosen for this study because major changes are anticipated to be captured after flooding events chembolu and dutta 2018 in brahmaputra the of annual discharge variation during the post monsoon season is highly fluctuates about 10 3 during october to about 2 6 in december vorosmarty et al 1998 data set from both archive satellite imagery and in situ observations are used in this study the derivatives from optical images of landsat tm etm at a high spatial resolution of 30 m are obtained from google earth engine it was observed that approximately 10 to 15 images were available in the repository during each post monsoon seasons therefore median images for each year was derived to represent general seasonal condition the in situ data consists of hydrological observations discharge and water level acquired from the central water commission cwc of india fig 1 b illustrates the flow duration curve and temporal variation of monthly average discharge prepared from the cwc data for the pandu guwahati gauging station 3 methodology the morphometric analysis carried out in this study mainly focuses on the sand bar dynamics being a crucial feature in braiding ashworth and lewin 2012 the investigation is done for the post monsoon period of 2000 to 2019 due to the active morphological changes of the river in this period fig 2 depicts the methodological flowchart which includes procedures such as bar area detection using mndwi bar frequency calculation idi computation comparison of idi with different stream powers and lastly multi regression analysis for controlling factor assessment 3 1 calculation of bar area using mndwi the spectral index mndwi was calculated by using reflectance from landsat archive in the google earth engine platform and its corresponding images were downloaded xu 2006 proposed the mndwi which is calculated as 1 mndwi green s w i r green s w i r where green is the green band and swir is the short wave infrared band in the electromagnetic spectrum the ranges of mndwi value ranges from 1 to 1 negative values in mndwi signify the absence of water whereas the positive values signify the water features a threshold value of 0 was used below which the sand bars were identified the rest of the features were identified as water furthermore the detected sand bars were categorized depending on their surface area and their approximate average elevations were observed through google earth pro which is conceptually illustrated in fig 3 for a specific braided reach and cross section 3 2 intensity disorder index in this study the bars were classified into seven different classes as per their surface area from the very small bar 103 m2 to the very large bar 108 m2 fig 3 then the frequency of each class was calculated for obtaining the probability of its occurrence this was further used to calculate entropy based intensity disorder index idi mishra et al 2009 idi explains the time dependent alterations of the bars in a braided river system chembolu and dutta 2018 it is used to evaluate seasonal entropy based heterogeneity to estimate the idi the intensity of entropy ie for different bar classes is required it is a metric for determining the disorder in the distribution of sandbar surface area in the study reach this can be calculated using eq 2 in terms of relative frequency maruyama et al 2005 2 ie i 1 n f i n log 2 f i n where f i is the frequency of the sand bars for different classes n is the number of classes n is the total frequency of bars in a particular period here the unit used for ie is bit having the logarithmic base 2 and defined over a range of ie is 0 i e smaller ie indicates less disordered intensity implying a more skewed distribution of sandbar occurrence frequency whereas higher ie indicates more highly disordered intensities spreading over a wider range the ie provides an insight into ambiguity in the distribution of different sand bar areas it varies from maximum value for equal distribution of different classes to 0 as the minimum value for most possible inequal distribution furthermore idi mathematically defined as the difference between maximum probable entropy and the entropy of the individual distribution eq 3 3 idi season ie max ie season here idi season is the intensity disorder index for a particular season ie max is the maximum possible entropy for uniform distribution and ie is the individual intensity entropy for a particular season 3 3 stream power the amount of available energy for river morphological processes is mostly determined by the stream power generated by the discharge flowing through the channel akhtar et al 2011 bawa et al 2014 karmaker et al 2017 stream power ω is the rate of the deliverance of kinetic energy to potential energy during the flow bagnold 1966 and mathematically defined as 4 ω γ q s where γ is the specific weight of water γ ρ g 9810 n m3 ρ is the density of water kg m3 g is the acceleration due to gravity m s2 q is the water discharge m3 s and s is the bed slope m m 4 results 4 1 frequency distribution analysis in this study the frequency of the seven bar classes table 2 was calculated and shown in fig 4 during the post monsoon season it is common for the large bars to get dissected and converted into small bars chembolu and dutta 2018 similar to the previous findings it was observed that the frequency of small bars was extremely high in comparison to the moderate large class bars that are common during this season as a result the density of small bar classes increases and it raises the disorderness the large bars are generally referred to as forced bars with low mobility or immobile rates with respect to their shape size and location while small bars are referred to as free bars with high mobility rates that play a key role in morphological changes baki and gan 2012 the detailed description of bar classes in the selected study reach is given in table 2 the frequency of small bars class 1 2 and 3 was observed to be higher than that of medium and large sized bars the frequency of the class 2 bar was significantly higher than all other classes in each individual year except for 2005 the frequency of class 2 bar signalled a decreasing trend from 2000 to 2010 however an increase in frequency was observed up to 2019 for class 2 and other lower bar classes class 1 and 3 fig 5 depicts an annual class wise bar frequency comparison for two different sub reaches based on nodal point upstream reach tezpur to guwahati and downstream reach guwahati to joghighopa similar to the total reach the frequency of class 2 bars was observed to be significantly higher than the frequency of other class bars along the sub reaches in most of the years it was determined that the downstream reach has a higher number of class 2 bars than the upstream reach this indicates that the downstream reach is morphologically more active than the upstream reach the smaller class bar dominates along the sub reaches and the higher class bars class 5 6 and 7 did not undergo major changes which further implies the formation of immobile bars islands over time fig 6 suggests that class 1 and 2 bars are more dynamic in comparison to the other classes and significantly contributing to the disorderness of the braided reach in 2019 the class 1 bar had the highest cumulative area as compared to other years in addition class 2 bar showed higher fluctuations in 2001 2013 and 2019 whereas in 2002 2014 and 2018 the class 2 bar had a rise in the cumulative area downstream of guwahati in 2002 the class 3 bar fluctuated higher in comparison to the other year a constant variation was observed in classes 5 and 6 for almost all the years indicating that these bars are stable and do not change notably with time and space the class 6 bars in 2002 2003 and 2007 and class 4 bars in 2011 had the greatest cumulative area in the downstream reach furthermore the smaller bars were observed with less frequency fig 4 in these years indicating that smaller bars may get eroded or combined or deposited to adjacent bars to form larger bars 4 2 temporal variability of intensity disorder index idi the bar classes variability in the study reach is a function of discharge flow depth erosion deposition and sediment transport the intensity disorder index idi is used in the present study as a parameter for braided reach disorderness identification as proposed by mishra et al 2009 it is an indicator of uniformity of the bar distribution over the braided reach fig 7 depicts the variability of idi for the whole study reach along with the two sub reaches separated by the nodal points the variability of idi for the whole study reach as well as the two sub reach were observed to be declining up to 2010 and then it showed more instability with an increasing trend up to 2019 a statistical analysis was performed to identify the trend of idi variation using the mann kendall test and sen s slope α 0 05 analysis table 3 it was clear that from 2000 to 2010 the idi showed significant changes for the entire reach and sub reaches p values α value negative sen s slope and kendall s tau value indicated declining trend of idi for all the reaches in study period however from 2010 to 2019 the p value is greater than the α value which implies no significant change still there is an increasing trend for the idi as the sen s slope and kendall s tau have positive values the dissection of larger bars into smaller bars and formation of chute channels on the diagonal bars increased the frequency of small bars this process resulted higher idi values in the second epoch 2010 2019 the idi values were observed to be higher in the downstream reach guwahati to jogighopa than the upstream reach tezpur to guwahati except for few years 2012 2013 and 2019 furthermore the downstream reach has a larger braided belt space than the upstream reach which accommodates all the erosional and depositional processes and contributes to the higher disorderness of the reach this is supported by the fact that in 2012 2013 and 2019 the small bar classes class 1 2 and 3 frequencies were more prevalent in the downstream reach the deviation of idi was also higher in the downstream reach for the second period 2010 2019 as noted in fig 6 2001 2013 and 2019 have a higher class 2 bar fluctuation and therefore accounted for the higher idi values in 2002 and 2013 the idi value was higher for the study reach in comparison with both the sub reaches similarly in 2002 2014 and 2018 the class 2 bar has a higher frequency fig 4 that is reflected by the idi variation the cumulative area values of the class 6 bar are higher indicating that growth in the larger bar class increases the stability of the reach and reduces the disorderness several studies reported about the shape similarity of different class of bar and its influence on the morphological behavior of the river an et al 2013 sambrook smith et al 2005 walsh and hicks 2002 however this cannot be considered in a highly braided river such as the brahmaputra since the frequency of distinct classes of bar is significantly higher 4 3 relationship between stream power idi and bar classes the morphological changes like thalweg shifting channel alteration the closing opening of an existing new channel bank erosion are the effect of seasonal flood events these processes in a braided reach may imitate the sand bar development and its variability in the post monsoon season the braided planform disturbances increase due to the high flood discharge here total stream power for monsoon ω m post monsoon ω pm and peak flood events ω pf was calculated and compared with yearly idi variation and relative bar frequency of different classes fig 8 a regression analysis was performed to investigate how varying stream power correlated with the idi fluctuation considering idi as the dependent variable table 4 according to table 4 the r statistics indicate that there is no stronger co relation between the idi and stream power derivatives with values of 0 26 0 18 and 0 39 for monsoon post monsoon and peak flood stream power respectively this demonstrates that the idi variation was not significantly related to any stream powers with the exception of a marginally better relationship with the peak flood stream power as the p statistics suggested the regression model does not demonstrate any significant relationship between the variables furthermore the responses of the braided channels to flooding occurrences must not be overlooked since they may have an impact on the disorderness of the braided reach this study showed that peak flood stream power is better related to idi variation than monsoon and post monsoon stream power it is apparent that whenever the peak flood stream power value increases the smaller bar frequency decreases as well as the larger bar frequency or the surface area increases for the succeeding year for the second period 2010 2019 the peak flood stream power was increased which may have contributed to the rising trend of idi there can be a significant effect of stream power on the different classes of bar variability in the braided reach the class 2 bar which is considered to be the most dominating bar class for idi variation discussed earlier showed an inverse relation to peak flood stream power this is because extreme floods generate high velocity and erosive power which can deepen the shallower channel wash the smaller mobile bars and cause substantial bank erosion further the consequences of rising intensity floods require time to absorb within the system before it evolves towards a new planform as evidenced by irregular patterns in sediment material depositions observed during flood receding charlton 2007 smaller bar growth established a direct relationship with the peak flood events for some of the year the reason could be the peak flood episodes in those years sculpted sediment material from the bigger bars or banks and formed the smaller class bars through deposition moody 2019 wheaton et al 2013 williams et al 2020 furthermore we may obtain a better process understanding by considering it as a whole system along with their geomorphic responses to the stream energy generated by fluctuating peak flooding events of varying durations 5 discussions 5 1 role of sand bar dynamics in the morphological uncertainty the fundamental morphological aspect of a braided river is bar creation which is also associated with other morphological processes like bifurcation confluence formations alteration in channel sinuosity thalweg shifting and lateral channel migration ashmore 2013 chembolu and dutta 2018 nandi et al 2022 tubino and bertoldi 2007 the formation or growth of sandbars and their spatiotemporal evolution are strongly connected to a sequence of complex erosion deposition processes which must be understood to describe the morphodynamics of a highly braided river system furthermore the size of a sandbar is related to the stability and accompanying channel characteristics baki and gan 2012 this is supported in the present study where the frequency of small bars varies faster highly unstable and the frequency of large bars becomes relatively constant stable over the years figs 4 and 5 it should be noted that large sandbars with discrete areas are evidence of morphologic stress in which wider or spreading portions capture the bed material exported from the contracting or constricted parts repetto et al 2002 ramirez and allison 2013 szupiany et al 2012 wu yeh 2005 the unit discharge and flow transport capacity decline substantially toward the bar head during the low and medium flow stages facilitating suspended and bed sediment deposition however during floods high flow this process is opposite resulting in erosions at the head and around the bar such processes are observed in the present study reaches where the smaller bars are the prime target of the fluvial action this further reduces the frequency at high flow and may deposit to the comparably larger bars the antecedent state is reflected in the subsequent season by an increase in larger bar size frequency and a reduction in smaller bar frequency the grain size distribution of the bed and suspended sediment material also governs the particles which are transported in suspension onto the bar head the bed material is considerably coarser in the proposed study reaches of the brahmaputra river and these features may have an impact on the morphodynamic evolution of the bars furthermore a process based understanding of the sediment transport is required to evaluate the impact of flow conditions secondary currents turbulence structures and boundary shear on the sand bar dynamics resulting in extensive morphological changes along the brahmaputra river 5 2 idi variation and its influence on the system s disorderness chembolu and dutta 2018 reported that the intensity of braiding depends on the braided belt width availability due to multi channel formation and sand bar disorderness the available braided belt width room to move or erodible corridor or freedom space helps the river to self adjust or self heal against the disturbances caused by floods and sediment load fluctuations biron et al 2014 piégay et al 2005 rapp and abbe 2003 the process form evolution comprises erosional geomorphic unit removal widening of active channels river bank failure scour etc and depositional processes formation of new geomorphic units sediment material accretion etc fryirs et al 2015 in the downstream reach of guwahati the braided belt space availability is larger as compared to the upstream reach and therefore it facilitates the formation of major geomorphic units and an increased idi disorderness furthermore the disorderness of a braided reach is an indicator of the morphological changes and also depends on the hydrologic regime nicholas et al 2013 anthropogenic stresses hicks et al 2021 and periodic disturbances like earthquakes borgohain et al 2017 sarker and thorne 2006 according to sarker and thorne 2006 the impact of the great assam earthquake 1950 on the morphological dynamics of the brahmaputra river probably lasted for half a century due to substantial sediment wave generation this may induce fluctuation in the sandbar evolution which affects the idi variation over the years therefore any changes in the governing factors must be mapped as they induce a series of fluvial changes in the braided system at various spatio temporal scales 5 3 contribution of stream power to the idi variation and morphological variability stream power is considered as the potential measure of geomorphic activities in braided river the studies on sediment transport variability bagnold 1966 1977 hassan et al 1992 reid and frostick 1986 schneider et al 2010 yang 1972 bank erosion processes lawler et al 1999 braided belt disorderness chembolu and dutta 2018 channel changes chang 1979 ferguson 1987 van den berg 1995 aggradation and degradation thresholds identification bull 1979 haves been carried out based on the stream power variability in this study an attempt has been made to relate the stream power derivatives to the idi variation of the reach however in the brahmaputra river lack of relationship signals the highly non linear and complex processes owing to the combined effects of anthropogenic activities tectonic disturbances and varied hydrologic regime the previous literature synthesis indicated the dominant impact of flood stream power on the morphodynamics of alluvial rivers akhtar et al 2011 bawa et al 2014 kale 2008 magilligan et al 2015 pradhan et al 2021b in contrast karmaker et al 2017 argued that braiding is not directly controlled by the stream power and geological characteristics control its spatial distribution whereas the seasonal variability of stream power is controlled by annual rainfall variability kaushal et al 2020 furthermore the planform changes are not only the results of extreme events and smaller floods with regular intervals may have a higher cumulative impact on the changes charlton 2007 it was reported that on average annually nine flood waves take place in the brahmaputra river karmaker and dutta 2010 fig 8 clearly demonstrates that when the disorderness of the reach increases the corresponding stream power reduces indicating a lower potential for energy expenditure majumdar and mandal 2020 made a similar observation while attempting to correlate stream power with planform index and bank erosion for the ganga river furthermore high stream power can result in scour and formed chute bars as well as a significant concentration of coarser material above the bar head and chute dietrich and smith 1984 in addition if the stream power is reduced beyond a bar top due to an abrupt depth increment it can result in a deposition at that bar tail due to the formation of a low flow zone kasvi et al 2013 this was also observed at few locations along the braided reach and the size of the larger bars has been augmented in these conditions the frequency of smaller bars was reduced due to erosion resulting in the increment of larger bar area by deposition of the eroded material at the bar tail 5 4 interpretation of process based sand bar disorderness and energy expenditure mechanism the previous sections concluded the dynamics of the bar morphology may not be solely attributed to the stream power the response of braided reach to the stream power is not only in the form of bar morphology but also in the changes by other forms like thalweg shifting sinuosity erosion and deposition chembolu and dutta 2018 the excess energy available may be expended by the morphological activities at various hierarchical levels and overall self adjustment of the braided system a conceptual system representation based on the sand bar dynamics of a large braided river has been illustrated in fig 9 a system scale has been employed to represent the bar classes and their interactions with flow energy within the fluvial territory the sand bars are conceptualized based on the observed sand bar classes in our study reach table 2 further the interdependent nature of sand bars in terms of size location and erosion deposition activity are hypothesised with respect to the incoming flow energy the high magnitude floods produce huge amounts of energy and erosional power in the flow which affects the sand bar depending upon the size and location baki and gan 2012 goswami 1985 the system can be suggested as a spring system therefore any disturbance caused by incoming flow energy to any of the attributes affects the entire system and the disturbance propagates in both longitudinal and lateral directions in accordance with the increasing flow energy magnitude smaller mobile bars or even parts of larger bars depending upon their stability criteria get eroded and again deposited into the downstream bars chembolu and dutta 2018 pradhan et al 2021a nandi et al 2022 in similar fashion part of the bank gets eroded and widens the channel while part of the bank gets the deposited material and makes the channel narrower karmaker et al 2017 as such all of these processes control the channel in channel activity such as forming new channels secondary and tertiary closing of the existing channels modifying the thalweg sinuosity and forming the chute channels bawa et al 2014 chembolu and dutta 2018 therefore such complex process form interactions can in directly influence the braided belt variability as well as all sorts of geomorphological activity of the large braided river system and dissipate a significant portion of the fluvial energy available to the system 6 conclusions in the present study a multiband water index was used to identify the sand bar distribution in the braided reach of the brahmaputra then the concept of entropy was introduced to assess the variability of the sand bar over the selected braided planform of the brahmaputra the intensity disorder index idi was computed and it provides an understanding of the spatio temporal variability of sand bar distribution throughout the desired reach a multi regression analysis was also performed to determine the relationship between idi and stream power derivatives some of the major findings drawn from the analysis i the variations of idi showed a decreasing trend in 2000 2010 followed by an increasing trend up to 2019 which further signals a decadal shift in morphological stability in the brahmaputra ii the frequency of smaller mobile bars is high as compared to the medium and larger bars immobile in the second time period and controls the idi variability the inter comparison of the two braided sub reaches showed that the downstream reach had a higher idi attributed to the prevalence of smaller sized bars iii according to different stream power comparison peak flood stream power was better correlated to idi variation than monsoon and post monsoon stream power this may be credited to the dissection of the larger bars into smaller bars and increased the idi values in the second period in addition the large bars increased their surface area due to the accumulation of sculpted sediment materials from the washed out smaller bars and eroded cohesive banks for some period iv the disorderness of the braided reach does not fully expend the incoming stream power but also the additional available fluvial energy may be dissipated by geomorphological activities such as sinuosity alteration erosion deposition mechanism thalweg shifting etc the braided reach of the brahmaputra river forms due to an integrated drainage network consisting of several tributaries this study develops an approach to understand the bar morphology disorderness in this large braided system the concept can be further applied to other geomorphological frameworks based on the understanding of prominent geomorphic unit sand bar dynamics and their sustained evolutions finally the knowledge gleaned from this study can be utilized to design a process form interaction

understanding the problem further the author declares that this research is not supported by any funding agency 
2654,understanding the morphological erraticism for large braided river systems is still a challenging issue in the present era of fluvial geomorphology the present paper reports thorough spatio temporal variability of sand bar dynamics 2000 2019 and their influence on the braided belt disorderness in the large braided brahmaputra river the sand bar area is detected using the modified normalized difference water index mndwi and an entropy based intensity disorder index idi is further proposed to measure the spatio temporal disorderness in the post monsoon period the idi varies at a lowest value of less than 0 5 to a highest value of more than 0 9 for the selected study reach interestingly idi displays a declining trend for the first decade followed by an increasing trend in the subsequent time slice which signals the large scale heterogeneity in process form interactions for the brahmaputra an attempt was made to establish relationship between idi stream power derivatives monsoon peak flood and post monsoon and bar area classes in order to facilitate a process based understanding of the geomorphic adjustments in comparison with other stream power derivatives the peak flood stream power showed a better correlation with the disorderness measure of the reach finally this study has highlighted that smaller highly immobile bars have significant control on the idi variations and govern the yearly planform disorderness of the brahmaputra further the findings of this study can be used to construct a process form interaction framework for large braided river systems keywords morphological disorderness braided river intensity disorder index stream power energy dissipation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction braided rivers consist of complex network of channels or branches and bars leopold and wolman 1957 which are further characterised by large sediment loads considerable discharge fluctuation and steep topographic gradients charlton 2007 morphological processes like erosion deposition channel migration and irregular planform formation pertaining to high stream power variability are crucial processes in understanding a braided river system bridge 1993 ferguson 1993 klaassen et al 1993 pradhan et al 2021b these processes in braided systems are recurrent and hasty enough to be measured over a short period there are numerous studies available on understanding the form process interactions of braided rivers majority of the studies are focused on integrating the flume based experiments ashmore 1982 1991 1993 young davies 1991 numerical modeling murray paola 1994 1997 satellite based remote sensing products khan et al 2014 nykanen et al 1998 pradhan et al 2017 2019 sapozhnikov and foufoula georgiou 1996 1997 walsh hicks 2002 and advanced equipment like digital photogrammetry and laser altimetry lane et al 2003 westaway et al 2000 2001 2003 the brahmaputra river is an ideal study region for assessment of morphological sandbar disorderness as it is one of the largest sand bed braided river systems in the world coleman 1969 mosselman et al 1995 thorne et al 1993 the brahmaputra ranks fourth in terms of the annual flow discharge close to 20 000 cumecs goswami 1985 in addition the brahmaputra is distinct from other large braided rivers owing to the extreme inter seasonal variability of flow sediment load and spatio temporal variations in morphological activities chembolu and dutta 2018 dubey et al 2020 goswami 1985 karmaker et al 2017 a series of large and long duration flood events along with tectonic activities have generated a complex morphodynamics response in this river system goswami 1985 sarker et al 2014 valdiya 1999 the morphodynamics of this extensive braided river system is accredited for high rates of bank erosion unstable braided belt and fluctuating channel courses dutta et al 2010 more than 30 million people relying on the brahmaputra river are severely affected by these morphological changes almost every year nayak and panda 2016 therefore understanding the spatio temporal variability of complex morphodynamics is necessary to differentiate the stable and unstable reaches and develop sustainable engineering or nature based solutions satellite remote sensing has proven its utility in many morphological studies where in situ survey is difficult or of costly affair bertoldi et al 2011 dubey et al 2020 fotherby 2009 piégay et al 2005 surian 1999 li et al 2020 characterize the braided rivers in high elevation environments by using long term satellite image analysis furthermore the influence of comprehensive human activities such as construction of dam farming practices afforestation deforestation and mining etc on river morphology has been investigated using high resolution satellite images you et al 2022 gao et al 2022 also utilized the google earth engine resources for accessing specific set of landsat images that helps them in their study to characterize the functional behaviour of upper lancang river located in the qinghai tibet plateau china 3400 m elevation similarly lu et al 2022 examined the altered water and sediment flux due to the glacier melting in the source region of yangtze river using unmanned aerial vehicle uav surveys and dem data several researches on morphological changes utilizing the remote sensing techniques have been conducted for the brahmaputra river with an emphasis on bank migration and complex erosion deposition processes alam et al 2007 baki and gan 2012 gilfellon et al 2003 khan and islam 2003 klaassen et al 1993 sarker et al 2014 sarma 2005 sarma and phukan 2006 thorne et al 1993 estimation of braiding parameters and their relation with stream power akhtar et al 2011 gilfellon et al 2003 karmaker et al 2017 takagi et al 2007 the synthesis of all these literatures provides an adequate understanding of the morphology of the brahmaputra however there are still challenges persisting in the poorly gauged brahmaputra river owing to the high degree of morphological variability and associated processes chembolu and dutta 2018 utilized selective satellite imagery and digitization approaches to study the sand bars islands disorderness however the authors believe methods involving satellite based multiband water index and semi automatic surface water classifications are more capable due to their high detection accuracy low implementation cost and ease of use the normalized difference water index ndwi is extensively used as an efficient land water classification parameter ji et al 2009 lira 2006 mcfeeters 1996 ouma and tateishi 2006 however in some instances ndwi misclassifies the water surface which led to the development of a further derivative called modified normalized difference water index mndwi han qiu 2005 xu 2006 2007 therefore in the present study mndwi is used to identify the spatio temporal variability of the sand bar area and associated disorderness integrating the optical imagery entropy is defined as the measure of molecular disorder or randomness in the system this concept is a thermodynamic based principle and it was first used in the field of fluvial geomorphology by leopold and langbein 1962 yang 1971c demonstrated a relationship in a river system between potential energy and elevation that is analogous to the relationship between heat energy and temperature in a thermodynamic system as discussed by leopold and langbein 1962 since then the entropy concept has been used conveniently in several studies primarily focused on the energy dissipation rate to explain the equilibrium in natural stream network brebner and wilson 1967 leopold and langbein 1962 sarker et al 2019 yang 1971a 1971b 1971c the entropy defined by shannon 1948 and its different derivatives have been widely used in the morphological characterization few studies on fractal river networks use shannon entropy based derivation in developing the relationships between mean drainage elevation and river profiles claps et al 1996 fiorentino et al 1993 tejedor et al 2017 distributed optimal water sediment in self organized deltas by using the information entropy several studies have also focused on forecasting the equilibrium morphology bed profile fluctuations fluvial process based evaluation stream bank erosion modeling bridge pier scouring and river recovery potential using the entropy concept bandyopadhyay et al 2014 nield 2006 pitchford et al 2015 pizarro et al 2017 pradhan et al 2021c 2022 sarker 2021a sarker 2021b xu and yang 2012 xu and zhao 2013 the application of entropy in large braided river morphodynamics is still an uncharted area which is the motivation behind this study in the brahmaputra large variability in discharge and sediment load results in extensive erosion deposition process and instigate complex bar dynamics this spatio temporal variability in bar dynamics must be explored in order to comprehend the braided hydrodynamics further it is also important to investigate the effect of bar dimension on the morphological changes of a braided reach consequently the focus of this article is based on the interpretations indicated by change detection and variability of sand bar adjustment through the following steps i quantification of different classes of sand bars and their surface area using mndwi ii analysis of temporal disorderness of the sand bars using the entropy concept iii understanding the self organized behaviour of different bar area classes and its response to the available stream energy and finally iv ascertaining the relation between stream power and yearly idi variation using multi regression analysis 2 study area and data preparation 2 1 study area the braided reach from tezpur to jogighopa of the brahmaputra river is selected for this study fig 1 this stretch is approximately 240 km long and is made up of varied braided formations with three nodal locations tezpur guwahati and jogighopa having the narrowest channel width the study reach is further divided into two different zones upstream reach and downstream reach based on the nodal point for analysis purposes nodal points are important physiographic location and have a greater impact on the morphology of the river the nodal points govern the distribution of discharge and sediment flux as these locations are the converging points of upstream channels and subsequently diverges towards downstream furthermore the riverbank is composed of highly erodible sand and silt composites that instigate additional dynamic characteristics to the braided brahmaputra river karmaker and dutta 2011 the braided belt width variability of selected river reach is about 1 2 km to 18 km with an average bed slope in order of 1 10 000 daily discharge hydrograph is highly erratic in nature and the mean daily discharge value varies from 4420 cumecs in low flow to 51 156 cumecs in flooding conditions singh et al 2004 2 1 1 geological description the study area encompasses the middle reach of the mighty brahmaputra river this river originates from southern tibet and is primarily a snow fed trans himalayan river as far as its geological aspect is concerned the brahmaputra is considered the youngest of all major river systems sarma 2004 the river has a total length of 2880 km and drainage basin area about 520 000 km2 which runs through china 1625 km 293 000 km2 india 918 km 195 000 km2 and bangladesh 337 km 47 000 km2 in assam region of indian part of brahmaputra the alluvium formation consists of clay silt sand and pebbles and is approximately 200 300 m thick geological survey of india 1974 the adjacent highlands to the brahmaputra valley are extremely unstable seismically the magnitudes of earthquake in 1897 and 1950 have been recorded as 8 7 in richter scale the severe earthquake caused massive land failures and rockfalls on hill slopes as well as ground collapse and fractures furthermore this leads to alteration in the course of many tributaries of brahmaputra and ultimately affected the morphology of the river a wider braided belt width and flow sediment variability create favourable circumstances for dynamic morphological activities in the river system wider braided belt width and flow sediment variability together create favourable circumstances for morphological activities in the river system the bed material composition is very fine exposing the river to morphological activities in response to changes in fluvial parameters such as channel shifting chembolu and dutta 2018 karmaker and dutta 2011 sarma 2005 that eventually results in flow partition and the formation of the mid channel bar and a further increase in the braiding of the reach richardson and thorne 2001 inconsistent morphological activities like thalweg shifting bank erosion and bar migration are commonly seen in this river descriptive information about the study area is given in table 1 there are three major tributaries in the north bank kameng dhansiri and manas and one major tributary in the south bank kopili that contribute flow and sediment to the study reach 2 2 data preparation the post monsoon season october to december for the year from 2000 to 2019 is chosen for this study because major changes are anticipated to be captured after flooding events chembolu and dutta 2018 in brahmaputra the of annual discharge variation during the post monsoon season is highly fluctuates about 10 3 during october to about 2 6 in december vorosmarty et al 1998 data set from both archive satellite imagery and in situ observations are used in this study the derivatives from optical images of landsat tm etm at a high spatial resolution of 30 m are obtained from google earth engine it was observed that approximately 10 to 15 images were available in the repository during each post monsoon seasons therefore median images for each year was derived to represent general seasonal condition the in situ data consists of hydrological observations discharge and water level acquired from the central water commission cwc of india fig 1 b illustrates the flow duration curve and temporal variation of monthly average discharge prepared from the cwc data for the pandu guwahati gauging station 3 methodology the morphometric analysis carried out in this study mainly focuses on the sand bar dynamics being a crucial feature in braiding ashworth and lewin 2012 the investigation is done for the post monsoon period of 2000 to 2019 due to the active morphological changes of the river in this period fig 2 depicts the methodological flowchart which includes procedures such as bar area detection using mndwi bar frequency calculation idi computation comparison of idi with different stream powers and lastly multi regression analysis for controlling factor assessment 3 1 calculation of bar area using mndwi the spectral index mndwi was calculated by using reflectance from landsat archive in the google earth engine platform and its corresponding images were downloaded xu 2006 proposed the mndwi which is calculated as 1 mndwi green s w i r green s w i r where green is the green band and swir is the short wave infrared band in the electromagnetic spectrum the ranges of mndwi value ranges from 1 to 1 negative values in mndwi signify the absence of water whereas the positive values signify the water features a threshold value of 0 was used below which the sand bars were identified the rest of the features were identified as water furthermore the detected sand bars were categorized depending on their surface area and their approximate average elevations were observed through google earth pro which is conceptually illustrated in fig 3 for a specific braided reach and cross section 3 2 intensity disorder index in this study the bars were classified into seven different classes as per their surface area from the very small bar 103 m2 to the very large bar 108 m2 fig 3 then the frequency of each class was calculated for obtaining the probability of its occurrence this was further used to calculate entropy based intensity disorder index idi mishra et al 2009 idi explains the time dependent alterations of the bars in a braided river system chembolu and dutta 2018 it is used to evaluate seasonal entropy based heterogeneity to estimate the idi the intensity of entropy ie for different bar classes is required it is a metric for determining the disorder in the distribution of sandbar surface area in the study reach this can be calculated using eq 2 in terms of relative frequency maruyama et al 2005 2 ie i 1 n f i n log 2 f i n where f i is the frequency of the sand bars for different classes n is the number of classes n is the total frequency of bars in a particular period here the unit used for ie is bit having the logarithmic base 2 and defined over a range of ie is 0 i e smaller ie indicates less disordered intensity implying a more skewed distribution of sandbar occurrence frequency whereas higher ie indicates more highly disordered intensities spreading over a wider range the ie provides an insight into ambiguity in the distribution of different sand bar areas it varies from maximum value for equal distribution of different classes to 0 as the minimum value for most possible inequal distribution furthermore idi mathematically defined as the difference between maximum probable entropy and the entropy of the individual distribution eq 3 3 idi season ie max ie season here idi season is the intensity disorder index for a particular season ie max is the maximum possible entropy for uniform distribution and ie is the individual intensity entropy for a particular season 3 3 stream power the amount of available energy for river morphological processes is mostly determined by the stream power generated by the discharge flowing through the channel akhtar et al 2011 bawa et al 2014 karmaker et al 2017 stream power ω is the rate of the deliverance of kinetic energy to potential energy during the flow bagnold 1966 and mathematically defined as 4 ω γ q s where γ is the specific weight of water γ ρ g 9810 n m3 ρ is the density of water kg m3 g is the acceleration due to gravity m s2 q is the water discharge m3 s and s is the bed slope m m 4 results 4 1 frequency distribution analysis in this study the frequency of the seven bar classes table 2 was calculated and shown in fig 4 during the post monsoon season it is common for the large bars to get dissected and converted into small bars chembolu and dutta 2018 similar to the previous findings it was observed that the frequency of small bars was extremely high in comparison to the moderate large class bars that are common during this season as a result the density of small bar classes increases and it raises the disorderness the large bars are generally referred to as forced bars with low mobility or immobile rates with respect to their shape size and location while small bars are referred to as free bars with high mobility rates that play a key role in morphological changes baki and gan 2012 the detailed description of bar classes in the selected study reach is given in table 2 the frequency of small bars class 1 2 and 3 was observed to be higher than that of medium and large sized bars the frequency of the class 2 bar was significantly higher than all other classes in each individual year except for 2005 the frequency of class 2 bar signalled a decreasing trend from 2000 to 2010 however an increase in frequency was observed up to 2019 for class 2 and other lower bar classes class 1 and 3 fig 5 depicts an annual class wise bar frequency comparison for two different sub reaches based on nodal point upstream reach tezpur to guwahati and downstream reach guwahati to joghighopa similar to the total reach the frequency of class 2 bars was observed to be significantly higher than the frequency of other class bars along the sub reaches in most of the years it was determined that the downstream reach has a higher number of class 2 bars than the upstream reach this indicates that the downstream reach is morphologically more active than the upstream reach the smaller class bar dominates along the sub reaches and the higher class bars class 5 6 and 7 did not undergo major changes which further implies the formation of immobile bars islands over time fig 6 suggests that class 1 and 2 bars are more dynamic in comparison to the other classes and significantly contributing to the disorderness of the braided reach in 2019 the class 1 bar had the highest cumulative area as compared to other years in addition class 2 bar showed higher fluctuations in 2001 2013 and 2019 whereas in 2002 2014 and 2018 the class 2 bar had a rise in the cumulative area downstream of guwahati in 2002 the class 3 bar fluctuated higher in comparison to the other year a constant variation was observed in classes 5 and 6 for almost all the years indicating that these bars are stable and do not change notably with time and space the class 6 bars in 2002 2003 and 2007 and class 4 bars in 2011 had the greatest cumulative area in the downstream reach furthermore the smaller bars were observed with less frequency fig 4 in these years indicating that smaller bars may get eroded or combined or deposited to adjacent bars to form larger bars 4 2 temporal variability of intensity disorder index idi the bar classes variability in the study reach is a function of discharge flow depth erosion deposition and sediment transport the intensity disorder index idi is used in the present study as a parameter for braided reach disorderness identification as proposed by mishra et al 2009 it is an indicator of uniformity of the bar distribution over the braided reach fig 7 depicts the variability of idi for the whole study reach along with the two sub reaches separated by the nodal points the variability of idi for the whole study reach as well as the two sub reach were observed to be declining up to 2010 and then it showed more instability with an increasing trend up to 2019 a statistical analysis was performed to identify the trend of idi variation using the mann kendall test and sen s slope α 0 05 analysis table 3 it was clear that from 2000 to 2010 the idi showed significant changes for the entire reach and sub reaches p values α value negative sen s slope and kendall s tau value indicated declining trend of idi for all the reaches in study period however from 2010 to 2019 the p value is greater than the α value which implies no significant change still there is an increasing trend for the idi as the sen s slope and kendall s tau have positive values the dissection of larger bars into smaller bars and formation of chute channels on the diagonal bars increased the frequency of small bars this process resulted higher idi values in the second epoch 2010 2019 the idi values were observed to be higher in the downstream reach guwahati to jogighopa than the upstream reach tezpur to guwahati except for few years 2012 2013 and 2019 furthermore the downstream reach has a larger braided belt space than the upstream reach which accommodates all the erosional and depositional processes and contributes to the higher disorderness of the reach this is supported by the fact that in 2012 2013 and 2019 the small bar classes class 1 2 and 3 frequencies were more prevalent in the downstream reach the deviation of idi was also higher in the downstream reach for the second period 2010 2019 as noted in fig 6 2001 2013 and 2019 have a higher class 2 bar fluctuation and therefore accounted for the higher idi values in 2002 and 2013 the idi value was higher for the study reach in comparison with both the sub reaches similarly in 2002 2014 and 2018 the class 2 bar has a higher frequency fig 4 that is reflected by the idi variation the cumulative area values of the class 6 bar are higher indicating that growth in the larger bar class increases the stability of the reach and reduces the disorderness several studies reported about the shape similarity of different class of bar and its influence on the morphological behavior of the river an et al 2013 sambrook smith et al 2005 walsh and hicks 2002 however this cannot be considered in a highly braided river such as the brahmaputra since the frequency of distinct classes of bar is significantly higher 4 3 relationship between stream power idi and bar classes the morphological changes like thalweg shifting channel alteration the closing opening of an existing new channel bank erosion are the effect of seasonal flood events these processes in a braided reach may imitate the sand bar development and its variability in the post monsoon season the braided planform disturbances increase due to the high flood discharge here total stream power for monsoon ω m post monsoon ω pm and peak flood events ω pf was calculated and compared with yearly idi variation and relative bar frequency of different classes fig 8 a regression analysis was performed to investigate how varying stream power correlated with the idi fluctuation considering idi as the dependent variable table 4 according to table 4 the r statistics indicate that there is no stronger co relation between the idi and stream power derivatives with values of 0 26 0 18 and 0 39 for monsoon post monsoon and peak flood stream power respectively this demonstrates that the idi variation was not significantly related to any stream powers with the exception of a marginally better relationship with the peak flood stream power as the p statistics suggested the regression model does not demonstrate any significant relationship between the variables furthermore the responses of the braided channels to flooding occurrences must not be overlooked since they may have an impact on the disorderness of the braided reach this study showed that peak flood stream power is better related to idi variation than monsoon and post monsoon stream power it is apparent that whenever the peak flood stream power value increases the smaller bar frequency decreases as well as the larger bar frequency or the surface area increases for the succeeding year for the second period 2010 2019 the peak flood stream power was increased which may have contributed to the rising trend of idi there can be a significant effect of stream power on the different classes of bar variability in the braided reach the class 2 bar which is considered to be the most dominating bar class for idi variation discussed earlier showed an inverse relation to peak flood stream power this is because extreme floods generate high velocity and erosive power which can deepen the shallower channel wash the smaller mobile bars and cause substantial bank erosion further the consequences of rising intensity floods require time to absorb within the system before it evolves towards a new planform as evidenced by irregular patterns in sediment material depositions observed during flood receding charlton 2007 smaller bar growth established a direct relationship with the peak flood events for some of the year the reason could be the peak flood episodes in those years sculpted sediment material from the bigger bars or banks and formed the smaller class bars through deposition moody 2019 wheaton et al 2013 williams et al 2020 furthermore we may obtain a better process understanding by considering it as a whole system along with their geomorphic responses to the stream energy generated by fluctuating peak flooding events of varying durations 5 discussions 5 1 role of sand bar dynamics in the morphological uncertainty the fundamental morphological aspect of a braided river is bar creation which is also associated with other morphological processes like bifurcation confluence formations alteration in channel sinuosity thalweg shifting and lateral channel migration ashmore 2013 chembolu and dutta 2018 nandi et al 2022 tubino and bertoldi 2007 the formation or growth of sandbars and their spatiotemporal evolution are strongly connected to a sequence of complex erosion deposition processes which must be understood to describe the morphodynamics of a highly braided river system furthermore the size of a sandbar is related to the stability and accompanying channel characteristics baki and gan 2012 this is supported in the present study where the frequency of small bars varies faster highly unstable and the frequency of large bars becomes relatively constant stable over the years figs 4 and 5 it should be noted that large sandbars with discrete areas are evidence of morphologic stress in which wider or spreading portions capture the bed material exported from the contracting or constricted parts repetto et al 2002 ramirez and allison 2013 szupiany et al 2012 wu yeh 2005 the unit discharge and flow transport capacity decline substantially toward the bar head during the low and medium flow stages facilitating suspended and bed sediment deposition however during floods high flow this process is opposite resulting in erosions at the head and around the bar such processes are observed in the present study reaches where the smaller bars are the prime target of the fluvial action this further reduces the frequency at high flow and may deposit to the comparably larger bars the antecedent state is reflected in the subsequent season by an increase in larger bar size frequency and a reduction in smaller bar frequency the grain size distribution of the bed and suspended sediment material also governs the particles which are transported in suspension onto the bar head the bed material is considerably coarser in the proposed study reaches of the brahmaputra river and these features may have an impact on the morphodynamic evolution of the bars furthermore a process based understanding of the sediment transport is required to evaluate the impact of flow conditions secondary currents turbulence structures and boundary shear on the sand bar dynamics resulting in extensive morphological changes along the brahmaputra river 5 2 idi variation and its influence on the system s disorderness chembolu and dutta 2018 reported that the intensity of braiding depends on the braided belt width availability due to multi channel formation and sand bar disorderness the available braided belt width room to move or erodible corridor or freedom space helps the river to self adjust or self heal against the disturbances caused by floods and sediment load fluctuations biron et al 2014 piégay et al 2005 rapp and abbe 2003 the process form evolution comprises erosional geomorphic unit removal widening of active channels river bank failure scour etc and depositional processes formation of new geomorphic units sediment material accretion etc fryirs et al 2015 in the downstream reach of guwahati the braided belt space availability is larger as compared to the upstream reach and therefore it facilitates the formation of major geomorphic units and an increased idi disorderness furthermore the disorderness of a braided reach is an indicator of the morphological changes and also depends on the hydrologic regime nicholas et al 2013 anthropogenic stresses hicks et al 2021 and periodic disturbances like earthquakes borgohain et al 2017 sarker and thorne 2006 according to sarker and thorne 2006 the impact of the great assam earthquake 1950 on the morphological dynamics of the brahmaputra river probably lasted for half a century due to substantial sediment wave generation this may induce fluctuation in the sandbar evolution which affects the idi variation over the years therefore any changes in the governing factors must be mapped as they induce a series of fluvial changes in the braided system at various spatio temporal scales 5 3 contribution of stream power to the idi variation and morphological variability stream power is considered as the potential measure of geomorphic activities in braided river the studies on sediment transport variability bagnold 1966 1977 hassan et al 1992 reid and frostick 1986 schneider et al 2010 yang 1972 bank erosion processes lawler et al 1999 braided belt disorderness chembolu and dutta 2018 channel changes chang 1979 ferguson 1987 van den berg 1995 aggradation and degradation thresholds identification bull 1979 haves been carried out based on the stream power variability in this study an attempt has been made to relate the stream power derivatives to the idi variation of the reach however in the brahmaputra river lack of relationship signals the highly non linear and complex processes owing to the combined effects of anthropogenic activities tectonic disturbances and varied hydrologic regime the previous literature synthesis indicated the dominant impact of flood stream power on the morphodynamics of alluvial rivers akhtar et al 2011 bawa et al 2014 kale 2008 magilligan et al 2015 pradhan et al 2021b in contrast karmaker et al 2017 argued that braiding is not directly controlled by the stream power and geological characteristics control its spatial distribution whereas the seasonal variability of stream power is controlled by annual rainfall variability kaushal et al 2020 furthermore the planform changes are not only the results of extreme events and smaller floods with regular intervals may have a higher cumulative impact on the changes charlton 2007 it was reported that on average annually nine flood waves take place in the brahmaputra river karmaker and dutta 2010 fig 8 clearly demonstrates that when the disorderness of the reach increases the corresponding stream power reduces indicating a lower potential for energy expenditure majumdar and mandal 2020 made a similar observation while attempting to correlate stream power with planform index and bank erosion for the ganga river furthermore high stream power can result in scour and formed chute bars as well as a significant concentration of coarser material above the bar head and chute dietrich and smith 1984 in addition if the stream power is reduced beyond a bar top due to an abrupt depth increment it can result in a deposition at that bar tail due to the formation of a low flow zone kasvi et al 2013 this was also observed at few locations along the braided reach and the size of the larger bars has been augmented in these conditions the frequency of smaller bars was reduced due to erosion resulting in the increment of larger bar area by deposition of the eroded material at the bar tail 5 4 interpretation of process based sand bar disorderness and energy expenditure mechanism the previous sections concluded the dynamics of the bar morphology may not be solely attributed to the stream power the response of braided reach to the stream power is not only in the form of bar morphology but also in the changes by other forms like thalweg shifting sinuosity erosion and deposition chembolu and dutta 2018 the excess energy available may be expended by the morphological activities at various hierarchical levels and overall self adjustment of the braided system a conceptual system representation based on the sand bar dynamics of a large braided river has been illustrated in fig 9 a system scale has been employed to represent the bar classes and their interactions with flow energy within the fluvial territory the sand bars are conceptualized based on the observed sand bar classes in our study reach table 2 further the interdependent nature of sand bars in terms of size location and erosion deposition activity are hypothesised with respect to the incoming flow energy the high magnitude floods produce huge amounts of energy and erosional power in the flow which affects the sand bar depending upon the size and location baki and gan 2012 goswami 1985 the system can be suggested as a spring system therefore any disturbance caused by incoming flow energy to any of the attributes affects the entire system and the disturbance propagates in both longitudinal and lateral directions in accordance with the increasing flow energy magnitude smaller mobile bars or even parts of larger bars depending upon their stability criteria get eroded and again deposited into the downstream bars chembolu and dutta 2018 pradhan et al 2021a nandi et al 2022 in similar fashion part of the bank gets eroded and widens the channel while part of the bank gets the deposited material and makes the channel narrower karmaker et al 2017 as such all of these processes control the channel in channel activity such as forming new channels secondary and tertiary closing of the existing channels modifying the thalweg sinuosity and forming the chute channels bawa et al 2014 chembolu and dutta 2018 therefore such complex process form interactions can in directly influence the braided belt variability as well as all sorts of geomorphological activity of the large braided river system and dissipate a significant portion of the fluvial energy available to the system 6 conclusions in the present study a multiband water index was used to identify the sand bar distribution in the braided reach of the brahmaputra then the concept of entropy was introduced to assess the variability of the sand bar over the selected braided planform of the brahmaputra the intensity disorder index idi was computed and it provides an understanding of the spatio temporal variability of sand bar distribution throughout the desired reach a multi regression analysis was also performed to determine the relationship between idi and stream power derivatives some of the major findings drawn from the analysis i the variations of idi showed a decreasing trend in 2000 2010 followed by an increasing trend up to 2019 which further signals a decadal shift in morphological stability in the brahmaputra ii the frequency of smaller mobile bars is high as compared to the medium and larger bars immobile in the second time period and controls the idi variability the inter comparison of the two braided sub reaches showed that the downstream reach had a higher idi attributed to the prevalence of smaller sized bars iii according to different stream power comparison peak flood stream power was better correlated to idi variation than monsoon and post monsoon stream power this may be credited to the dissection of the larger bars into smaller bars and increased the idi values in the second period in addition the large bars increased their surface area due to the accumulation of sculpted sediment materials from the washed out smaller bars and eroded cohesive banks for some period iv the disorderness of the braided reach does not fully expend the incoming stream power but also the additional available fluvial energy may be dissipated by geomorphological activities such as sinuosity alteration erosion deposition mechanism thalweg shifting etc the braided reach of the brahmaputra river forms due to an integrated drainage network consisting of several tributaries this study develops an approach to understand the bar morphology disorderness in this large braided system the concept can be further applied to other geomorphological frameworks based on the understanding of prominent geomorphic unit sand bar dynamics and their sustained evolutions finally the knowledge gleaned from this study can be utilized to design a process form interaction
