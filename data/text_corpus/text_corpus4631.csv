23155,jack up crane vessels are commonly used to install offshore wind turbine blades and other components a jack up crane vessel is subjected to wind and wave loads which cause motion at crane tip excessive motion at crane tip can lead to failure of lifting operations therefore the crane tip motion should be properly assessed for jack up crane vessels in this study a fully coupled model is developed for a typical elevated jack up crane vessel considering the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic loads on the vessel the soil structure interaction and the structural flexibility of the jack up legs and crane the vessel model developed is further coupled with the simo aero code to achieve a fully coupled aero hydro soil elastic mechanical code simo riflex aero for numerical modeling and dynamic analysis of offshore single blade installation using jack up crane vessels the simo riflex aero code is then applied to study the dynamic response of the dtu 10 mw wind turbine blade installed by a typical jack up crane vessel under various wind and wave conditions the results show that significant motion is induced at crane tip mainly due to wave loads it is important to consider the structural flexibility of the jack up legs and crane when modeling the installation of offshore wind turbine blades keywords offshore wind turbine blade installation jack up crane vessel soil structure interaction structural flexibility fully coupled method dynamic motion response 1 introduction offshore wind turbines can be installed by either floating or jack up crane vessels as shown in fig 1 compared to jack up vessels floating vessels provide more flexibility for offshore operations and accessibility in deep water they have been used to install fully assembled wind turbine towers with rotors and nacelle for floating and jacket supported offshore wind turbines as presented in fig 1 a and b however such operations are very challenging and rarely used due to the wave induced motion of the floating crane vessels jack up crane vessels are commonly used to install offshore wind turbines in shallow water because they can provide a stable working platform they are able to install the components of offshore wind turbines such as foundation tower nacelle and blades separately and in sequence as shown in fig 1 c ahn et al 2017 due to the growing market for offshore wind energy the demand for use of jack up crane vessels keeps increasing global data 2014 compared to traditional jack up platforms used in the offshore oil and gas industry the jack up crane vessels for offshore wind turbine installation usually have shallower leg penetration into the seabed because of the frequent repositioning as a result the vessels are more sensitive to wind and wave loads the tip of the crane on the vessel is observed to have notable motion during offshore operations large crane tip motion can lead to damaged guide pins at blade root during the blade installation to ensure safe and cost efficient operations it is of great importance to study the dynamic response of the jack up crane vessel especially of the crane tip and the installed components to date limited work has been carried out on jack up crane vessels used in offshore wind turbine installation duan and olsson 2014 and ringsberg et al 2017 studied the soil impact loads on the spudcans of a jack up crane vessel during the lowering and retrieval phases of jack up legs weather window assessments were also conducted based on the spudcan impact force criteria it was found that the leg lowering and retrieval operations are possible under larger wave heights in long waves van dalfsen 2016 studied the effects of soil load modeling on the dynamic structural response of the jack up crane vessel under survival conditions the results indicated that advanced soil models are essential in the design check of jack up crane vessels in extreme sea states however the dynamic motion response of the vessels during crane operations are not considered in these studies zhao et al 2018 developed an integrated dynamic analysis method for simulating installation of a single blade for wind turbines the coupled aero hydro mechanical code simo aero was developed and verified which is capable of accounting for blade aerodynamics vessel hydrodynamics and system mechanical couplings the simo aero code was used to study the dynamic response of a single blade installed by a jack up crane vessel however the motions of the vessel and the crane were not considered by zhao et al 2018 in the present study a fully coupled model is developed for a typical jack up crane vessel by using the simo sintef ocean 2017b and riflex sintef ocean 2017a codes the simo and riflex codes were developed by sintef ocean and have been widely used in the offshore wind oil and gas industries the vessel model can account for the wave loads on the jack up legs the wind loads on the vessel the structural flexibility of the vessel legs and the on board crane and the soil structure interaction eigen value analysis is conducted to identify the eigen periods and mode shapes of the vessel the first two longest natural periods are compared against values calculated according to standard recommended formula to evaluate the numerical model then the vessel model developed is integrated with the simo aero code developed by zhao et al 2018 to achieve a fully coupled aero hydro soil elastic mechanical code i e simo riflex aero for offshore wind turbine blade installation by a jack up crane vessel afterwards a series of time domain simulations are carried out to study the dynamic response characteristics of the vessel the cane tip and the installed blade under different wind and wave conditions the effects of crane tip motion on the dynamic response of the installed blade are also investigated 2 numerical modeling of the elevated jack up crane vessel in this section a coupled model is developed for typical elevated jack up crane vessels based on the simo riflex code as shown in fig 2 the vessel model accounts for the structural flexibility of the legs and the crane the soil spudcan interaction the wave loads on the legs and the wind loads acting on the vessel the vessel model developed is later integrated with the simo aero code in section 5 to formulate the simo riflex aero code a fully aero hydro soil elastic mechanical coupled code for simulating offshore wind turbine blade installed by jack up crane vessels the hull of the vessel is modeled as a rigid body with 6 degrees of freedom dofs in simo because it is generally much stiffer in all directions compared to the jack up legs and the crane the jack up legs are modeled by use of flexible beam elements in riflex the spudcans are modeled as nodal bodies at the lower end of each leg the jack up legs are connected to the hull by jacking systems installed in the white jacking houses shown in fig 3 a fig 3 b shows the rock chock type jacking system which is commonly used in modern jack up vessels it forms very stiff clamped connections between the legs and the hull the flexibility of such jacking system has negligible influence on the system natural periods global maritime 2003 thus the hull leg connections are modeled as rigid connections in the present model pedestal crane is a typical type of cranes equipped on jack up crane vessels as shown in fig 4 a a pedestal crane consists of crane supports a wire overhang system and a lattice boom in the numerical model it is assumed that the deformation of the crane system are mainly due to the flexibility of the boom and boom wires the deformation of the crane supports including king pedestal and back stay is neglected the lattice boom is simplified into a circular riflex beam with equivalent structural stiffness properties the lower end of the boom is hinged on the crane base the boom inclination is controlled by the boom wires which are modeled as riflex bar elements 2 1 modeling of soil spudcan interaction in the present model the soil reaction force is represented by using equivalent linear elastic springs combined with linear dampers to consider the soil damping effects without detailed modeling of the spudcans as shown in fig 5 it is a feasible simplification for modeling of soil behavior for jack up crane vessels under operational sea states which typically have a significant wave height below 2 5 3 0m ahn et al 2017 paterson et al 2017 in such conditions the loads acting on the spudcans are much smaller than those required to reach the soil yield surface hence the linear elastic soil modes can be used martin 1994 zeng et al 2015 as shown in fig 5 linear springs and dampers in 6 dofs at the reference point are used to represent the soil resistant force the reference point of the soil model is at the lower end of each jack up leg where the spudcan locates the corresponding soil reaction force can be expressed as a function of spudcan displacement i e 1 f s k s x s c c s x s c where the dots denote time derivative k s k x k y k z k ϕ k θ k ψ is the soil stiffness vector in 6 dofs without considering coupling effects the stiffness coefficient are dependent on the soil properties the dimension and the penetration depth of the spudcans they could be calculated using recommended empirical formula sname 2008 iso 2009 or estimated based on site specific soil properties the c s is the corresponding vector of the soil damping x s c is the displacement vector i e 2 x s c x y z ϕ θ ψ where x y z are the translation motion of the reference point lower end node of jack up leg ϕ θ and ψ are the rotational motion of the leg at its lower end 2 2 modeling of the wave loads a jack up crane vessel usually has its hull elevated well above the mean sea surface when installing offshore wind turbines only the lower parts of the legs are submerged as shown in fig 6 the instantaneous wave load normal to the leg can be calculated using morison s formula leg diameter to wave length ratio 1 5 3 f h η ρ a e x t 1 c a u z ρ a e x t c a r z 1 2 ρ d e x t c d u z r z u z r z ρ a i n t r z d z where the dots denote time derivatives ρ is the mass density of water d e x t is the external diameter of the leg a e x t and a i n t are respectively the external and internal cross sectional areas of the leg c a and c d are respectively the non dimensional 2d added mass and quadratic drag coefficients u and r are respectively the velocity vector of undisturbed wave field and motion vector of the leg h is the water depth and η is the instantaneous wave elevation the last term in eq 3 represents the effect of water inside leg sintef ocean 2017a 2 3 modeling of the wind loads during offshore wind turbine installation the wind loads on the jack up crane vessel consists of contributions from the jack up house legs as well as the wind turbine components and equipment loaded on the vessel deck the wind area and shape coefficients of each component are different the wind load on one component may be greatly affected by shielding effect from others detailed coefficients from wind tunnel test are favorable in order to achieve an accurate estimation of wind loads however these coefficients are not available at present under such a circumstance the wind area above the hull baseline is considered as a block with equivalent area and wind coefficients the wind loads on the parts of the legs between the wave crest and the hull baseline are neglected as recommended dnvgl 2015 the simplification is acceptable since the motion of the jack up vessel is mainly wave induced during operations the wind load is calculated as dnvgl 2015 4 f x w d 1 2 ρ a i r c s a v 2 c o s α 5 f y w d 1 2 ρ a i r c s a v 2 s i n α 6 f z w i n d 0 where ρ a i r is the density of air α is the relative wind inflow angle as shown in fig 7 v is the relative wind inflow velocity c s is the overall shape coefficient i e c s 1 1 a is the area normal to the inflow wind 7 a a x n c o s α a y n s i n α where a x n and a y n are respectively the wind area normal to x v and y v axis the corresponding wind moments can be expressed as 8 m x w d z c f y w d 9 m y w d z c f x w d 10 m z w d x c f y w d y c f x w d where x c y c z c is the position vector of the center of the equivalent wind block 2 4 modeling of p δ effect and influence of leg inclination for slender and flexible jack up structures the second order effects need to be considered such as the p δ effect and the influence of leg inclination sname 2008 the p δ effect is illustrated in fig 8 a the deformation of jack up legs causes hull translational motion in the horizontal plane as a result the vertical soil reaction force no longer passes through the center of hull leg connection and leads to an extra moment inclination of the legs as illustrated in fig 8 b results in an eccentricity between the vertical soil force and the hull leg connection it also introduces extra bending moment in the legs at the hull leg connections these two effects are accounted for by the non linear geometry feature in the finite element model in riflex 2 5 modeling of system damping for a typical jack up type structure the damping sources are mainly structural damping soil damping and hydrodynamic damping the hydrodynamic damping is accounted for by incorporating the wave velocity relative to the movement of legs which is the third term in eq 3 the soil damping is typically around 2 of the system critical damping dnvgl 2015 in this study the soil damping is considered by using equivalent linear dampers which are presented as the second term in eq 1 the structural damping of jack up crane vessels also includes damping in guides shock pads locking devices and jacking mechanisms in the present model the structural damping corresponds to 0 5 of the system critical damping and is modeled by use of the rayleigh damping model rayleigh 1877 3 system description of a typical jack up crane vessel a typical jack up crane vessel is used in this study the main properties of the vessel are listed in table 1 including the parameters of the hull legs and wind coefficients the structural properties of the crane are presented in table 2 the detailed site specific data for the vessel and the corresponding soil parameters are given in table 3 which were obtained when the vessel installed offshore wind turbines at a 39m deep site in the north sea 3 1 definition of coordinate systems a global coordinate system and a vessel related coordinate system are introduced as shown in fig 9 for the vessel related coordinate system o v x v y v z v the origin o v is located at the hull geometry center with x v axis along the hull length and y v axis along the hull width while the z v axis follows the right hand rule the global coordinate system o x y z has its origin located at the mean sea surface the x and z respectively parallel with y v and z v when the vessel is at rest the crane boom angle is defined as the relative angle between the crane boom and the deck the wave incident angle θ w v is defined as the angle of the wave direction relative to the x and is positive counterclockwise a similar definition is used for the wind inflow angle θ w d the vessel is used to install a wind turbine blade as shown in fig 9 detailed modeling of the blade and the lifting gear is discussed in section 5 3 2 cancellation and enhancement periods of wave loads on the legs table 4 gives the critical wave periods that could lead to cancellation and enhancement effects of the global wave loads on the vessel legs due to wave phase caused by the spacing between legs dnvgl 2015 the wave loads on individual legs are not affected the resulting total loads on all of the legs would be reduced to zero due to the opposite phases of wave loads on the two legs in the wave propagation direction when the cancellation effect happens otherwise the sum wave loads would be doubled in case of same phases which is the enhancement effect of wave loads some of these cancellation and enhancement periods are likely to occur when the vessel works in the north sea typical wave period 5 15s the influences of wave cancellation and wave enhancement effects on the system dynamic response are studied in the later sections 4 evaluation of the vessel numerical model the developed vessel model is evaluated in this section the natural periods of the vessel motion obtained from the numerical model are compared against values estimated according to standard recommended empirical formula verification against experimental data or on site measurement is not carried out since these data are very difficult to obtain eigen value analysis is conducted to identify the eigen periods and eigen modes of vessel motion excluding the crane which are presented in table 5 and fig 10 the first two largest natural periods correspond to surge and sway motion followed by that of yaw motion which agrees with the general order of natural periods for typical elevated jack up vessels given in dnv rp c104 dnvgl 2015 according to dnv rp c104 dnvgl 2015 the longest natural periods of a typical elevated unit can be approximated by 11 t n 2 π m e k e where m e and k e are respectively the equivalent mass and stiffness associated with one leg which have to be obtained from the complete model of the jack up vessel and four legs depending on the eigen modes the natural periods of surge and sway motion for the vessel are calculated by using eq 11 and compared with the corresponding values obtained from the eigen value analysis as given in table 6 the comparison shows that the eigen periods of the eigen value analysis agree fairly well with those estimated by the empirical formula it implies that the established numerical model can provide reasonable estimation of the vessel dynamic response the natural period of the crane motion is identified by using decay tests while the vessel is fixed a vertical force is applied at the crane tip and removed after some time the natural period of the crane is calculated by analyzing the time series of the crane tip motion the natural period is caused by the rotational motion of the crane boom around its hinged lower end due to the boom wire deformation the crane boom itself has marginal deformation compared to that of the boom wires the natural period of the crane is affected by the lifted components and lifting gears the crane itself has a natural period of 2 0s without lifting anything however when the installed blade and the lifting gear given in section 5 are considered the crane natural period is shifted to approximately 2 9s 5 modeling of the installed wind turbine blade and the lifting gear the developed vessel model is coupled with the simo aero code developed by zhao et al 2018 to establish a fully coupled aero hydro soil elastic mechanical code simo riflex aero for simulating offshore wind turbine blade installation using jack up crane vessels the coupled code is capable of accounting for the aerodynamics of the installed blade the structural flexibility of the vessel legs and crane the wave loads on the legs and wind loads on the hull the soil structure interaction as well as the mechanical couplings between the crane and the blade the vessel model is extensively discussed in section 2 the detailed model of the blade and corresponding lifting gear is explained in this section the blade is modeled as a rigid body with 6 dofs in simo the structural flexibility of the blade is neglected since it has minor influence on the dynamic motion response of the blade during installation zhao et al 2018 the aerodynamic loads acting on the blade are calculated by the external code aero based on the cross flow principle details of the aero code can be found in ref zhao et al 2018 the dtu 10 mw wind turbine blade bak et al 2013 is considered in the present study a yoke is used to hold the blade the yoke and the blade are considered as one rigid body in the numerical model the yoke is lifted by the hook via four slings the lift wire runs through the crane tip to the hook in the present model the lift wire and slings are modeled as bar elements with equivalent stiffness and damping properties the hook is modeled as a point mass at the lower end of the lift wire tugger lines are used for blade heading control which run from the yoke to a trolley on the crane boom pretension is applied in tugger lines to prevent slack lines the tugger line tension is modeled as bi linear spring force zhao et al 2018 the main properties of the blade lifting system are summarized in table 7 installation of the dtu 10 mw wind turbine blade by the aforementioned jack up crane vessel will be simulated by the coupled code simo riflex aero as shown in fig 11 the blade span is deployed along the vessel longitudinal direction a blade body related coordinate system is defined and used in the presented study the its origin is at the blade center of gravity the y b axis is along the blade span the x b axis goes from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the blade while the z b axis follows the right hand rule the blade body related coordinate parallels with the global coordinate when the blade is at rest as shown in fig 9 table 8 lists the first three longest natural periods and corresponding motion which dominate the blade rigid body motion obtained when the crane tip is fixed the first mode is caused by the blade pendulum motion around the hook which is denoted by the blade roll resonant response in this study the blade yaw resonant motion dominate the second mode the third mode is caused by the double pendulum motion of the blade and hook around the crane tip in the vertical o b y b z b plane with the blade and hook motion out of phase zhao et al 2018 6 time domain simulations and case studies time domain simulations are carried out to study the dynamic response of the vessel and the installed blade under different sea states using the fully coupled simo riflex aero code a series of load cases are defined as given in table 9 lc1 and lc2 are turbulent wind only cases the vessel and the crane tip are assumed to be fixed in lc1 and are free to move in lc2 these two cases are used to evaluate the wind induced motion of the vessel and the crane tip moreover comparing results of lc1 and other cases can identify the effect of crane tip motion on the motion of the installed blade lc3 lc13 are load cases with combined turbulent wind and irregular waves in lc6 the significant wave height and peak period are correlated with the wind condition at the north sea center site li et al 2015 the wind turbulence intensity is calculated according to the iec class a which is the design class for the dtu 10 mw wind turbine bak et al 2013 the wind and wave parameters are varied around lc6 to study the impacts of different factors on the system dynamic motion response including wind and wave directions aligned and misaligned significant wave height wave peak period and mean wind speed turbulent winds are used in all load cases the turbsim jonkman 2009 is used to generate the three dimensional turbulent wind field according to the kaimal turbulence model the irregular waves are long crested and are modeled by using the jonswap spectrum for each load case the simulation lasts for 1 h after removing the start up transients the statistical values and power spectra of the dynamic motion response are obtained based on the 1 h simulation results 7 results and discussion the results from the time domain simulations are discussed in this section the characteristics of the vessel motion 6 dofs the crane tip movement 3 dofs the blade motion at its cog and the corresponding translational motion at the blade root 3 dofs are investigated the blade root is considered as a point on the blade which is modeled as a rigid body therefore the translational motion of the blade root are obtained from the 6 dof rigid body motion of the blade tensions in the boom wires lift wire slings and tugger lines are not discussed here due to their marginal fluctuations 7 1 motion of the vessel the vessel motion is defined in the vessel related coordinate system in fig 9 fig 12 a show the standard deviations of the vessel translational motion in lc1 lc13 while those in fig 12 b present those of the vessel rotational motion the vessel motion is zero in lc1 as it is fixed during the numerical simulation the vessel heave motion is negligible comparisons between lc2 and lc3 lc13 reveal that the wave induced motion of the vessel dominates over the wind induced response the wind loads are further shown to have minor influence on the vessel motion compared to the wave load by comparing lc5 and lc6 and lc6 lc12 and lc13 the vessel motion is sensitive to the incident wave direction as shown by comparing the results in lc3 lc6 and lc7 it is also dependent on the wave height which can be observed in the results for lc6 lc8 and lc9 the vessel motion is marginally affected by the cancellation and enhancement effects in wave loads as shown by the results in lc10 and lc11 the amplitudes of vessel motion show a increasing trend with decreasing wave peak period the vessel motion spectra are analyzed fig 13 shows the spectra of vessel motion in surge sway and yaw the spectra of vessel pitch and roll motion are similar to those of surge and sway motion respectively the power spectrum of vessel surge motion is dominated by the surge resonant response the vessel sway motion is dominated by the vessel sway resonant response in lc3 θ w v 0 o while notable contributions from the crane resonance response are observed in lc6 and lc11 θ w v 65 87 o the vessel yaw motion is mainly dominated by the vessel yaw resonant response 7 2 motion at the crane tip the crane tip motion is important for crane operations at a large lifting height the characteristics of the crane tip motion are discussed in this section the standard deviations of crane tip motion in the vessel related coordinate system are presented in fig 14 both the vessel motion and the crane deformation contribute to the crane tip motion the crane deformation includes the deformation of the boom wires and the crane boom while the deformation of the latter is much marginal compared to that of the former the crane is deployed in the vertical o v y v z v plane during the operation as shown in fig 9 as a result the crane tip motion along x v and z v gets significant contributions from the crane resonant response due to crane deformation as can be observed in their power spectra shown in fig 15 the crane tip motion along x v has minor contributions of crane resonant response and is mainly resulted from the vessel motion the crane tip motion is marginally affected by the variation of wind conditions as shown by comparing it s standard deviations in lc5 lc6 lc12 and lc13 in fig 14 similar to the vessel motion the crane tip motion is sensitive to the wave excitation the comparisons among the results in lc6 lc10 and lc11 and lc6 lc8 and lc9 show that the crane tip motion decreases significantly with reduction in the significant wave height and wave peak period 7 3 motion of the installed blade the 6 dof rigid body motions of the blade with the reference point at its cog are studied in this section the motions are defined in the blade related coordinate system in fig 11 the first 3 dof motions refer to the translational motions at the cog while the rest 3 dof motions refer to the rotational motions around the cog their standard deviations in lc1 13 are shown in fig 16 it can be observed that the blade roll motion is much larger than the blade yaw motion in fig 16 b since the latter is well controlled by the tugger lines deployed perpendicular to the blade span while the former experiences limited restoring force from the tugger lines comparisons among lc1 3 show that the blade surge heave and pitch motions experience significant contributions from the vessel motion and crane movement they show large dependency on the wave condition lc3 lc6 lc11 and are marginally affected by the wind properties lc5 lc6 lc12 and lc13 they are dominated by a combination of the crane resonant response and the vessel sway resonant motion as shown by the power spectra of blade surge motion in fig 17 the dominance of these two contributions is dependent on the wave direction the blade motion in sway roll and yaw is mainly induced by blade aerodynamic load the power spectra of blade sway and yaw motions are presented in fig 18 the blade sway motion is completely dominated by the blade roll resonant response in lc1 consideration the vessel and crane motion introduces another two peaks into its power spectrum due to the double pendulum induced response and the vessel surge resonant motion as shown in fig 18 a these two peaks are negligible in the spectrum of blade yaw motion in fig 18 b the blade yaw motion is dominated by the blade roll and yaw resonant responses consideration the vessel and crane motion increases the contribution from the blade yaw resonant motion the effects of the vessel and crane motion on blade motion in sway roll and yaw are significant in short waves 7 4 motion at the blade root the blade root motion is critical during the final mating phase of blade installation the mating process is not possible if the blade root motion is too large the characteristics of the translational motion at blade root in the blade related coordinate system in fig 11 are studied in this section fig 19 shows the standard deviations of the blade root motion comparing results in lc1 lc3 indicates that the blade root motion would be significantly underestimated especially along x b if the detailed modeling of vessel and crane motion is not considered larger underestimation is expected to occur in shorter waves as indicated by comparing the power spectra of blade root motion in lc1 lc6 and lc11 in fig 20 the displacements of blade root in the global coordinate system are further compared with those of the vessel origin the crane tip and the blade cog as shown in table 10 the blade root motion along y is mainly resulted from that of the blade cog the blade root motion along z is much larger than that of the blade cog due to the notable contribution from blade roll motion in lc3 11 the blade root motion along x is close to that of blade cog because the contribution from blade yaw motion becomes relatively less important the displacements of the blade root and blade cog are much larger than those of the crane tip and the vessel origin detailed system modeling including the blade the vessel and the crane is recommended for numerical analysis of offshore wind turbine blade installation 8 conclusions this study deals with the development evaluation and application of a fully integrated simulation tool namely simo riflex aero for modeling and dynamic response analysis of single blade installation for offshore wind turbines using a jack up crane vessel the developed simulation tool can account for aerodynamics hydrodynamics soil and structural dynamics and wire coupling mechanics a coupled simo riflex model for a typical elevated jack up crane vessel is first developed considering wave loads on the vessel legs wind loads on the vessel structural flexibility of the legs and the crane soil structure interaction as well as important non linear effects such as p δ effect and leg inclination eigen value analysis is conducted to analyze the eigen periods and mode shapes of the vessel motion the natural periods of the vessel motion are found to be in the order of 0 4 3s which are lower than typical wave periods however the vessel motion resonances in the longitudinal transverse and torsional degrees can still be excited especially in short waves the first two longest periods are compared with values estimated by empirical formula recommended by standards and guidelines the developed simo riflex model is then coupled with the simo aero code zhao et al 2018 to achieve the integrated simulation tool simo riflex aero the fully coupled simo riflex aero code is then applied to simulate the dynamic response of the dtu 10 mw wind turbine blade being installed by a jack up crane vessel under different stochastic wave and wind conditions in time domain the vessel motion is mainly induced by wave loads on the jack up legs a decrease in wave period and an increase in wave height can cause significant increase in the vessel motion the vessel motion is dominated by the vessel s surge sway and yaw resonant response with contribution from the crane s resonant response significant crane tip motion is induced by the vessel motion together with the crane flexibility the crane tip motion in sway and heave is dominated by the crane resonant response the motion of the installed blade are significantly affected by the crane motion caused by the vessel motion due to wave load on the legs crane tip motion contributes to much larger blade motion in surge heave and pitch increases in the blade sway roll and yaw motion are also caused by the crane tip motion in short waves while in long waves they are not as a result the blade root motion is significantly increased both along and normal to the hub axis the blade root velocity is expected to experience larger increase in short waves which can lead to high potential of damaged guide pins during the final connection phase it is essential to plan offshore operations by using an integrated numerical model and analysis it is revealed in this study by taking the offshore wind turbine blade installation using a jack up crane vessel as an example in addition to the direct modeling of the blade motion under wind loads modeling of the jack up vessel and the crane is also of great importance for a more safe and efficient installation operation the vessel motion can cause significant motion at the crane tip during lifting operations at large heights the crane tip motion due to the vessel motion and crane flexibility can also greatly increase the motion of the lifted components and hence affects the safety and efficiency of the operation the methodology developed in this study can also be applied to deal with other types of offshore lifting operations using jack up crane vessels acknowledgment the authors appreciate the support from the department of

interaction structural flexibility fully coupled method dynamic motion response 1 introduction offshore wind turbines can be installed by either floating or jack up crane vessels as shown in fig 1 compared to jack up vessels floating vessels provide more flexibility for offshore operations and accessibility in deep water they have been used to install fully assembled wind turbine towers with rotors and nacelle for floating and jacket supported offshore wind turbines as presented in fig 1 a and b however such operations are very challenging and rarely used due to the wave induced motion of the floating crane vessels jack up crane vessels are commonly used to install offshore wind turbines in shallow water because they can provide a stable working platform they are able to install the components of offshore wind turbines such as foundation tower nacelle and blades separately and in sequence as shown in fig 1 c ahn et al 2017 due to the growing market for offshore wind energy the demand for use of jack up crane vessels keeps increasing global data 2014 compared to traditional jack up platforms used in the offshore oil and gas industry the jack up crane vessels for offshore wind turbine installation usually have shallower leg penetration into the seabed because of the frequent repositioning as a result the vessels are more sensitive to wind and wave loads the tip of the crane on the vessel is observed to have notable motion during offshore operations large crane tip motion can lead to damaged guide pins at blade root during the blade installation to ensure safe and cost efficient operations it is of great importance to study the dynamic response of the jack up crane vessel especially of the crane tip and the installed components to date limited work has been carried out on jack up crane vessels used in offshore wind turbine installation duan and olsson 2014 and ringsberg et al 2017 studied the soil impact loads on the spudcans of a jack up crane vessel during the lowering and retrieval phases of jack up legs weather window assessments were also conducted based on the spudcan impact force criteria it was found that the leg lowering and retrieval operations are possible under larger wave heights in long waves van dalfsen 2016 studied the effects of soil load modeling on the dynamic structural response of the jack up crane vessel under survival conditions the results indicated that advanced soil models are essential in the design check of jack up crane vessels in extreme sea states however the dynamic motion response of the vessels during crane operations are not considered in these studies zhao et al 2018 developed an integrated dynamic analysis method for simulating installation of a single blade for wind turbines the coupled aero hydro mechanical code simo aero was developed and verified which is capable of accounting for blade aerodynamics vessel hydrodynamics and system mechanical couplings the simo aero code was used to study the dynamic response of a single blade installed by a jack up crane vessel however the motions of the vessel and the crane were not considered by zhao et al 2018 in the present study a fully

compared against values calculated according to standard recommended formula to evaluate the numerical model then the vessel model developed is integrated with the simo aero code developed by zhao et al 2018 to achieve a fully coupled aero hydro soil elastic mechanical code i e simo riflex aero for offshore wind turbine blade installation by a jack up crane vessel afterwards a series of time domain simulations are carried out to study the dynamic response characteristics of the vessel the cane tip and the installed blade under different wind and wave conditions the effects of crane tip motion on the dynamic response of the installed blade are also investigated 2 numerical modeling of the elevated jack up crane vessel in this section a coupled model is developed for typical elevated jack up crane vessels based on the simo riflex code as shown in fig 2 the vessel model accounts for the structural flexibility of the legs and the crane the soil spudcan interaction the wave loads on the legs and the wind loads acting on the vessel the vessel model developed is later integrated with the simo aero code in section 5 to formulate the simo riflex aero code a fully aero hydro soil elastic mechanical coupled code for simulating offshore wind turbine blade installed by jack up crane vessels the hull of the vessel is modeled as a rigid body with 6 degrees of freedom dofs in simo because it is generally much stiffer in all directions compared to the jack up legs and the crane the jack up legs are modeled by use of flexible beam elements in riflex the spudcans are modeled as nodal bodies at the lower end of each leg the jack up legs are connected to the hull by jacking systems installed in the white jacking houses shown in fig 3 a fig 3 b shows the rock chock type jacking system which is commonly used in modern jack up vessels it forms very stiff clamped connections between the legs and the hull the flexibility of such jacking system has negligible influence on the system natural periods global maritime 2003 thus the hull leg connections are modeled as rigid connections in the present model pedestal crane is a typical type of cranes equipped on jack up crane vessels as shown in fig 4 a a pedestal crane consists of crane supports a wire overhang system and a lattice boom in the numerical model it is assumed that the deformation of the crane system are mainly due to the flexibility of the boom and boom wires the deformation of the crane supports including king pedestal and back stay is neglected the lattice boom is simplified into a circular riflex beam with equivalent structural stiffness properties the lower end of the boom is hinged on the crane base the boom inclination is controlled by the boom wires which are modeled as riflex bar elements 2 1 modeling of soil spudcan interaction in the present model the soil reaction force is represented by using equivalent linear elastic springs combined with linear dampers to consider the soil damping effects without detailed modeling of the spudcans as shown in fig 5 it is a feasible simplification for modeling of soil behavior for jack up crane vessels under operational sea states which typically have a significant wave height below 2 5 3 0m ahn et al 2017 paterson et al 2017 in such conditions the loads acting on the spudcans are much smaller than those required to reach the soil yield surface hence the linear elastic soil modes can be used martin 1994 zeng et al 2015 as shown in fig 5 linear springs and dampers in 6 dofs at the reference point are used to represent the soil resistant force the reference point of the soil model is at the lower end of each jack up leg where the spudcan locates the corresponding soil reaction force can be expressed as a function of spudcan displacement i e 1 f s k s x s c c s x s c where the dots denote time derivative k s k x k y k z k ϕ k θ k ψ is the soil stiffness vector in 6 dofs without considering coupling effects the stiffness coefficient are dependent on the soil properties the dimension and the penetration depth of the spudcans they could be calculated using recommended empirical formula sname 2008 iso 2009 or estimated based on site specific soil properties the c s is the corresponding vector of the soil damping x s c is the displacement vector i e 2 x s c x y z ϕ θ ψ where x y z are the translation motion of the reference point lower end node of jack up leg ϕ θ and ψ are the rotational motion of the leg at its lower end 2 2 modeling of the wave loads a jack up crane vessel usually has its hull elevated well above the mean sea surface when installing offshore wind turbines only the lower parts of the legs are submerged as shown in fig 6 the instantaneous wave load normal to the leg can be calculated using morison s formula leg diameter to wave length ratio 1 5 3 f h η ρ a e x t 1 c a u z ρ a e x t c a r z 1 2 ρ d e x t c d u z r z u z r z ρ a i n t r z d z where the dots denote time derivatives ρ is the mass density of water d e x t is the external diameter of the leg a e x t and a i n t are respectively the external and internal cross sectional areas of the leg c a and c d are respectively the non dimensional 2d added mass and quadratic drag coefficients u and r are respectively the velocity vector of undisturbed wave field and motion vector of the leg h is the water depth and η is the instantaneous wave elevation the last term in eq 3 represents the effect of water inside leg sintef ocean 2017a 2 3 modeling of the wind loads during offshore wind turbine installation the wind loads on the jack up crane vessel consists of contributions from the jack up house legs as well as the wind turbine components and equipment loaded on the vessel deck the wind area and shape coefficients of each component are different the wind load on one component may be greatly affected by shielding effect from others detailed coefficients from wind tunnel test are favorable in order to achieve an accurate estimation of wind loads however these coefficients are not available at present under such a circumstance the wind area above the hull baseline is considered as a block with equivalent area and wind coefficients the wind loads on the parts of the legs between the wave crest and the hull baseline are neglected as recommended dnvgl 2015 the simplification is acceptable since the motion of the jack up vessel is mainly wave induced during operations the wind load is calculated as dnvgl 2015 4 f x w d 1 2 ρ a i r c s a v 2 c o s α 5 f y w d 1 2 ρ a i r c s a v 2 s i n α 6 f z w i n d 0 where ρ a i r is the density of air α is the relative wind inflow angle as shown in fig 7 v is the relative wind inflow velocity c s is the overall shape coefficient i e c s 1 1 a is the area normal to the inflow wind 7 a a x n c o s α a y n s i n α where a x n and a y n are respectively the wind area normal to x v and y v axis the corresponding wind moments can be expressed as 8 m x w d z c f y w d 9 m y w d z c f x w d 10 m z w d x c f y w d y c f x w d where x c y c z c is the position vector of the center of the equivalent wind block 2 4 modeling of p δ effect and influence of leg inclination for slender and flexible jack up structures the second order effects need to be considered such as the p δ effect and the influence of leg inclination sname 2008 the p δ effect is illustrated in fig 8 a the deformation of jack up legs causes hull translational motion in the horizontal plane as a result the vertical soil reaction force no longer passes through the center of hull leg connection and leads to an extra moment inclination of the legs as illustrated in fig 8 b results in an eccentricity between the vertical soil force and the hull leg connection it also introduces extra bending moment in the legs at the hull leg connections these two effects are accounted for by the non linear geometry feature in the finite element model in riflex 2 5 modeling of system damping for a typical jack up type structure the damping sources are mainly structural damping soil damping and hydrodynamic damping the hydrodynamic damping is accounted for by incorporating the wave velocity relative to the movement of legs which is the third term in eq 3 the soil damping is typically around 2 of the system critical damping dnvgl 2015 in this study the soil damping is considered by using equivalent linear dampers which are presented as the second term in eq 1 the structural damping of jack up crane vessels also includes damping in guides shock pads locking devices and jacking mechanisms in the present model the structural damping corresponds to 0 5 of the system critical damping and is modeled by use of the rayleigh damping model rayleigh 1877 3 system description of a typical jack up crane vessel a typical jack up crane vessel is used in this study the main properties of the vessel are listed in table 1 including the parameters of the hull legs and wind coefficients the structural properties of the crane are presented in table 2 the detailed site specific data for the vessel and the corresponding soil parameters are given in table 3 which were obtained when the vessel installed offshore wind turbines at a 39m deep site in the north sea 3 1 definition of coordinate systems a global coordinate system and a vessel related coordinate system are introduced as shown in fig 9 for the vessel related coordinate system o v x v y v z v the origin o v is located at the hull geometry center with x v axis along the hull length and y v axis along the hull width while the z v axis follows the right hand rule the global coordinate system o x y z has its origin located at the mean sea surface the x and z respectively parallel with y v and z v when the vessel is at rest the crane boom angle is defined as the relative angle between the crane boom and the deck the wave incident angle θ w v is defined as the angle of the wave direction relative to the x and is positive counterclockwise a similar definition is used for the wind inflow angle θ w d the vessel is used to install a wind turbine blade as shown in fig 9 detailed modeling of the blade and the lifting gear is discussed in section 5 3 2 cancellation and enhancement periods of wave loads on the legs table 4 gives the critical wave periods that could lead to cancellation and enhancement effects of the global wave loads on the vessel legs due to wave phase caused by the spacing between legs dnvgl 2015 the wave loads on individual legs are not affected the resulting total loads on all of the legs would be reduced to zero due to the opposite phases of wave loads on the two legs in the wave propagation direction when the cancellation effect happens otherwise the sum wave loads would be doubled in case of same phases which is the enhancement effect of wave loads some of these cancellation and enhancement periods are likely to occur when the vessel works in the north sea typical wave period 5 15s the influences of wave cancellation and wave enhancement effects on the system dynamic response are studied in the later sections 4 evaluation of the vessel numerical model the developed vessel model is evaluated in this section the natural periods of the vessel motion obtained from the numerical model are compared against values estimated according to standard recommended empirical formula verification against experimental data or on site measurement is not carried out since these data are very difficult to obtain eigen value analysis is conducted to identify the eigen periods and eigen modes of vessel motion excluding the crane which are presented in table 5 and fig 10 the first two largest natural periods correspond to surge and sway motion followed by that of yaw motion which agrees with the general order of natural periods for typical elevated jack up vessels given in dnv rp c104 dnvgl 2015 according to dnv rp c104 dnvgl 2015 the longest natural periods of a typical elevated unit can be approximated by 11 t n 2 π m e k e where m e and k e are respectively the equivalent mass and stiffness associated with one leg which have to be obtained from the complete model of the jack up vessel and four legs depending on the eigen modes the natural periods of surge and sway motion for the vessel are calculated by using eq 11 and compared with the corresponding values obtained from the eigen value analysis as given in table 6 the comparison shows that the eigen periods of the eigen value analysis agree fairly well with those estimated by the empirical formula it implies that the established numerical model can provide reasonable estimation of the vessel dynamic response the natural period of the crane motion is identified by using decay tests while the vessel is fixed a vertical force is applied at the crane tip and removed after some time the natural period of the crane is calculated by analyzing the time series of the crane tip motion the natural period is caused by the rotational motion of the crane boom around its hinged lower end due to the boom wire deformation the crane boom itself has marginal deformation compared to that of the boom wires the natural period of the crane is affected by the lifted components and lifting gears the crane itself has a natural period of 2 0s without lifting anything however when the installed blade and the lifting gear given in section 5 are considered the crane natural period is shifted to approximately 2 9s 5 modeling of the installed wind turbine blade and the lifting gear the developed vessel model is coupled with the simo aero code developed by zhao et al 2018 to establish a fully coupled aero hydro soil elastic mechanical code simo riflex aero for simulating offshore wind turbine blade installation using jack up crane vessels the coupled code is capable of accounting for the aerodynamics of the installed blade the structural flexibility of the vessel legs and crane the wave loads on the legs and wind loads on the hull the soil structure interaction as well as the mechanical couplings between the crane and the blade the vessel model is extensively discussed in section 2 the detailed model of the blade and corresponding lifting gear is explained in this section the blade is modeled as a rigid body with 6 dofs in simo the structural flexibility of the blade is neglected since it has minor influence on the dynamic motion response of the blade during installation zhao et al 2018 the aerodynamic loads acting on the blade are calculated by the external code aero based on the cross flow principle details of the aero code can be found in ref zhao et al 2018 the dtu 10 mw wind turbine blade bak et al 2013 is considered in the present study a yoke is used to hold the blade the yoke and the blade are considered as one rigid body in the numerical model the yoke is lifted by the hook via four slings the lift wire runs through the crane tip to the hook in the present model the lift wire and slings are modeled as bar elements with equivalent stiffness and damping properties the hook is modeled as a point mass at the lower end of the lift wire tugger lines are used for blade heading control which run from the yoke to a trolley on the crane boom pretension is applied in tugger lines to prevent slack lines the tugger line tension is modeled as bi linear spring force zhao et al 2018 the main properties of the blade lifting system are summarized in table 7 installation of the dtu 10 mw wind turbine blade by the aforementioned jack up crane vessel will be simulated by the coupled code simo riflex aero as shown in fig 11 the blade span is deployed along the vessel longitudinal direction a blade body related coordinate system is defined and used in the presented study the its origin is at the blade center of gravity the y b axis is along the blade span the x b axis goes from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the blade while the z b axis follows the right hand rule the blade body related coordinate parallels with the global coordinate when the blade is at rest as shown in fig 9 table 8 lists the first three longest natural periods and corresponding motion which dominate the blade rigid body motion obtained when the crane tip is fixed the first mode is caused by the blade pendulum motion around the hook which is denoted by the blade roll resonant response in this study the blade yaw resonant motion dominate the second mode the third mode is caused by the double pendulum motion of the blade and hook around the crane tip in the vertical o b y b z b plane with the blade and hook motion out of phase zhao et al 2018 6 time domain simulations and case studies time domain simulations are carried out to study the dynamic response of the vessel and the installed blade under different sea states using the fully coupled simo riflex aero code a series of load cases are defined as given in table 9 lc1 and lc2 are turbulent wind only cases the vessel and the crane tip are assumed to be fixed in lc1 and are free to move in lc2 these two cases are used to evaluate the wind induced motion of the vessel and the crane tip moreover comparing results of lc1 and other cases can identify the effect of crane tip motion on the motion of the installed blade lc3 lc13 are load cases with combined turbulent wind and irregular waves in lc6 the significant wave height and peak period are correlated with the wind condition at the north sea center site li et al 2015 the wind turbulence intensity is calculated according to the iec class a which is the design class for the dtu 10 mw wind turbine bak et al 2013 the wind and wave parameters are varied around lc6 to study the impacts of different factors on the system dynamic motion response including wind and wave directions aligned and misaligned significant wave height wave peak period and mean wind speed turbulent winds are used in all load cases the turbsim jonkman 2009 is used to generate the three dimensional turbulent wind field according to the kaimal turbulence model the irregular waves are long crested and are modeled by using the jonswap spectrum for each load case the simulation lasts for 1 h after removing the start up transients the statistical values and power spectra of the dynamic motion response are obtained based on the 1 h simulation results 7 results and discussion the results from the time domain simulations are discussed in this section the characteristics of the vessel motion 6 dofs the crane tip movement 3 dofs the blade motion at its cog and the corresponding translational motion at the blade root 3 dofs are investigated the blade root is considered as a point on the blade which is modeled as a rigid body therefore the translational motion of the blade root are obtained from the 6 dof rigid body motion of the blade tensions in the boom wires lift wire slings and tugger lines are not discussed here due to their marginal fluctuations 7 1 motion of the vessel the vessel motion is defined in the vessel related coordinate system in fig 9 fig 12 a show the standard deviations of the vessel translational motion in lc1 lc13 while those in fig 12 b present those of the vessel rotational motion the vessel motion is zero in lc1 as it is fixed during the numerical simulation the vessel heave motion is negligible comparisons between lc2 and lc3 lc13 reveal that the wave induced motion of the vessel dominates over the wind induced response the wind loads are further shown to have minor influence on the vessel motion compared to the wave load by comparing lc5 and lc6 and lc6 lc12 and lc13 the vessel motion is sensitive to the incident wave direction as shown by comparing the results in lc3 lc6 and lc7 it is also dependent on the wave height which can be observed in the results for lc6 lc8 and lc9 the vessel motion is marginally affected by the cancellation and enhancement effects in wave loads as shown by the results in lc10 and lc11 the amplitudes of vessel motion show a increasing trend with decreasing wave peak period the vessel motion spectra are analyzed fig 13 shows the spectra of vessel motion in surge sway and yaw the spectra of vessel pitch and roll motion are similar to those of surge and sway motion respectively the power spectrum of vessel surge motion is dominated by the surge resonant response the vessel sway motion is dominated by the vessel sway resonant response in lc3 θ w v 0 o while notable contributions from the crane resonance response are observed in lc6 and lc11 θ w v 65 87 o the vessel yaw motion is mainly dominated by the vessel yaw resonant response 7 2 motion at the crane tip the crane tip motion is important for crane operations at a large lifting height the characteristics of the crane tip motion are discussed in this section the standard deviations of crane tip motion in the vessel related coordinate system are presented in fig 14 both the vessel motion and the crane deformation contribute to the crane tip motion the crane deformation includes the deformation of the boom wires and the crane boom while the deformation of the latter is much marginal compared to that of the former the crane is deployed in the vertical o v y v z v plane during the operation as shown in fig 9 as a result the crane tip motion along x v and z v gets significant contributions from the crane resonant response due to crane deformation as can be observed in their power spectra shown in fig 15 the crane tip motion along x v has minor contributions of crane resonant response and is mainly resulted from the vessel motion the crane tip motion is marginally affected by the variation of wind conditions as shown by comparing it s standard deviations in lc5 lc6 lc12 and lc13 in fig 14 similar to the vessel motion the crane tip motion is sensitive to the wave excitation the comparisons among the results in lc6 lc10 and lc11 and lc6 lc8 and lc9 show that the crane tip motion decreases significantly with reduction in the significant wave height and wave peak period 7 3 motion of the installed blade the 6 dof rigid body motions of the blade with the reference point at its cog are studied in this section the motions are defined in the blade related coordinate system in fig 11 the first 3 dof motions refer to the translational motions at the cog while the rest 3 dof motions refer to the rotational motions around the cog their standard deviations in lc1 13 are shown in fig 16 it can be observed that the blade roll motion is much larger than the blade yaw motion in fig 16 b since the latter is well controlled by the tugger lines deployed perpendicular to the blade span while the former experiences limited restoring force from the tugger lines comparisons among lc1 3 show that the blade surge heave and pitch motions experience significant contributions from the vessel motion and crane movement they show large dependency on the wave condition lc3 lc6 lc11 and are marginally affected by the wind properties lc5 lc6 lc12 and lc13 they are dominated by a combination of the crane resonant response and the vessel sway resonant motion as shown by the power spectra of blade surge motion in fig 17 the dominance of these two contributions is dependent on the wave direction the blade motion in sway roll and yaw is mainly induced by blade aerodynamic load the power spectra of blade sway and yaw motions are presented in fig 18 the blade sway motion is completely dominated by the blade roll resonant response in lc1 consideration the vessel and crane motion introduces another two peaks into its power spectrum due to the double pendulum induced response and the vessel surge resonant motion as shown in fig 18 a these two peaks are negligible in the spectrum of blade yaw motion in fig 18 b the blade yaw motion is dominated by the blade roll and yaw resonant responses consideration the vessel and crane motion increases the contribution from the blade yaw resonant motion the effects of the vessel and crane motion on blade motion in sway roll and yaw are significant in short waves 7 4 motion at the blade root the blade root motion is critical during the final mating phase of blade installation the mating process is not possible if the blade root motion is too large the characteristics of the translational motion at blade root in the blade related coordinate system in fig 11 are studied in this section fig 19 shows the standard deviations of the blade root motion comparing results in lc1 lc3 indicates that the blade root motion would be significantly underestimated especially along x b if the detailed modeling of vessel and crane motion is not considered larger underestimation is expected to occur in shorter waves as indicated by comparing the power spectra of blade root motion in lc1 lc6 and lc11 in fig 20 the displacements of blade root in the global coordinate system are further compared with those of the vessel origin the crane tip and the blade cog as shown in table 10 the blade root motion along y is mainly resulted from that of the blade cog the blade root motion along z is much larger than that of the blade cog due to the notable contribution from blade roll motion in lc3 11 the blade root motion along x is close to that of blade cog because the contribution from blade yaw motion becomes relatively less important the displacements of the blade root and blade cog are much larger than those of the crane tip and the vessel origin detailed system modeling including the blade the vessel and the crane is recommended for numerical analysis of offshore wind turbine blade installation 8 conclusions this study deals with the development evaluation and application of a fully integrated simulation tool namely simo riflex aero for modeling and dynamic response analysis of single blade installation for offshore wind turbines using a jack up crane vessel the developed simulation tool can account for aerodynamics hydrodynamics soil and structural dynamics and wire coupling mechanics a coupled simo riflex model for a typical elevated jack up crane vessel is first developed considering wave loads on the vessel legs wind loads on the vessel structural flexibility of the legs and the crane soil structure interaction as well as important non linear effects such as p δ effect and leg inclination eigen value analysis is conducted to analyze the eigen periods and mode shapes of the vessel motion the natural periods of the vessel motion are found to be in the order of 0 4 3s which are lower than typical wave periods however the vessel motion resonances in the longitudinal transverse and torsional degrees can still be excited especially in short waves the first two longest periods are compared with values estimated by empirical formula recommended by standards and guidelines the developed simo riflex model is then coupled with the simo aero code zhao et al 2018 to achieve the integrated simulation tool simo riflex aero the fully coupled simo riflex aero code is then applied to simulate the dynamic response of the dtu 10 mw wind turbine blade being installed by a jack up crane vessel under different stochastic wave and wind conditions in time domain the vessel motion is mainly induced by wave loads on the jack up legs a decrease in wave period and an increase in wave height can cause significant increase in the vessel motion the vessel motion is dominated by the vessel s surge sway and yaw resonant response with contribution from the crane s resonant response significant crane tip motion is induced by the vessel motion together with the crane flexibility the crane tip motion in sway and heave is dominated by the crane resonant response the motion of the installed blade are significantly affected by the crane motion caused by the vessel motion due to wave load on the legs crane tip motion contributes to much larger blade motion in surge heave and pitch increases in the blade sway roll and yaw motion are also caused by the crane tip motion in short waves while in long waves they are not as a result the blade root motion is significantly increased both along and normal to the hub axis the blade root velocity is expected to experience larger increase in short waves which can lead to high potential of damaged guide pins during the final connection phase it is essential to plan offshore operations by using an integrated numerical model and analysis it is revealed in this study by taking the offshore wind turbine blade installation using a jack up crane vessel as an example in addition to the direct modeling of the blade motion under wind loads modeling of the jack up vessel and the crane is also of great importance for a more safe and efficient installation operation the vessel motion can cause significant motion at the crane tip during lifting operations at large heights the crane tip motion due to the vessel motion and crane flexibility can also greatly increase the motion of the lifted components and hence affects the safety and efficiency of the operation the methodology developed in this study can also be applied to deal with other types of offshore lifting operations using jack up crane vessels acknowledgment the authors appreciate the support from the department of

redesigning and constructing artificial ports or harbors in the coastal regions with variable bathymetries keywords mild slope equation mse hybrid finite element method hfem amplification factor numerical convergence pohang new harbor 1 introduction harbor resonance is a major problem around the coastal zones caused by topographical variations wave wave interactions and interaction of waves with man made structures geometry of the harbor play significant role to generate local resonance the excitation of harbor resonance due to wave propagation towards the coastal region may cause several difficulties such as loading and unloading of cargo process damaging of coastal boundaries and breaking of mooring ropes etc kumar et al 2016 it is difficult to restrict these incoming waves propagating towards the coastal regions therefore the mathematical model can be constructed based on diffraction refraction and partial reflection of incident wave to analyze the resonance phenomenon in the coastal regions such as harbor bays canals etc to analyze this problem several linear and non linear numerical model have been employed based on finite difference method fdm panchang et al 1991 madsen and larsen 1987 nabavi et al 2007 boundary element method bem kumar et al 2015 2013 kumar and gulshan 2018 cerrato et al 2016 2017 finite element method fem houston 1981 mei and chen 1976 mercadé ruiz et al 2017 etc linear model are essentially based on helmholtz equation kumar et al 2014 and mse whereas non linear model are based on boussinesq type equation gao et al 2017a thus estimation of wave impact around the coastal areas is significantly important in designing of harbors or modification in the existing ones in the past few decades both experimental and theoretical studies on rectangular and circular shaped harbors were conducted on the problem of harbor resonance ippen and goda 1963 hwang and tuck 1970 lee 1971 in addition analytical studies has been performed on this problem by several investigators based on constant as well as varying water depth to analyze the wave oscillation in simple shaped harbors such as rectangular circular ippen and goda 1963 hwang and tuck 1970 lee 1971 wang et al 2015 2014 the fdm is suitable for the problems with regular or simple geometries because it is quite easier to construct a mesh grid in the domain and code the problem panchang et al 1991 for complex geometries two dimensional 2d bem is utilized to solve helmholtz equation for constant water depth problem kumar et al 2015 2013 ippen and goda 1963 hwang and tuck 1970 lee 1971 kumar and gulshan 2017 whereas for varying bathymetries the fem can be employed to solve the shallow water wave problem tsay and liu 1989 demirbilek and panchang 1998 jung et al 2016 bellotti et al 2012 introduced a technique which uses finite element method for shallow water waves for calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of partially enclosed basins such as harbors and bays by applying a radiation condition at the interface boundary instead of zero surface elevation condition a galerkin fem was introduced by jung et al 2016 which can be applied to regions where water depth approaches zero like coastal regions recently several investigations have been done based on boussinesq model to simulate the harbor resonance problem dong et al 2013 gao et al 2018 gao et al 2016 2017b presented the non linear boussinesq model for predicting the behavior of infragravity wave oscillations generated by group of incoming short wave in shallow water the excitation of transverse oscillations within a harbor with small bottom slope was examined by wang et al 2013 and observed that these waves produces maximum amplitude at the backwall of the harbor and decreases in the offshore direction the propagation of water waves reproduced by mse based on shallow water waves was first introduced by eckart 1952 in early 1950s after that berkhoff 1972 1974 independently reformulated it for varying bathemetry and studied the combined effect of reflection refraction and diffraction basically mse is developed for linear and non linear waves which are propagating over sea beds with mild slope further many modification of the mse have been introduced by various investigators for subsequent works kirby et al 1992 kirby 1986 massel 1993 beji and nadaoka 1957 such as an extended version of the time dependent mse was presented for both linear and non linear waves which includes the effects of rapidly varying depth tong et al 2010 random modified mse without using forcing terms was presented by suh et al 2001 and zhang and edge 1998 an improved or modified mse using variational principle technique derived by chamberlain and porter 1995 describe the scattering properties of single and double ripple beds by including the higher order term that was not considered in berkhoff mse it was reported that high order fem for wave propagation problem shows accurate simulations for practical wave propagation analysis ham and bathe 2012 schmicker et al 2014 a model harbd based on fem has been used by the army corps of engineers in various projects for harbor development to study infragravity waves in barbers point harbor chen and houston 1987 another approach hfem was initially used by berkhoff 1974 and hybrid formulation based on shallow water wave equation to analyze the harbor resonance problem was developed by mei and chen 1976 hybrid functional proposed by behrendt and jonsson 1984 was also utilized the hybrid element concept was followed to study wave scattering by offshore structures or islands houston 1981 tsay and liu 1989 demirbilek and panchang 1998 mixed and hybrid finite element method including convergence result and error estimates for second order elliptical problem was reported by roberts and thomas 1987 in this paper a novel hybrid numerical scheme is utilized based on the combination of analytical approximation fourier bessel expansion and finite element approximation with variable bathemetry to compute the wave amplification for the harbor with irregular geometries in this formulation the fourier bessel expansion is used to solve the helmholtz equation in unbounded region with constant depth and the hybrid finite element formulation is utilized in the bounded region with variable water depth to enhance the numerical accuracy hybrid mesh discretization is employed to provide the better convergence as compared to regular mess elements the numerical scheme is also validated with previous well defined studies conducted by ippen and goda 1963 lee 1971 wang et al 2015 2011 for the rectangular shaped harbor the present numerical scheme is implemented on t shaped and tt shaped harbor geometry with the consideration of partially reflecting boundaries to determine the wave characteristics in the domain of definition the resonance modes of t shaped and tt shaped harbor are obtained and the wave field corresponding to these resonance modes is also analyzed additionally present scheme is implemented on realistic pohang new harbor pnh kumar et al 2014 and for this six locations based on the port stations are identified in pnh to analyze the wave amplification the resonance mode at each recorder stations is also discussed further the wave amplitude at different resonance mode inside pnh is also estimated to determine the safe location overall the current numerical scheme provides an efficient tool to understand the resonance phenomenon in a highly irregular shaped harbor with

for each of these wave number laboratory experimental data were collected at the center of the back wall of the harbor by ippen and goda 1963 and lee 1971 the laboratory experiments showed that the resonant mode occurs at 1 32 the present result indicate that the amplification factor is around 6 which occur at k l 1 32 on the other hand ippen and goda s results showed that the amplification is almost 6 at k l 1 32 the amplification factor is almost 1 for k l 2 and remaining cases show that the amplification is lying between 1 and 3 in fig 4a the amplification factor is compared with the experimental studies conducted by lee 1971 and ippen and goda 1963 further it is also compared with analytical appproximation using fourier transformation in fig 4b the present numerical scheme is employed to obtain the amplification curve for rectangular harbor of dimensions 1200 m length 200 m width 10 m depth at the back wall and variable depth which is same as taken by wang et al 2015 for γ

into 3263 hybrid elements and 1832 nodes which is shown in the right panel of fig 5 in fig 6 amplification factor is obtained for the t shaped harbor at the marked point w corresponding to non dimensional wave number and the results revealed that there are two resonance peaks corresponding to wave numbers k 1 1 4 and k 2 4 with amplification 1 7 and 0 7 respectively it is observed that the amplification factor for t shaped domain is lesser as compared to the rectangular model after that a rectangular block is assembled at the bottom of t shape geometry to obtain tt shaped harbor the domain has similar entrance width 0 006 m and depth 0 25 m the characteristic length from origin is 0 62 m again amplification is determined at the marked point w and the obtained results are compared

observed that the resonance peaks obtain in tt shaped harbor has less amplification as compared to t shaped and rectangular harbor see fig 8 thus the geometry of tt shaped harbor can be utilized to build an artificial harbor overall the geometry of domain play an important role to determine the wave application in a harbor in fig 8 the wave field is shown for the first two resonance frequencies for t shaped and tt shaped harbor under the resonance conditions the resonance peaks are obtained at the non dimensional wave number k 1 1 4 k 2 4 for t shaped harbor and k 1 1 7 k 2 3 8 for tt shaped harbor respectively the wave field contour plot for first k 1 1 4 and second resonance mode k 2 4 of t shaped harbor is given in the upper panel of fig 9 in the lower panel of fig 9 the wave field contours for tt shaped harbor is given it is observed that wave field is reduced in tt shaped harbor with respect to t shaped harbor at the back of wall corresponding to each of resonance mode the simulation results of t shaped and tt shaped harbor implies that harbor resonance is influenced significantly by the geometry of a domain 5 implementation on pohang new harbor 5 1 bathymetry data for pnh pohang new harbor pnh a real harbor with complex geometry is situated on the southeast part of south korea in pohang city pnh is experienced extreme wave oscillation around 3 5 m in height during the seasonal weather conditions the real bathymetry data for pnh alongwith the depth contour plot is diaplayed in fig 10 the depth near the entrance is 18 m approximately the variation of depth inside the pnh ranges from 10 m to 19 m 5 2 simulation result the topography of pnh with hybrid element discretization is shown in fig 11 including semi circular pseudo boundary the pnh region is discretized into 2900 hybrid mesh elements and 1604 number of nodes on the pseudo boundary the discretization of hybrid elements mesh is considered refined because it provide the refined information of incident waves propagated through entrance of pnh thus the non uniform hybrid element mesh is utilized to enhance the accuracy of the numerical schemes the six recorder stations from ws 01 to ws 06 are at the key moored ship location in the pnh to analyze the wave amplification see fig 11 the amplification factor is defined as the ratio of potential function of the response wave to the incident wave it is computed at the recorder stations from ws 01 to ws 06 for the monochromatic incident wave as shown in fig 12 the amplification curve for pnh is shown in fig 12 amplification factor is obtained to examine the resonance peaks for the monochromatic incident wave propagating at normal to the entrance the wave amplification for each recorder station varies with respect to different resonance modes or frequencies the resonance frequencies with high amplitude will induced strong resonance in the pnh and vice versa the strong amplification is observed at recorder station ws 01 ws 04 and ws 05 as compare to other record stations therefore the incident waves with difference resonance mode induced high wave oscillation at recorder station ws 01 ws 04 and ws 05 at recorder station ws 03 the wave amplification is less as compare to other recorder stations hence the safest location in the pnh for the moored ship motion is at recorder station ws 03 under the resonance conditions wave amplification for the incident wave with resonance frequency k 1 1 74 k 2 2 8 k 3 3 32 k 4 3 66 and k 5 4 4 are estimated in the pnh domain wave height contour for first five resonance modes is shown in fig 13 for the pnh for first resonance mode k 1 1 74 the strong wave oscillation is obtained near the recorder station ws 01 and ws 02 in second resonance mode k 2 2 8 the wave amplification is induced at recorder station ws 03 wave height contour for third resonance mode k 3 3 32 amplify at recorder station ws 01 ws 03 and ws 06 similarly fourth and fifth resonance mode k 4 3 66 and k 5 4 4 has significant wave oscillation at sharp corners in the pnh overall incident waves with different resonant frequencies have induced the wave oscillation in the pnh therefore safe location for the moored ship can be identified based on the simulation result obtain in pnh 6 conclusions in this study an efficient and computationally reliable hybrid element model is developed which can be applied to any irregular geometrical shaped harbor to analyze the wave characteristic pattern under the resonance conditions the hybrid mesh discretization and regular discretization are considered for comparison of better convergence the hybrid mesh gives the optimum accuracy for the numerical scheme the numerical approach is validated through the comparison of wave amplification factor for rectangular domain using hfem and existing studies with experimental results the numerical convergence is also verified through error analysis by utilizing least square method further based on the validation the wave amplification is also estimated for t shaped and tt shaped harbor under the resonance conditions it is concluded based on the simulation results for t shaped and tt shaped harbor that wave oscillation is subsidized in tt shaped harbor the current numerical scheme is very useful to construct the artificial harbor under the resonance conditions the present numerical scheme based on hfem and mse with the consideration of variable bathemetry is implemented on a realistic pohang new harbor south korea under the resonance conditions further the partially reflecting boundary is also considered with non uniform hybrid mesh to improve the accuracy of the numerical model the amplification factor is estimated for six recorder station key port location in the pnh the first five resonance modes or frequencies are taken to analyze the wave field in the pnh wave filed contours represent the wave amplitude of an incident wave with different frequencies due to diffraction refraction and partial reflection of interior boundary wall of pnh the study of wave oscillations pattern is very crucial for the coastal engineers or the harbor design planners before any modification and construction the slight modification in the harbor layout can induce and subsidize the wave oscillations generated inside the harbor acknowledgment this work is supported by

numerical convergence pohang new harbor 1 introduction harbor resonance is a major problem around the coastal zones caused by topographical variations wave wave interactions and interaction of waves with man made structures geometry of the harbor play significant role to generate local resonance the excitation of harbor resonance due to wave propagation towards the coastal region may cause several difficulties such as loading and unloading of cargo process damaging of coastal boundaries and breaking of mooring ropes etc kumar et al 2016 it is difficult to restrict these incoming waves propagating towards the coastal regions therefore the mathematical model can be constructed based on diffraction refraction and partial reflection of incident wave to analyze the resonance phenomenon in the coastal regions such as harbor bays canals etc to analyze this problem several linear and non linear numerical model have been employed based on finite difference method fdm panchang et al 1991 madsen and larsen 1987 nabavi et al 2007 boundary element method bem kumar et al 2015 2013 kumar and gulshan 2018 cerrato et al 2016 2017 finite element method fem houston 1981 mei and chen 1976 mercadé ruiz et al 2017 etc linear model are essentially based on helmholtz equation kumar et al 2014 and mse whereas non linear model are based on boussinesq type equation gao et al 2017a thus estimation of wave impact around the coastal areas is significantly important in designing of harbors or modification in the existing ones in the past few decades both experimental and theoretical studies on rectangular and circular shaped harbors were conducted on the problem of harbor resonance ippen and goda 1963 hwang and tuck 1970 lee 1971 in addition analytical studies has been performed on this problem by several investigators based on constant as well as varying water depth to analyze the wave oscillation in simple shaped harbors such as rectangular circular ippen and goda 1963 hwang and tuck 1970 lee 1971 wang et al 2015 2014 the fdm is suitable for the problems with regular or simple geometries because it is quite easier to construct a mesh grid in the domain and code the problem panchang et al 1991 for complex geometries two dimensional 2d bem is utilized to solve helmholtz equation for constant water depth problem kumar et al 2015 2013 ippen and goda 1963 hwang and tuck 1970 lee 1971 kumar and gulshan 2017 whereas for varying bathymetries the fem can be employed to solve the shallow water wave problem tsay and liu 1989 demirbilek and panchang 1998 jung et al 2016 bellotti et al 2012 introduced a technique which uses finite element method for shallow water waves for calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of partially enclosed basins such as harbors and bays by applying a radiation condition at the interface boundary instead of zero surface elevation condition a galerkin fem was introduced by jung et al 2016 which can be applied to regions where water depth approaches zero like coastal regions recently several investigations have been done based on boussinesq model to simulate the harbor resonance problem dong et al 2013 gao et al 2018 gao et al 2016 2017b presented the non linear boussinesq model for predicting the behavior of infragravity wave oscillations generated by group of incoming short wave in shallow water the excitation of transverse oscillations within a harbor with small bottom slope was examined by wang et al 2013 and observed that these waves produces maximum amplitude at the backwall of the harbor and decreases in the offshore direction the propagation of water waves reproduced by mse based on shallow water waves was first introduced by eckart 1952 in early 1950s after that berkhoff 1972 1974 independently reformulated it for varying bathemetry and studied the combined effect of reflection refraction and diffraction basically mse is developed for linear and non linear waves which are propagating over sea beds with mild slope further many modification of the mse have been introduced by various investigators for subsequent works kirby et al 1992 kirby 1986 massel 1993 beji and nadaoka 1957 such as an extended version of the time dependent mse was presented for both linear and non linear waves which includes the effects of rapidly varying depth tong et al 2010 random modified mse without using forcing terms was presented by suh et al 2001 and zhang and edge 1998 an improved or modified mse using variational principle technique derived by chamberlain and porter 1995 describe the scattering properties of single and double ripple beds by including the higher order term that was not considered in berkhoff mse it was reported that high order fem for wave propagation problem shows accurate simulations for practical wave propagation analysis ham and bathe 2012 schmicker et al 2014 a model harbd based on fem has been used by the army corps of engineers in various projects for harbor

equation to analyze the harbor resonance problem was developed by mei and chen 1976 hybrid functional proposed by behrendt and jonsson 1984 was also utilized the hybrid element concept was followed to study wave scattering by offshore structures or islands houston 1981 tsay and liu 1989 demirbilek and panchang 1998 mixed and hybrid finite element method including convergence result and error estimates for second order elliptical problem was reported by roberts and thomas 1987 in this paper a novel hybrid numerical scheme is utilized based on the combination of analytical approximation fourier bessel expansion and finite element approximation with variable bathemetry to compute the wave amplification for the harbor with irregular geometries in this formulation the fourier bessel expansion is used to solve the helmholtz equation in unbounded region with constant depth and the hybrid finite element formulation is utilized in the bounded region with variable water depth to enhance the numerical accuracy hybrid mesh discretization is employed to provide the better convergence as compared to regular mess elements the numerical scheme is also validated with previous well defined studies conducted by ippen and goda 1963 lee 1971 wang et al 2015 2011 for the rectangular shaped harbor the present numerical scheme is implemented on t shaped and tt shaped harbor geometry with the consideration of partially reflecting boundaries to determine the wave characteristics in the domain of definition the resonance modes of t shaped and tt shaped harbor are obtained and the

examine the resonance peaks for the monochromatic incident wave propagating at normal to the entrance the wave amplification for each recorder station varies with respect to different resonance modes or frequencies the resonance frequencies with high amplitude will induced strong resonance in the pnh and vice versa the strong amplification is observed at recorder station ws 01 ws 04 and ws 05 as compare to other record stations therefore the incident waves with difference resonance mode induced high wave oscillation at recorder station ws 01 ws 04 and ws 05 at recorder station ws 03 the wave amplification is less as compare to other recorder stations hence the safest location in the pnh for the moored ship motion is at recorder station ws 03 under the resonance conditions wave

has significant wave oscillation at sharp corners in the pnh overall incident waves with different resonant frequencies have induced the wave oscillation in the pnh therefore safe location for the moored ship can be identified based on the simulation result obtain in pnh 6 conclusions in this study an efficient and computationally reliable hybrid element model is developed which can be applied to any irregular geometrical shaped harbor to analyze the wave characteristic pattern under the resonance conditions the hybrid mesh discretization and regular discretization are considered for comparison of better convergence the hybrid mesh gives the optimum accuracy for the numerical scheme the numerical approach is validated through the comparison of wave amplification factor for rectangular domain using hfem and existing studies with experimental results the numerical convergence is also verified through error analysis by utilizing least square method further based on the validation the wave amplification is also estimated for t shaped and tt shaped harbor under the resonance conditions it is concluded based on the simulation results for t shaped and tt shaped harbor that wave oscillation is subsidized in tt shaped harbor the current numerical scheme is very useful to construct the artificial harbor under the resonance conditions the present numerical scheme based on hfem and mse with the consideration of variable bathemetry is implemented on a realistic pohang new harbor south korea under the resonance conditions further the partially reflecting boundary is also considered with non uniform hybrid mesh to improve the accuracy of the numerical model the amplification factor is estimated for six recorder station key port location in the pnh the first five resonance modes or frequencies are taken to analyze the wave field in the pnh wave filed contours represent the wave amplitude of an incident wave with different frequencies due to diffraction refraction and partial reflection of interior boundary wall of pnh the study of wave oscillations pattern is very crucial for the coastal engineers or the harbor design planners before any modification and construction the slight modification in the harbor layout can induce and subsidize the wave oscillations generated inside the harbor acknowledgment this work is supported by

23157,empirical relationships of compressive ice strength as a function of stress rate have been utilized in models of vibrations that arise during coupled ice structure interactions central to current self excited models sem is a deterministic relationship of compressive ice strength as a function of stress rate based on uniaxial compressive strength data obtained from thin first year sea ice however full scale observations laboratory test data and fundamental knowledge of ice material behavior suggest that any such relationship would be influenced by factors such as temperature and the scale of the interaction in this paper the influence of temperature and scale effects is examined and first order estimates of their effect on modifying the assumed strength vs stress rate relationship are presented this approach is used to assess the sensitivity of the sem method to changes in environmental and interaction conditions results suggest that accounting for changes in ice temperature and the scale of interaction considerably affect ice induced vibration responses predicted by the model additional large scale experiments full scale data and the development of physics based models of ice compressive failure are needed to better account for different ice conditions and different sized structures that may be considered in design keywords ice induced vibrations ice mechanics self excited vibration dynamic ice structure interaction 1 introduction 1 1 background when designing structures for ice environments ice induced vibrations iiv especially steady state vibrations are an important engineering consideration the international standard for petroleum and natural gas industries arctic offshore structures iso 19906 2010 provides design guidelines for dynamic ice actions section a 8 2 6 of iso 19906 2010 and explicitly discusses the susceptibility of iiv through frequency lock in section a 8 2 14 of iso 19906 2010 frequency lock in refers to the condition when ice fails at a frequency close to the natural frequency of the structure primarily due to crushing and causes a dynamic amplification in structural response such behavior has been observed in the field especially when the natural frequency of the structure is within the range of 1 2 hz peyton 1968 jefferies and wright 1988 bjerkås et al 2013a the guideline provided in the iso code recommends identifying the lowest structural mode susceptible to iiv and checking the stability criterion through modal damping to calculate the modal amplitude at the ice action point the method referred in the iso code määttänen 1978 uses the compressive strength stress rate relationship proposed by blenkarn 1970 this relationship shown in fig 1 uses uniaxial compressive data collected by peyton on thin first year ice on cook inlet alaska peyton 1968 the data shows ice strength increases as a function of loading rate up to a certain point and then start decreasing as loading rate is increased further until reaching to a point after which it is almost constant such behavior has also been observed and reported by other authors schwarz 1970 wu et al 1976 michel and toussaint 1977 it has been postulated that the negative slope in that relationship serves as a source of negative damping and if this is greater than the structural damping then the structural response will grow over time blenkarn termed this as self excited vibration to explain iiv and a rigorous model was later proposed by määttänen although the peyton relationship was based on uniaxial compression test data this relationship has been treated as universal and has been applied to full scale lighthouse structures however fundamental material behavior of ice suggests that such relationship would be significantly influenced by ice properties and interaction conditions in this paper the variation in ice strength stress rate relationship subjected to a variation in ice temperature and interaction scale is inferred based on the fundamental ice material behavior the inference is then used to evaluate how such variation can propagate through the dynamic ice structure interaction and affect iiv response 1 2 literature review the first scientific interest in understanding the dynamic nature of ice structure interactions associated with iiv arose in the late 1960s when this phenomenon was first observed on fixed vertical pile offshore platforms in cook inlet alaska peyton 1968 blenkarn 1970 through the use of full scale measurements both authors concluded that a moving ice field can induce severe vibrations to slender offshore structures however the explanation offered by each author regarding the cause of these iivs differed significantly in these earliest analyses the ice failure processes was described as a stick slip type phenomenon that followed a sawtooth loading pattern comparing his observations to his laboratory test series peyton 1968 concluded that ice has a characteristic failure frequency the notion that these vibrations were of a self excited nature was first proposed by blenkarn 1970 who correctly identified that both the properties of the ice and the structure play an important role in governing the interaction dynamics blenkarn also highlighted the need to consider the natural vibration modes of the structure to assess its susceptibility to damped or steady state resonant vibrations a condition commonly referred to as lock in the physical ice conditions observed to be of most significance by blenkarn were ice speed and thickness less than a decade later similar problems were encountered with navigational aids and lighthouse structures built in the gulf of bothnia finland ultimately resulting in damage and in some instances failure of these structures engelbrektson 1977 määttänen 1978 research undertaken by määttänen further explored the self excited nature of ice structure interactions associated with iiv on full scale lighthouses määttänen 1977 1978 similarly channel markers in gulf of bothnia were also found to be prone to ice induced vibrations one of these markers was instrumented in winter 1987 1988 and severe stresses were recorded due to steady state vibrations or lock in phenomenon nordlund et al 1988 very few cycles were required for the structure to reach peak amplitude from rest which led the authors to believe that the excitation mechanism has a significant force component that is dependent on the displacement and or velocity of the structure due to the observed shift between high level and low level amplitude the excitation mechanism was thought to be comprised of a random force superimposed by an interaction force that is dependent on the structural displacement or velocity similar dynamic effects which ultimately led to cases of structural failure were later reported on jacket platforms in the bohai sea china xu and bernt 1981 two jacket platforms one of which was a small flare jacket were reported to collapse within a period of 10 years based on field measurements on a full scale six legged jacket platform in combination with numerical analysis it was concluded that an amplified resonant response can be expected under a certain combination of ice floe velocity spatial ice load distribution and damping properties of the structure to help mitigate these vibrations ice breaking cones were installed at the water level while this did reduce the extent of ice crushing a different cyclic failure process leading to vibrations was observed due to repeated flexural cusp failures also during high tidal currents the failure frequency of the thin ice could potentially reach of the natural frequencies of the structure yue and bi 2000 yue et al 2007 in canada observations of dynamic ice forces acting on bridge piers neill 1976 montgomery et al 1980 highlighted that in some structures the dynamic response of the pier may exceed the static response during a peak ice force event as offshore technology continued improve and evolve in the 1980s operations moved further north into increasingly challenging ice conditions during this time it was believed that iiv issues were most relevant for narrow structures and this issue was less of a concern for wide structures this belief was challenged during the winter of 1986 when thick multi year ice caused severe ice induced vibrations leading to partial liquefaction of the foundation of the 90 m wide molikpaq mobile arctic caisson structure which was operating in the beaufort sea jefferies and wright 1988 frederking and sudom 2006 cyclic behavior with a frequency of approximately 1 4 hz was recorded with peak vibration amplitudes up to 10 mm which lasted for four minutes timco and wright 2005 these iivs and associated foundation issues created significant concerns about the stability of the structure which ultimately resulted in an evacuation of the platform a comprehensive review of these early observations was provided by sodhi 1988 and these incidents along with uncertainties associated with full scale measurements from the molikpaq have been broadly discussed in the ice mechanics community taylor and jordaan 2011 jordaan et al 2011 to help address uncertainties around full scale loads for first year ice interactions with fixed structures the european union funded two major full scale ice force measurement projects in the northern gulf of bothnia in a span of five years the first of these was entitled low level ice forces loleif and the second was entitled structures in ice strice ice force was directly measured against norströmsgrund lighthouse using nine ice force measuring panels ice thickness and air temperature were also recorded while the full datasets and reports for the loleif and strice projects are not readily accessible brief descriptions of the test setup can be found in the literature schwarz and jochmann 2001 bjerkås et al 2013a results from the loleif project show that effective pressure decreases with nominal interaction area and also with increasing ice thickness schwarz and jochmann 2001 the strice data have been extensively analyzed by bjerkås to study the dynamics of ice structure interactions and associated ice induced vibrations bjerkås and skiple 2005 bjerkås et al 2013a 2013b from these analyses three different interaction modes namely intermittent crushing frequency lock in and continuous crushing were observed intermittent crushing was observed in speeds between 0 02 m s to 0 08 m s and was associated primarily with circumferential cracking events or simultaneous high crushing loads on several panels while rare frequency lock in was observed to occur occasionally and during one reported event steady state vibration persisted for about 190 cycles bjerkås et al 2013a associated with this particular event was the observation that it was preceded by a circumferential crack that produced a smooth contact surface which helped to synchronize contact during the ice crushing process according to the authors during the first phase of this event as the force built up the structure exhibited lateral displacement and then sprang back when the load dropped following ice failure creating contact conditions that allowed the next phase of synchronized load build up during this event there were several intervals each having 8 10 cycles in which the local load progressively increased during each cycle due to synchronization of the ice failure with the structural response ultimately displacing the structure up to 24 30 mm bjerkås et al 2013a since this displacement was associated with dynamic amplification system damping was an important factor in influencing this response after many failure cycles the mass of accumulated broken ice caused a local collapse in a sector of the ice triggering flooding of the ice cover causing it to bend and fail for speeds greater than 0 1 m s continuous crushing was observed which generally produced loads that were significantly lower than either intermittent or lock in modes it should be noted here that the critical speed above which continuous crushing occurred was found to vary with ice thickness and temperature to help further understand this issue many laboratory research programs using small scale compliant structures have been carried out määttänen 1981 määttänen 1983 toyama et al 1983 jordaan and timco 1988 sodhi 1989 kärnä and muhonen 1990 finn et al 1993 kärnä et al 2003 huang et al 2007 määttänen 2008 määttänen et al 2011 browne et al 2013 taylor et al 2013 o rourke et al 2016a o rourke et al 2016b from these studies it is observed that in general for speeds up to some lower limit velocity the ice loads exhibit a sawtooth pattern with a failure frequency that is proportional to the ice speed once the ice speed exceeds this lower limit the iiv frequency tends to lock in to a natural frequency of the system typically less than the natural frequency of the structure and the loading pattern exhibits a more sinusoidal character as the ice speed is further increased beyond a certain upper limit velocity the ice failure behavior transitions to a random brittle mode with reduced amplitude emerging from this collective body of work is a general consensus regarding classification of modes of dynamic ice structure interaction as a function of loading rate into the four types put forward by kärnä and trunen 1990 described below and depicted in fig 2 a creep or damage enhanced creep at a very slow loading rate where ice fails in ductile manner the structure experiences very high global load however no structural vibration occurs b sawtooth or intermittent ice crushing at a faster loading rate where the loading pattern can be periodic in nature comprising of a loading and unloading phase the structure and ice moves quasi statically in the loading phase followed by an unloading event primarily due to spalling the sudden load drop results in a transient vibration with a relatively high acceleration the associated acceleration may be important in designing non structural components and devices supported by the main structure depending on the damping of the structure the transient vibration eventually dies out before entering in the next loading phase c frequency lock in or steady state vibration at higher loading rate where the response of the structure may become more sinusoidal in nature the frequency of the ice force gets locked into the natural frequency of the structure even though ice speed changes slightly if the ice speed remains within the range the steady state vibration can sustain for a long period having nearly constant amplitude yue et al 2009 evidence of such vibrations in full scale have been reported by bjerkås et al 2013a nordlund et al 1988 and others d random or continuous ice crushing which occurs at very high interaction speed the failure is brittle and random in nature causing a lower global load and structural displacement 1 3 iiv modelling approaches the most commonly employed engineering approaches to modelling ice induced vibration can be broadly classified into two major categories the first group considered the ice to have a characteristic crushing failure frequency or crushing length matlock et al 1969 was the first to introduce an ice structure interaction model based on this idea and such approaches have been used to explain full scale ice induced vibration occurrences gagnon 2012 in his classical model matlock assumed ice to be an ideal elastic brittle material and the model was represented by a carriage transporting a series of uniformly spaced elastic brittle teeth when a tooth is in contact with the structure the force is assumed to be linearly dependent on the deformation of the tooth sodhi 1994 later modified the model using results from a number of test series sodhi and nakazawa 1988 sodhi 1989 1992 sodhi and chin 1992 in his model one force cycle is divided into three phases loading extrusion and separation each having its own mathematical formulation and was able to replicate the essential features of intermittent crushing huang and liu 2009 also extended the matlock model by including the discrete failure behavior dependence of ice strength on ice velocity and randomness of failure the other commonly employed approach considers ice induced vibration to be self excited in nature blenkarn 1970 was the first to introduce this idea which was later incorporated into a coupled dynamic ice structure interaction model by määttänen 1978 the määttänen self excited model sem utilizes the crushing strength vs stress rate curve first proposed by blenkarn shown in fig 1 based on peyton s measurements blenkarn proposed that the crushing strength vs stress rate curve has a negative slope beyond a certain loading rate sustained ice induced vibrations are explained in the context of this negative damping effect the effect of relative velocity in dynamic ice structure interactions has been considered by other researchers as well based on their test results tsuchiya et al 1985 proposed that maximum resistance of ice should be recalculated in each time step taking into account the effect of relative velocity daoud and lee 1986 considered the ice force function to follow a predefined sawtooth function and defined the velocity dependence with a heaviside step function having the value 1 for positive relative velocity and 0 otherwise kry 1978 proposed the idea of independent zones of crushing in front of a wide structure and considered that effective stresses for each zone are developed independently of the adjacent zones daley 1991 developed an ice failure model based on a progressive sequence of through body shear cracks triggered once a critical stress limit is reached resulting in a sudden drop in force due to flaking events eranti 1992 used this zonal ice force concept to develop his ice structure interaction model the indentor is assumed to penetrate into each zone until a critical ice pressure is reached which is both loading rate dependent and has a certain degree of randomness the ice zone fails a finite distance ahead and the indentor is able to move within this zone with only minor resistance of the failed ice kärnä extended the idea of zonal force to simulate response of full three dimensional structures using the finite element method kärnä 1992 kärnä et al 1999 the model also includes the soil structure interaction to account for the foundation behavior ice action is considered in two phases elastic far field and non linear near field which are further divide into zones where the interactive forces as well as the relative displacement between the ice and structure are defined at specific contact points the far field response is described using rigid body motion of ice mass and elastic displacement of ice edge failure in the near field area is assumed to be horizontal splits where each layer fails independently due to the compressive force applied on it failure force is a function of characteristic ice failure pressure which is sampled from a log normal distribution using a base value and nominal contact area also it is assumed that crushing pressure decreases by a factor of 2 when the relative velocity exceeds a certain range withalm and hoffmann 2010 used the zonal ice force concept to extend the matlock model for full scale round structures ice induced vibration has also been linked to contact area variation hendrikse and metrikine 2015 and the reduced velocity concept used in vortex induced vibration palmer et al 2010 despite the above progress significant gaps remain in explaining iiv and developing engineering models that are linked to fundamental mechanics of ice failure in this paper the effects of temperature and scale on the strength vs loading rate curve shown in fig 1 are investigated to identifying how accounting for such effects influences design assessments of susceptibility of structures to ice induced vibration and assess if accounting for such factors increases agreement with full scale observations while it is clear that the assumption of the universality of this relationship is convenient for analysis purposes it is less clear if such a relationship holds for different ice conditions and scales since insufficient full scale data exists on which to validate such an assumption for this reason in the analysis presented herein inferences have been made regarding the anticipated effects of these factors on the strength vs stress rate relationship to explore its effect on steady state ice induced vibrations 2 model description 2 1 self excited model sem models identified in the current iso 19906 guidelines include negative damping of ice as a contributing factor in frequency lock in to identify the lock in frequency iso suggests identifying the natural modes which are sensitive to ice induced vibration the conditions for dynamic stability developed by määttänen 1978 and kärnä et al 1999 can be used in such cases for a natural mode n the dynamic stability can be achieved if the relative damping coefficient of the structure ζ n is larger than the opposite contribution of ice action mathematically dynamic stability will be achieved if the following equation is satisfied 1 ζ n nc 2 4 π f n m n h θ where ζ n is the damping ratio of the eigenmode n c is the non normalized modal amplitude at the ice action point m n is the true modal mass expressed in kilograms k g f n is the natural frequency of the eigenmode expressed in hertz h z h is the ice thickness expressed in meters m θ is a coefficient the suggested value of which is 40 10 6 kilograms per metre second k g m s once the lowest natural mode susceptible to frequency lock in is identified a sawtooth forcing function with a frequency equal to the natural frequency of the mode is generated in this approach the forcing function accounts for ice structure coupling by using the strength vs stress rate relationship to calculate the instantaneous ice force as a function of the relative velocity between the ice and the structure as is described further below in the present study the määttänen sem has been used since this model is based solely on the strength stress rate relationship whereas the kärnä model accounts for rate dependence by decreasing ice strength by a factor of 2 when the relative velocity between the ice and structure exceeds a transitional range 100 250 mm s kärnä et al 1999 in määttänen s sem the following assumptions have been made ice is always in a continuous crushing state hence the strength vs stress rate curve can be used except for cases where the structure s velocity is greater than ice velocity in such cases the interaction force goes to zero the crushing strength is averaged out over the interaction area the elastic deformation of ice and the viscoelastic behavior are ignored at the beginning of a loading cycle the deflection of the structure increases as the ice sheet advances leading to an increase in resistance from the structure as the structural resistance continues to build with increasing deflection the rate of deflection relative to the ice velocity begins to decrease leading to an increase in the loading rate this phase of the interaction cycle continues until the structure comes to rest for an instant at its peak deflection at which point the resistance from the structure has increased to the point that it exceeds the maximum ice strength causing the structural movement to change direction triggering the onset of rebounding as the structure begins to rebound it starts to move towards the ice sheet causing the loading rate to further increase which in turn cause the ice crushing strength to decrease as the structure accelerates during the rebounding process the loading rate further increases resulting in continued decreases in ice strength since the structural deflection decreases during rebounding the associated resistance force also decreases as rebounding continues further the structure eventually begins to decelerate and the loading rate begins to decrease since the structure is advancing more slowly towards the ice causing the ice strength to begin to increase again the structure continues to decelerate until it eventually comes to rest for an instant before the structural movement again reverses direction and begins deflecting at the onset of the next loading cycle the equation for dynamic ice structure interaction is as follows 2 m x c x k x f according to the self excitation vibration model ice force is only a function of relative velocity considering only one mode of vibration the equation can be simplified as 3 m x c x kx f v x where v is the ice drift velocity for small motion the forcing function can be expanded as 4 f v x f v x f v v so equation 2 becomes 5 m x c f v x kx f v if the term f v is negative and numerically greater than the structural damping coefficient c then there will be net negative damping in equation 5 which would lead to the growth of a structural response with time self excited vibration the roots of equation 5 are complex conjugate pairs and the appearance of the self excited vibration depends on the sign of the real part vibration will arise for positive real part and no vibration will arise if the sign is negative the stability condition is valid only for one ice velocity at a time however when assessing the potential onset of oscillations it is sufficient to check for stability at the ice velocity corresponding to the steepest negative slope in the non linear crushing strength vs loading rate curve for a root with a positive real part vibration amplitudes are supposed to increase exponentially however in practice such growth will tend to limit cycles this occurs even for constant ice velocities since the oscillation of the relative velocity will occur due to the deflection rebound cycle of the structure correspondingly as the relative velocity changes the instantaneous strength moves along the curve and once it returns to the positive slope region this will suppress further amplitude growth thus all self excited ice induced vibration will have a stable limit cycle which is also termed as stability as large e g the condition is satisfied for a root with a negative real part vibration amplitudes decay exponentially however if the roots of the equilibrium equations are not calculated at the point with steepest negative slope of the strength vs loading rate curve obtaining negative real parts still does not guarantee absolute stability a change in relative velocity in the deflection rebound cycle described above can result in vibration of the structure due to oscillation of the relative velocity which can very soon yield to such a velocity that the corresponding point in the strength vs stress rate curve no longer lies on the area of negative slope suppressing further amplitude growth the loading rate of the ice sheet is calculated with the equation originally deduced by blenkarn 1970 6 σ v 0 x i 4 σ c πa cos θ where v 0 is the ice drift velocity x i is the velocity of the structure at the point of action σ c is ice crushing stress and a is the radius of the structure the cosine term takes into account the circular form of the load distribution assumed in this model as shown in fig 3 the ice crushing strength can be obtained from the simplified version of the piecewise linear peyton curve shown in fig 4 for j t h time step as 7 σ c α j β j σ the linearized version of the curve requires the following parameters to define the strength stress rate relationship α intercept in the y axis equal to σ 0 when loading rate is zero β slope of the crushing strength stress rate curve σ 1 limit stress rate of ductile region was considered to be 0 2 mpa s in the original sem σ 2 limit stress rate of transition region was considered to be 0 8 mpa s in the original sem by solving the two sets of equations explicit expressions for stress rate σ and crushing strength σ c can be obtained as follows 8 σ α j πa 4 v 0 x i c o s θ β j 9 σ c πa α j πa 4 β j v 0 x i c o s θ the crushing strength of ice would be equal to the global pressure applied by ice on the structure at the waterline thus integrating the ice crushing strength along the waterline circumference of the structure will give the ice induced force f applied on the structure at the waterline given as 10 f 2 0 π 2 σ c a c o s θ hdθ 2 ah 0 π 2 πa α j c o s θ πa 4 β j v 0 x i c o s θ dθ where h is the ice thickness using the forcing function from equation 10 we can now solve the system equation mentioned in equation 3 numerically 2 2 modification of peyton curve parameters the simplified assumption of linear relationship enables identification of the stability criterion in a straight forward way as outlined above the roots should be calculated at the steepest point of the negatively sloped portion of the strength vs stress rate curve to ensure stability of the system this also applies for numerical integration as is employed here from fundamental understanding of ice material behavior michel and toussaint 1977 sanderson 1988 schulson and duval 2009 it is known that changing ice conditions such as temperature and scale will influence ice strength on this basis it is proposed here that changes in such conditions would be expected to affect the strength vs stress rate curves yielding a family of curves rather than a single universal curve to ensure stability of the system for the range of conditions expected in a given design scenario the roots should be obtained for conditions that yield the curve with highest negative slope to perform such an analysis it is first necessary to assess how changes in these conditions would influence the peyton curve parameters so that the effects of such variations on ice induced vibration response can be assessed in the present analysis only the effects of temperature and pressure scale on crushing strength have been considered other deterministic e g grain size ice density salinity etc and probabilistic factors randomness due to fracture could be considered as well but are beyond the scope of the present work 2 3 effect of temperature on peyton curve parameters while the effect of temperature on the peyton strength vs stress rate relationship have not been reported in the literature such effects have been studied from small scale experiments for both freshwater ice wu et al 1976 and saline ice schwarz 1970 in the present work only saline ice is considered and the work of schwarz 1970 provides useful insights here for the peyton uniaxial compressive strength dataset the average temperature for that season was reported to be 10 c blenkarn 1970 and this value is assumed to be representative of the mean ice temperature for the reference strength stress rate curve schwarz 1970 found that uniaxial compressive strength of sea ice is a function of ice temperature and that as the temperature increases the ice becomes weaker due to growth of brine pockets similar to the effect observed for flexural strength e g timco and weeks 2010 based on these results it is reasonable to infer that a similar trend would be expected for the peyton relationship as well to provide a first order estimate of this effect a temperature correction factor is calculated as the ratio of maximum strength at the temperature of interest to the maximum strength at 10 c from schwarz 1970 at three stress rates 10 2 0 2 0 8 these factors were applied to the peyton relationship to account for the effect of temperature 2 c 5 c 10 c 20 c as shown in fig 5 linear interpolation was used to obtain maximum strength at 5 c and 2 c from the data of schwarz 1970 the corresponding intercept and slope values for the modified peyton curves considering temperature effects are listed in table 1 below 2 4 effect of ice thickness and structure width on peyton curve parameters the pressure area data compiled by sanderson 1988 corresponds to a number of datasets covering a range of scales which clearly show a trend of decreasing average pressure with increasing interaction area given the importance of these scale effects for ice load estimation as is reflected in the design methodology in iso 19906 2010 the strength vs stress rate relationships used in sem should also account for such effects as shown in fig 6 below there is good general agreement between the data from sanderson schwarz 1970 and peyton 1968 as well as the value obtained using the global average pressure model from iso 19906 evaluated at the same area as in peyton s data as discussed in detail in taylor 2010 decreases in pressure due to increasing ice thickness tend to be associated more with probabilistic aspects of localized spalling fracture while width effects tend to be more associated with averaging of local ice pressures across the width of the structure since the mechanisms associated with pressure thickness scale effects and pressure width scale effect are different it is logical here to treat these effects separately the approach of treating scale effects for sea ice as a combination of a thickness and a width scaling effect has also been discussed by other authors e g løset et al 1999 iso 19906 2010 the global ice pressure model provided in iso 19906 2010 accounts for the effects of ice thickness and structure width on average global pressures the scaling relationships embodied in the iso 19906 model to account for the effect of width and thickness have been applied here to scale the peyton curves for the range of ice thickness and structure widths of interest as is shown in fig 7 as one would expect the magnitude of the peak and the slopes of the curve becomes less steep for increasing width as well as increasing ice thickness it is noted here that the values of width and thickness for the base case in this analysis e g peyton s uniaxial compression tests was not reported by peyton in his original paper however since sem considers the relationship to be universal these values can be inferred from values observed in peyton s field test measurements the structural pile used in cook inlet tests had a diameter of 4 3 m sanderson 1988 and an average thickness of ice for that season was 0 36 m blenkarn 1970 it should be mentioned here that while the scale of the interaction can influence the dominant ice failure mode as is discussed in section 2 1 application of the sem is assumed to correspond only to events where continuous crushing occurs during full scale interactions continuous crushing only occurs during a relatively small proportion of all interactions and other ice failure modes result in more random loading patterns that are not associated with observations of iiv jefferies and wright 1988 jefferies et al 2008 this allows for simplification of the methodology by limiting the analysis to scenarios where the ice fails in continuous crushing the intercept and slope values for modified peyton s curve considering the scale effect are listed in table 2 table 3 3 results and analysis to implement the model described in section 2 1 the sem analysis routine was programmed in matlab the structure chosen as a basis for the analysis was the norströmsgrund lighthouse since the structure has experienced a number of ice induced vibration events that have been reported in the literature also the structure has been analyzed previously using the sem nandan et al 2011 which allows for direct comparison of results to verify proper functioning of the analysis routines in their analysis nandan et al 2011 used a 15 node lumped mass model with translational and rotational degrees of freedom and the ice force was considered to be acting only on the waterline node however a single degree of freedom sdof representation of the model was found to be very efficient computationally without a loss of accuracy the sdof parameters for the structure were obtained from a joint industry project jip which was arranged to validate different ice induced vibration models kärnä et al 2013 thus making the parameters independent of the analysis the numerical integration was done by forward time integration scheme using the rk4 algorithm a summary of the structural parameters for the sdof models are given in table 4 the model was first validated using the same ice parameters thickness velocity used by nandan et al 2011 with the original strength stress rate relationship once the model was found to be in agreement for the original strength stress rate relationship individual analysis was performed using the modified peyton s curve discussed in sections 2 3 2 4 from these analyses the acceleration of the structure was used to characterize the ice induced vibration response in the foregoing a sinusoidal response with constant amplitude has been termed as steady state ice induced vibration ss iiv whereas a decaying response has been termed as damped ice induced vibration d iiv since ss iiv is more significant from a structural perspective particular attention has been placed on this type of response 3 1 structural response base case for analysis validation the base case used in this analysis is based on the results of nandan et al 2011 who conducted a simulation for an interaction event having a duration of one hundred seconds which included a stepwise variation in ice thickness and drift speed ice thickness was assumed to be 0 5 m for the first 5 s after which an instantaneous change of the ice thickness to a value of 1 5 m occurred and continued until t 58 s another step change then occurred just after 58 s and the ice thickness returned to 0 5 m again which continued until the end of the simulation ice drift speed starts at 0 2 m s and increased to 0 25 m s at 10 s and to 0 35 m s at 30 s results obtained for this case are shown in fig 8 and exhibit ss iiv that initiate at t 30 s due to the change in ice drift speed and continue until t 58 s these ss iivs are characterized by a significant amplitude and a frequency close to the natural frequency of the structure after t 58 s when the ice thickness decreases the response returns to a damped vibration mode the results show that ice induced vibration is strongly correlated with both ice thickness and drift speed and are in excellent agreement with the result of nandan et al 2011 3 2 analysis cases considered using the approach described in section 2 a series of modified peyton relationships were generated yielding the corresponding curve coefficients for each of the analysis cases summarized below using the inputs and parameter values associated with each of the analysis cases outlined in table 5 above a series of matlab simulations was conducted and results were plotted to allow for comparison with the base case described in section 3 1 an assessment of the influence of temperature and scale effects on the strength vs stress rate curve and the corresponding predictions of structural response during dynamic ice structure interactions are provided in the sections that follow 3 3 effect of temperature on sem results as depicted in fig 5 as the ice becomes warmer the strength vs stress rate relationship is expected to have a lower peak strength value and a reduced slope moreover the ice failure tends to fail in a more ductile manner at higher temperatures which is anticipated to excite less dynamic response in the structure this rationale is consistent with analysis results obtained here as well as recent medium scale experimental results obtained by birajdar et al 2016 2017 as shown in fig 9 the amplitude of damped and steady state vibration was found to decrease with increasing ice temperature cases a h the mode of the vibration was also found to be highly dependent on ice temperature and for a given ice velocity and thickness combination a threshold temperature may exist above which ss iiv does not occur at all while this result is consistent with expectations based on fundamental mechanics and also with recent observations from small scale test browne et al 2013 o rourke et al 2015 and medium scale indentation experiments with compliant structures birajdar et al 2016 this is contrary to the assessment provide by bjerkås et al 2013b he hypothesized that observations of more frequent ice induced vibration during the spring season was attributable to the ice cover being warmer due to higher solar heat flux and the thermal erosion of ice since ice during spring is warmer thicker and faster moving it is unclear which of these factors dominates the correlation of increased ss iiv with spring ice conditions as examined in section 3 1 since increasing the thickness and velocity are both expected to increase the likelihood of ss iiv and results here suggest lower likelihood of ss iiv for warmer ice it would be valuable to revisit available full scale data to further clarify the role of temperature in full scale iiv 3 4 effect of pressure thickness scale effect on sem results from full scale data it is observed that a distinct pressure thickness effect wherein average pressures were found to decrease with increasing thickness for a structure of given width has been observed from a variety of datasets e g kärnä et al 2006 taylor 2010 taylor and jordaan 2015 it is reasonable to assume that this effect also would result in a decrease in the peak strength and in the slope of the strength vs stress rate curve fig 7 since the ice force equation eq 10 is a linear function of ice thickness increasing ice thickness will proportionally increase the global load on the structure albiet accounting for the pressure thickness effect has a mitigating effect on the rate at which this ice load increases this in turn influences the susceptibility of the structure to ice induced vibration and accounting for this pressure thickness scale effect is expected to reduce the likelihood of iiv occurring this result is illustrated in fig 10 which includes a comparison of sem results for different ice thicknesses when pressure thickness effects are not accounted for cases i l and when pressure thickness effects are included cases m p as may be observed from fig 10 above while the direct relationship between ice thickness and ice force dominates the overall response accounting for the pressure thickness effect in the strength vs stress rate curve does have a significant effect on the predicted amplitude of ice induced vibration for the cases considered here the estimated peak amplitude of the vibration when thickness effects were not included cases i l were found to be about twice as high as predicted values obtained when thickness effects are included in the strength vs stress rate curve cases m p 3 5 effect of pressure width scale effect on sem results similar to ice thickness increasing structure width is also associated with decreasing average global pressures width effects are generally attributed to the effects of statistical averaging of non simultaneous loads that act across the face of the structure e g kry 1978 assuming the pressure width scale effect would have similar influence on the average strength embodied in the peyton relationship it may be inferred that the peak strength and slopes of the strength vs stress rate curve would decrease fig 7 for the base case used in this analysis the original peyton curve used to represent the ice behavior corresponds to a pile diameter of 4 3 m for the norströmsgrund lighthouse which is used as the representative structural system for this analysis the reported width at the waterline is 7 5 m kärnä et al 2013 fig 7 shows a family of inferred strength vs stress rate relationships that have been obtained for different structure widths by scaling the original peyton relationship using the width effect relationship embodied in the iso 19906 global ice pressure equation using the same approach a modified strength vs stress rate relationship is obtained for a width of 7 5 m norströmsgrund lighthouse to assess the significance of width effect on iiv response results have been obtained by simulating the response of the norströmsgrund lighthouse using the original peyton curve with no width effect accounted for left side of fig 11 as well as using a modified strength vs stress rate relationship which accounts for the width effect corresponding to a width of 7 5 m right side of fig 11 as may be observed from fig 11 above when width effects are accounted for ss iiv does not occur within the simulation period and the vibration amplitude is also significantly smaller in the above case the width of the structure is identical 7 5 m in both simulation cases only the ice strength relationship is changed for design applications where the actual width of the structure may be changed it is important to note since that ice force is also a function of structure radius in the sem model increasing the structure width has both aggravating due to increase of loaded area and mitigating effects due to decreasing average pressure on ice induced vibration when pressure width effect is considered to obtain further insight on pressure width effect the acceleration response has been calculated with and without this effect for three different structural configurations diameter d 2 m 5 m 10 m under similar ice conditions see fig 12 in practice changes in structural dimensions would be expected to result in corresponding changes to the mass stiffness and damping of the structure for the present investigation to more clearly illustrate the pressure width effect and simplify the analysis it has been assumed that in each of the cases considered the structural configurations are such that they yield the same sdof structural parameters at the waterline e g mass stiffness damping since it has been assumed for this section of the analysis that only the waterline diameter is changed as expected smaller waterline widths correspond to lower total ice loads resulting in insufficient force to excite steady state vibration regardless of whether or not the width effects are accounted for however it is important to note that since the base case peyton s curve corresponds to a width of 4 3 m for widths less than this value accounting for the pressure width effect results in higher pressures which in turn results in a larger amplitude response for widths close to the base case diameter of 4 3 m e g 5 m accounting for the width effect is not expected to have a pronounced effect as is reflected in the result in fig 12 as width is further increased e g d 10 m the pressure width effect results in decreased global pressures resulting in a potentially more significant reduction in predicted vibration amplitude for wider structures 4 discussion of implications for design to assess the potential implications of the above analysis for design steady state acceleration contours as a function of ice thickness and velocity after nandan et al 2011 have been examined for the norströmsgrund lighthouse structure since the width of the structure will be fixed for a given design in this section emphasis is placed on the influence of temperature and thickness to this end the modified strength vs stress rate relationships that have been updated to account for the effects of temperature fig 5 and pressure thickness scale effect fig 7 have been used to ensure consistency throughout this analysis steady state acceleration values have been used in these plots which are assumed to correspond to the maximum acceleration values in the last several seconds of the results obtained for each analysis case as may be observed from fig 13 temperature appears to have a significant influence on the extent of predicted ss iiv acceleration response over the range thickness and velocities considered consistent with results discussed in section 3 3 accounting for temperature effects in the sem suggests that colder ice is more likely to induce vibrations in the structure to examine the implications of the pressure thickness scale effect a comparison of results from steady state acceleration contour plots for sem analysis excluding and including this effect have been plotted in fig 14 as may be observed from this plot the expected range of conditions resulting in iiv and the severity of the dynamic response when iiv does occur are both expected to decrease when pressure thickness scale effects are accounted for in the model similarly using a 10 m wide structure for comparison purposes the influence of width effect on steady state acceleration has also been analyzed as a function of ice thickness and velocity results in fig 15 show that accounting the pressure width scale effect also tends to decrease the expected range of conditions resulting in iiv and the severity of the dynamic response for widths greater than 4 3 m the width corresponding to peyton s measurements 5 concluding remarks despite considerable advances in ice mechanics and modelling of dynamic ice structure interactions in recent decades significant uncertainties still exist changes in ice properties and behavior are expected throughout the season as ice conditions evolve especially due to changes in temperature and ice thickness moreover the strength of ice is known to vary widely throughout a given interaction as well as from interaction to interaction the triaxial state of stress and the prevalence of fracture during ice compressive failure highly complicates the modelling of ice structure interactions the fundamental question posed by this research is to assess how sensitive results obtained using the sem approach are to variations in temperature and scale the analysis presented in this paper represents an approximate first order estimate of these effects based on information from full scale data laboratory tests as well as fundamental knowledge of ice material behavior this information was used to assess how changes in temperature ice thickness and structure width may impact the modelled strength vs stress rate relationship and associated iiv from this work it has been observed that changes in ice temperature thickness and structure width are expected to have significant effects on predicted dynamic response of the structure as compared with those predicted using baseline conditions these results suggest that as ice temperature increases higher ice drift velocity is necessary to induce ss iiv and the expected intensity of these vibrations may be lower for warm ice than would be expected for colder ice when pressure thickness and pressure width scale effects were accounted for as the ice thickness and structure width increase beyond the baseline values the predicted threshold speed to trigger ss iiv increases and the intensity of the dynamic response may be lower than predicted using peyton s original curve it is important to reiterate here that this analysis is a first order sensitivity assessment to provide guidance for ongoing research in this area and the modified relationships developed here are not intended for use in design practice further work is needed to address uncertainties in coupled ice structure interactions especially those associated with the effects of temperature and scale the incorporation of ice load models based on statistical distributions of high pressure zones and linked to the physics of ice compressive failure are seen as a promising direction taylor and richard 2014 recent experimental hpz studies on dynamic coupling during ice structure interactions at small scale browne et al 2013 taylor et al

23157,empirical relationships of compressive ice strength as a function of stress rate have been utilized in models of vibrations that arise during coupled ice structure interactions central to current self excited models sem is a deterministic relationship of compressive ice strength as a function of stress rate based on uniaxial compressive strength data obtained from thin first year sea ice however full scale observations laboratory test data and fundamental knowledge of ice material behavior suggest that any such relationship would be influenced by factors such as temperature and the scale of the interaction in this paper the influence of temperature and scale effects is examined and first order estimates of their effect on modifying the assumed strength vs stress rate relationship are presented this approach is used to assess the sensitivity of the sem method to changes in environmental and interaction conditions results suggest that accounting for changes in ice temperature and the scale of interaction considerably affect ice induced vibration responses predicted by the model additional large scale experiments full scale data and the development of physics based models of ice compressive failure are needed to better account for different ice conditions and different sized structures that may be considered in design keywords ice induced vibrations ice mechanics self excited vibration dynamic ice structure interaction 1 introduction 1 1 background when designing structures for ice environments ice induced vibrations iiv especially steady state vibrations are an important engineering consideration the international standard for petroleum and natural gas industries arctic offshore structures iso 19906 2010 provides design guidelines for dynamic ice actions section a 8 2 6 of iso 19906 2010 and explicitly discusses the susceptibility of iiv through frequency lock in section a 8 2 14 of iso 19906 2010 frequency lock in refers to the condition when ice fails at a frequency close to the natural frequency of the structure primarily due to crushing and causes a dynamic amplification in structural response such behavior has been observed in the field especially when the natural frequency of the structure is within the range of 1 2 hz peyton 1968 jefferies and wright 1988 bjerkås et al 2013a the guideline provided in the iso code recommends identifying the lowest structural mode susceptible to iiv and checking the stability criterion through modal damping to calculate the modal amplitude at the ice action point the method referred in the iso code määttänen 1978 uses the compressive strength stress rate relationship proposed by blenkarn 1970 this relationship shown in fig 1 uses uniaxial compressive data collected by peyton on thin first year ice on cook inlet alaska peyton 1968 the data shows ice strength increases as a function of loading rate up to a certain point and then start decreasing as loading rate is increased further until reaching to a point after which it is almost constant such behavior has also been observed and reported by other authors schwarz 1970 wu et al 1976 michel and toussaint 1977 it has been postulated that the negative slope in that relationship serves as a source of negative damping and if this is greater than the structural damping then the structural response will grow over time blenkarn termed this as self excited vibration to explain iiv and a rigorous model was later proposed by määttänen although the peyton relationship was based on uniaxial compression test data this relationship has been treated as universal and has been applied to full scale lighthouse structures however fundamental material behavior of ice suggests that such relationship would be significantly influenced by ice properties and interaction conditions in this paper the variation in ice strength stress rate relationship subjected to a variation in ice temperature and interaction scale is inferred based on the fundamental ice material behavior the inference is then used to evaluate how such variation can propagate through the dynamic ice structure interaction and affect iiv response 1 2 literature review the first scientific interest in understanding the dynamic nature of ice structure interactions associated with iiv arose in the late 1960s when this phenomenon was first observed on fixed vertical pile offshore platforms in cook inlet alaska peyton 1968 blenkarn 1970 through the use of full scale measurements both authors concluded that a moving ice field can induce severe vibrations to slender offshore structures however the explanation offered by each author regarding the cause of these iivs differed significantly in these earliest analyses the ice failure processes was described as a stick slip type phenomenon that followed a sawtooth loading pattern comparing his observations to his laboratory test series peyton 1968 concluded that ice has a characteristic failure frequency the notion that these vibrations were of a self excited nature was first proposed by blenkarn 1970 who correctly identified that both the properties of the ice and the structure play an important role in governing the interaction dynamics blenkarn also highlighted the need to consider the natural vibration modes of the structure to assess its susceptibility to damped or steady state resonant vibrations a condition commonly referred to as lock in the physical ice conditions observed to be of most significance by blenkarn were ice speed and thickness less than a decade later similar problems were encountered with navigational aids and lighthouse structures built in the gulf of bothnia finland ultimately resulting in damage and in some instances failure of these structures engelbrektson 1977 määttänen 1978 research undertaken by määttänen further explored the self excited nature of ice structure interactions associated with iiv on full scale lighthouses määttänen 1977 1978 similarly channel markers in gulf of bothnia were also found to be prone to ice induced vibrations one of these markers was instrumented in winter 1987 1988 and severe stresses were recorded due to steady state vibrations or lock in phenomenon nordlund et al 1988 very few cycles were required for the structure to reach peak amplitude from rest which led the authors to believe that the excitation mechanism has a significant force component that is dependent on the displacement and or velocity of the structure due to the observed shift between high level and low level amplitude the excitation mechanism was thought to be comprised of a random force superimposed by an interaction force that is dependent on the structural displacement or velocity similar dynamic effects which ultimately led to cases of structural failure were later reported on jacket platforms in the bohai sea china xu and bernt 1981 two jacket platforms one of which was a small flare jacket were reported to collapse within a period of 10 years based on field measurements on a full scale six legged jacket platform in combination with numerical analysis it was concluded that an amplified resonant response can be expected under a certain combination of ice floe velocity spatial ice load distribution and damping properties of the structure to help mitigate these vibrations ice breaking cones were installed at the water level while this did reduce the extent of ice crushing a different cyclic failure process leading to vibrations was observed due to repeated flexural cusp failures also during high tidal currents the failure frequency of the thin ice could potentially reach of the natural frequencies of the structure yue and bi 2000 yue et al 2007 in canada observations of dynamic ice forces acting on bridge piers neill 1976 montgomery et al 1980 highlighted that in some structures the dynamic response of the pier may exceed the static response during a peak ice force event as offshore technology continued improve and evolve in the 1980s operations moved further north into increasingly challenging ice conditions during this time it was believed that iiv issues were most relevant for narrow structures and this issue was less of a concern for wide structures this belief was challenged during the winter of 1986 when thick multi year ice caused severe ice induced vibrations leading to partial liquefaction of the foundation of the 90 m wide molikpaq mobile arctic caisson structure which was operating in the beaufort sea jefferies and wright 1988 frederking and sudom 2006 cyclic behavior with a frequency of approximately 1 4 hz was recorded with peak vibration amplitudes up to 10 mm which lasted for four minutes timco and wright 2005 these iivs and associated foundation issues created significant concerns about the stability of the structure which ultimately resulted in an evacuation of the platform a comprehensive review of these early observations was provided by sodhi 1988 and these incidents along with uncertainties associated with full scale measurements from the molikpaq have been broadly discussed in the ice mechanics community taylor and jordaan 2011 jordaan et al 2011 to help address uncertainties around full scale loads for first year ice interactions with fixed structures the european union funded two major full scale ice force measurement projects in the northern gulf of bothnia in a span of five years the first of these was entitled low level ice forces loleif and the second was entitled structures in ice strice ice force was directly measured against norströmsgrund lighthouse using nine ice force measuring panels ice thickness and air temperature were also recorded while the full datasets and reports for the loleif and strice projects are not readily accessible brief descriptions of the test setup can be found in the literature schwarz and jochmann 2001 bjerkås et al 2013a results from the loleif project show that effective pressure decreases with nominal interaction area and also with increasing ice thickness schwarz and jochmann 2001 the strice data have been extensively analyzed by bjerkås to study the dynamics of ice structure interactions and associated ice induced vibrations bjerkås and skiple 2005 bjerkås et al 2013a 2013b from these analyses three different interaction modes namely intermittent crushing frequency lock in and continuous crushing were observed intermittent crushing was observed in speeds between 0 02 m s to 0 08 m s and was associated primarily with circumferential cracking events or simultaneous high crushing loads on several panels while rare frequency lock in was observed to occur occasionally and during one reported event steady state vibration persisted for about 190 cycles bjerkås et al 2013a associated with this particular event was the observation that it was preceded by a circumferential crack that produced a smooth contact surface which helped to synchronize contact during the ice crushing process according to the authors during the first phase of this event as the force built up the structure exhibited lateral displacement and then sprang back when the load dropped following ice failure creating contact conditions that allowed the next phase of synchronized load build up during this event there were several intervals each having 8 10 cycles in which the local load progressively increased during each cycle due to synchronization of the ice failure with the structural response ultimately displacing the structure up to 24 30 mm bjerkås et al 2013a since this displacement was associated with dynamic amplification system damping was an important factor in influencing this response after many failure cycles the mass of accumulated broken ice caused a local collapse in a sector of the ice triggering flooding of the ice cover causing it to bend and fail for speeds greater than 0 1 m s continuous crushing was observed which generally produced loads that were significantly lower than either intermittent or lock in modes it should be noted here that the critical speed above which continuous crushing occurred was found to vary with ice thickness and temperature to help further understand this issue many laboratory research programs using small scale compliant structures have been carried out määttänen 1981 määttänen 1983 toyama et al 1983 jordaan and timco 1988 sodhi 1989 kärnä and muhonen 1990 finn et al 1993 kärnä et al 2003 huang et al 2007 määttänen 2008 määttänen et al 2011 browne et al 2013 taylor et al 2013 o rourke et al 2016a o rourke et al 2016b from these studies it is observed that in general for speeds up to some lower limit velocity the ice loads exhibit a sawtooth pattern with a failure frequency that is proportional to the ice speed once the ice speed exceeds this lower limit the iiv frequency tends to lock in to a natural frequency of the system typically less than the natural frequency of the structure and the loading pattern exhibits a more sinusoidal character as the ice speed is further increased beyond a certain upper limit velocity the ice failure behavior transitions to a random brittle mode with reduced amplitude emerging from this collective body of work is a general consensus regarding classification of modes of dynamic ice structure interaction as a function of loading rate into the four types put forward by kärnä and trunen 1990 described below and depicted in fig 2 a creep or damage enhanced creep at a very slow loading rate where ice fails in ductile manner the structure experiences very high global load however no structural vibration occurs b sawtooth or intermittent ice crushing at a faster loading rate where the loading pattern can be periodic in nature comprising of a loading and unloading phase the structure and ice moves quasi statically in the loading phase followed by an unloading event primarily due to spalling the sudden load drop results in a transient vibration with a relatively high acceleration the associated acceleration may be important in designing non structural components and devices supported by the main structure depending on the damping of the structure the transient vibration eventually dies out before entering in the next loading phase c frequency lock in or steady state vibration at higher loading rate where the response of the structure may become more sinusoidal in nature the frequency of the ice force gets locked into the natural frequency of the structure even though ice speed changes slightly if the ice speed remains within the range the steady state vibration can sustain for a long period having nearly constant amplitude yue et al 2009 evidence of such vibrations in full scale have been reported by bjerkås et al 2013a nordlund et al 1988 and others d random or continuous ice crushing which occurs at very high interaction speed the failure is brittle and random in nature causing a lower global load and structural displacement 1 3 iiv modelling approaches the most commonly employed engineering approaches to modelling ice induced vibration can be broadly classified into two major categories the first group considered the ice to have a characteristic crushing failure frequency or crushing length matlock et al 1969 was the first to introduce an ice structure interaction model based on this idea and such approaches have been used to explain full scale ice induced vibration occurrences gagnon 2012 in his classical model matlock assumed ice to be an ideal elastic brittle material and the model was represented by a carriage transporting a series of uniformly spaced elastic brittle teeth when a tooth is in contact with the structure the force is assumed to be linearly dependent on the deformation of the tooth sodhi 1994 later modified the model using results from a number of test series sodhi and nakazawa 1988 sodhi 1989 1992 sodhi and chin 1992 in his model one force cycle is divided into three phases loading extrusion and separation each having its own mathematical formulation and was able to replicate the essential features of intermittent crushing huang and liu 2009 also extended the matlock model by including the discrete failure behavior dependence of ice strength on ice velocity and randomness of failure the other commonly employed approach considers ice induced vibration to be self excited in nature blenkarn 1970 was the first to introduce this idea which was later incorporated into a coupled dynamic ice structure interaction model by määttänen 1978 the määttänen self excited model sem utilizes the crushing strength vs stress rate curve first proposed by blenkarn shown in fig 1 based on peyton s measurements blenkarn proposed that the crushing strength vs stress rate curve has a negative slope beyond a certain loading rate sustained ice induced vibrations are explained in the context of this negative damping effect the effect of relative velocity in dynamic ice structure interactions has been considered by other researchers as well based on their test results tsuchiya et al 1985 proposed that maximum resistance of ice should be recalculated in each time step taking into account the effect of relative velocity daoud and lee 1986 considered the ice force function to follow a predefined sawtooth function and defined the velocity dependence with a heaviside step function having the value 1 for positive relative velocity and 0 otherwise kry 1978 proposed the idea of independent zones of crushing in front of a wide structure and considered that effective stresses for each zone are developed independently of the adjacent zones daley 1991 developed an ice failure model based on a progressive sequence of through body shear cracks triggered once a critical stress limit is reached resulting in a sudden drop in force due to flaking events eranti 1992 used this zonal ice force concept to develop his ice structure interaction model the indentor is assumed to penetrate into each zone until a critical ice pressure is reached which is both loading rate dependent and has a certain degree of randomness the ice zone fails a finite distance ahead and the indentor is able to move within this zone with only minor resistance of the failed ice kärnä extended the idea of zonal force to simulate response of full three dimensional structures using the finite element method kärnä 1992 kärnä et al 1999 the model also includes the soil structure interaction to account for the foundation behavior ice action is considered in two phases elastic far field and non linear near field which are further divide into zones where the interactive forces as well as the relative displacement between the ice and structure are defined at specific contact points the far field response is described using rigid body motion of ice mass and elastic displacement of ice edge failure in the near field area is assumed to be horizontal splits where each layer fails independently due to the compressive force applied on it failure force is a function of characteristic ice failure pressure which is sampled from a log normal distribution using a base value and nominal contact area also it is assumed that crushing pressure decreases by a factor of 2 when the relative velocity exceeds a certain range withalm and hoffmann 2010 used the zonal ice force concept to extend the matlock model for full scale round structures ice induced vibration has also been linked to contact area variation hendrikse and metrikine 2015 and the reduced velocity concept used in vortex induced vibration palmer et al 2010 despite the above progress significant gaps remain in explaining iiv and developing engineering models that are linked to fundamental mechanics of ice failure in this paper the effects of temperature and scale on the strength vs loading rate curve shown in fig 1 are investigated to identifying how accounting for such effects influences design assessments of susceptibility of structures to ice induced vibration and assess if accounting for such factors increases agreement with full scale observations while it is clear that the assumption of the universality of this relationship is convenient for analysis purposes it is less clear if such a relationship holds for different ice conditions and scales since insufficient full scale data exists on which to validate such an assumption for this reason in the analysis presented herein inferences have been made regarding the anticipated effects of these factors on the strength vs stress rate relationship to explore its effect on steady state ice induced vibrations 2 model description 2 1 self excited model sem models identified in the current iso 19906 guidelines include negative damping of ice as a contributing factor in frequency lock in to identify the lock in frequency iso suggests identifying the natural modes which are sensitive to ice induced vibration the conditions for dynamic stability developed by määttänen 1978 and kärnä et al 1999 can be used in such cases for a natural mode n the dynamic stability can be achieved if the relative damping coefficient of the structure ζ n is larger than the opposite contribution of ice action mathematically dynamic stability will be achieved if the following equation is satisfied 1 ζ n nc 2 4 π f n m n h θ where ζ n is the damping ratio of the eigenmode n c is the non normalized modal amplitude at the ice action point m n is the true modal mass expressed in kilograms k g f n is the natural frequency of the eigenmode expressed in hertz h z h is the ice thickness expressed in meters m θ is a coefficient the suggested value of which is 40 10 6 kilograms per metre second k g m s once the lowest natural mode susceptible to frequency lock in is identified a sawtooth forcing function with a frequency equal to the natural frequency of the mode is generated in this approach the forcing function accounts for ice structure coupling by using the strength vs stress rate relationship to calculate the instantaneous ice force as a function of the relative velocity between the ice and the structure as is described further below in the present study the määttänen sem has been used since this model is based solely on the strength stress rate relationship whereas the kärnä model accounts for rate dependence by decreasing ice strength by a factor of 2 when the relative velocity between the ice and structure exceeds a transitional range 100 250 mm s kärnä et al 1999 in määttänen s sem the following assumptions have been made ice is always in a continuous crushing state hence the strength vs stress rate curve can be used except for cases where the structure s velocity is greater than ice velocity in such cases the interaction force goes to zero the crushing strength is averaged out over the interaction area the elastic deformation of ice and the viscoelastic behavior are ignored at the beginning of a loading cycle the deflection of the structure increases as the ice sheet advances leading to an increase in resistance from the structure as the structural resistance continues to build with increasing deflection the rate of deflection relative to the ice velocity begins to decrease leading to an increase in the loading rate this phase of the interaction cycle continues until the structure comes to rest for an instant at its peak deflection at which point the resistance from the structure has increased to the point that it exceeds the maximum ice strength causing the structural movement to change direction triggering the onset of rebounding as the structure begins to rebound it starts to move towards the ice sheet causing the loading rate to further increase which in turn cause the ice crushing strength to decrease as the structure accelerates during the rebounding process the loading rate further increases resulting in continued decreases in ice strength since the structural deflection decreases during rebounding the associated resistance force also decreases as rebounding continues further the structure eventually begins to decelerate and the loading rate begins to decrease since the structure is advancing more slowly towards the ice causing the ice strength to begin to increase again the structure continues to decelerate until it eventually comes to rest for an instant before the structural movement again reverses direction and begins deflecting at the onset of the next loading cycle the equation for dynamic ice structure interaction is as follows 2 m x c x k x f according to the self excitation vibration model ice force is only a function of relative velocity considering only one mode of vibration the equation can be simplified as 3 m x c x kx f v x where v is the ice drift velocity for small motion the forcing function can be expanded as 4 f v x f v x f v v so equation 2 becomes 5 m x c f v x kx f v if the term f v is negative and numerically greater than the structural damping coefficient c then there will be net negative damping in equation 5 which would lead to the growth of a structural response with time self excited vibration the roots of equation 5 are complex conjugate pairs and the appearance of the self excited vibration depends on the sign of the real part vibration will arise for positive real part and no vibration will arise if the sign is negative the stability condition is valid only for one ice velocity at a time however when assessing the potential onset of oscillations it is sufficient to check for stability at the ice velocity corresponding to the steepest negative slope in the non linear crushing strength vs loading rate curve for a root with a positive real part vibration amplitudes are supposed to increase exponentially however in practice such growth will tend to limit cycles this occurs even for constant ice velocities since the oscillation of the relative velocity will occur due to the deflection rebound cycle of the structure correspondingly as the relative velocity changes the instantaneous strength moves along the curve and once it returns to the positive slope region this will suppress further amplitude growth thus all self excited ice induced vibration will have a stable limit cycle which is also termed as stability as large e g the condition is satisfied for a root with a negative real part vibration amplitudes decay exponentially however if the roots of the equilibrium equations are not calculated at the point with steepest negative slope of the strength vs loading rate curve obtaining negative real parts still does not guarantee absolute stability a change in relative velocity in the deflection rebound cycle described above can result in vibration of the structure due to oscillation of the relative velocity which can very soon yield to such a velocity that the corresponding point in the strength vs stress rate curve no longer lies on the area of negative slope suppressing further amplitude growth the loading rate of the ice sheet is calculated with the equation originally deduced by blenkarn 1970 6 σ v 0 x i 4 σ c πa cos θ where v 0 is the ice drift velocity x i is the velocity of the structure at the point of action σ c is ice crushing stress and a is the radius of the structure the cosine term takes into account the circular form of the load distribution assumed in this model as shown in fig 3 the ice crushing strength can be obtained from the simplified version of the piecewise linear peyton curve shown in fig 4 for j t h time step as 7 σ c α j β j σ the linearized version of the curve requires the following parameters to define the strength stress rate relationship α intercept in the y axis equal to σ 0 when loading rate is zero β slope of the crushing strength stress rate curve σ 1 limit stress rate of ductile region was considered to be 0 2 mpa s in the original sem σ 2 limit stress rate of transition region was considered to be 0 8 mpa s in the original sem by solving the two sets of equations explicit expressions for stress rate σ and crushing strength σ c can be obtained as follows 8 σ α j πa 4 v 0 x i c o s θ β j 9 σ c πa α j πa 4 β j v 0 x i c o s θ the crushing strength of ice would be equal to the global pressure applied by ice on the structure at the waterline thus integrating the ice crushing strength along the waterline circumference of the structure will give the ice induced force f applied on the structure at the waterline given as 10 f 2 0 π 2 σ c a c o s θ hdθ 2 ah 0 π 2 πa α j c o s θ πa 4 β j v 0 x i c o s θ dθ where h is the ice thickness using the forcing function from equation 10 we can now solve the system equation mentioned in equation 3 numerically 2 2 modification of peyton curve parameters the simplified assumption of linear relationship enables identification of the stability criterion in a straight forward way as outlined above the roots should be calculated at the steepest point of the negatively sloped portion of the strength vs stress rate curve to ensure stability of the system this also applies for numerical integration as is employed here from fundamental understanding of ice material behavior michel and toussaint 1977 sanderson 1988 schulson and duval 2009 it is known that changing ice conditions such as temperature and scale will influence ice strength on this basis it is proposed here that changes in such conditions would be expected to affect the strength vs stress rate curves yielding a family of curves rather than a single universal curve to ensure stability of the system for the range of conditions expected in a given design scenario the roots should be obtained for conditions that yield the curve with highest negative slope to perform such an analysis it is first necessary to assess how changes in these conditions would influence the peyton curve parameters so that the effects of such variations on ice induced vibration response can be assessed in the present analysis only the effects of temperature and pressure scale on crushing strength have been considered other deterministic e g grain size ice density salinity etc and probabilistic factors randomness due to fracture could be considered as well but are beyond the scope of the present work 2 3 effect of temperature on peyton curve parameters while the effect of temperature on the peyton strength vs stress rate relationship have not been reported in the literature such effects have been studied from small scale experiments for both freshwater ice wu et al 1976 and saline ice schwarz 1970 in the present work only saline ice is considered and the work of schwarz 1970 provides useful insights here for the peyton uniaxial compressive strength dataset the average temperature for that season was reported to be 10 c blenkarn 1970 and this value is assumed to be representative of the mean ice temperature for the reference strength stress rate curve schwarz 1970 found that uniaxial compressive strength of sea ice is a function of ice temperature and that as the temperature increases the ice becomes weaker due to growth of brine pockets similar to the effect observed for flexural strength e g timco and weeks 2010 based on these results it is reasonable to infer that a similar trend would be expected for the peyton relationship as well to provide a first order estimate of this effect a temperature correction factor is calculated as the ratio of maximum strength at the temperature of interest to the maximum strength at 10 c from schwarz 1970 at three stress rates 10 2 0 2 0 8 these factors were applied to the peyton relationship to account for the effect of temperature 2 c 5 c 10 c 20 c as shown in fig 5 linear interpolation was used to obtain maximum strength at 5 c and 2 c from the data of schwarz 1970 the corresponding intercept and slope values for the modified peyton curves considering temperature effects are listed in table 1 below 2 4 effect of ice thickness and structure width on peyton curve parameters the pressure area data compiled by sanderson 1988 corresponds to a number of datasets covering a range of scales which clearly show a trend of decreasing average pressure with increasing interaction area given the importance of these scale effects for ice load estimation as is reflected in the design methodology in iso 19906 2010 the strength vs stress rate relationships used in sem should also account for such effects as shown in fig 6 below there is good general agreement between the data from sanderson schwarz 1970 and peyton 1968 as well as the value obtained using the global average pressure model from iso 19906 evaluated at the same area as in peyton s data as discussed in detail in taylor 2010 decreases in pressure due to increasing ice thickness tend to be associated more with probabilistic aspects of localized spalling fracture while width effects tend to be more associated with averaging of local ice pressures across the width of the structure since the mechanisms associated with pressure thickness scale effects and pressure width scale effect are different it is logical here to treat these effects separately the approach of treating scale effects for sea ice as a combination of a thickness and a width scaling effect has also been discussed by other authors e g løset et al 1999 iso 19906 2010 the global ice pressure model provided in iso 19906 2010 accounts for the effects of ice thickness and structure width on average global pressures the scaling relationships embodied in the iso 19906 model to account for the effect of width and thickness have been applied here to scale the peyton curves for the range of ice thickness and structure widths of interest as is shown in fig 7 as one would expect the magnitude of the peak and the slopes of the curve becomes less steep for increasing width as well as increasing ice thickness it is noted here that the values of width and thickness for the base case in this analysis e g peyton s uniaxial compression tests was not reported by peyton in his original paper however since sem considers the relationship to be universal these values can be inferred from values observed in peyton s field test measurements the structural pile used in cook inlet tests had a diameter of 4 3 m sanderson 1988 and an average thickness of ice for that season was 0 36 m blenkarn 1970 it should be mentioned here that while the scale of the interaction can influence the dominant ice failure mode as is discussed in section 2 1 application of the sem is assumed to correspond only to events where continuous crushing occurs during full scale interactions continuous crushing only occurs during a relatively small proportion of all interactions and other ice failure modes result in more random loading patterns that are not associated with observations of iiv jefferies and wright 1988 jefferies et al 2008 this allows for simplification of the methodology by limiting the analysis to scenarios where the ice fails in continuous crushing the intercept and slope values for modified peyton s curve considering the scale effect are listed in table 2 table 3 3 results and analysis to implement the model described in section 2 1 the sem analysis routine was programmed in matlab the structure chosen as a basis for the analysis was the norströmsgrund lighthouse since the structure has experienced a number of ice induced vibration events that have been reported in the literature also the structure has been analyzed previously using the sem nandan et al 2011 which allows for direct comparison of results to verify proper functioning of the analysis routines in their analysis nandan et al 2011 used a 15 node lumped mass model with translational and rotational degrees of freedom and the ice force was considered to be acting only on the waterline node however a single degree of freedom sdof representation of the model was found to be very efficient computationally without a loss of accuracy the sdof parameters for the structure were obtained from a joint industry project jip which was arranged to validate different ice induced vibration models kärnä et al 2013 thus making the parameters independent of the analysis the numerical integration was done by forward time integration scheme using the rk4 algorithm a summary of the structural parameters for the sdof models are given in table 4 the model was first validated using the same ice parameters thickness velocity used by nandan et al 2011 with the original strength stress rate relationship once the model was found to be in agreement for the original strength stress rate relationship individual analysis was performed using the modified peyton s curve discussed in sections 2 3 2 4 from these analyses the acceleration of the structure was used to characterize the ice induced vibration response in the foregoing a sinusoidal response with constant amplitude has been termed as steady state ice induced vibration ss iiv whereas a decaying response has been termed as damped ice induced vibration d iiv since ss iiv is more significant from a structural perspective particular attention has been placed on this type of response 3 1 structural response base case for analysis validation the base case used in this analysis is based on the results of nandan et al 2011 who conducted a simulation for an interaction event having a duration of one hundred seconds which included a stepwise variation in ice thickness and drift speed ice thickness was assumed to be 0 5 m for the first 5 s after which an instantaneous change of the ice thickness to a value of 1 5 m occurred and continued until t 58 s another step change then occurred just after 58 s and the ice thickness returned to 0 5 m again which continued until the end of the simulation ice drift speed starts at 0 2 m s and increased to 0 25 m s at 10 s and to 0 35 m s at 30 s results obtained for this case are shown in fig 8 and exhibit ss iiv that initiate at t 30 s due to the change in ice drift speed and continue until t 58 s these ss iivs are characterized by a significant amplitude and a frequency close to the natural frequency of the structure after t 58 s when the ice thickness decreases the response returns to a damped vibration mode the results show that ice induced vibration is strongly correlated with both ice thickness and drift speed and are in excellent agreement with the result of nandan et al 2011 3 2 analysis cases considered using the approach described in section 2 a series of modified peyton relationships were generated yielding the corresponding curve coefficients for each of the analysis cases summarized below using the inputs and parameter values associated with each of the analysis cases outlined in table 5 above a series of matlab simulations was conducted and results were plotted to allow for comparison with the base case described in section 3 1 an assessment of the influence of temperature and scale effects on the strength vs stress rate curve and the corresponding predictions of structural response during dynamic ice structure interactions are provided in the sections that follow 3 3 effect of temperature on sem results as depicted in fig 5 as the ice becomes warmer the strength vs stress rate relationship is expected to have a lower peak strength value and a reduced slope moreover the ice failure tends to fail in a more ductile manner at higher temperatures which is anticipated to excite less dynamic response in the structure this rationale is consistent with analysis results obtained here as well as recent medium scale experimental results obtained by birajdar et al 2016 2017 as shown in fig 9 the amplitude of damped and steady state vibration was found to decrease with increasing ice temperature cases a h the mode of the vibration was also found to be highly dependent on ice temperature and for a given ice velocity and thickness combination a threshold temperature may exist above which ss iiv does not occur at all while this result is consistent with expectations based on fundamental mechanics and also with recent observations from small scale test browne et al 2013 o rourke et al 2015 and medium scale indentation experiments with compliant structures birajdar et al 2016 this is contrary to the assessment provide by bjerkås et al 2013b he hypothesized that observations of more frequent ice induced vibration during the spring season was attributable to the ice cover being warmer due to higher solar heat flux and the thermal erosion of ice since ice during spring is warmer thicker and faster moving it is unclear which of these factors dominates the correlation of increased ss iiv with spring ice conditions as examined in section 3 1 since increasing the thickness and velocity are both expected to increase the likelihood of ss iiv and results here suggest lower likelihood of ss iiv for warmer ice it would be valuable to revisit available full scale data to further clarify the role of temperature in full scale iiv 3 4 effect of pressure thickness scale effect on sem results from full scale data it is observed that a distinct pressure thickness effect wherein average pressures were found to decrease with increasing thickness for a structure of given width has been observed from a variety of datasets e g kärnä et al 2006 taylor 2010 taylor and jordaan 2015 it is reasonable to assume that this effect also would result in a decrease in the peak strength and in the slope of the strength vs stress rate curve fig 7 since the ice force equation eq 10 is a linear function of ice thickness increasing ice thickness will proportionally increase the global load on the structure albiet accounting for the pressure thickness effect has a mitigating effect on the rate at which this ice load increases this in turn influences the susceptibility of the structure to ice induced vibration and accounting for this pressure thickness scale effect is expected to reduce the likelihood of iiv occurring this result is illustrated in fig 10 which includes a comparison of sem results for different ice thicknesses when pressure thickness effects are not accounted for cases i l and when pressure thickness effects are included cases m p as may be observed from fig 10 above while the direct relationship between ice thickness and ice force dominates the overall response accounting for the pressure thickness effect in the strength vs stress rate curve does have a significant effect on the predicted amplitude of ice induced vibration for the cases considered here the estimated peak amplitude of the vibration when thickness effects were not included cases i l were found to be about twice as high as predicted values obtained when thickness effects are included in the strength vs stress rate curve cases m p 3 5 effect of pressure width scale effect on sem results similar to ice thickness increasing structure width is also associated with decreasing average global pressures width effects are generally attributed to the effects of statistical averaging of non simultaneous loads that act across the face of the structure e g kry 1978 assuming the pressure width scale effect would have similar influence on the average strength embodied in the peyton relationship it may be inferred that the peak strength and slopes of the strength vs stress rate curve would decrease fig 7 for the base case used in this analysis the original peyton curve used to represent the ice behavior corresponds to a pile diameter of 4 3 m for the norströmsgrund lighthouse which is used as the representative structural system for this analysis the reported width at the waterline is 7 5 m kärnä et al 2013 fig 7 shows a family of inferred strength vs stress rate relationships that have been obtained for different structure widths by scaling the original peyton relationship using the width effect relationship embodied in the iso 19906 global ice pressure equation using the same approach a modified strength vs stress rate relationship is obtained for a width of 7 5 m norströmsgrund lighthouse to assess the significance of width effect on iiv response results have been obtained by simulating the response of the norströmsgrund lighthouse using the original peyton curve with no width effect accounted for left side of fig 11 as well as using a modified strength vs stress rate relationship which accounts for the width effect corresponding to a width of 7 5 m right side of fig 11 as may be observed from fig 11 above when width effects are accounted for ss iiv does not occur within the simulation period and the vibration amplitude is also significantly smaller in the above case the width of the structure is identical 7 5 m in both simulation cases only the ice strength relationship is changed for design applications where the actual width of the structure may be changed it is important to note since that ice force is also a function of structure radius in the sem model increasing the structure width has both aggravating due to increase of loaded area and mitigating effects due to decreasing average pressure on ice induced vibration when pressure width effect is considered to obtain further insight on pressure width effect the acceleration response has been calculated with and without this effect for three different structural configurations diameter d 2 m 5 m 10 m under similar ice conditions see fig 12 in practice changes in structural dimensions would be expected to result in corresponding changes to the mass stiffness and damping of the structure for the present investigation to more clearly illustrate the pressure width effect and simplify the analysis it has been assumed that in each of the cases considered the structural configurations are such that they yield the same sdof structural parameters at the waterline e g mass stiffness damping since it has been assumed for this section of the analysis that only the waterline diameter is changed as expected smaller waterline widths correspond to lower total ice loads resulting in insufficient force to excite steady state vibration regardless of whether or not the width effects are accounted for however it is important to note that since the base case peyton s curve corresponds to a width of 4 3 m for widths less than this value accounting for the pressure width effect results in higher pressures which in turn results in a larger amplitude response for widths close to the base case diameter of 4 3 m e g 5 m accounting for the width effect is not expected to have a pronounced effect as is reflected in the result in fig 12 as width is further increased e g d 10 m the pressure width effect results in decreased global pressures resulting in a potentially more significant reduction in predicted vibration amplitude for wider structures 4 discussion of implications for design to assess the potential implications of the above analysis for design steady state acceleration contours as a function of ice thickness and velocity after nandan et al 2011 have been examined for the norströmsgrund lighthouse structure since the width of the structure will be fixed for a given design in this section emphasis is placed on the influence of temperature and thickness to this end the modified strength vs stress rate relationships that have been updated to account for the effects of temperature fig 5 and pressure thickness scale effect fig 7 have been used to ensure consistency throughout this analysis steady state acceleration values have been used in these plots which are assumed to correspond to the maximum acceleration values in the last several seconds of the results obtained for each analysis case as may be observed from fig 13 temperature appears to have a significant influence on the extent of predicted ss iiv acceleration response over the range thickness and velocities considered consistent with results discussed in section 3 3 accounting for temperature effects in the sem suggests that colder ice is more likely to induce vibrations in the structure to examine the implications of the pressure thickness scale effect a comparison of results from steady state acceleration contour plots for sem analysis excluding and including this effect have been plotted in fig 14 as may be observed from this plot the expected range of conditions resulting in iiv and the severity of the dynamic response when iiv does occur are both expected to decrease when pressure thickness scale effects are accounted for in the model similarly using a 10 m wide structure for comparison purposes the influence of width effect on steady state acceleration has also been analyzed as a function of ice thickness and velocity results in fig 15 show that accounting the pressure width scale effect also tends to decrease the expected range of conditions resulting in iiv and the severity of the dynamic response for widths greater than 4 3 m the width corresponding to peyton s measurements 5 concluding remarks despite considerable advances in ice mechanics and modelling of dynamic ice structure interactions in recent decades significant uncertainties still exist changes in ice properties and behavior are expected throughout the season as ice conditions evolve especially due to changes in temperature and ice thickness moreover the strength of ice is known to vary widely throughout a given interaction as well as from interaction to interaction the triaxial state of stress and the prevalence of fracture during ice compressive failure highly complicates the modelling of ice structure interactions the fundamental question posed by this research is to assess how sensitive results obtained using the sem approach are to variations in temperature and scale the analysis presented in this paper represents an approximate first order estimate of these effects based on information from full scale data laboratory tests as well as fundamental knowledge of ice material behavior this information was used to assess how changes in temperature ice thickness and structure width may impact the modelled strength vs stress rate relationship and associated iiv from this work it has been observed that changes in ice temperature thickness and structure width are expected to have significant effects on predicted dynamic response of the structure as compared with those predicted using baseline conditions these results suggest that as ice temperature increases higher ice drift velocity is necessary to induce ss iiv and the expected intensity of these vibrations may be lower for warm ice than would be expected for colder ice when pressure thickness and pressure width scale effects were accounted for as the ice thickness and structure width increase beyond the baseline values the predicted threshold speed to trigger ss iiv increases and the intensity of the dynamic response may be lower than predicted using peyton s original curve it is important to reiterate here that this analysis is a first order sensitivity assessment to provide guidance for ongoing research in this area and the modified relationships developed here are not intended for use in design practice further work is needed to address uncertainties in coupled ice structure interactions especially those associated with the effects of temperature and scale the incorporation of ice load models based on statistical distributions of high pressure zones and linked to the physics of ice compressive failure are seen as a promising direction taylor and richard 2014 recent experimental hpz studies on dynamic coupling during ice structure interactions at small scale browne et al 2013 taylor et al

two response peaks can be clearly identified a cancellation effect occurs between direct wave effects and floater motion induced loads and horizontal and vertical rotor positions can significantly affect the dynamic responses of the blade loads the rotor should be placed close to the floater centre to avoid large floater motion induced velocity on the blade section sensitivity studies are carried out with varying significant wave heights and peak periods these results may contribute to a general understanding of floater induced dynamic loads on floating tidal turbines in a random sea keywords floating tidal turbine dynamic response blade element momentum linear surface wave wave induced load 1 introduction the idea of generating power from ocean tides dates back to the 1950s elghali et al 2007 tidal current power has the advantages of being highly predictable having high energy density and producing limited environmental impacts adcock et al 2015 in the last 20 years tidal turbines especially the horizontal axis turbines have been developed for more than one or two generations nowadays most tidal turbines reach megawatt level power capacity with diameters from 10 m to 20 m the rotation speed of the turbine varies depending on the rated current speed and rotor diameter the tip speed ratio tsr of a typical horizontal axis tidal turbine is about 4 8 with the power coefficient of 0 3 0 4 liu et al 2011 ng et al 2013 zhou et al 2017 with tidal turbines being utilised in deep waters defined as being deeper than 70 m some floating tidal turbines are designed and tested tethys 2012 scotrenewables 2018 the major advantage of floating tidal turbines is that they can be easily maintained as all electrical equipment can be placed inside the floating structure and they can be easily accessed unlike the bottom fixed ones zhou et al 2017 another consideration is that the tidal flow is stronger near the sea surface and therefore a floating tidal turbine can generate more energy compared to a bottom mounted one at the same site however the floater motion of floating turbines may induce large dynamic loads on the blade leading to unexpected structure failure tidal turbines suffer from harsh sea environments such as turbulent inflows free surface waves and floater motions although some studies have investigated unsteady loads the knowledge remains limited for wave loads on tidal turbines barltrop et al 2007 carried out experiments using a 400 mm diameter rotor in a towing tank with regular waves and a significant cyclic load variation was observed similar towing tests were reported by lust et al 2013 luznik et al 2013 both studies confirmed that the average power and thrust were unaffected by the passing waves galloway et al 2014 investigated wave effects on an 800 mm 3 bladed horizontal axis tidal turbine device being towed at 0 9 m s 1 in regular waves they also found that the presence of waves did not affect the time averaged torque and thrust but imposed fluctuating loads for motion induced loads on turbines milne et al 2015 presented experiments to measure unsteady bending moments at the blade root for a scaled tidal turbine subjected to planar forcing in a towing tank and found that the unsteady blade loads increased with frequency and exceeded steady loads by up to 15 the problem of unsteady loads on tidal turbines shares many features with that for wind turbines several numerical tools have been developed to estimate the loads and power output of tidal turbines the blade element moment theory bemt introduced by glauert 1935 is widely used to estimate the loads on a rotor batten et al 2008 investigated the loads on tidal turbines and developed the bemt model to effectively predict steady thrust and torque to predict the dynamic behaviour of time fluctuating loads on tidal turbines faudot and dahlhaug 2012 used a quasi static bemt model to predict wave loads on the blades in which the surface wave effect as a first order approximation simply acts as an addition to a uniform stream velocity from the linear wave theory galloway et al 2014 further developed a modified bemt code using a boeing vertol dynamic stall model and pitt peters dynamic inflow model which had been validated by experimental observations to include more physics and fewer empirical parameters the lifting line method epps and kimball 2013 boundary element method young et al 2010 and even full navier stokes ns equations tatum et al 2016 wang et al 2017 can replace the bemt model recently numerical studies have been carried out using direct computational fluid dynamics cfd to investigate the performance of horizontal and vertical axis tidal turbines with 1 or 2 degree of freedom dof motions zhang et al 2015 sheng et al 2016 wang et al 2017 wang et al 2017 found that fluctuating loads on the rotor are mainly caused by axial motion outside the in plane motion of the turbine in which blade loads were studied under surge and roll coupled floater motions from a general point of view the first order dynamic wave load on the turbines blade consists of 1 the dynamic variation of the lift and drag forces due to the inflow fluctuation 2 direct wave excitation forces on the blade 3 added mass effects due to the motion of the blade and 4 dynamic stall effects the added mass effect is a result of the rotor blade motion which is proportional to the blade cross section acceleration due to rotation motion of the blade for rapid changes inflow the dynamic inflow model is introduced to simulate the scenario in which the global flow field cannot respond quickly to establish steady state conditions additionally the dynamic stall deals with the development of the boundary layer on the blade section due to rapid changes of the angle of attack the unsteadiness of the loads on the blade section depends on not only the sea environments such as current velocity inflow turbulence waves and so on but also the operating conditions of the turbine if the turbine was operating at near maximum power then it could be expected that the flow could separate leading to large dynamic loads the reduced frequency k π f c v is used to describe the inflow unsteadiness where f is the frequency of inflow c is the chord of the blade section at 0 75 r and v is the inflow velocity in galloway et al 2014 the dynamic stall were suggested to be excluded in the presented cases with the corresponding reduced frequency of 0 03 milne et al 2015 concluded that the effects of unsteadiness on the loading were inherently small at these relatively low frequencies guo et al 2018a developed an unsteady bemt model that includes added mass effects wave excitation force and rotor dynamics to investigate first order wave loads on tidal turbines this numerical model was validated by guo et al 2017b in which experiments were carried out with an 800 mm diameter rotor exposed to a series of regular waves with different periods and wave heights in a towing tank the prototype tidal turbine used in guo et al 2018a is a 1 mw 20 m diameter horizontal axis turbine with a rated rotation speed of 10 rpm the results showed that for unsteady loads induced by normal ocean waves with a period from 5s to 15s added mass effects and direct wave loads on the blade morison forces can be neglected owing to the small reduced frequency o 0 01 in addition the tip speed ratio tsr of the turbine under the operation condition is about 5 6 which means that the phenomenon of stall was not expected to occur for rigidly mounted tidal turbines the transfer functions have been developed between the rotor loads including thrust torque and blade bending moments and the incident waves and a quasi static formula was derived for wave induced load estimation guo et al 2017a further investigated random wave loads on a tidal turbine and found that responses were dominated by first order contributions which can be fully described by the first order transfer functions meanwhile the response spectra of the flap wise and edge wise blade bending moments show that both low and high frequency responses were excited guo et al 2018b presented a study on the dynamic responses of a floating tidal turbine system with prescribed 6 dof motion using a frequency domain approach in which both floater motion and wave effects on the inflow field were considered floater motion was found to induce loads that dominate the dynamic responses compared with the contributions from direct wave effects on the inflow several previous papers have studied wave effects on tidal turbines faudot and dahlhaug 2012 galloway et al 2014 guo et al 2018a and others have investigated dynamic load behaviour with prescribed floater motions zhang et al 2015 sheng et al 2016 wang et al 2017 guo et al 2018b however in reality floater motion is normally induced by waves which also directly affect the inflow considering the above we carried out this study to investigate the effects of wave induced floater motion on the dynamic responses of a tidal turbine in the time domain both direct wave effects on the inflow field and wave induced floater motion were considered in the present numerical model generator power production thrust torque and blade bending moments were studied note that the linear responses could be obtained by directly multiplying the incident wave spectra and the linear transfer functions in the frequency domain guo et al 2017a in this study by performing the time domain simulation we can acquire more information including non linear effects related to the dynamic wake the dynamic stall the second order wave effects and so on the remainder of this paper is organised as follows a theory background is introduced and a simplified numerical approach proposed in section 2 a reference floating tidal turbine system sjtu ftt is briefly introduced including a floating hull tidal turbine and mooring system in section 3 finally the dynamic performance and responses of the tidal turbine are presented and discussed in detail sensitivity studies that considering different incident wave conditions are also presented this study contributes to the understanding of motion induced loads on floating tidal turbines 2 methodologies 2 1 coordinate systems it is essential to first clarify the coordinate systems used as shown in fig 1 three coordinate systems are involved 1 the global coordinate system 2 coordinates fixed to the floater and 3 the local blade section coordinate system the global coordinate system o xyz is located at the seabed with positive x values pointing downstream and the z axis pointing upwards the floater fixed coordinate system g x y z is located at the geometric centre of the floater waterline plane the origin of the local blade coordinate system is at the centre of the rotor and the z axis is always aligned with the rotating blade the angle between the blade and the upward z axis is defined as the azimuthal position of the blade θ w in the global coordinate system the instantaneous blade section position r b s t is given as 1 r b s t η t a 1 t r f r a 2 t r with 2 a 1 t 1 γ β γ 1 α β α 1 3 a 2 t cos θ w sin θ w 0 sin θ w cos θ w 0 0 0 1 where η t is the position vector of the floater r f r is the vector between centre of the floater and the centre of the turbine r r 0 0 is the span wise position of the blade section and a 1 and a 2 are the transfer matrices between the earth fixed coordinate system and the local blade coordinate system respectively as shown in fig 1 α β and γ are the roll pitch and yaw angles of the floater respectively here the floater motion is assumed to be small with α sin α the vectors e g inflow velocities in the global coordinate system are transferred into the local blade section coordinate using 4 v i a 2 a 1 v 0 2 2 blade element momentum theory bemt is widely used to predict the performance of tidal turbines under the assumption made by bemt flow passing the rotor is discretised into several annular elements with height d r the lateral boundary of these elements consists of streamlines which means that there is no span wise flow glauert 1935 crossing the boundary unlike propellers whose projected area ratio is quite large the chord of tidal turbines is normally much smaller than their radius therefore omitting span wise flow is reasonable for hydrodynamic calculations for tidal turbines batten et al 2006 2008 bahaj et al 2007 as has been proved by previous model validations the basic implementation and validation of the code used in the present work can be found in guo et al 2018a here we only briefly describe the overall code with emphasis on the modifications used to include floater motion in bemt the full flowchart of the numerical model can be found in fig 4 the velocities seen by each blade section are shown in fig 2 where v 0 is inflow velocity w is velocity induced by the wake ω is the rotational speed of the rotor and r is the span wise position of this element the inflow velocity seen by the blade consists of inflow current velocity v c wave particle velocity v w and floater velocity v m 5 v i a 2 a 1 v c v w v m first the velocities in the earth fixed coordinate system are transferred to the coordinate system fixed to the floating body by a 1 then the velocities are rotated θ w about the axis of the rotor by a 2 v c v w and v m are given by the potential theory discussed below based on bemt the induced velocity is determined by momentum differences in flow before and after passing the rotor in view of the changes of the inflow caused by the incident waves the induced velocities on the blade section cannot instantly establish the new steady state conditions to describe the development of the induced wake field in the time domain the dynamic inflow model is introduced the simple model in which two first order differential equations govern the induced velocities is used in this study guo et al 2018a 6 w i n t τ 1 d w i n t d t w q s k τ 1 d w q s d t 7 w τ 2 d w d t w i n t where w is the induced velocity as shown in fig 2 w q s is the quasi static value w i n t is an intermediate value and τ 1 and τ 2 are two time constants given by hansen 2013 once the induced velocity is determined the resultant velocity and angle of attack can be determined the angle of attack at each blade element oscillates with the waves passing and blade rotating dynamic stall may occur as a result of the fluctuations of velocity over the rotor plane depending on the angle of attack then lift and drag are calculated by the b l stall model for each blade element accounting for the dynamic behaviour of the lift and drag coefficients under unsteady inflow conditions hansen et al 2004 for dynamic inflow condition induced by surface waves in the present experiments the reduced frequency is no more than 0 05 and the tsr of the rotor is about 5 6 note that the stall effects may be insufficient galloway et al 2014 guo et al 2018a given the effects of the number of blades and the 3d nature of the problem hub and tip loss corrections are applied the yaw correction for the skewed wake is omitted owing to the assumption that the floater motion is small 2 3 potential theory based on the potential flow theory the fluid velocity potential φ x y z t is governed by the laplace equation 8 2 φ x y z t 0 and could be further regarded as a linear combination of three parts 9 φ x y z t φ i φ r φ d where φ i φ r and φ d are the incident radiation and diffraction potentials respectively for incident potential φ i in which structure is ignored the boundary value problem can be solved by combining the boundary conditions the free surface sea bottom and radiation conditions faltinsen 1993 10 φ i ζ a g ω cosh k z cosh k h cos ω t k x α where ζ a is the amplitude of the incident wave g is the acceleration of gravity ω is wave frequency k is wave number α is the phase of the incident wave and h is

added mass and damping 18 h τ 1 2 π b ω i ω a ω e i ω t d ω where a ω and b ω are frequency dependent added mass and damping respectively 2 4 numerical solutions floater motion can be obtained by solving equation 17 in the time domain note that the hydrodynamic load on the rotor f r is related to the floater motion which means that an iterative method is needed in one time step to solve this equation considering coupling effects between the floater motion and the rotor dynamics with an emphasis on the motion induced responses of the turbine including load and power output we suggest a simplified method shown in fig 5 in which the mean rotor force f r is used as an applied load in calculating the floater motion then the obtained motion is transferred to the bemt model for blade load calculations it should be noted that as a simplified method the obtained rotor loads will not be used to re calculate the motion of the floating support structure the fully coupled numerical approach will be the authors future work to calculate floater motion the hydrodynamic coefficients in the frequency domain e g wave excitation force added mass and damping were calculated using wamit then the motion of the floater in the time domain with a given random sea state was solved by orcaflex manual orcaflex 2012 the unsteady bem model that we developed was utilised to calculate the dynamic load on the rotor with the obtained floater motion and pre defined surface waves note that the wave trains used in orcaflex and the bemt model are the same 3 a floating tidal turbine 3 1 floating platform the three column semi submersible platform sjtu ftt shown in fig 6 was developed by shanghai jiao tong university to support floating tidal turbines the platform draft is 8 m floater only and the displacement is 1 40 106kg the sjtu ftt semi consists of a main column connected with the underwater turbine and three offset columns that are connected to the main column through a series of small diameter braces and cross members the base of each offset column is a larger diameter cylinder called a base column with a diameter of 12 m and a height of 3 m at the top of the base column there is a 5 m diameter upper column the configuration of the sjtu ftt semi is listed in table 1 the mass including the ballast of the sjtu ftt semi is 1 15 106kg the mass calculation includes the hull rotor nacelle and ballast water weights the mass together with the vertical mooring loads balances the buoyancy of the platform table 2 shows the mass properties of the sjtu ftt semi 3 2 mooring system the sjtu ftt semi is moored with three sets of catenary moorings spread symmetrically about the centre of the platform each set of mooring lines consists of three equivalent catenary lines fig 7 illustrates the mooring layout and table 3 lists the mooring line properties the fairleads are located 1 m above the baseline on the base column the anchors are at the seabed with a depth of 75 each of the nine mooring lines has an unstretched length of 391 m a mass per length in air of 150 kgm 1 and an extensional stiffness of 7 00 106kn 3 3 tidal turbine a three bladed horizontal axis tidal turbine is installed on the floating platform the prototype tidal turbine was developed by shanghai jiao tong university with a rotor diameter of 20 m and a hub diameter of 2 5 m the general configuration of the turbine is listed in table 4 the blade sections were developed according to the naca 63 8xx profile with varying thickness and pre twists fig 8 presents the panel model used for the wamit calculation the hydrodynamic coefficients including added mass and potential damping are shown in figs 9 and 10 based on the hydrodynamic coefficients time domain simulation was performed in orcaflex to acquire a time series of the 6 dof motions of the floater the power and thrust coefficient curves of the used tidal turbine can be found in guo et al 2018a at the low speed region tsr 4 owing to the fixed pitch angle the rotor is dominated by the stall effects when the tsr is larger than 7 the turbulent wake state leads to a reduction of the power coefficient the optimal power coefficient can be obtained at a tsr of approximately 4 6 in this paper the rated rotation speed of the turbine is at 10 rpm tsr is 4 2 with the rated power of 1 12 mw and thrust of 800 kn 4 simulation domain and environmental conditions the hydrodynamic coefficients of the sjtu ftt semi including added mass potential damping and wave load transfer functions were calculated in wamit in the frequency domain the potential flow theory was utilised to solve the boundary value problem as introduced in section 2 the water depth was set at 75 m as in the time domain calculation in orcaflex fig 8 shows the panel model of the hull used in the wamit calculation for the time domain calculation the simulation domain is illustrated in fig 3 in this study the authors investigated the combined wave and support platform motion effects on the thrust and torque characteristics of a floating tidal turbine therefore the environment is kept simple to expel other factors that may interfere with the results the inflow is uniform along the depth and it is aligned with waves the inflow turbulence wave spreading and swells are not considered note that in reality tidal turbines suffer from a more complex sea environment and the dynamic loading on the blade may be much larger than the results presented in this study for instance large eddies may also give rise to unsteady loading in the wave energy band the dynamic loads related to other factors will be considered for future work random incident waves were modelled using a jonswap spectrum for different h s and t p values the jonswap spectrum is given as dnv dnvrp 2010 19 s ω α h s 2 ω 5 ω p 4 exp 1 25 ω ω p 4 γ exp ω ω p 2 2 τ 2 ω p 2 where γ is the peakedness parameter τ is the shape parameter τ 0 07 for ω ω p and τ 0 09 for ω ω p as suggested in dnv dnvrp 2010 h s is the significant wave height and ω p 2 π t p is the angular spectral peak frequency for each wave component the phase ε j is random and uniformly distributed in 0 2 π the amplitude a j is given as follows 20 a j 2 s ω j δ ω j the wave environments strongly depend on the site where the tidal turbine is placed in general for a site that is not far from the coast or the near islands the surface waves tend to have relatively long wave periods and small wave heights as listed in table 5 four sets of environmental conditions were considered in this numerical study ec 1 with aligned currents and waves was treated as a typical operational environment ec 2 to ec 4 were performed as sensitivity cases in which the current speed peak period t p and significant wave height h s were varied to investigate their effects on load and power output for each case in the time domain the simulation had a duration of 3 h with a time step of 0 2s to eliminate start up and transient effects the first 500s was removed for the dynamic analysis for each case three realisations with different random seeds random wave phase ε j for each wave component were run to reduce stochastic variations except for cases in which tsr was varied the rotor speed was kept at 10 rpm 5 results and discussions 5 1 dynamic loads on the tidal turbine response spectra of the blade loads including torque thrust and blade bending moments are shown in fig 11 we compared cases that only considered incident waves in which the floater was motionless or only considered prescribed floater motion wave effects on the inflow were omitted compared with the results from cases with or without prescribed floater motion the dynamic loads on a floating tidal turbine are much larger than those on a fixed turbine with the same environmental conditions studies of load responses for fixed turbines can be found in guo et al 2017a compared with wave only cases that have only one peak with the same peak frequency as the incident waves in fig 11 two peaks can be identified from the response spectra for cases with prescribed floater motion for convenience the two peaks shown in fig 11 are labelled as peak i and peak ii the frequencies of the two peaks are listed in table 6 peak i is at about 0 9 rad s and peak ii is at 1 28 rad s from fig 12 we know that the surge and pitch motion response peaks were around 1 25 rad s and 0 96 rad s respectively we believe that when floater motion was considered the two peaks in the load response spectra were induced by surge and pitch motion respectively to confirm this conclusion we tested cases with only one dof motion surge heave or pitch these torque and thrust response spectra are presented in fig 13 the response spectra of torque thrust and blade bending moments have almost the same shape therefore we discuss only the torque and thrust response spectra in the following from the results presented in fig 13 surge and pitch motion induced loads contributed the most to dynamic loads likely because the surge and pitch motion would significantly affect the axial inflow seen by the rotor for heave motions only in plane inflow velocity was affected which is of less importance similar results can be found in a study by wang et al 2017 who investigated dynamic loads on a tidal turbine with forced roll and surge motions they concluded that the fluctuating load on the rotor was mainly caused by axial motion not the in plane motion of the turbine note that the two peaks from the 6 and 1 dof cases were not the same the discrepancies in the peak frequency were about 10 and 5 for peak i and peak ii respectively we believe that this result was caused by coupling between pitch and surge motions in contrast as shown in fig 12 compared with the results from cases with only prescribed floater motion it is interesting that the effects from direct waves and floater motion on the blade loads may be cancelled out for peak i of the response spectra which is near the incident wave peak frequency in one wave period the direct wave particle velocity may have the same direction as the blade motion leading to smaller resultant velocity in the blade section compared with the scenario in which only the floater motion was considered in practice floater motion is mainly induced by incident waves which also impose direct effects on the inflow field at the rotor the results presented here indicate that these two effects i e direct wave effects on the inflow field and floater motion should both be considered to properly estimate the load of the floating tidal turbines cancellation effects should be related to the relative phase between the floater motion and waves at the rotor plane and therefore is strongly affected by the relative horizontal position of the rotor on the floater our sensitivity study on rotor position is described in the following subsection by performing a time domain simulation based on the bemt model nonlinear effects appeared that were related to the dynamic wake dynamic stall and second order wave effects in particular high frequency responses were clearly observed for blade bending moments the high frequency response peak was located at twice the peak frequency of incident waves the second order term was presented and discussed by guo et al 2017a for fixed tidal turbines for floating tidal turbines the second order term also increased significantly although the energy proportion of the second order term was still much smaller than that of the wave frequency component sum frequency effects may cause resonant elastic motion of the blade for a composite tidal turbine blade the first natural frequency was around 1 hz 2 hz guo et al 2017b therefore the natural frequency of the blade should be far from the second order sum frequency note that only first order wave velocity was considered in this study for quantitative prediction of high order responses both low and high frequency second order motion responses should be calculated another issue was the slow drift wave effect low frequency wave loads are calculated in the time domain of the floater using newman s approximation due to damping a large low frequency response peak can be observed in the surge response spectrum of the floater however at the corresponding frequency in the turbine s load response spectra the responses are limited compared to wave frequency responses see fig 11 because the energy proportion for drift motion was very small the low frequency floater motion had no effect on the blade loads note that the swells are not considered in the present study as they may give rise to slow drift loads rotational frequency responses for blade bending moments were not observed in our results because gravity and buoyancy forces were ignored in practice small imbalances between the gravity and buoyancy forces could induce periodic oscillations of the edge wise blade bending moments with rotation frequency leading to considerable undesirable fatigue turbulence may also induce a significant 1p loading which is beyond the scope of this study 5 2 power output figs 14 and 15 show the generator power output of the floating tidal turbines in this section the incident irregular waves have the same parameters with a significant wave height of 1 5 m and peak period of 6 0s the generated power curves are plotted with the current and rotational speeds as variables along the x axis in figs 14 and 15 respectively the blue dashed line shows the results obtained from constant inflow conditions without any waves the error bar indicates the standard deviation from the mean for the power generation as the current speed reaches 2 5 m s 1 the mean generator power reaches 1 mw since the rotation speed and blade pitch of the rotor are fixed in fig 14 if the current speed exceeds 2 5 m s 1 the generator power also increases in proportion to the current speed in reality power production was maintained at 1 mw by the blade pitch controller the mean values of the cases with irregular incident waves were exactly the same as the results from constant inflow conditions the passing waves mainly caused periodic oscillations in the load and power output as shown in the previous section though their mean value does not change from an energy perspective all wave induced forces were conservative the rotor did not absorb energy from passing surface waves this conclusion was confirmed by the previous towing experiments under regular wave conditions in this section all cases were exposed to jonswap waves with the same significant wave height and peak period the only differences were the inflow current velocity and rotational speed the standard deviation shown by the error bars in fig 14 became larger with increasing current speed in fig 15 the generated power was not sensitive to rotation speeds from 10 to 20 rpm however with increasing rotation speed the standard deviation also increased slower rotation of the rotor was helpful for reducing the wave induced oscillations in the power output similar power production results have been presented for fixed tidal turbines guo et al 2017a 5 3 rotor location sensitivity from the previous discussion we conclude that if the floater motion induced and wave particle velocities at the rotor plane are in phase these two effects may be cancelled out we can change the relative phase relation by changing the underwater turbine position for the horizontal x direction the thrust and torque response spectrum densities as a function of incident wave frequency with different values of r x are shown in fig 17 the horizontal position of the turbine as illustrated in fig 16 is defined as the horizontal distance between the central line of the floater and the rotor centre a positive value indicates a downstream position the rotor position significantly affected the load response spectra when the absolute value of r x increases peak i the red line in fig 17 which is believed to be caused by the rapid increase in pitch motion this is due to the increase in rotational radius r f s leading to large linear velocity at the blade section the phase relation between the waves and motion is less important however for peak ii the surge velocity at the blade section did not change when changing turbine horizontal position the height variation in response peak ii is believed to be caused by changes in relative phase relations the average length of the incident jonswap waves was about 23 5 m t z 4 31s which is the same as the distance moved in the x direction of the rotor for one load cycle indeed for some particular position peak ii can be effectively cancelled out however for the horizontal position of the rotor we did not find an optimal position to minimise the loads cancellation effects strongly depend on incident waves therefore we suggest that the rotor should be placed at a position close to the floater centre vertical position r z is defined as the vertical distance between the mean water level and the rotor centre for fixed tidal turbines wave induced loads can be effectively reduced by increasing the turbine s submergence guo et al 2018a because the wave influence is restricted within a region with a depth of half the wavelength for a floating tidal turbine the response spectra of the torque and thrust with different vertical positions are shown in fig 18 with greater submergence peak i significantly goes up while peak ii goes down slightly for peak i the larger distance between the floater and turbine centres leads to larger pitch induced velocity on the blade section for peak ii the larger submergence is helpful to reduce the direct wave loads on the rotor the reduction in peak ii is much smaller than the increase in peak i unlike the fixed turbine the floating tidal turbine should not have a large submergence when the turbine is near the free surface other issues become crucial such as the possibility of the blade tip leaving the water the interaction between the waves and wake and the nonlinear blade free surface interaction 5 4 sea state sensitivity in this section we describe the sensitivity studies carried out in different wave conditions with varying significant wave heights and peak periods h s was selected from 0 5 m to 3 0 m with a step of 0 5 m and t p had the following values 5s 5 5s 6 0s 6 5s and 7 0s the current velocity and rotation speed of the rotor were held at 2 5 m s 1 and 10 0 rpm respectively for the torque and thrust the dominant first order wave frequency response was proportional to the amplitude of the wave particle velocity fig 19 shows the standard deviation from the mean torque and thrust for wave states with different significant wave heights the peak period of the waves was kept at 6 0s for these cases the standard deviations of both torque and thrust are linearly related to the significant wave heights which can be regarded as the standard deviation of wave excitation in operational conditions indicating that the linear response is still dominant for fixed turbines similar results were presented in guo et al 2017a which found that the standard deviations of cyclic torque and thrust had linear relationships with the incident wave height although both waves and floater motion are considered in this study the induced loads are still linearly related to the incident waves the torque and thrust response spectra with different wave peak periods were also examined the incident wave spectra are shown in fig 20 the peak periods moved from 4 5s to 7 0s while the significant wave heights remained at 1 5 m the response spectra of the floater s surge and pitch motions are shown in fig 21 as the incident wave peak period increases from 4 5s to 7 0s pitch motions also significantly increase because the incident waves are moving to the natural period of the floater s pitch motions about 12s meanwhile the first peak with a frequency of 0 75 rad s increases and the second with a frequency of 1 2 rad s decreases in response to the surge spectrum as discussed above the load responses were dominated by floater motion induced contributions the response spectra of dynamic thrust and torque on the tidal turbine are shown in fig 22 peak i was caused by a dramatic increase in pitch motion as the incident wave frequency moves from 4 5s to 7 0s at the same time peak ii which was induced by surge motions decreases 6 conclusion the present study was carried out to investigate the combined wave and support platform motion effects on the thrust and torque characteristics of a floating tidal turbine in time domain some conclusions are summarized as follows the torque and thrust response spectra were dominated by floater motion induced contributions two response peaks can be identified due to surge and pitch motion of the floater respectively cancellation effects between the contributions from direct wave effects and floater motion on the dynamic responses were found due to the positioning of the tidal turbine within the floating support system the mean power production value with irregular incident waves mirrored the static results passing waves and floater motion only cause periodic oscillations in power output and did not change the mean value with faster rotor speeds or inflow current velocities the standard deviation of the power output would be larger strong sensitivity is shown for the location of the rotor due to the impact of the surge and the pitch motion and thus the ideal location would be close to the centre of the floater sensitivity studies in different wave conditions with varying significant wave height and peak period proved that the standard deviation from the mean torque and thrust values were linearly related to the significant wave heights note that in the present work the motions of the floater was calculated in advance and then it was used in bemt model for estimations of the loads on the rotor in the present study in reality the loads on the rotor and the floater motions affect each other for more accurate estimation of the dynamic responses of the floating tidal turbine system a coupled numerical method and experiments for the model floating tidal turbine system in a wave basin will be developed and carried out in the future another issue was the vortex induced motion of the three column platform which could be a problem for semi submersible especially where high currents are excepted the low frequency motion of the floater may also impose dynamic loads on the rotor which is beyond the scope of this paper acknowledgement this research is supported by the national natural science foundation

23158,this study aims to reveal the dynamic response and power output characteristics of a floating tidal turbine with prescribed motions in six degrees of freedom floater motions were calculated in the time domain based on linear potential theory both wave induced inflow fields and floater motions are considered in a modified blade element momentum theory model for rotor load simulation generator power production and loads on a reference tidal turbine system were investigated the torque and thrust response spectra are found to be dominated by floater motion induced contributions and two response peaks can be clearly identified a cancellation effect occurs between direct wave effects and floater motion induced loads and horizontal and vertical rotor positions can significantly affect the dynamic responses of the blade loads the rotor should be placed close to the floater centre to avoid large floater motion induced velocity on the blade section sensitivity studies are carried out with varying significant wave heights and peak periods these results may contribute to a general understanding of floater induced dynamic loads on floating tidal turbines in a random sea keywords floating tidal turbine dynamic response blade element momentum linear surface wave wave induced load 1 introduction the idea of generating power from ocean tides dates back to the 1950s elghali et al 2007 tidal current power has the advantages of being highly predictable having high energy density and producing limited environmental impacts adcock et al 2015 in the last 20 years tidal turbines especially the horizontal axis turbines have been developed for more than one or two generations nowadays most tidal turbines reach megawatt level power capacity with diameters from 10 m to 20 m the rotation speed of the turbine varies depending on the rated current speed and rotor diameter the tip speed ratio tsr of a typical horizontal axis tidal turbine is about 4 8 with the power coefficient of 0 3 0 4 liu et al 2011 ng et al 2013 zhou et al 2017 with tidal turbines being utilised in deep waters defined as being deeper than 70 m some floating tidal turbines are designed and tested tethys 2012 scotrenewables 2018 the major advantage of floating tidal turbines is that they can be easily maintained as all electrical equipment can be placed inside the floating structure and they can be easily accessed unlike the bottom fixed ones zhou et al 2017 another consideration is that the tidal flow is stronger near the sea surface and therefore a floating tidal turbine can generate more energy compared to a bottom mounted one at the same site however the floater motion of floating turbines may induce large dynamic loads on the blade leading to unexpected structure failure tidal turbines suffer from harsh sea environments such as turbulent inflows free surface waves and floater motions although some studies have investigated unsteady loads the knowledge remains limited for wave loads on tidal turbines barltrop et al 2007 carried out experiments using a 400 mm diameter rotor in a towing tank with regular waves and a significant cyclic load variation was observed similar towing tests were reported by lust et al 2013 luznik et al 2013 both studies confirmed that the average power and thrust were unaffected by the passing waves galloway et al 2014 investigated wave effects on an 800 mm 3 bladed horizontal axis tidal turbine device being towed at 0 9 m s 1 in regular waves they also found that the presence of waves did not affect the time averaged torque and thrust but imposed fluctuating loads for motion induced loads on turbines milne et al 2015 presented experiments to measure unsteady bending moments at the blade root for a scaled tidal turbine subjected to planar forcing in a towing tank and found that the unsteady blade loads increased with frequency and exceeded steady loads by up to 15 the problem of unsteady loads on tidal turbines shares many features with that for wind turbines several numerical tools have been developed to estimate the loads and power output of tidal turbines the blade element moment theory bemt introduced by glauert 1935 is widely used to estimate the loads on a rotor batten et al 2008 investigated the loads on tidal turbines and developed the bemt model to effectively predict steady thrust and torque to predict the dynamic behaviour of time fluctuating loads on tidal turbines faudot and dahlhaug 2012 used a quasi static bemt model to predict wave loads on the blades in which the surface wave effect as a first order approximation simply acts as an addition to a uniform stream velocity from the linear wave theory galloway et al 2014 further developed a modified bemt code using a boeing vertol dynamic stall model and pitt peters dynamic inflow model which had been validated by experimental observations to include more physics and fewer empirical parameters the lifting line method epps and kimball 2013 boundary element method young et al 2010 and even full navier stokes ns equations tatum et al 2016 wang et al 2017 can replace the bemt model recently numerical studies have been carried out using direct computational fluid dynamics cfd to investigate the performance of horizontal and vertical axis tidal turbines with 1 or 2 degree of freedom dof motions zhang et al 2015 sheng et al 2016 wang et al 2017 wang et al 2017 found that fluctuating loads on the rotor are mainly caused by axial motion outside the in plane motion of the turbine in which blade loads were studied under surge and roll coupled floater motions from a general point of view the first order dynamic wave load on the turbines blade consists of 1 the dynamic variation of the lift and drag forces due to the inflow fluctuation 2 direct wave excitation forces on the blade 3 added mass effects due to the motion of the blade and 4 dynamic stall effects the added mass effect is a result of the rotor blade motion which is proportional to the blade cross section acceleration due to rotation motion of the blade for rapid changes inflow the dynamic inflow model is introduced to simulate the scenario in which the global flow field cannot respond quickly to establish steady state conditions additionally the dynamic stall deals with the development of the boundary layer on the blade section due to rapid changes of the angle of attack the unsteadiness of the loads on the blade section depends on not only the sea environments such as current velocity inflow turbulence waves and so on but also the operating conditions of the turbine if the turbine was operating at near maximum power then it could be expected that the flow could separate leading to large dynamic loads the reduced frequency k π f c v is used to describe the inflow unsteadiness where f is the frequency of inflow c is the chord of the blade section at 0 75 r and v is the inflow velocity in galloway et al 2014 the dynamic stall were suggested to be excluded in the presented cases with the corresponding reduced frequency of 0 03 milne et al 2015 concluded that the effects of unsteadiness on the loading were inherently small at these relatively low frequencies guo et al 2018a developed an unsteady bemt model that includes added mass effects wave excitation force and rotor dynamics to investigate first order wave loads on tidal turbines this numerical model was validated by guo et al 2017b in which experiments were carried out with an 800 mm diameter rotor exposed to a series of regular waves with different periods and wave heights in a towing tank the prototype tidal turbine used in guo et al 2018a is a 1 mw 20 m diameter horizontal axis turbine with a rated rotation speed of 10 rpm the results showed that for unsteady loads induced by normal ocean waves with a period from 5s to 15s added mass effects and direct wave loads on the blade morison forces can be neglected owing to the small reduced frequency o 0 01 in addition the tip speed ratio tsr of the turbine under the operation condition is about 5 6 which means that the phenomenon of stall was not expected to occur for rigidly mounted tidal turbines the transfer functions have been developed between the rotor loads including thrust torque and blade bending moments and the incident waves and a quasi static formula was derived for wave induced load estimation guo et al 2017a further investigated random wave loads on a tidal turbine and found that responses were dominated by first order contributions which can be fully described by the first order transfer functions meanwhile the response spectra of the flap wise and edge wise blade bending moments show that both low and high frequency responses were excited guo et al 2018b presented a study on the dynamic responses of a floating tidal turbine system with prescribed 6 dof motion using a frequency domain approach in which both floater motion and wave effects on the inflow field were considered floater motion was found to induce loads that dominate the dynamic responses compared with the contributions from direct wave effects on the inflow several previous papers have studied wave effects on tidal turbines faudot and dahlhaug 2012 galloway et al 2014 guo et al 2018a and others have investigated dynamic load behaviour with prescribed floater motions zhang et al 2015 sheng et al 2016 wang et al 2017 guo et al 2018b however in reality floater motion is normally induced by waves which also directly affect the inflow considering the above we carried out this study to investigate the effects of wave induced floater motion on the dynamic responses of a tidal turbine in the time domain both direct wave effects on the inflow field and wave induced floater motion were considered in the present numerical model generator power production thrust torque and blade bending moments were studied note that the linear responses could be obtained by directly multiplying the incident wave spectra and the linear transfer functions in the frequency domain guo et al 2017a in this study by performing the time domain simulation we can acquire more information including non linear effects related to the dynamic wake the dynamic stall the second order wave effects and so on the remainder of this paper is organised as follows a theory background is introduced and a simplified numerical approach proposed in section 2 a reference floating tidal turbine system sjtu ftt is briefly introduced including a floating hull tidal turbine and mooring system in section 3 finally the dynamic performance and responses of the tidal turbine are presented and discussed in detail sensitivity studies that considering different incident wave conditions are also presented this study contributes to the understanding of motion induced loads on floating tidal turbines 2 methodologies 2 1 coordinate systems it is essential to first clarify the coordinate systems used as shown in fig 1 three coordinate systems are involved 1 the global coordinate system 2 coordinates fixed to the floater and 3 the local blade section coordinate system the global coordinate system o xyz is located at the seabed with positive x values pointing downstream and the z axis pointing upwards the floater fixed coordinate system g x y z is located at the geometric centre of the floater waterline plane the origin of the local blade coordinate system is at the centre of the rotor and the z axis is always aligned with the rotating blade the angle between the blade and the upward z axis is defined as the azimuthal position of the blade θ w in the global coordinate system the instantaneous blade section position r b s t is given as 1 r b s t η t a 1 t r f r a 2 t r with 2 a 1 t 1 γ β γ 1 α β α 1 3 a 2 t cos θ w sin θ w 0 sin θ w cos θ w 0 0 0 1 where η t is the position vector of the floater r f r is the vector between centre of the floater and the centre of the turbine r r 0 0 is the span wise position of the blade section and a 1 and a 2 are the transfer matrices between the earth fixed coordinate system and the local blade coordinate system respectively as shown in fig 1 α β and γ are the roll pitch and yaw angles of the floater respectively here the floater motion is assumed to be small with α sin α the vectors e g inflow velocities in the global coordinate system are transferred into the local blade section coordinate using 4 v i a 2 a 1 v 0 2 2 blade element momentum theory bemt is widely used to predict the performance of tidal turbines under the assumption made by bemt flow passing the rotor is discretised into several annular elements with height d r the lateral boundary of these elements consists of streamlines which means that there is no span wise flow glauert 1935 crossing the boundary unlike propellers whose projected area ratio is quite large the chord of tidal turbines is normally much smaller than their radius therefore omitting span wise flow is reasonable for hydrodynamic calculations for tidal turbines batten et al 2006 2008 bahaj et al 2007 as has been proved by previous model validations the basic implementation and validation of the code used in the present work can be found in guo et al 2018a here we only briefly describe the overall code with emphasis on the modifications used to include floater motion in bemt the full flowchart of the numerical model can be found in fig 4 the velocities seen by each blade section are shown in fig 2 where v 0 is inflow velocity w is velocity induced by the wake ω is the rotational speed of the rotor and r is the span wise position of this element the inflow velocity seen by the blade consists of inflow current velocity v c wave particle velocity v w and floater velocity v m 5 v i a 2 a 1 v c v w v m first the velocities in the earth fixed coordinate system are transferred to the coordinate system fixed to the floating body by a 1 then the velocities are rotated θ w about the axis of the rotor by a 2 v c v w and v m are given by the potential theory discussed below based on bemt the induced velocity is determined by momentum differences in flow before and after passing the rotor in view of the changes of the inflow caused by the incident waves the induced velocities on the blade section cannot instantly establish the new steady state conditions to describe the development of the induced wake field in the time domain the dynamic inflow model is introduced the simple model in which two first order differential equations govern the induced velocities is used in this study guo et al 2018a 6 w i n t τ 1 d w i n t d t w q s k τ 1 d w q s d t 7 w τ 2 d w d t w i n t where w is the induced velocity as shown in fig 2 w q s is the quasi static value w i n t is an intermediate value and τ 1 and τ 2 are two time constants given by hansen 2013 once the induced velocity is determined the resultant velocity and angle of attack can be determined the angle of attack at each blade element oscillates with the waves passing and blade rotating dynamic stall may occur as a result of the fluctuations of velocity over the rotor plane depending on the angle of attack then lift and drag are calculated by the b l stall model for each blade element accounting for the dynamic behaviour of the lift and drag coefficients under unsteady inflow conditions hansen et al 2004 for dynamic inflow condition induced by surface waves in the present experiments the reduced frequency is no more than 0 05 and the tsr of the rotor is about 5 6 note that the stall effects may be insufficient galloway et al 2014 guo et al 2018a given the effects of the number of blades and the 3d nature of the problem hub and tip loss corrections are applied the yaw correction for the skewed wake is omitted owing to the assumption that the floater motion is small 2 3 potential theory based on the potential flow theory the fluid velocity potential φ x y z t is governed by the laplace equation 8 2 φ x y z t 0 and could be further regarded as a linear combination of three parts 9 φ x y z t φ i φ r φ d where φ i φ r and φ d are the incident radiation and diffraction potentials respectively for incident potential φ i in which structure is ignored the boundary value problem can be solved by combining the boundary conditions the free surface sea bottom and radiation conditions faltinsen 1993 10 φ i ζ a g ω cosh k z cosh k h cos ω t k x α where ζ a is the amplitude of the incident wave g is the acceleration of gravity ω is wave frequency k is wave number α is the phase of the incident wave and h is

added mass and damping 18 h τ 1 2 π b ω i ω a ω e i ω t d ω where a ω and b ω are frequency dependent added mass and damping respectively 2 4 numerical solutions floater motion can be obtained by solving equation 17 in the time domain note that the hydrodynamic load on the rotor f r is related to the floater motion which means that an iterative method is needed in one time step to solve this equation considering coupling effects between the floater motion and the rotor dynamics with an emphasis on the motion induced responses of the turbine including load and power output we suggest a simplified method shown in fig 5 in which the mean rotor force f r is used as an applied load in calculating the floater motion then the obtained motion is transferred to the bemt model for blade load calculations it should be noted that as a simplified method the obtained rotor loads will not be used to re calculate the motion of the floating support structure the fully coupled numerical approach will be the authors future work to calculate floater motion the hydrodynamic coefficients in the frequency domain e g wave excitation force added mass and damping were calculated using wamit then the motion of the floater in the time domain with a given random sea state was solved by orcaflex manual orcaflex 2012 the unsteady bem model that we developed was utilised to calculate the dynamic load on the rotor with the obtained floater motion and pre defined surface waves note that the wave trains used in orcaflex and the bemt model are the same 3 a floating tidal turbine 3 1 floating platform the three column semi submersible platform sjtu ftt shown in fig 6 was developed by shanghai jiao tong university to support floating tidal turbines the platform draft is 8 m floater only and the displacement is 1 40 106kg the sjtu ftt semi consists of a main column connected with the underwater turbine and three offset columns that are connected to the main column through a series of small diameter braces and cross members the base of each offset column is a larger diameter cylinder called a base column with a diameter of 12 m and a height of 3 m at the top of the base column there is a 5 m diameter upper column the configuration of the sjtu ftt semi is listed in table 1 the mass including the ballast of the sjtu ftt semi is 1 15 106kg the mass calculation includes the hull rotor nacelle and ballast water weights the mass together with the vertical mooring loads balances the buoyancy of the platform table 2 shows the mass properties of the sjtu ftt semi 3 2 mooring system the sjtu ftt semi is moored with three sets of catenary moorings spread symmetrically about the centre of the platform each set of mooring lines consists of three equivalent catenary lines fig 7 illustrates the mooring layout and table 3 lists the mooring line properties the fairleads are located 1 m above the baseline on the base column the anchors are at the seabed with a depth of 75 each of the nine mooring lines has an unstretched length of 391 m a mass per length in air of 150 kgm 1 and an extensional stiffness of 7 00 106kn 3 3 tidal turbine a three bladed horizontal axis tidal turbine is installed on the floating platform the prototype tidal turbine was developed by shanghai jiao tong university with a rotor diameter of 20 m and a hub diameter of 2 5 m the general configuration of the turbine is listed in table 4 the blade sections were developed according to the naca 63 8xx profile with varying thickness and pre twists fig 8 presents the panel model used for the wamit calculation the hydrodynamic coefficients including added mass and potential damping are shown in figs 9 and 10 based on the hydrodynamic coefficients time domain simulation was performed in orcaflex to acquire a time series of the 6 dof motions of the floater the power and thrust coefficient curves of the used tidal turbine can be found in guo et al 2018a at the low speed region tsr 4 owing to the fixed pitch angle the rotor is dominated by the stall effects when the tsr is larger than 7 the turbulent wake state leads to a reduction of the power coefficient the optimal power coefficient can be obtained at a tsr of approximately 4 6 in this paper the rated rotation speed of the turbine is at 10 rpm tsr is 4 2 with the rated power of 1 12 mw and thrust of 800 kn 4 simulation domain and environmental conditions the hydrodynamic coefficients of the sjtu ftt semi including added mass potential damping and wave load transfer functions were calculated in wamit in the frequency domain the potential flow theory was utilised to solve the boundary value problem as introduced in section 2 the water depth was set at 75 m as in the time domain calculation in orcaflex fig 8 shows the panel model of the hull used in the wamit calculation for the time domain calculation the simulation domain is illustrated in fig 3 in this study the authors investigated the combined wave and support platform motion effects on the thrust and torque characteristics of a floating tidal turbine therefore the environment is kept simple to expel other factors that may interfere with the results the inflow is uniform along the depth and it is aligned with waves the inflow turbulence wave spreading and swells are not considered note that in reality tidal turbines suffer from a more complex sea environment and the dynamic loading on the blade may be much larger than the results presented in this study for instance large eddies may also give rise to unsteady loading in the wave energy band the dynamic loads related to other factors will be considered for future work random incident waves were modelled using a jonswap spectrum for different h s and t p values the jonswap spectrum is given as dnv dnvrp 2010 19 s ω α h s 2 ω 5 ω p 4 exp 1 25 ω ω p 4 γ exp ω ω p 2 2 τ 2 ω p 2 where γ is the peakedness parameter τ is the shape parameter τ 0 07 for ω ω p and τ 0 09 for ω ω p as suggested in dnv dnvrp 2010 h s is the significant wave height and ω p 2 π t p is the angular spectral peak frequency for each wave component the phase ε j is random and uniformly distributed in 0 2 π the amplitude a j is given as follows 20 a j 2 s ω j δ ω j the wave environments strongly depend on the site where the tidal turbine is placed in general for a site that is not far from the coast or the near islands the surface waves tend to have relatively long wave periods and small wave heights as listed in table 5 four sets of environmental conditions were considered in this numerical study ec 1 with aligned currents and waves was treated as a typical operational environment ec 2 to ec 4 were performed as sensitivity cases in which the current speed peak period t p and significant wave height h s were varied to investigate their effects on load and power output for each case in the time domain the simulation had a duration of 3 h with a time step of 0 2s to eliminate start up and transient effects the first 500s was removed for the dynamic analysis for each case three realisations with different random seeds random wave phase ε j for each wave component were run to reduce stochastic variations except for cases in which tsr was varied the rotor speed was kept at 10 rpm 5 results and discussions 5 1 dynamic loads on the tidal turbine response spectra of the blade loads including torque thrust and blade bending moments are shown in fig 11 we compared cases that only considered incident waves in which the floater was motionless or only considered prescribed floater motion wave effects on the inflow were omitted compared with the results from cases with or without prescribed floater motion the dynamic loads on a floating tidal turbine are much larger than those on a fixed turbine with the same environmental conditions studies of load responses for fixed turbines can be found in guo et al 2017a compared with wave only cases that have only one peak with the same peak frequency as the incident waves in fig 11 two peaks can be identified from the response spectra for cases with prescribed floater motion for convenience the two peaks shown in fig 11 are labelled as peak i and peak ii the frequencies of the two peaks are listed in table 6 peak i is at about 0 9 rad s and peak ii is at 1 28 rad s from fig 12 we know that the surge and pitch motion response peaks were around 1 25 rad s and 0 96 rad s respectively we believe that when floater motion was considered the two peaks in the load response spectra were induced by surge and pitch motion respectively to confirm this conclusion we tested cases with only one dof motion surge heave or pitch these torque and thrust response spectra are presented in fig 13 the response spectra of torque thrust and blade bending moments have almost the same shape therefore we discuss only the torque and thrust response spectra in the following from the results presented in fig 13 surge and pitch motion induced loads contributed the most to dynamic loads likely because the surge and pitch motion would significantly affect the axial inflow seen by the rotor for heave motions only in plane inflow velocity was affected which is of less importance similar results can be found in a study by wang et al 2017 who investigated dynamic loads on a tidal turbine with forced roll and surge motions they concluded that the fluctuating load on the rotor was mainly caused by axial motion not the in plane motion of the turbine note that the two peaks from the 6 and 1 dof cases were not the same the discrepancies in the peak frequency were about 10 and 5 for peak i and peak ii respectively we believe that this result was caused by coupling between pitch and surge motions in contrast as shown in fig 12 compared with the results from cases with only prescribed floater motion it is interesting that the effects from direct waves and floater motion on the blade loads may be cancelled out for peak i of the response spectra which is near the incident wave peak frequency in one wave period the direct wave particle velocity may have the same direction as the blade motion leading to smaller resultant velocity in the blade section compared with the scenario in which only the floater motion was considered in practice floater motion is mainly induced by incident waves which also impose direct effects on the inflow field at the rotor the results presented here indicate that these two effects i e direct wave effects on the inflow field and floater motion should both be considered to properly estimate the load of the floating tidal turbines cancellation effects should be related to the relative phase between the floater motion and waves at the rotor plane and therefore is strongly affected by the relative horizontal position of the rotor on the floater our sensitivity study on rotor position is described in the following subsection by performing a time domain simulation based on the bemt model nonlinear effects appeared that were related to the dynamic wake dynamic stall and second order wave effects in particular high frequency responses were clearly observed for blade bending moments the high frequency response peak was located at twice the peak frequency of incident waves the second order term was presented and discussed by guo et al 2017a for fixed tidal turbines for floating tidal turbines the second order term also increased significantly although the energy proportion of the second order term was still much smaller than that of the wave frequency component sum frequency effects may cause resonant elastic motion of the blade for a composite tidal turbine blade the first natural frequency was around 1 hz 2 hz guo et al 2017b therefore the natural frequency of the blade should be far from the second order sum frequency note that only first order wave velocity was considered in this study for quantitative prediction of high order responses both low and high frequency second order motion responses should be calculated another issue was the slow drift wave effect low frequency wave loads are calculated in the time domain of the floater using newman s approximation due to damping a large low frequency response peak can be observed in the surge response spectrum of the floater however at the corresponding frequency in the turbine s load response spectra the responses are limited compared to wave frequency responses see fig 11 because the energy proportion for drift motion was very small the low frequency floater motion had no effect on the blade loads note that the swells are not considered in the present study as they may give rise to slow drift loads rotational frequency responses for blade bending moments were not observed in our results because gravity and buoyancy forces were ignored in practice small imbalances between the gravity and buoyancy forces could induce periodic oscillations of the edge wise blade bending moments with rotation frequency leading to considerable undesirable fatigue turbulence may also induce a significant 1p loading which is beyond the scope of this study 5 2 power output figs 14 and 15 show the generator power output of the floating tidal turbines in this section the incident irregular waves have the same parameters with a significant wave height of 1 5 m and peak period of 6 0s the generated power curves are plotted with the current and rotational speeds as variables along the x axis in figs 14 and 15 respectively the blue dashed line shows the results obtained from constant inflow conditions without any waves the error bar indicates the standard deviation from the mean for the power generation as the current speed reaches 2 5 m s 1 the mean generator power reaches 1 mw since the rotation speed and blade pitch of the rotor are fixed in fig 14 if the current speed exceeds 2 5 m s 1 the generator power also increases in proportion to the current speed in reality power production was maintained at 1 mw by the blade pitch controller the mean values of the cases with irregular incident waves were exactly the same as the results from constant inflow conditions the passing waves mainly caused periodic oscillations in the load and power output as shown in the previous section though their mean value does not change from an energy perspective all wave induced forces were conservative the rotor did not absorb energy from passing surface waves this conclusion was confirmed by the previous towing experiments under regular wave conditions in this section all cases were exposed to jonswap waves with the same significant wave height and peak period the only differences were the inflow current velocity and rotational speed the standard deviation shown by the error bars in fig 14 became larger with increasing current speed in fig 15 the generated power was not sensitive to rotation speeds from 10 to 20 rpm however with increasing rotation speed the standard deviation also increased slower rotation of the rotor was helpful for reducing the wave induced oscillations in the power output similar power production results have been presented for fixed tidal turbines guo et al 2017a 5 3 rotor location sensitivity from the previous discussion we conclude that if the floater motion induced and wave particle velocities at the rotor plane are in phase these two effects may be cancelled out we can change the relative phase relation by changing the underwater turbine position for the horizontal x direction the thrust and torque response spectrum densities as a function of incident wave frequency with different values of r x are shown in fig 17 the horizontal position of the turbine as illustrated in fig 16 is defined as the horizontal distance between the central line of the floater and the rotor centre a positive value indicates a downstream position the rotor position significantly affected the load response spectra when the absolute value of r x increases peak i the red line in fig 17 which is believed to be caused by the rapid increase in pitch motion this is due to the increase in rotational radius r f s leading to large linear velocity at the blade section the phase relation between the waves and motion is less important however for peak ii the surge velocity at the blade section did not change when changing turbine horizontal position the height variation in response peak ii is believed to be caused by changes in relative phase relations the average length of the incident jonswap waves was about 23 5 m t z 4 31s which is the same as the distance moved in the x direction of the rotor for one load cycle indeed for some particular position peak ii can be effectively cancelled out however for the horizontal position of the rotor we did not find an optimal position to minimise the loads cancellation effects strongly depend on incident waves therefore we suggest that the rotor should be placed at a position close to the floater centre vertical position r z is defined as the vertical distance between the mean water level and the rotor centre for fixed tidal turbines wave induced loads can be effectively reduced by increasing the turbine s submergence guo et al 2018a because the wave influence is restricted within a region with a depth of half the wavelength for a floating tidal turbine the response spectra of the torque and thrust with different vertical positions are shown in fig 18 with greater submergence peak i significantly goes up while peak ii goes down slightly for peak i the larger distance between the floater and turbine centres leads to larger pitch induced velocity on the blade section for peak ii the larger submergence is helpful to reduce the direct wave loads on the rotor the reduction in peak ii is much smaller than the increase in peak i unlike the fixed turbine the floating tidal turbine should not have a large submergence when the turbine is near the free surface other issues become crucial such as the possibility of the blade tip leaving the water the interaction between the waves and wake and the nonlinear blade free surface interaction 5 4 sea state sensitivity in this section we describe the sensitivity studies carried out in different wave conditions with varying significant wave heights and peak periods h s was selected from 0 5 m to 3 0 m with a step of 0 5 m and t p had the following values 5s 5 5s 6 0s 6 5s and 7 0s the current velocity and rotation speed of the rotor were held at 2 5 m s 1 and 10 0 rpm respectively for the torque and thrust the dominant first order wave frequency response was proportional to the amplitude of the wave particle velocity fig 19 shows the standard deviation from the mean torque and thrust for wave states with different significant wave heights the peak period of the waves was kept at 6 0s for these cases the standard deviations of both torque and thrust are linearly related to the significant wave heights which can be regarded as the standard deviation of wave excitation in operational conditions indicating that the linear response is still dominant for fixed turbines similar results were presented in guo et al 2017a which found that the standard deviations of cyclic torque and thrust had linear relationships with the incident wave height although both waves and floater motion are considered in this study the induced loads are still linearly related to the incident waves the torque and thrust response spectra with different wave peak periods were also examined the incident wave spectra are shown in fig 20 the peak periods moved from 4 5s to 7 0s while the significant wave heights remained at 1 5 m the response spectra of the floater s surge and pitch motions are shown in fig 21 as the incident wave peak period increases from 4 5s to 7 0s pitch motions also significantly increase because the incident waves are moving to the natural period of the floater s pitch motions about 12s meanwhile the first peak with a frequency of 0 75 rad s increases and the second with a frequency of 1 2 rad s decreases in response to the surge spectrum as discussed above the load responses were dominated by floater motion induced contributions the response spectra of dynamic thrust and torque on the tidal turbine are shown in fig 22 peak i was caused by a dramatic increase in pitch motion as the incident wave frequency moves from 4 5s to 7 0s at the same time peak ii which was induced by surge motions decreases 6 conclusion the present study was carried out to investigate the combined wave and support platform motion effects on the thrust and torque characteristics of a floating tidal turbine in time domain some conclusions are summarized as follows the torque and thrust response spectra were dominated by floater motion induced contributions two response peaks can be identified due to surge and pitch motion of the floater respectively cancellation effects between the contributions from direct wave effects and floater motion on the dynamic responses were found due to the positioning of the tidal turbine within the floating support system the mean power production value with irregular incident waves mirrored the static results passing waves and floater motion only cause periodic oscillations in power output and did not change the mean value with faster rotor speeds or inflow current velocities the standard deviation of the power output would be larger strong sensitivity is shown for the location of the rotor due to the impact of the surge and the pitch motion and thus the ideal location would be close to the centre of the floater sensitivity studies in different wave conditions with varying significant wave height and peak period proved that the standard deviation from the mean torque and thrust values were linearly related to the significant wave heights note that in the present work the motions of the floater was calculated in advance and then it was used in bemt model for estimations of the loads on the rotor in the present study in reality the loads on the rotor and the floater motions affect each other for more accurate estimation of the dynamic responses of the floating tidal turbine system a coupled numerical method and experiments for the model floating tidal turbine system in a wave basin will be developed and carried out in the future another issue was the vortex induced motion of the three column platform which could be a problem for semi submersible especially where high currents are excepted the low frequency motion of the floater may also impose dynamic loads on the rotor which is beyond the scope of this paper acknowledgement this research is supported by the national natural science foundation

23159,a high resolution swan wind wave hindcast model was implemented for the sea of marmara for this we focused firstly on the quality of two data sources for the wind forcing viz the era interim winds from the ecmwf and cfsr winds from the noaa ncep these were compared against wind measurements for 2013 collected at the silivri offshore buoy in the north of the sea of marmara a sensitivity analysis was performed to find the optimal numerical settings and wind source this analysis showed that the cfsr winds are most suited for wave modeling in the sea of marmara as the sea of marmara can practically be considered as deep water we calibrated the swan model for different combinations of wind input and whitecapping source terms the calibration was performed by varying the whitecapping coefficient for different combinations the model setting giving the lowest errors and highest correlation via sensitivity analysis was determined as the calibrated model thirdly the calibrated model was validated against measurements at the silivri buoy for the years 2014 2015 and 2016 this validation confirmed that the calibrated swan model with cfsr wind forcing performed better than the default settings lastly the performance of the calibrated swan model was assessed for different wave height ranges wind sources annually and per season their directional properties using wind and wave roses their distribution function and quantile quantile plots along with extreme waves the calibrated model offers almost the same extreme waves with different recurrent periods as the measurements keywords wave modeling whitecapping era interim cfsr swan the sea of marmara 1 introduction determination of wind induced wave conditions is important in coastal areas in view of their economic societal and marine activities the modeling of wind waves in enclosed seas like the sea of marmara is a difficult process because of the proximity of boundaries varying upwind fetch restrictions and the large number of influencing parameters ardhuin and roland 2013 indicates that the primary input that affects the model s accuracy in an enclosed water body is wind forcing and the secondary factor is parameterization of the physical processes i e the source terms therefore the focus in this study concerns the wind forcing and the physical processes since waves are generated by surface winds the winds are easily affected by the orography of the surrounding environment any change in the wind input will therefore influence the computational results ponce de león and orfila 2013 komen et al 1994 for these reasons in this study performances of two wind fields cfsr and era interim with different temporal and spatial resolutions were assessed following van vledder and akpinar 2015 hereafter a sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the impact of using different wind data sources on model performance in combination with finding the optimal physical and numerical settings of the swan model the wind and wave climate of the sea of marmara has been studied by various authors özhan and abdalla 1999 produced a wind and wave atlas covering all the turkish coasts using ecmwf the european centre for medium range weather forecasts wind fields and tsms turkish state meteorological service s synoptic maps they reported that data obtained from the ecmwf wind fields is good enough for use in wind and wave climate calculations for large water bodies such as the mediterranean and the black sea on the other hand they realized that the ecmwf wind fields give poor results in small water bodies such as the sea of marmara as the spatial resolution is insufficient to represent effect of sudden changes in land sea roughness orography and sea breeze effects examples of such effects are presented by e g ponce de león and orfila 2013 in order to resolve this challenge a new wind model was developed by erkal 1997 taking into account the conditions of the sea of marmara the model was later revised by özhan et al 1998 who brought it to a more practical state in the wave calculations made for the black sea and the mediterranean the dimensions of the grids constituting to a rectangular grid were 0 3 longitude and 0 25 latitude the time step was set to 15 min and the calculated sea state parameters were accumulated at 3 h intervals in the sea of marmara the spatial resolution rectangular dimensions was chosen as 0 12 longitude and 0 09 latitude approximately 10 km 10 km the time step was set to 5 min and the sea state parameters were stored at 1 h intervals due to the lack of available wave measurements no calibration or verification was done for their wave model results özhan et al 1998 they gave annual and seasonal roses of observed wave heights and surface wind velocities for each point determined in the sea areas studied in addition significant wave height and mean wave period relationships long term extreme values of wind and waves and monthly maximum wind and wave distributions were presented saraçoğlu 2011 obtained the wind and deep sea wave climate for the black sea and the sea of marmara using the 3rd generation wave model mike 21 sw era reanalysis data by ecmwf was used as the wind input in the model using this wind data modeling was performed for both seas for the calibration of the models gelendzhik hopa sinop filyos and karaburun buoy data were used on the black sea coasts and only wave parameters obtained from the ambarlı measurement station for a short two month time period were used on the coast of the sea of marmara following the calibration operations for both seas model simulations were carried out for a period of 12 years 1996 2008 for some stations determined by model results wave roses graphs of relation between mean wave period and significant wave height cumulative probability plots of exceedance distribution and deep sea maximum wave height statistics were obtained these results were presented comparatively with the wind and deep sea wave atlas for the turkish coasts özhan and abdalla 1999 saraçoğlu 2011 concluded that his results for the black sea are agreeable with those of özhan and abdalla 1999 but the results for the sea of marmara are not sufficiently agreeable with those of özhan and abdalla 1999 using mike 21 a 3rd generation spectral wave model abdollahzadehmoradi et al 2014 estimated the potential of wave energy that the sea of marmara possesses the model was run with ecmwf wind input and its calibration was carried out based on two months of measurements from ambarlı station they also compared their results with those of saraçoğlu 2011 they claimed that their work had improvements compared to the previous work performed by saraçoğlu 2011 in a sense that they created a new and finer computational mesh and also they were able to predict wave characteristics for 2012 they claimed that overall the previous model was outperformed by their new model it is seen however that they did not compare model performances based on any statistical error indicators it cannot therefore be concluded that the model of abdollahzadehmoradi et al 2014 is superior to the previous study by saraçoğlu 2011 to this day there are only three studies available on wind wave modeling in the sea of marmara these have however been carried out using wave measurements that are too short about 2 months for consistent model development calibration or validation özhan and abdalla 1999 saraçoğlu 2011 abdollahzadehmoradi et al 2014 to improve on this situation we use a much longer period of four years of wind and wave measurements to implement an accurate swan wave model for the sea of marmara a key element of this development is choosing the best model wind field data source for driving the wave model innovative components of our study are the use of cfsr wind data and the use of measured wave data for calibration and validation purposes preliminary results were presented in kutupoğlu et al 2016 and now we present more comprehensive results of the setup calibration and validation of an accurate swan wave model for the sea of marmara the structure of this paper is as follows the characteristics of our study area are presented in chapter 2 the materials used comprising of wind data the wind and wave measurement data bathymetry of the study area the methodology to develop an accurate wave model for the sea of marmara a description of the swan model setup and the statistical techniques used to quantify model performance are presented in chapter 3 chapter 4 presents results of determining qualities of wind data sources the sensitivity analysis the model calibration and the validation of the calibrated model in concluding we summarize the important results obtained in this study on wave modeling of the sea of marmara and recommendations for future studies in chapter 5 2 the study area the marmara region including the sea of marmara forms a passage between the balkan peninsula and anatolia and connects europe and asia as a result of being on the edge of europe connecting the bosphorus and dardanelles straits as a passage from the black sea to the aegean sea and lying close to sea ports in the black and aegean seas this region is highly developed in industry commerce tourism and transportation located on its coasts are the cities of i̇zmit çanakkale yalova tekirdağ balıkesir as well as some of turkey s biggest cities istanbul kocaeli and bursa the marmara region is also the most industrialized region in turkey and one third of the country s industry is situated in this region sertel et al 2010 the study area and location of wind and wave measurement station considered in this study are presented on the bathymetry of the sea of marmara in fig 1 it is an inner sea of turkey lying between 40 41 25 north and 26 30 east as can be seen from this figure the sea of marmara is a relatively small and narrow basin with islands in which fetch limited conditions are dominant i e when the dimensionless fetch does not exceed 104 c f holthuijsen 2007 due to its small size the sea of marmara can also be prone to sudden changes in surface roughness at the land sea boundaries which can significantly affect wind speeds in the coastal areas it is approximately 240 km long and 70 km wide with a surface area of 11 500 km2 and its deepest point is 1270 m the northern part of the sea of marmara has a narrow continental shelf with a mean depth of about 70 m which increases in depth abruptly while the southern part has a relatively larger shelf with a mean depth of about 80 m these shelves are separated by trenches of 600 m in depth and there are three basins extending toward the ne sw direction çağatay et al 2000 these properties make the sea of marmara practically a deep water body from a wave point of view except for the shallow surf zone 3 materials and methods 3 1 data used it is generally accepted that the quality of the wind forcing is the most important parameter that affects the accuracy of estimates in wind wave modeling therefore we considered two wind data sources known for their relative good quality lower statistical error and higher correlation the era interim and cfsr wind data sets both data sources are of high temporal and spatial resolution covering turkey and belonging to ecmwf and noaa prediction centers respectively the era interim reanalysis wind database has wind fields with a 6 h temporal resolution covering a period from 1979 to present and a 0 75 spatial resolution these wind data were interpolated and retrieved on a 0 1 resolution both in latitude and longitude the wind fields are provided as the zonal and meridional wind components at a height of 10 m the cfsr version 1 of cfs re analysis data set is available from 1 january 1979 to 31 march 2011 version 2 of the cfsr data sets was put into operation in march 2011 and has been accessible from the cfsr database since april 2011 cfsr database for version 1 has data of 0 3 spatial resolution in both directions whereas data in the second version have a spatial resolution of 0 2 in both directions the temporal resolution of the wind data is 1 h in both versions detailed information can be found in saha et al 2010 2014 for the cfsr winds and dee et al 2011 for the era interim winds wind measurements from silivri buoy station named odas 01tr which is owned by tpao turkish petroleum corporation were used to analyze the quality of wind fields in cfsr and era interim data sets the silivri buoy is a seawatch midi 185 buoy equipped with a wind sensor at a height of 2 m wind data collected at this sensor were converted to u10 wind speed using the generally accepted hellman exponential law u 10 u z 10 z 1 7 with z 2 m the temporal resolution of the wind speeds is 1 min and the temporal resolution of the wave heights is 30 min the station is located at 41 043889 n and 28 186944 e 3 km offshore in istanbul s town of silivri and at a water depth of 50 m it can be seen in fig 1 that the buoy is located close to shore unfortunately we have no long term measurements yet in more open water or any other location over the sea of marmara which would enhance the quality of our model implementation in our study we used wind and wave data from 2013 for the setup and calibration of our wave model data from the years 2014 2015 and 2016 were used for the validation wind and wave statistics for the measurement data are presented in table 1 for the wind different wind speed properties were determined from the 1 min and 3 min gusts to the sustained 1 h average wind of which the latter were used for the comparison against the 1 h model winds for this comparison the era wind speed components were interpolated to 1 h intervals as can be seen from the table for the calibration period the number of data points are 4560 and 479 996 for waves and winds respectively hm0 has a maximum value of 1 95 m with a mean of 0 33 m the maximum value of the 1 min wind speed is 16 35 m s down to 13 91 m s for the 1 h sustained wind speed the mean wind speed is 4 58 m s it can be seen in table 1 that in the validation period the measured data was taking into consideration for three years of 2014 2016 maximum hm0 values are observed as 2 27 m 2 93 m and 3 28 m for 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively mean hm0 ranges between 0 28 m and 0 41 m these differences in the statistics of hm0 illustrate the inherent seasonal variability for stormy months in 2014 data is missing while it is also missing in calm months for 2016 the bathymetry data was obtained from the gebco general bathymetric chart of the oceans between 40 2042 and 41 09587 n and 26 6958 29 9958 e gebco 2014 it is acquired with a spatial resolution of 0 008333 in both directions 3 2 methodology as surface wind is the primary factor driving any wind wave model we first analyzed the performance of two wind data sources viz the era interim wind fields from ecmwf and the cfsr winds from noaa ncep by comparing them against wind data measurements at the silivri wave buoy please see fig 1 located in the north of the sea of marmara these two data sources were selected in view of their easy availability and good performances as found in akpinar et al 2016 and van vledder and akpinar 2015 the quality assessment of these wind sources was done by investigating their accuracy for different wind speed ranges annually and per season their directional properties using wind roses and their distribution function hereafter a swan model schematization was constructed and a sensitivity analysis was carried out to find the optimal numerical and physical settings from the results of the sensitivity analysis the best performing combination of wave model settings and wind data source was selected model performance is quantified using statistical error indices of wind speed u10 and significant wave height hm0 and their directions unfortunately no wave period information was available in addition we consider the prediction of design wave heights using extreme value analysis in developing the high resolution wave hindcast model for the sea of marmara many choices needed to be made regarding the spatial and spectral resolutions numerical and physical settings therefore a sensitivity analysis was carried out to find the optimal spatial resolution and time step as well as assessing the relevance of different physical formulations and their adjustable parameters on model performance the best method to calibrate a wave model is to select a number of physical processes represented by source terms and their adjustable coefficients and apply an elaborate error minimization procedure instead of using such a time consuming procedure we followed a simpler approach in which we performed a number of model runs by varying their coefficients around their default settings and choose the one with the lowest rms error and highest correlation as the optimal setting it is seen from the literature that the most sensitive processes in deep water that significantly affect model performance are whitecapping dissipation followed by wind input moeini and etemad shahidi 2007 appendini et al 2013 akpınar and ponce de león 2016 akpınar et al 2016 as there are many source term formulations to choose from we selected five combinations of the most frequently used formulations for whitecapping dissipation and wind input as well as the two wind data sources for simplicity we did not consider other source terms like the quadruplet interactions in our calibration the calibration process consists of running the wave model repeatedly for a full hindcast over the year 2013 using the selected formulations wind data sources and different values for the adjustable coefficient values swan team 2016 followed by assessing the performance of hm0 based on all data of 2013 at the silivri buoy data the combination of source terms and coefficients giving the highest correlation and lowest error is determined as the best setting this best setting is considered the results of our calibration at last a validation analysis for the calibrated swan model is done for the remaining three years of data again with the cfsr winds 3 3 swan model description the wind wave modeling in the sea of marmara was carried out with the swan wave model version 41 01ab booij et al 1999 ris et al 1999 it is a third generation wave prediction model developed by delft university of technology descriptions of the model structure formulations and usage can be found in booij et al 1999 and the swan technical and user manuals swan team 2016 in view of the purpose of this study we restricted our detailed description only to the elements of the swan model relevant for setting up the model for the sea of marmara being the wind input and whitecapping source terms at the end of this section information is given about the other source terms and the basic numerical settings in our wave model setup we tested various formulations for exponential wind input and whitecapping dissipation the source term for wind input can be formulated as 1 s in σ θ a b e σ θ in which the term a expression is given by cavaleri and malanotte rizzoli 1981 for the wind input term b two formulations were considered the first one is derived from the wam cycle 3 model s early version wamdi group 1988 using the formulations of snyder et al 1981 but rescaled in terms of friction velocity u by komen et al 1984 the second expression for the b term is due to janssen 1989 1991a and used in wam cycle 4 model komen et al 1994 whitecapping formulations are based on a pulse based model hasselmann 1974 2 s d s w σ θ γ σ k k e σ θ where γ is a coefficient depending on steepness k is wave number and σ and k respectively represent a mean frequency and a mean wave number cf the wamdi group 1988 by closing the energy balance of the waves in fully developed conditions komen et al 1984 estimated the value of γ this means that this value relies on the used wind input formulation two values for γ are used in swan since two wind input expressions are used the first is as in wam cycle 3 due to komen et al 1984 and the second is based on janssen 1991a as in wam cycle 4 see janssen 1991b günther et al 1992 this coefficient has been adapted by günther et al 1992 based on janssen 1991a see also janssen 1991b as given by wamdi group 1988 3 γ γ k j c d s 1 δ δ k k s s p m the coefficients c ds δ and p are adjustable coefficients s is the total wave steepness s pm is the value of s in the spectrum of pierson moskowitz pierson and moskowitz 1964 s pm 3 02 10 3 the default values of the whitecapping coefficient cds in its formulation are defined as cds 4 5 for janssen and cds 2 36 10 5 for komen a number of alternative whitecapping expressions have been proposed to improve the accuracy of swan an alternative is proposed by van der westhuysen et al 2007 and van der westhuysen 2007 based on the whitecapping expression of alves and banner 2003 this adapted whitecapping expression is used together with a wind input term that is based on that of yan 1987 the default value of the whitecapping coefficient in this alternative is cds 5 10 5 for westhuysen for the other source terms we used the default formulations present in swan version 41 01ab these comprise the non linear four wave interactions snl4 which are approximated with the discrete interaction approximation of hasselmann et al 1985 using cnl4 3 107 and λ 0 25 for bottom friction sbot we use the jonswap formulation of hasselmann et al 1973 using cfric 0 038 m2 s 3 and for the non linear three interactions snl3 we use the lta method of eldeberky 1996 using trfac 0 10 cutfr 2 5 depth limited wave breaking is modelled using the bore based model of battjes and janssen 1978 using alpha 1 and gamma 0 73 the model was run in a non stationary mode with a time step of 30 min and with a maximum of 4 iterations per time step using the stopc convergence criterion requiring 99 of the active grid points to be converged it covered a computational domain the sea of marmara from 26 6958 to 29 9958 east and 40 2042 41 0942 north the domain was built on a regular rectangular grid consisting of 500 135 grid points with a grid resolution of 0 0066 in both directions equal to 0 73 km and 0 55 km the spectrum was discretized with a frequency range between 0 04 hz and 1 0 hz and 35 frequency bins logarithmically spaced and with 36 equally spaced directions in the sensitivity analysis section 4 2 1 we checked our choice of above settings 3 4 model performance evaluation criteria model performance is assessed using the following statistical error measures mean absolute error mae is the first parameter evaluated and it is calculated as below 4 m a e 1 n i 1 n y i x i where y i are hindcast values x i are measurement values and n is the number of data second parameter is the root mean square error rmse calculated as 5 r m s e 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 and the variables are the same as those of the previous error parameter the average difference bias is given by the equation below 6 b i a s y x where x and y are the averages of the measurements and hindcasts respectively except for three different error criteria scatter index si values were calculated using the following expression 7 s i r m s e x for all error indices above a value being nearest to zero presents better performance in comparison with other values the correlation coefficient r indicating the correspondence between measurement and hindcast data sets is calculated by the following formula 8 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 to quantify the performance of directions directional equivalents of the bias and rmse are defined as 9 m a e θ b i a s θ 1 n i 1 n δ i 10 r m s e θ 1 n i 1 n δ i 2 with δ the shortest distance between 2 directions θ 1 and θ 2 11 δ 180 180 θ 1 θ 2 note that for directional data linear regression lines have no meaning as they are not invariant to a directional shift the same argument is used to define the directional version of bias in terms of the mean absolute directional error 3 5 probability distribution functions and quantile quantile plots a closer look at the agreement between measured and simulated wind and wave data is by means of the probability distribution function and quantile quantile plots hereafter referred to as q q plots a q q plot displays a quantile quantile plot of the quantiles of the sample data x versus the quantiles of the sample data y q q plots compare two probability distributions by graphing their quantiles against each other if the two are similar the plotted values will roughly lie along the central diagonal if the two are linearly related values will again lie along a line though with different slope and possibly a different intercept various probability density functions are available to describe the wind speed frequency curve the most commonly used probability density functions for winds are weibull rayleigh and log normal functions rayleigh probability distribution function is also widely accepted in the literature for representing probability distribution of waves the details of these distributions can be found in appendix a 3 6 extreme value analysis the method to assess the similarity between the extreme values of the hindcast datasets obtained from the swan model and the measurement data set is described here with the help of extrapolation in extreme value analysis design values with different return period for longer than the present data period can be investigated extreme value analyses are generally determined using gumbel weibull and generalized pareto distributions neelamani et al 2007 muzathik et al 2011 in this study we selected the extreme value analyses obtained by using the gumbel distribution as recommended by liu and ma 1980 and persson and ryden 2010 in this study extreme value analysis was applied by taking into consideration the maximum values of each month for all data sets for 2013 as a result wave heights with different recurrence periods were estimated by applying gumbel distribution graphics to monthly maximum values the general formulation of the gumbel distribution is given below 12 g h e e h a c where g h gives the probability of non exceedance where a is the location parameter and c is the scale parameter the probability of exceedance is calculated by q h 1 g h equality q h is calculated by the following formula 13 q h i d 1 n d 2 where i represents the order of the data calculated from the data generated in decreasing order and n represents the total number of data in the gumbel distribution d1 0 44 and d2 0 12 neelamani et al 2007 the y axis represents the maximum value of each month in the gumbel distribution graph and the x axis represents the probability calculated by gumbel distribution probability values corresponding to the maximum values are marked on the distribution graph and the most appropriate line is based on least squares analysis from the determined points the upper line of the x axis gives the annual recurrence interval 4 results 4 1 analysis of wind sources 4 1 1 error analysis the error statistics of both re analyses wind data and 1 h sustained wind speed and direction measurements for 2013 are presented in table 2 as can be seen from this table in terms of bulk statistics the cfsr winds present a positive bias the era interim winds show lower estimates over the measurements wind directions are also estimated better by cfsr winds with a maeɵ value of 40 4 in comparison with the era interim winds with a maeɵ value of 49 3 a refinement into different wind speed intervals 0 4 m s 4 8 m s and 8 m s referred to as low moderate and high wind speeds is also presented in table 2 it is seen here that both wind data sources overpredict lower wind speeds whereas era interim predictions are slightly lower in relation to the cfsr winds high wind speeds u10 8 m s are much better predicted with cfsr winds giving a si of 20 compared to the 29 for era interim winds the results of this table show that the cfsr winds have the best agreement with the measurements this is confirmed on the basis of the scatter diagrams and time series comparisons presented in figs 2 and 3 the colour scheme in the scatter diagrams in fig 2 represents the log10 of the number of entries in a square box of 0 2 m s normalized with the log10 of the maximum number of entries in a box in this way the clustering of data points is highlighted each figure contains 2 lines the solid red line according to the model y cx and the line of perfect agreement is the dashed line the number of samples n and names of wind data sources are shown in the title and on the plot from these plots it is seen that the regression line obtained using the cfsr winds overlaps with the perfect fit line for the era interim there is a larger deviation between the lines in fig 3 a time series comparison for both winds against the measurements is presented for the year 2013 and a period of one month december 2013 where more peaks are observed and winds are much more variable in this time interval in comparison with other periods of this year these plots confirm that the cfsr winds also estimate better the peaks of the wind speed than the era interim winds all these findings confirm the results in table 2 4 1 2 wind roses in order to inspect the directional characteristics and dominant directions at silivri station annual and seasonal wind roses were generated here seasons are defined as three month periods where winter contains the months december january and february spring march april and may summer june july and august and autumn september october and november these roses are shown in fig 4 based on measured and simulated wind data at silivri location for the year 2013 percentages of wind speeds u10 3 m s representing the calm periods within the entire data for both measurement and hindcast datasets are given in table 3 the observed dominant wind direction displayed by all year roses left column is north east based on frequency of occurrence the location is exposed to a secondary direction to south westerly winds around the east of the sea of marmara there is south west to north east land elevation and thus it is surmised that this orographic feature directs the winds along this line this could be the cause that in this region north east is the dominant direction of the winds while south west is the secondary dominant direction here the maximum wind speeds in each direction sector coincide with those from the simulated cfsr winds the same applies for era interim winds which show a good match of dominant wind direction with the measurements except for the highest wind speeds per direction sector the patterns in the seasonal roses shown in four right columns in fig 4 show many similar characteristics significant exceptions occur for the south west sector in winter and spring where the era interim and cfsr winds overestimate the contribution of wind for summer the era interim winds exhibit a much broader north easterly sector for autumn both era interim and cfsr have a stronger north east component than the measurements and both data sources also overestimate the south westerly sector the seasonal roses clearly show a dominant wind sector from the north east and a secondary wind sector from the south west of which the latter is over estimated by the model winds considering all wind roses on the whole cfsr winds agree better in the dominant directional estimation relative to era interim winds which tend to underestimate wind speed consistent with this feature the percentages of calm periods are slightly higher than those of the cfsr winds 4 1 3 probability distributions and q q plots of wind speeds the agreement of the two wind data sources in terms of their wind speed with respect to those of the measurements is further analyzed by comparing their probability density functions pdf and q q plots as visualized in fig 5 together with the regression line y c x and the line of perfect agreement as can be seen from this figure era interim winds appear to better estimate winds that are lower than 2 m s whereas cfsr winds seem to have a lower probability in estimating the winds within the same range nevertheless era interim winds perform well in the speed range of 2 6 m s contrary to cfsr winds which have low probabilities in the same range regarding strong winds 6 m s cfsr winds give rather more precise estimations over era interim winds whose maximum value at this station is about 12 m s being rather low in comparison with that of the measurements besides it is seen from the q q plots that the cfsr winds have a similar distribution as the wind measurements cfsr winds against the measurements show closest results to both the regression line y c x and the line of perfect agreement 4 2 set up of wave model including results of sensitivity analysis 4 2 1 impact of numerical and physical settings on model performance the purpose of this section is to examine the sensitivity of numerical settings on model performance to find possible improvements in model setup in comparison with the recommended default settings described in section 3 3 we examined the impact of changing the computational grid resolution and computational time step on model performance this was achieved in sensitivity runs in which a full hindcast for the year 2013 was carried out and the predicted significant wave height hm0 at silivri station was compared against the observations for each sensitivity run one parameter setting was changed while keeping the other settings constant error statistics of hindcast results based on each setting against the measurements were determined and analyzed to detect alterations on model performance the spatial resolution of the computational grids was varied in 4 different ways such that both x and y directions were equal 0 0066 500 135 0 0044 750 203 0 0033 1000 270 and 1 km 275 103 no changes in model performance were detected therefore we decided that the spatial resolution of our swan model was set as 0 0066 as we consider this choice to be optimal in terms of computational requirements and achieved accuracy test computations indicated that a time step of 30 min with a maximum of 4 iterations per time step provided a good balance between computational requirements and accuracy we tested also effect of the directional resolution using different equally spaced directions but no improvement was obtained in comparison with the default setting therefore the recommended value of 36 in the swan manual was used to assess whether shallow water processes play a role we analyzed the spatial distributions of the magnitude of the physical processes as computed by swan cf van vledder et al 2016 for a severe wave condition in which we expect that shallow water effects might play a role it is the point of time in the storm of 23 may 2013 at 15 00 h characterized by a strong south westerly wind in the order of 12 m s the variation of the normalized source terms with m0 as in van vledder et al 2016 clearly shows that in deep water the processes of wind input whitecapping dissipation and non linear four wave interactions are dominant whitecapping and non linear four wave interactions are of equal magnitude the shallow water processes of bottom friction depth limited wave breaking and triad interactions are so weak and only noticeable at a thin strip along the edges of the sea of marmara based on these results the shallow water processes were deactivated in our further computations we realize that shallow water effects do occur close to the coast where waves will feel bottom effects the resolution of our spatial grid however is unable to resolve these effects 4 3 calibration the purpose of this section is to calibrate the swan model by finding the optimal combination of wind input source term whitecapping formulation and related coefficients and wind data source the optimal combination is to the one producing the best agreement with observations of significant wave height hm0 at silivri location for 2013 in terms of statistical error indices correlation si bias rmse mae and visual comparisons of derived data for this purpose five different combinations of source terms for wind induced wave growth and whitecapping formulations were selected all supplemented with the dia for the non linear four wave interactions 1 komen komen et al 1994 komen komen et al 1994 2 komen komen et al 1994 janssen janssen 1991a 1991b 3 janssen janssen 1991a 1991b janssen janssen 1991a 1991b 4 janssen janssen 1991a 1991b komen komen et al 1994 5 yan yan 1987 westhuysen van der westhuysen 2007 van der westhuysen et al 2007 for each combination the coefficients for the whitecapping dissipation were varied around their default settings followed by a model run for 2013 using both wind sources the predicted significant wave height data for each setting different cds were compared against the measured data at the silivri station for 2013 and error statistics were determined a multi criteria analysis was performed to select the best performing combination based on assessing various statistical error measures and visual plots with equal weight the error statistics of the settings using the cfsr winds are presented in table 4 not included here are the results for the models forced with the era interim winds and their performances are visualized by taylor diagrams taylor 2001 in fig 6 in the taylor diagrams each color represents results for unique combination of source terms and also stars and squares show the default setting and the best setting swan models respectively it is note that the best setting and default setting janssen komen and default setting janssen janssen combinations overlap in the taylor diagram the janssen komen combination has poor results because its value is too far from the points black circles representing the measurements it is also seen that the default setting models have lower standard deviation but the best setting models have a higher standard deviation than the one of the measurements scatter diagrams generated for cfsr run and era interim run swan models with the best settings for each source term combination are presented in fig 7 this figure shows that the straight line of the data from janssen janssen combination overlaps with the perfect fit line this implies that this combination is the best based on scatter plots however this combination has error statistics of rmse 0 17 m and si 52 however komen janssen cds 1 0 setting in combination with cfsr winds shows a lower error performance with rmse 0 16 m and si 48 this shows that the komen janssen cds 1 0 setting in combination with the cfsr winds has an improvement about 4 in wave height hindcasts in comparison with the janssen janssen combination therefore komen janssen cds 1 0 setting in combination with cfsr winds is determined to be the best combination for the swan model forced with the era interim winds the komen komen cds 0 5e 5 setting performs best based on these two settings the komen janssen combination driven by cfsr wind is considered as the calibrated swan model the effect of the calibration on model performance is summarized in fig 8 showing two scatter diagrams of measured and predicted significant wave height hm0 based on the cfsr based swan model runs for 2013 the left panel shows the results of the calibrated swan which input file is given in appendix b and the right panel the results of the default swan model this figure shows a slight improvement in agreement but still a large amount of scatter an overview of the error statistics for all wave heights combined and in 0 5 m wave height classes is given in table 5 from this table it follows that the calibration resulted in a slight improvement in model performance evidently the default swan model driven by cfsr wind was already relatively good as becomes clear from 1 improvement in scatter index for the era wind based simulations the scatter index reduced by 9 as the calibration compensated for the underestimation of wind speeds see section 4 1 table 5 also shows that the performance of both swan model setups decreases with increasing wave height 4 4 validation the calibrated swan model is validated by comparing the model results forced with the previously unused cfsr winds in years of 2014 2015 and 2016 and the silivri station significant wave height hm0 and mean direction dir measurements the results of the three one year model runs used for verification are evaluated separately and lumped together scatter diagrams of the measured and predicted significant wave heights using the calibrated and default swan models in different years are given in fig 9 the related error statistics are summarized in table 6 it is seen that the calibrated model compares well with the measurements in all years compared to the statistics shown in table 6 it shows that especially the bias error has been reduced while the model performs well throughout the year in only a few time instants the peak values are lower in the hindcast for all of the three years of validation scatter diagrams are presented in the first column of fig 9 for two different model settings similar findings were obtained for the default and best setting swan models forced with the era interim winds but not shown here as they show similar results scatter diagrams confirm that the calibrated swan model has a better model performance in comparison with the default settings swan model it has also a good relation between observed and modeled significant wave heights especially in 2015 fig 10a as the number of overlapping data points is low in 2016 fig 10b the relationship between measurements and model results is poorer than in other years the qualitative results from fig 9 are confirmed by the quantitative results in table 6 the mean value of the calibrated swan model in all years is slightly lower than the measurements again its error statistics are generally low in all years and there is also a good correlation between the wave height measurements and the hindcasts of about 0 75 0 84 fig 11 presents probability density plots of simulated hm0 values with the calibrated and default setting swan models forced with cfsr winds against that of the measurements at silivri station for 3 years from 2014 to 2016 as can be seen from this figure in all years the calibrated swan model has the best agreement with the measurements especially in terms of the peak values 4 5 climate results this section presents wave climate results of the calibrated swan model in comparison with the measurements and results obtained with the default settings swan model all driven by the cfsr winds first attention is given to the wave roses followed by an exposure of the distribution functions of significant wave height and finally of the ability to predict the extreme wave conditions 4 5 1 wave roses wave roses based on all data of 2013 as well as from different seasons are presented in fig 12 the upper row of roses is based on the wave measurement the middle row is based on the calibrated swan model whereas the lower row is based on the defaults settings swan model based on the wave roses of the measurements for all data it is seen that waves primarily come from a directional sector between south south west and east north east although there are many similarities between the roses of the simulations there are also some differences the measured easterly waves are predicted better by both swan models but the measured south easterly waves are captured less well by the swan models the default model hindcasts produces slightly lower wave heights than the calibrated model percentages of calm period waves hm0 0 5 m for all measurements and based on the calibrated and default setting swan model results for each season and all data of 2013 are presented in table 7 as can be seen from this table for the range hm0 0 5 m the default setting model presents a very high percentage of calms which is higher than 90 except for winter where it is 79 the results of the calibrated swan model possesses a very close ratio 82 to the measurements for the calm period waves the percentage of calm periods for all data is much more than predicted from the default setting swan models about 89 at all seasons except for summer the calibrated swan model has the closest percentages relative to those of the measurements in winter the dominant direction of the measured waves tends to be in the direction sector from east to south wave roses generated for the two models the calibrated and default setting show directions from a wider sector north east to south west and their dominant direction coincides with that of the measurements in summer the measured south easterly waves are not captured well by both models the measured waves come from a directional sector from east to south whereas the hindcasts present a much narrower sector from easterly directions in autumn easterly waves are predicted more by both swan models in comparison with those of measurements it is also observed from all these wave roses that the calibrated swan model results present more similar characteristics to those of the measurements in comparison with the default model results it is noted that this exposure presents more detail than can be inferred from a reduction of the scatter index by 1 4 5 2 probability distributions and q q plots of wave heights probability density functions and q q plots of simulated and measured significant wave heights are presented in fig 13 as seen from the probability distributions with the exception of the calibrated swan model the default setting model overestimated waves having heights less than 0 3 m and underestimated waves in the range 0 3 1 m a very good relation is witnessed between results of the calibrated swan model and the measurements this is the only model setting that was able to precisely capture the highest observed wave heights above 1 m the default setting model shows a strong underestimation for waves of the same height besides q q plots show that values for the default setting swan model lie closer along the red straight line showing that the distribution of its data are more aligned with those of the measurements than those of the calibrated swan model however it is also observed that the data values of the calibrated swan model and measurements roughly lie along the line of perfect agreement this means that the samples of the calibrated swan results and measurements come from a similar distribution 4 5 3 models ability in prediction of extreme waves in the following an analysis was executed to determine the ability of the calibrated and default setting swan models in estimating extreme events i e extreme design waves with different return periods this was done by acquiring maximum values of monthly significant wave heights for the year 2013 from both the simulations and the measurements the gumbel distribution graphical method was applied on these monthly maximum values to obtain statistical results of extreme values the results are summarized in table 8 and visualized in fig 14 according to this figure it is found that the calibrated swan model yields the closest results to those of the measurements whereas the default setting swan model predicts lower extreme waves for instance for a 100 year return period extreme wave height values are estimated to be around 3 m according to results of the calibrated swan model as well as the measurements the default setting swan model only shows an estimate of about 2 5 m 5 conclusions and recommendations in this study a high resolution and accurate swan wave hindcast model was implemented for the sea of marmara for this two recent re analysis wind data sets the era interim and the cfsr were used as forcings for the wave model their qualities were tested against silivri wind measurements in terms of both wind speed and direction then test runs on model settings were performed to find the optimal values for time step grid resolutions and the combination of source terms for wind input and whitecapping and the coefficient for whitecapping model performance was assessed against measurements of significant wave height hm0 and mean wave direction dir at the silivri buoy location based on the results of this study the following conclusions were obtained the best wind data source is the cfsr wind data base cfsr winds slightly overestimate wind speeds while era interim winds underestimate them wind speeds lower than 4 m s are better predicted by era interim re analysis in this study area for moderate winds between 4 m s and 8 m s the quality of both winds is almost the same cfsr winds show a much better performance giving si of 20 compared to the 29 by era interim for strong winds being greater than 8 m s the dominant wind directions observed in the measurements are matching with those of both era interim and cfsr winds there is also a good match between the measurements and cfsr winds in terms of directions of the highest wind speeds per direction sector but they are not catched by era interim the sea of marmara can practically be considered as deep water as the deep water processes of wind input whitecapping and quadruplet interactions are dominant and of equal magnitude the shallow water processes of bottom friction depth limited wave breaking and triad interactions are insignificant except along the shallow coastal zones the best performing or calibrated swan model setup comprises the komen for wind input janssen for whitecapping where cds 1 0 in combination with cfsr wind forcing in terms of significant wave height the calibration improved the bias by 5 cm whereas the scatter index improved by only 1 the calibration has most effect on low wave heights between 0 5 m and 1 m the calibrated swan model shows good agreement with the measurements in all years as demonstrated by the good agreement with measurements in terms of the directionally dependent high wind speeds the maximum wave height and the wave heights with high return periods for the sea of marmara it is recommended to use the calibrated swan model forced by cfsr winds for our future studies we plan to produce a new and online accessible wind and wave atlas for the sea of marmara using the model developed in this study we expect that wind products at a finer spatial resolution may improve the prediction of moderate winds and extreme weather events this may be provided by e g the wrf model a limitation of the present study is that we only could calibrate the model against hm0 at one deep water location it is therefore recommended to perform additional measurements involving not only more wave parameters but also at more exposed locations in the sea of marmara acknowledgements this work is based on the master thesis of the first author at uludağ university bursa turkey we would like to thank tsms turkish state meteorological service for its help in obtaining the necessary permissions for obtaining data from the ecmwf and the tpao anonym association of turkish petroleum and tsms for providing the measurements at silivri appendix a probability density functions of winds and waves the weibull distribution is very flexible and simple but also adapts well to field data the weibull distribution is the most commonly used and widely accepted distribution for wind data analysis akpınar and akpınar 2005 ucar and balo 2009 gülersoy and çetin 2010 akpınar 2013 for this reason a two parameter weibull probability density function is used for the analysis of wind speeds in this study in the most general case the weibull distribution function is expressed as a 1 f w v k c v c k 1 e v c k where f w v is the probability density of the wind speed k is the shape parameter and c is the scale parameter the scale parameter c of the weibull distribution also has a reference value in the wind data it is also expected that the k shape parameter is usually between 1 5 and 3 akpınar and akpınar 2004 kurban et al 2007 various analytical and empirical methods are used to obtain these parameters here the scale and shape parameters are determined according to the justus formula manwell et al 2002 mirhosseini et al 2011 akpınar 2013 a 2 k σ v o r t 1 086 a 3 c v o r t k 2 6674 0 184 0 816 k 2 73855 v o

weibull cumulative distribution function gives the probability that the wind speed is less than or equal to a certain value thus the cumulative distribution function f w v is expressed as the integral of the probability density function f w v fyrippis et al 2010 akpınar 2013 a 6 f w v 1 e v c k the fit of the significant wave heights produced by the swan hindcast model using different winds with the measured wave heights at the silivri station was assessed using the rayleigh probability distribution function accepted in the literature longuet higgins 1952 goda 1979 yüksek et al 2000 the rayleigh density function is given by the following relation a 7 f r v 2 v c 2 e v c 2 the cumulative probability function of the rayleigh distribution is a 8 f r v 1 e v c 2 the greatest advantage of this distribution is that the distribution can be determined only by the average significant wave height appendix b swan input file for the calibrated model image 
23159,a high resolution swan wind wave hindcast model was implemented for the sea of marmara for this we focused firstly on the quality of two data sources for the wind forcing viz the era interim winds from the ecmwf and cfsr winds from the noaa ncep these were compared against wind measurements for 2013 collected at the silivri offshore buoy in the north of the sea of marmara a sensitivity analysis was performed to find the optimal numerical settings and wind source this analysis showed that the cfsr winds are most suited for wave modeling in the sea of marmara as the sea of marmara can practically be considered as deep water we calibrated the swan model for different combinations of wind input and whitecapping source terms the calibration was performed by varying the whitecapping coefficient for different combinations the model setting giving the lowest errors and highest correlation via sensitivity analysis was determined as the calibrated model thirdly the calibrated model was validated against measurements at the silivri buoy for the years 2014 2015 and 2016 this validation confirmed that the calibrated swan model with cfsr wind forcing performed better than the default settings lastly the performance of the calibrated swan model was assessed for different wave height ranges wind sources annually and per season their directional properties using wind and wave roses their distribution function and quantile quantile plots along with extreme waves the calibrated model offers almost the same extreme waves with different recurrent periods as the measurements keywords wave modeling whitecapping era interim cfsr swan the sea of marmara 1 introduction determination of wind induced wave conditions is important in coastal areas in view of their economic societal and marine activities the modeling of wind waves in enclosed seas like the sea of marmara is a difficult process because of the proximity of boundaries varying upwind fetch restrictions and the large number of influencing parameters ardhuin and roland 2013 indicates that the primary input that affects the model s accuracy in an enclosed water body is wind forcing and the secondary factor is parameterization of the physical processes i e the source terms therefore the focus in this study concerns the wind forcing and the physical processes since waves are generated by surface winds the winds are easily affected by the orography of the surrounding environment any change in the wind input will therefore influence the computational results ponce de león and orfila 2013 komen et al 1994 for these reasons in this study performances of two wind fields cfsr and era interim with different temporal and spatial resolutions were assessed following van vledder and akpinar 2015 hereafter a sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the impact of using different wind data sources on model performance in combination with finding the optimal physical and numerical settings of the swan model the wind and wave climate of the sea of marmara has been studied by various authors özhan and abdalla 1999 produced a wind and wave atlas covering all the turkish coasts using ecmwf the european centre for medium range weather forecasts wind fields and tsms turkish state meteorological service s synoptic maps they reported that data obtained from the ecmwf wind fields is good enough for use in wind and wave climate calculations for large water bodies such as the mediterranean and the black sea on the other hand they realized that the ecmwf wind fields give poor results in small water bodies such as the sea of marmara as the spatial resolution is insufficient to represent effect of sudden changes in land sea roughness orography and sea breeze effects examples of such effects are presented by e g ponce de león and orfila 2013 in order to resolve this challenge a new wind model was developed by erkal 1997 taking into account the conditions of the sea of marmara the model was later revised by özhan et al 1998 who brought it to a more practical state in the wave calculations made for the black sea and the mediterranean the dimensions of the grids constituting to a rectangular grid were 0 3 longitude and 0 25 latitude the time step was set to 15 min and the calculated sea state parameters were accumulated at 3 h intervals in the sea of marmara the spatial resolution rectangular dimensions was chosen as 0 12 longitude and 0 09 latitude approximately 10 km 10 km the time step was set to 5 min and the sea state parameters were stored at 1 h intervals due to the lack of available wave measurements no calibration or verification was done for their wave model results özhan et al 1998 they gave annual and seasonal roses of observed wave heights and surface wind velocities for each point determined in the sea areas studied in addition significant wave height and mean wave period relationships long term extreme values of wind and waves and monthly maximum wind and wave distributions were presented saraçoğlu 2011 obtained the wind and deep sea wave climate for the black sea and the sea of marmara using the 3rd generation wave model mike 21 sw era reanalysis data by ecmwf was used as the wind input in the model using this wind data modeling was performed for both seas for the calibration of the models gelendzhik hopa sinop filyos and karaburun buoy data were used on the black sea coasts and only wave parameters obtained from the ambarlı measurement station for a short two month time period were used on the coast of the sea of marmara following the calibration operations for both seas model simulations were carried out for a period of 12 years 1996 2008 for some stations determined by model results wave roses graphs of relation between mean wave period and significant wave height cumulative probability plots of exceedance distribution and deep sea maximum wave height statistics were obtained these results were presented comparatively with the wind and deep sea wave atlas for the turkish coasts özhan and abdalla 1999 saraçoğlu 2011 concluded that his results for the black sea are agreeable with those of özhan and abdalla 1999 but the results for the sea of marmara are not sufficiently agreeable with those of özhan and abdalla 1999 using mike 21 a 3rd generation spectral wave model abdollahzadehmoradi et al 2014 estimated the potential of wave energy that the sea of marmara possesses the model was run with ecmwf wind input and its calibration was carried out based on two months of measurements from ambarlı station they also compared their results with those of saraçoğlu 2011 they claimed that their work had improvements compared to the previous work performed by saraçoğlu 2011 in a sense that they created a new and finer computational mesh and also they were able to predict wave characteristics for 2012 they claimed that overall the previous model was outperformed by their new model it is seen however that they did not compare model performances based on any statistical error indicators it cannot therefore be concluded that the model of abdollahzadehmoradi et al 2014 is superior to the previous study by saraçoğlu 2011 to this day there are only three studies available on wind wave modeling in the sea of marmara these have however been carried out using wave measurements that are too short about 2 months for consistent model development calibration or validation özhan and abdalla 1999 saraçoğlu 2011 abdollahzadehmoradi et al 2014 to improve on this situation we use a much longer period of four years of wind and wave measurements to implement an accurate swan wave model for the sea of marmara a key element of this development is choosing the best model wind field data source for driving the wave model innovative components of our study are the use of cfsr wind data and the use of measured wave data for calibration and validation purposes preliminary results were presented in kutupoğlu et al 2016 and now we present more comprehensive results of the setup calibration and validation of an accurate swan wave model for the sea of marmara the structure of this paper is as follows the characteristics of our study area are presented in chapter 2 the materials used comprising of wind data the wind and wave measurement data bathymetry of the study area the methodology to develop an accurate wave model for the sea of marmara a description of the swan model setup and the statistical techniques used to quantify model performance are presented in chapter 3 chapter 4 presents results of determining qualities of wind data sources the sensitivity analysis the model calibration and the validation of the calibrated model in concluding we summarize the important results obtained in this study on wave modeling of the sea of marmara and recommendations for future studies in chapter 5 2 the study area the marmara region including the sea of marmara forms a passage between the balkan peninsula and anatolia and connects europe and asia as a result of being on the edge of europe connecting the bosphorus and dardanelles straits as a passage from the black sea to the aegean sea and lying close to sea ports in the black and aegean seas this region is highly developed in industry commerce tourism and transportation located on its coasts are the cities of i̇zmit çanakkale yalova tekirdağ balıkesir as well as some of turkey s biggest cities istanbul kocaeli and bursa the marmara region is also the most industrialized region in turkey and one third of the country s industry is situated in this region sertel et al 2010 the study area and location of wind and wave measurement station considered in this study are presented on the bathymetry of the sea of marmara in fig 1 it is an inner sea of turkey lying between 40 41 25 north and 26 30 east as can be seen from this figure the sea of marmara is a relatively small and narrow basin with islands in which fetch limited conditions are dominant i e when the dimensionless fetch does not exceed 104 c f holthuijsen 2007 due to its small size the sea of marmara can also be prone to sudden changes in surface roughness at the land sea boundaries which can significantly affect wind speeds in the coastal areas it is approximately 240 km long and 70 km wide with a surface area of 11 500 km2 and its deepest point is 1270 m the northern part of the sea of marmara has a narrow continental shelf with a mean depth of about 70 m which increases in depth abruptly while the southern part has a relatively larger shelf with a mean depth of about 80 m these shelves are separated by trenches of 600 m in depth and there are three basins extending toward the ne sw direction çağatay et al 2000 these properties make the sea of marmara practically a deep water body from a wave point of view except for the shallow surf zone 3 materials and methods 3 1 data used it is generally accepted that the quality of the wind forcing is the most important parameter that affects the accuracy of estimates in wind wave modeling therefore we considered two wind data sources known for their relative good quality lower statistical error and higher correlation the era interim and cfsr wind data sets both data sources are of high temporal and spatial resolution covering turkey and belonging to ecmwf and noaa prediction centers respectively the era interim reanalysis wind database has wind fields with a 6 h temporal resolution covering a period from 1979 to present and a 0 75 spatial resolution these wind data were interpolated and retrieved on a 0 1 resolution both in latitude and longitude the wind fields are provided as the zonal and meridional wind components at a height of 10 m the cfsr version 1 of cfs re analysis data set is available from 1 january 1979 to 31 march 2011 version 2 of the cfsr data sets was put into operation in march 2011 and has been accessible from the cfsr database since april 2011 cfsr database for version 1 has data of 0 3 spatial resolution in both directions whereas data in the second version have a spatial resolution of 0 2 in both directions the temporal resolution of the wind data is 1 h in both versions detailed information can be found in saha et al 2010 2014 for the cfsr winds and dee et al 2011 for the era interim winds wind measurements from silivri buoy station named odas 01tr which is owned by tpao turkish petroleum corporation were used to analyze the quality of wind fields in cfsr and era interim data sets the silivri buoy is a seawatch midi 185 buoy equipped with a wind sensor at a height of 2 m wind data collected at this sensor were converted to u10 wind speed using the generally accepted hellman exponential law u 10 u z 10 z 1 7 with z 2 m the temporal resolution of the wind speeds is 1 min and the temporal resolution of the wave heights is 30 min the station is located at 41 043889 n and 28 186944 e 3 km offshore in istanbul s town of silivri and at a water depth of 50 m it can be seen in fig 1 that the buoy is located close to shore unfortunately we have no long term measurements yet in more open water or any other location over the sea of marmara which would enhance the quality of our model implementation in our study we used wind and wave data from 2013 for the setup and calibration of our wave model data from the years 2014 2015 and 2016 were used for the validation wind and wave statistics for the measurement data are presented in table 1 for the wind different wind speed properties were determined from the 1 min and 3 min gusts to the sustained 1 h average wind of which the latter were used for the comparison against the 1 h model winds for this comparison the era wind speed components were interpolated to 1 h intervals as can be seen from the table for the calibration period the number of data points are 4560 and 479 996 for waves and winds respectively hm0 has a maximum value of 1 95 m with a mean of 0 33 m the maximum value of the 1 min wind speed is 16 35 m s down to 13 91 m s for the 1 h sustained wind speed the mean wind speed is 4 58 m s it can be seen in table 1 that in the validation period the measured data was taking into consideration for three years of 2014 2016 maximum hm0 values are observed as 2 27 m 2 93 m and 3 28 m for 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively mean hm0 ranges between 0 28 m and 0 41 m these differences in the statistics of hm0 illustrate the inherent seasonal variability for stormy months in 2014 data is missing while it is also missing in calm months for 2016 the bathymetry data was obtained from the gebco general bathymetric chart of the oceans between 40 2042 and 41 09587 n and 26 6958 29 9958 e gebco 2014 it is acquired with a spatial resolution of 0 008333 in both directions 3 2 methodology as surface wind is the primary factor driving any wind wave model we first analyzed the performance of two wind data sources viz the era interim wind fields from ecmwf and the cfsr winds from noaa ncep by comparing them against wind data measurements at the silivri wave buoy please see fig 1 located in the north of the sea of marmara these two data sources were selected in view of their easy availability and good performances as found in akpinar et al 2016 and van vledder and akpinar 2015 the quality assessment of these wind sources was done by investigating their accuracy for different wind speed ranges annually and per season their directional properties using wind roses and their distribution function hereafter a swan model schematization was constructed and a sensitivity analysis was carried out to find the optimal numerical and physical settings from the results of the sensitivity analysis the best performing combination of wave model settings and wind data source was selected model performance is quantified using statistical error indices of wind speed u10 and significant wave height hm0 and their directions unfortunately no wave period information was available in addition we consider the prediction of design wave heights using extreme value analysis in developing the high resolution wave hindcast model for the sea of marmara many choices needed to be made regarding the spatial and spectral resolutions numerical and physical settings therefore a sensitivity analysis was carried out to find the optimal spatial resolution and time step as well as assessing the relevance of different physical formulations and their adjustable parameters on model performance the best method to calibrate a wave model is to select a number of physical processes represented by source terms and their adjustable coefficients and apply an elaborate error minimization procedure instead of using such a time consuming procedure we followed a simpler approach in which we performed a number of model runs by varying their coefficients around their default settings and choose the one with the lowest rms error and highest correlation as the optimal setting it is seen from the literature that the most sensitive processes in deep water that significantly affect model performance are whitecapping dissipation followed by wind input moeini and etemad shahidi 2007 appendini et al 2013 akpınar and ponce de león 2016 akpınar et al 2016 as there are many source term formulations to choose from we selected five combinations of the most frequently used formulations for whitecapping dissipation and wind input as well as the two wind data sources for simplicity we did not consider other source terms like the quadruplet interactions in our calibration the calibration process consists of running the wave model repeatedly for a full hindcast over the year 2013 using the selected formulations wind data sources and different values for the adjustable coefficient values swan team 2016 followed by assessing the performance of hm0 based on all data of 2013 at the silivri buoy data the combination of source terms and coefficients giving the highest correlation and lowest error is determined as the best setting this best setting is considered the results of our calibration at last a validation analysis for the calibrated swan model is done for the remaining three years of data again with the cfsr winds 3 3 swan model description the wind wave modeling in the sea of marmara was carried out with the swan wave model version 41 01ab booij et al 1999 ris et al 1999 it is a third generation wave prediction model developed by delft university of technology descriptions of the model structure formulations and usage can be found in booij et al 1999 and the swan technical and user manuals swan team 2016 in view of the purpose of this study we restricted our detailed description only to the elements of the swan model relevant for setting up the model for the sea of marmara being the wind input and whitecapping source terms at the end of this section information is given about the other source terms and the basic numerical settings in our wave model setup we tested various formulations for exponential wind input and whitecapping dissipation the source term for wind input can be formulated as 1 s in σ θ a b e σ θ in which the term a expression is given by cavaleri and malanotte rizzoli 1981 for the wind input term b two formulations were considered the first one is derived from the wam cycle 3 model s early version wamdi group 1988 using the formulations of snyder et al 1981 but rescaled in terms of friction velocity u by komen et al 1984 the second expression for the b term is due to janssen 1989 1991a and used in wam cycle 4 model komen et al 1994 whitecapping formulations are based on a pulse based model hasselmann 1974 2 s d s w σ θ γ σ k k e σ θ where γ is a coefficient depending on steepness k is wave number and σ and k respectively represent a mean frequency and a mean wave number cf the wamdi group 1988 by closing the energy balance of the waves in fully developed conditions komen et al 1984 estimated the value of γ this means that this value relies on the used wind input formulation two values for γ are used in swan since two wind input expressions are used the first is as in wam cycle 3 due to komen et al 1984 and the second is based on janssen 1991a as in wam cycle 4 see janssen 1991b günther et al 1992 this coefficient has been adapted by günther et al 1992 based on janssen 1991a see also janssen 1991b as given by wamdi group 1988 3 γ γ k j c d s 1 δ δ k k s s p m the coefficients c ds δ and p are adjustable coefficients s is the total wave steepness s pm is the value of s in the spectrum of pierson moskowitz pierson and moskowitz 1964 s pm 3 02 10 3 the default values of the whitecapping coefficient cds in its formulation are defined as cds 4 5 for janssen and cds 2 36 10 5 for komen a number of alternative whitecapping expressions have been proposed to improve the accuracy of swan an alternative is proposed by van der westhuysen et al 2007 and van der westhuysen 2007 based on the whitecapping expression of alves and banner 2003 this adapted whitecapping expression is used together with a wind input term that is based on that of yan 1987 the default value of the whitecapping coefficient in this alternative is cds 5 10 5 for westhuysen for the other source terms we used the default formulations present in swan version 41 01ab these comprise the non linear four wave interactions snl4 which are approximated with the discrete interaction approximation of hasselmann et al 1985 using cnl4 3 107 and λ 0 25 for bottom friction sbot we use the jonswap formulation of hasselmann et al 1973 using cfric 0 038 m2 s 3 and for the non linear three interactions snl3 we use the lta method of eldeberky 1996 using trfac 0 10 cutfr 2 5 depth limited wave breaking is modelled using the bore based model of battjes and janssen 1978 using alpha 1 and gamma 0 73 the model was run in a non stationary mode with a time step of 30 min and with a maximum of 4 iterations per time step using the stopc convergence criterion requiring 99 of the active grid points to be converged it covered a computational domain the sea of marmara from 26 6958 to 29 9958 east and 40 2042 41 0942 north the domain was built on a regular rectangular grid consisting of 500 135 grid points with a grid resolution of 0 0066 in both directions equal to 0 73 km and 0 55 km the spectrum was discretized with a frequency range between 0 04 hz and 1 0 hz and 35 frequency bins logarithmically spaced and with 36 equally spaced directions in the sensitivity analysis section 4 2 1 we checked our choice of above settings 3 4 model performance evaluation criteria model performance is assessed using the following statistical error measures mean absolute error mae is the first parameter evaluated and it is calculated as below 4 m a e 1 n i 1 n y i x i where y i are hindcast values x i are measurement values and n is the number of data second parameter is the root mean square error rmse calculated as 5 r m s e 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 and the variables are the same as those of the previous error parameter the average difference bias is given by the equation below 6 b i a s y x where x and y are the averages of the measurements and hindcasts respectively except for three different error criteria scatter index si values were calculated using the following expression 7 s i r m s e x for all error indices above a value being nearest to zero presents better performance in comparison with other values the correlation coefficient r indicating the correspondence between measurement and hindcast data sets is calculated by the following formula 8 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 to quantify the performance of directions directional equivalents of the bias and rmse are defined as 9 m a e θ b i a s θ 1 n i 1 n δ i 10 r m s e θ 1 n i 1 n δ i 2 with δ the shortest distance between 2 directions θ 1 and θ 2 11 δ 180 180 θ 1 θ 2 note that for directional data linear regression lines have no meaning as they are not invariant to a directional shift the same argument is used to define the directional version of bias in terms of the mean absolute directional error 3 5 probability distribution functions and quantile quantile plots a closer look at the agreement between measured and simulated wind and wave data is by means of the probability distribution function and quantile quantile plots hereafter referred to as q q plots a q q plot displays a quantile quantile plot of the quantiles of the sample data x versus the quantiles of the sample data y q q plots compare two probability distributions by graphing their quantiles against each other if the two are similar the plotted values will roughly lie along the central diagonal if the two are linearly related values will again lie along a line though with different slope and possibly a different intercept various probability density functions are available to describe the wind speed frequency curve the most commonly used probability density functions for winds are weibull rayleigh and log normal functions rayleigh probability distribution function is also widely accepted in the literature for representing probability distribution of waves the details of these distributions can be found in appendix a 3 6 extreme value analysis the method to assess the similarity between the extreme values of the hindcast datasets obtained from the swan model and the measurement data set is described here with the help of extrapolation in extreme value analysis design values with different return period for longer than the present data period can be investigated extreme value analyses are generally determined using gumbel weibull and generalized pareto distributions neelamani et al 2007 muzathik et al 2011 in this study we selected the extreme value analyses obtained by using the gumbel distribution as recommended by liu and ma 1980 and persson and ryden 2010 in this study extreme value analysis was applied by taking into consideration the maximum values of each month for all data sets for 2013 as a result wave heights with different recurrence periods were estimated by applying gumbel distribution graphics to monthly maximum values the general formulation of the gumbel distribution is given below 12 g h e e h a c where g h gives the probability of non exceedance where a is the location parameter and c is the scale parameter the probability of exceedance is calculated by q h 1 g h equality q h is calculated by the following formula 13 q h i d 1 n d 2 where i represents the order of the data calculated from the data generated in decreasing order and n represents the total number of data in the gumbel distribution d1 0 44 and d2 0 12 neelamani et al 2007 the y axis represents the maximum value of each month in the gumbel distribution graph and the x axis represents the probability calculated by gumbel distribution probability values corresponding to the maximum values are marked on the distribution graph and the most appropriate line is based on least squares analysis from the determined points the upper line of the x axis gives the annual recurrence interval 4 results 4 1 analysis of wind sources 4 1 1 error analysis the error statistics of both re analyses wind data and 1 h sustained wind speed and direction measurements for 2013 are presented in table 2 as can be seen from this table in terms of bulk statistics the cfsr winds present a positive bias the era interim winds show lower estimates over the measurements wind directions are also estimated better by cfsr winds with a maeɵ value of 40 4 in comparison with the era interim winds with a maeɵ value of 49 3 a refinement into different wind speed intervals 0 4 m s 4 8 m s and 8 m s referred to as low moderate and high wind speeds is also presented in table 2 it is seen here that both wind data sources overpredict lower wind speeds whereas era interim predictions are slightly lower in relation to the cfsr winds high wind speeds u10 8 m s are much better predicted with cfsr winds giving a si of 20 compared to the 29 for era interim winds the results of this table show that the cfsr winds have the best agreement with the measurements this is confirmed on the basis of the scatter diagrams and time series comparisons presented in figs 2 and 3 the colour scheme in the scatter diagrams in fig 2 represents the log10 of the number of entries in a square box of 0 2 m s normalized with the log10 of the maximum number of entries in a box in this way the clustering of data points is highlighted each figure contains 2 lines the solid red line according to the model y cx and the line of perfect agreement is the dashed line the number of samples n and names of wind data sources are shown in the title and on the plot from these plots it is seen that the regression line obtained using the cfsr winds overlaps with the perfect fit line for the era interim there is a larger deviation between the lines in fig 3 a time series comparison for both winds against the measurements is presented for the year 2013 and a period of one month december 2013 where more peaks are observed and winds are much more variable in this time interval in comparison with other periods of this year these plots confirm that the cfsr winds also estimate better the peaks of the wind speed than the era interim winds all these findings confirm the results in table 2 4 1 2 wind roses in order to inspect the directional characteristics and dominant directions at silivri station annual and seasonal wind roses were generated here seasons are defined as three month periods where winter contains the months december january and february spring march april and may summer june july and august and autumn september october and november these roses are shown in fig 4 based on measured and simulated wind data at silivri location for the year 2013 percentages of wind speeds u10 3 m s representing the calm periods within the entire data for both measurement and hindcast datasets are given in table 3 the observed dominant wind direction displayed by all year roses left column is north east based on frequency of occurrence the location is exposed to a secondary direction to south westerly winds around the east of the sea of marmara there is south west to north east land elevation and thus it is surmised that this orographic feature directs the winds along this line this could be the cause that in this region north east is the dominant direction of the winds while south west is the secondary dominant direction here the maximum wind speeds in each direction sector coincide with those from the simulated cfsr winds the same applies for era interim winds which show a good match of dominant wind direction with the measurements except for the highest wind speeds per direction sector the patterns in the seasonal roses shown in four right columns in fig 4 show many similar characteristics significant exceptions occur for the south west sector in winter and spring where the era interim and cfsr winds overestimate the contribution of wind for summer the era interim winds exhibit a much broader north easterly sector for autumn both era interim and cfsr have a stronger north east component than the measurements and both data sources also overestimate the south westerly sector the seasonal roses clearly show a dominant wind sector from the north east and a secondary wind sector from the south west of which the latter is over estimated by the model winds considering all wind roses on the whole cfsr winds agree better in the dominant directional estimation relative to era interim winds which tend to underestimate wind speed consistent with this feature the percentages of calm periods are slightly higher than those of the cfsr winds 4 1 3 probability distributions and q q plots of wind speeds the agreement of the two wind data sources in terms of their wind speed with respect to those of the measurements is further analyzed by comparing their probability density functions pdf and q q plots as visualized in fig 5 together with the regression line y c x and the line of perfect agreement as can be seen from this figure era interim winds appear to better estimate winds that are lower than 2 m s whereas cfsr winds seem to have a lower probability in estimating the winds within the same range nevertheless era interim winds perform well in the speed range of 2 6 m s contrary to cfsr winds which have low probabilities in the same range regarding strong winds 6 m s cfsr winds give rather more precise estimations over era interim winds whose maximum value at this station is about 12 m s being rather low in comparison with that of the measurements besides it is seen from the q q plots that the cfsr winds have a similar distribution as the wind measurements cfsr winds against the measurements show closest results to both the regression line y c x and the line of perfect agreement 4 2 set up of wave model including results of sensitivity analysis 4 2 1 impact of numerical and physical settings on model performance the purpose of this section is to examine the sensitivity of numerical settings on model performance to find possible improvements in model setup in comparison with the recommended default settings described in section 3 3 we examined the impact of changing the computational grid resolution and computational time step on model performance this was achieved in sensitivity runs in which a full hindcast for the year 2013 was carried out and the predicted significant wave height hm0 at silivri station was compared against the observations for each sensitivity run one parameter setting was changed while keeping the other settings constant error statistics of hindcast results based on each setting against the measurements were determined and analyzed to detect alterations on model performance the spatial resolution of the computational grids was varied in 4 different ways such that both x and y directions were equal 0 0066 500 135 0 0044 750 203 0 0033 1000 270 and 1 km 275 103 no changes in model performance were detected therefore we decided that the spatial resolution of our swan model was set as 0 0066 as we consider this choice to be optimal in terms of computational requirements and achieved accuracy test computations indicated that a time step of 30 min with a maximum of 4 iterations per time step provided a good balance between computational requirements and accuracy we tested also effect of the directional resolution using different equally spaced directions but no improvement was obtained in comparison with the default setting therefore the recommended value of 36 in the swan manual was used to assess whether shallow water processes play a role we analyzed the spatial distributions of the magnitude of the physical processes as computed by swan cf van vledder et al 2016 for a severe wave condition in which we expect that shallow water effects might play a role it is the point of time in the storm of 23 may 2013 at 15 00 h characterized by a strong south westerly wind in the order of 12 m s the variation of the normalized source terms with m0 as in van vledder et al 2016 clearly shows that in deep water the processes of wind input whitecapping dissipation and non linear four wave interactions are dominant whitecapping and non linear four wave interactions are of equal magnitude the shallow water processes of bottom friction depth limited wave breaking and triad interactions are so weak and only noticeable at a thin strip along the edges of the sea of marmara based on these results the shallow water processes were deactivated in our further computations we realize that shallow water effects do occur close to the coast where waves will feel bottom effects the resolution of our spatial grid however is unable to resolve these effects 4 3 calibration the purpose of this section is to calibrate the swan model by finding the optimal combination of wind input source term whitecapping formulation and related coefficients and wind data source the optimal combination is to the one producing the best agreement with observations of significant wave height hm0 at silivri location for 2013 in terms of statistical error indices correlation si bias rmse mae and visual comparisons of derived data for this purpose five different combinations of source terms for wind induced wave growth and whitecapping formulations were selected all supplemented with the dia for the non linear four wave interactions 1 komen komen et al 1994 komen komen et al 1994 2 komen komen et al 1994 janssen janssen 1991a 1991b 3 janssen janssen 1991a 1991b janssen janssen 1991a 1991b 4 janssen janssen 1991a 1991b komen komen et al 1994 5 yan yan 1987 westhuysen van der westhuysen 2007 van der westhuysen et al 2007 for each combination the coefficients for the whitecapping dissipation were varied around their default settings followed by a model run for 2013 using both wind sources the predicted significant wave height data for each setting different cds were compared against the measured data at the silivri station for 2013 and error statistics were determined a multi criteria analysis was performed to select the best performing combination based on assessing various statistical error measures and visual plots with equal weight the error statistics of the settings using the cfsr winds are presented in table 4 not included here are the results for the models forced with the era interim winds and their performances are visualized by taylor diagrams taylor 2001 in fig 6 in the taylor diagrams each color represents results for unique combination of source terms and also stars and squares show the default setting and the best setting swan models respectively it is note that the best setting and default setting janssen komen and default setting janssen janssen combinations overlap in the taylor diagram the janssen komen combination has poor results because its value is too far from the points black circles representing the measurements it is also seen that the default setting models have lower standard deviation but the best setting models have a higher standard deviation than the one of the measurements scatter diagrams generated for cfsr run and era interim run swan models with the best settings for each source term combination are presented in fig 7 this figure shows that the straight line of the data from janssen janssen combination overlaps with the perfect fit line this implies that this combination is the best based on scatter plots however this combination has error statistics of rmse 0 17 m and si 52 however komen janssen cds 1 0 setting in combination with cfsr winds shows a lower error performance with rmse 0 16 m and si 48 this shows that the komen janssen cds 1 0 setting in combination with the cfsr winds has an improvement about 4 in wave height hindcasts in comparison with the janssen janssen combination therefore komen janssen cds 1 0 setting in combination with cfsr winds is determined to be the best combination for the swan model forced with the era interim winds the komen komen cds 0 5e 5 setting performs best based on these two settings the komen janssen combination driven by cfsr wind is considered as the calibrated swan model the effect of the calibration on model performance is summarized in fig 8 showing two scatter diagrams of measured and predicted significant wave height hm0 based on the cfsr based swan model runs for 2013 the left panel shows the results of the calibrated swan which input file is given in appendix b and the right panel the results of the default swan model this figure shows a slight improvement in agreement but still a large amount of scatter an overview of the error statistics for all wave heights combined and in 0 5 m wave height classes is given in table 5 from this table it follows that the calibration resulted in a slight improvement in model performance evidently the default swan model driven by cfsr wind was already relatively good as becomes clear from 1 improvement in scatter index for the era wind based simulations the scatter index reduced by 9 as the calibration compensated for the underestimation of wind speeds see section 4 1 table 5 also shows that the performance of both swan model setups decreases with increasing wave height 4 4 validation the calibrated swan model is validated by comparing the model results forced with the previously unused cfsr winds in years of 2014 2015 and 2016 and the silivri station significant wave height hm0 and mean direction dir measurements the results of the three one year model runs used for verification are evaluated separately and lumped together scatter diagrams of the measured and predicted significant wave heights using the calibrated and default swan models in different years are given in fig 9 the related error statistics are summarized in table 6 it is seen that the calibrated model compares well with the measurements in all years compared to the statistics shown in table 6 it shows that especially the bias error has been reduced while the model performs well throughout the year in only a few time instants the peak values are lower in the hindcast for all of the three years of validation scatter diagrams are presented in the first column of fig 9 for two different model settings similar findings were obtained for the default and best setting swan models forced with the era interim winds but not shown here as they show similar results scatter diagrams confirm that the calibrated swan model has a better model performance in comparison with the default settings swan model it has also a good relation between observed and modeled significant wave heights especially in 2015 fig 10a as the number of overlapping data points is low in 2016 fig 10b the relationship between measurements and model results is poorer than in other years the qualitative results from fig 9 are confirmed by the quantitative results in table 6 the mean value of the calibrated swan model in all years is slightly lower than the measurements again its error statistics are generally low in all years and there is also a good correlation between the wave height measurements and the hindcasts of about 0 75 0 84 fig 11 presents probability density plots of simulated hm0 values with the calibrated and default setting swan models forced with cfsr winds against that of the measurements at silivri station for 3 years from 2014 to 2016 as can be seen from this figure in all years the calibrated swan model has the best agreement with the measurements especially in terms of the peak values 4 5 climate results this section presents wave climate results of the calibrated swan model in comparison with the measurements and results obtained with the default settings swan model all driven by the cfsr winds first attention is given to the wave roses followed by an exposure of the distribution functions of significant wave height and finally of the ability to predict the extreme wave conditions 4 5 1 wave roses wave roses based on all data of 2013 as well as from different seasons are presented in fig 12 the upper row of roses is based on the wave measurement the middle row is based on the calibrated swan model whereas the lower row is based on the defaults settings swan model based on the wave roses of the measurements for all data it is seen that waves primarily come from a directional sector between south south west and east north east although there are many similarities between the roses of the simulations there are also some differences the measured easterly waves are predicted better by both swan models but the measured south easterly waves are captured less well by the swan models the default model hindcasts produces slightly lower wave heights than the calibrated model percentages of calm period waves hm0 0 5 m for all measurements and based on the calibrated and default setting swan model results for each season and all data of 2013 are presented in table 7 as can be seen from this table for the range hm0 0 5 m the default setting model presents a very high percentage of calms which is higher than 90 except for winter where it is 79 the results of the calibrated swan model possesses a very close ratio 82 to the measurements for the calm period waves the percentage of calm periods for all data is much more than predicted from the default setting swan models about 89 at all seasons except for summer the calibrated swan model has the closest percentages relative to those of the measurements in winter the dominant direction of the measured waves tends to be in the direction sector from east to south wave roses generated for the two models the calibrated and default setting show directions from a wider sector north east to south west and their dominant direction coincides with that of the measurements in summer the measured south easterly waves are not captured well by both models the measured waves come from a directional sector from east to south whereas the hindcasts present a much narrower sector from easterly directions in autumn easterly waves are predicted more by both swan models in comparison with those of measurements it is also observed from all these wave roses that the calibrated swan model results present more similar characteristics to those of the measurements in comparison with the default model results it is noted that this exposure presents more detail than can be inferred from a reduction of the scatter index by 1 4 5 2 probability distributions and q q plots of wave heights probability density functions and q q plots of simulated and measured significant wave heights are presented in fig 13 as seen from the probability distributions with the exception of the calibrated swan model the default setting model overestimated waves having heights less than 0 3 m and underestimated waves in the range 0 3 1 m a very good relation is witnessed between results of the calibrated swan model and the measurements this is the only model setting that was able to precisely capture the highest observed wave heights above 1 m the default setting model shows a strong underestimation for waves of the same height besides q q plots show that values for the default setting swan model lie closer along the red straight line showing that the distribution of its data are more aligned with those of the measurements than those of the calibrated swan model however it is also observed that the data values of the calibrated swan model and measurements roughly lie along the line of perfect agreement this means that the samples of the calibrated swan results and measurements come from a similar distribution 4 5 3 models ability in prediction of extreme waves in the following an analysis was executed to determine the ability of the calibrated and default setting swan models in estimating extreme events i e extreme design waves with different return periods this was done by acquiring maximum values of monthly significant wave heights for the year 2013 from both the simulations and the measurements the gumbel distribution graphical method was applied on these monthly maximum values to obtain statistical results of extreme values the results are summarized in table 8 and visualized in fig 14 according to this figure it is found that the calibrated swan model yields the closest results to those of the measurements whereas the default setting swan model predicts lower extreme waves for instance for a 100 year return period extreme wave height values are estimated to be around 3 m according to results of the calibrated swan model as well as the measurements the default setting swan model only shows an estimate of about 2 5 m 5 conclusions and recommendations in this study a high resolution and accurate swan wave hindcast model was implemented for the sea of marmara for this two recent re analysis wind data sets the era interim and the cfsr were used as forcings for the wave model their qualities were tested against silivri wind measurements in terms of both wind speed and direction then test runs on model settings were performed to find the optimal values for time step grid resolutions and the combination of source terms for wind input and whitecapping and the coefficient for whitecapping model performance was assessed against measurements of significant wave height hm0 and mean wave direction dir at the silivri buoy location based on the results of this study the following conclusions were obtained the best wind data source is the cfsr wind data base cfsr winds slightly overestimate wind speeds while era interim winds underestimate them wind speeds lower than 4 m s are better predicted by era interim re analysis in this study area for moderate winds between 4 m s and 8 m s the quality of both winds is almost the same cfsr winds show a much better performance giving si of 20 compared to the 29 by era interim for strong winds being greater than 8 m s the dominant wind directions observed in the measurements are matching with those of both era interim and cfsr winds there is also a good match between the measurements and cfsr winds in terms of directions of the highest wind speeds per direction sector but they are not catched by era interim the sea of marmara can practically be considered as deep water as the deep water processes of wind input whitecapping and quadruplet interactions are dominant and of equal magnitude the shallow water processes of bottom friction depth limited wave breaking and triad interactions are insignificant except along the shallow coastal zones the best performing or calibrated swan model setup comprises the komen for wind input janssen for whitecapping where cds 1 0 in combination with cfsr wind forcing in terms of significant wave height the calibration improved the bias by 5 cm whereas the scatter index improved by only 1 the calibration has most effect on low wave heights between 0 5 m and 1 m the calibrated swan model shows good agreement with the measurements in all years as demonstrated by the good agreement with measurements in terms of the directionally dependent high wind speeds the maximum wave height and the wave heights with high return periods for the sea of marmara it is recommended to use the calibrated swan model forced by cfsr winds for our future studies we plan to produce a new and online accessible wind and wave atlas for the sea of marmara using the model developed in this study we expect that wind products at a finer spatial resolution may improve the prediction of moderate winds and extreme weather events this may be provided by e g the wrf model a limitation of the present study is that we only could calibrate the model against hm0 at one deep water location it is therefore recommended to perform additional measurements involving not only more wave parameters but also at more exposed locations in the sea of marmara acknowledgements this work is based on the master thesis of the first author at uludağ university bursa turkey we would like to thank tsms turkish state meteorological service for its help in obtaining the necessary permissions for obtaining data from the ecmwf and the tpao anonym association of turkish petroleum and tsms for providing the measurements at silivri appendix a probability density functions of winds and waves the weibull distribution is very flexible and simple but also adapts well to field data the weibull distribution is the most commonly used and widely accepted distribution for wind data analysis akpınar and akpınar 2005 ucar and balo 2009 gülersoy and çetin 2010 akpınar 2013 for this reason a two parameter weibull probability density function is used for the analysis of wind speeds in this study in the most general case the weibull distribution function is expressed as a 1 f w v k c v c k 1 e v c k where f w v is the probability density of the wind speed k is the shape parameter and c is the scale parameter the scale parameter c of the weibull distribution also has a reference value in the wind data it is also expected that the k shape parameter is usually between 1 5 and 3 akpınar and akpınar 2004 kurban et al 2007 various analytical and empirical methods are used to obtain these parameters here the scale and shape parameters are determined according to the justus formula manwell et al 2002 mirhosseini et al 2011 akpınar 2013 a 2 k σ v o r t 1 086 a 3 c v o r t k 2 6674 0 184 0 816 k 2 73855 v o r t is the average wind speed and σ is the standard deviation of the wind speeds and can be calculated using the following formulas a 4 v o r t 1 n i 1 n v i a 5 σ i 1 n v i v o r t 2 n 1 0 5 the weibull cumulative distribution function gives the probability that the wind speed is less than or equal to a certain value thus the cumulative distribution function f w v is expressed as the integral of the probability density function f w v fyrippis et al 2010 akpınar 2013 a 6 f w v 1 e v c k the fit of the significant wave heights produced by the swan hindcast model using different winds with the measured wave heights at the silivri station was assessed using the rayleigh probability distribution function accepted in the literature longuet higgins 1952 goda 1979 yüksek et al 2000 the rayleigh density function is given by the following relation a 7 f r v 2 v c 2 e v c 2 the cumulative probability function of the rayleigh distribution is a 8 f r v 1 e v c 2 the greatest advantage of this distribution is that the distribution can be determined only by the average significant wave height appendix b swan input file for the calibrated model image
