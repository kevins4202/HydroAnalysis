12960,biochar based column filtration systems bcfs for greywater treatment have gained attention in the last decade however a review of the state of the art on this subject has not been conducted leaving the analysis and limitations of the available research still unexplored this paper reviews the current literature to give insights into the technology and identify new areas of investigation this study used a systematic review approach to evaluate the documentation relating to the technology s worldwide status configuration removal mechanisms removal efficiency and water reuse applications in total 28 studies were reported in 16 countries including india and sweden as leading ones three filter column configurations were identified single biochar filter multilayer filter and polishing step in the treatment chain the pollutant removal efficiency of bcfs ranged between 50 and 99 treated greywater is reused mainly for non potable purposes such as toilet flushing cloth washing and crop irrigation overall this technology can be a feasible and sustainable alternative for greywater treatment and application in water scarce regions however further research is needed on social perception toward potable water reuse new feedstocks for biochar production the scaling up and long term assessment evaluation of additional water microbial indicators and the modification of biochar to target specific water reuse purposes graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biochar column filtration system greywater water reuse water scarce regions 1 introduction water is an essential resource for the functioning of ecosystem services that benefit human beings 1 nevertheless nearly 4 billion people faced water scarcity and 2 billion people were settled in countries with water stress by 2019 2 as the world population grows places are urbanized and industry expands quickly both the water demand and amount of wastewater rise significantly 3 wastewater is of concern when discharged untreated in water bodies or soil as it is associated with eutrophication pathogenic pollution damage to soil s properties and mosquito breeding 4 however there are sustainable opportunities for water reclamation from wastewater that could help minimize the freshwater needs and preserve water bodies and soil leading to green development in society 5 as a type of wastewater greywater includes outflows from washbasins bathrooms kitchen sinks and laundry machines and accounts for 50 80 of the total wastewater generated in households and residential buildings 6 unlike sewage wastewater it contains less organic matter and harmful pathogens as it excludes water from toilets which includes urine and faces 7 therefore greywater is safer to manipulate and simpler to treat for reuse in non potable purposes such as crop irrigation garden watering toilet flushing and discharge into water bodies 8 10 biological processes such as membrane bioreactor mbr upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb and rotating biological contactor rbc have been widely used to remove organic matter contaminants in greywater due to their high efficiency however as they are mechanized they tend to be more appropriate for centralized treatment systems 5 efforts to promote a circular economy in the water sector have focused on searching sustainable on site wastewater treatment technologies over the last two decades 11 when compared to centralized systems locally based treatment solutions are characterized by requiring fewer capital costs and energy less maintenance and operation and are affordable in terms of local material availability 12 in the case of greywater nature based solutions such as constructed wetlands cw green walls gw vertical gardens vg and green roofs gr have been used as sustainable treatment techniques resulting in less carbon footprint and less new water demand 13 14 recently the reuse and recycling of waste materials as adsorbents for wastewater treatment has gained attention to find synergistic strategies to boost the circular economy in both the water and waste sectors 15 biochar a charcoal like substance produced by the thermal decomposition of organic material from agricultural and forestry wastes also called biomass in the absence of oxygen pyrolysis is an example of waste based adsorbent material it is widely used as a fertilizer for soil conditioning and carbon sequestration 16 17 new studies however have demonstrated its potential as an adsorbent in wastewater treatment due to its high surface area high porosity and reactive surface functional group 18 19 for instance biochar has been employed in the treatment of stormwater 20 21 municipal 22 agricultural 23 and industrial wastewaters 24 when it comes to greywater treatment several treatment technologies such as cw vg and gr have incorporated biochar as a filter media proving to remove organic and inorganic water pollutants 25 27 over the last decade the use of bcfs for greywater treatment has experienced a surge in interest from the academia community however there is a lack of in depth knowledge about the available literature on this topic therefore the main objective of this study is to systematically gather the available literature from a broad range of publications to provide insights into the existing research and identify new areas of investigation four research questions rq have been proposed to orientate the research process rq1 what is the world s status of research on the use of bcfs to treat greywater rq2 what are the types of configurations and style of operation of bcfs rq3 what is the pollutant removal potential by bcfs in comparison to conventional adsorbents rq4 what are the actual and potential applications of greywater once treated in bcfs 2 methods this study employed the systematic literature review slr approach to assess the existing literature on the topic of greywater treatment technologies and narrow it to the application of bcfs to answer the research questions the study adopted a modified version of the fourteen step approach by tawfik et al 28 and the five step outlined by denyer tranfield 29 in the first phase four objectives were formulated 1 investigate the world s status of research about the use of bcfs for greywater treatment 2 describe the configuration and operation of the treatment system 3 evaluate the suitability of bcfs to remove pollutants in greywater and 4 describe the applications of bcfs in the reuse of treated greywater the second phase comprised the formulation of the research strategy where search terms were defined to carefully examine the existing literature initially subject area related keywords were established and divided into three sets the first one was related to biochar bio char biochar charcoal char the second one to greywater greywater graywater grey water grey water laundry wastewater handwashing wastewater washbasin wastewater dishwashing wastewater cloth washing wastewater kitchen wastewater bathroom wastewater bathroom wastewater shower wastewater and the last one to treatment treatment reclamation and recycling after that sophisticated search strings were constructed using boolean logic and or with all possible combinations among the three sets of keywords a total of 180 search terms were composed before searching in databases supplementary material table s 1 it is worth mentioning that some search strings were redefined to deal with the search format of databases the second phase comprised the formulation of the research strategy where search terms were defined to carefully examine the existing literature initially subject area related keywords were established and divided into three sets the first one was related to biochar bio char biochar charcoal char the second one to greywater greywater graywater grey water grey water laundry wastewater handwashing wastewater washbasin wastewater dishwashing wastewater cloth washing wastewater kitchen wastewater bathroom wastewater bathroom wastewater shower wastewater and the last one to treatment treatment reclamation and recycling after that sophisticated search strings were constructed using boolean logic and or with all possible combinations among the three sets of keywords a total of 180 search terms were composed before searching in databases supplementary material table s 1 it is worth mentioning that some search strings were redefined to deal with the search format of databases as part of the third phase seven well known online publisher databases were selected for literature search google scholar researchgate base sciencedirect ingenta scopus and locate coventry university uk in addition the identification of relevant studies from the publication databases by using the search strings took place in the fourth phase a vigorous channelling process using inclusion exclusion criteria and quality attributes checklist of questions was performed to select the most adequate from the existing literature a total list of eight inclusion exclusion criteria with their rationale was suggested table 1 while a total of four quality attributes qa were applied to the potential studies qa1 does the study discuss the use of biochar in greywater treatment qa2 does the study refer to the use of biochar based column filtration systems in greywater treatment qa3 does the study show empirical results concerning the removal of pollutants in greywater treated in biochar based column filtration units and qa4 does the study provide information about the reuse of treated greywater in potable and or non potable water reuse applications the channelling processing consisted mainly of two steps screening and eligibility at first the total articles and dissertations were identified and stored in the reference management software zotero and duplicated articles were excluded afterwards a title and abstract screening was carried out to narrow the findings to those addressing the publication scope next the eligibility of the articles and dissertations was evaluated thus irrelevant duplicates and non full available texts were removed within the framework of established inclusion and exclusion criteria manual searching was conducted by searching reference lists from the articles and dissertations already screened and doing citation tracking data extraction was the fifth phase and consisted of an in depth reviewing and information collection of the filtered articles and dissertations a data extraction form in the shape of an excel spreadsheet was designed and six categories were proposed to guide the data collection process finally the most relevant studies were analysed and interpreted valuable data to answer the research questions was summarized in an excel spreadsheet then the results and discussion of the thematic content of the chosen studies were reported in a manuscript for further revision and submission to a peer review journal 3 results and discussion 3 1 descriptive analysis at the beginning 4130 sources were found using the set of all possible combinations between the three main sets of keywords this number was shortlisted to 1476 by deleting duplicates manually 233 and through the automatized option in the software zotero 2421 then this number was title and abstract screened and 1415 sources were removed thus a total of 61 sources were assessed for eligibility and 36 were eliminated for being irrelevant to the study focus 31 and lacking full text availability 5 manually 3 sources were added leaving 28 studies for further analysis fig 1 table 2 presents general information and a summary of the studies found 3 1 1 year of publication fig 2 illustrates the yearly distribution of the reviewed studies overall the number of publications fluctuated over the study period of the review 2010 2021 the record of publications had two peaks in 2014 and 2019 when six and seven studies were published respectively the observed increase in the first half could be attributed to an emerging interest in the water sector to seek replacement filter media for activated carbon in wastewater treatment after concerns related to high footprint and high production cost 31 39 unlike the period 2010 2015 toward the end of the second period in 2019 another increase in publishing was observed this result may be explained by the fact the water scarcity problem gained attention worldwide especially in water stress and low and middle income countries promoting the search for locally based materials in the process of decentralized wastewater treatment 7 41 43 45 3 1 2 geographical distribution the geographical distribution of the reviewed studies both by country and continent is represented in figs 3 and 4 respectively fig 3 provides the number of publications based on the authors country of affiliation overall publications were done in 16 countries including palestine sweden and india are the countries with notable contributions with 6 and 5 publications respectively followed by malaysia 3 and ghana 2 while the remaining territories only produced one study each further analysis demonstrated that although sweden and india share similar production in number their research efforts concentrated differently over time nearly 84 of swedish studies 5 were conducted in the period 2012 2016 while 80 of indian publications 4 were finalized between 2016 and 2020 this high research interest in biochar application for greywater remediation in sweden and generally in europe as can be observed in figs 3 and 4 might be due to the implementation of the european union eu circular economy strategy that aims to develop sustainable water recycling systems 50 51 a closer analysis of the european publications that represent 32 of the reviewed studies fig 4 reveals interesting facts they demonstrated that biochar use in greywater remediation has the potential to discharge safely treated wastewater into the environment avoid eutrophication in water bodies 31 36 reuse greywater in irrigation without risk to human health 4 6 37 42 ensure access to safe drinking water 49 and recycle nutrients 35 india and other asian countries such as malaysia and vietnam have also invested in biochar based greywater treatment research asian studies in this literature review accounted for 36 of the total publications fig 4 with india being the leader country unlike europe asian efforts have focused on using biochar in greywater treatment to cope with water shortages 5 32 46 and the absence of sewage systems in small cities to stop pouring untreated wastewater to open land 5 40 fig 4 also shows that several authors based in african countries have investigated the properties of biochar to reclaim greywater and thus reduce the consumption of limited freshwater sources 8 33 44 these efforts are helping african countries to meet the 2030 agenda for sustainable development goals sdgs especially in achieving sdg 3 good health and well being and sdg 6 clean water and sanitation 3 1 3 distribution by type of study fig 5 denotes the distribution by source type of the publications reviewed in this study article type is the main source of information 17 studies followed by dissertations 9 and lastly scientific reports 2 generally scholars mainly published in journals with an approach to zero waste management water and wastewater management and environmental technologies dissertation studies were fragmented into two levels undergraduate 2 and postgraduate 7 while 2 publications were categorized as scientific reports this low number of studies found may be due to the study s focus which includes only publications on the use of biochar based column filtration systems for greywater treatment table 1 although biochar has been widely used in the treatment of different types of wastewater and remediation technologies this study focused only on identifying the state of art only for bcfs used in the regeneration principally of greywater 3 2 content analysis 3 2 1 biochar in filtration systems for greywater treatment biochar can be defined as a carbon rich 85 porous and complex material produced from the pyrolysis hydrothermal carbonization gasification and torrefaction of several types of waste biomass such as agriculture forestry and municipal waste 52 53 today the use of biochar in the water sector has become increasingly popular due to biochar s enhanced physicochemical properties for water wastewater decontamination and remediation 54 specific surface area high porosity high cation exchange capacity ph surface functional groups surface reactivity and mineral composition are the main biochar properties that affect its capability to adsorb organic inorganic and even pathogenic contaminants in water 18 according to yaashikaa et al 55 several factors influence biochar s properties during production including the type of biomass temperature rate of heating retention time and pressure for instance enaime et al 18 concluded that high temperature pyrolysis commonly results in biochar with a larger surface area and pore volume making it ideal for the sorption of organic contaminants while inorganic pollutants can be removed more effectively by biochar produced at low temperature pyrolysis since it has more oxygen containing functional groups given all that has been mentioned identifying biochar characteristics is relevant to assessing its potential in the removal of pollutants from greywater as can be seen in table 3 in this literature review out of the 28 reviewed studies 21 provided information on the biochar used either about its feedstock source or physicochemical properties whereas 7 studies fail to acknowledge this information it is apparent from table 3 that almost all the studies utilized wood based biochar either pruning residues 48 leaves 7 or chopped trees among the authors only salihu wamdeo 39 pointed out that the selection of biochar from high lignin containing feedstock exhibited a molecular structure similar to that of activated carbon and may therefore replace it while the rest of them argued the selection was based primarily on local availability reasons comparing the results of biochar size overall the most common range was 1 5 mm however smaller and larger particle sizes of 0 25 mm 41 and 9 5 mm 45 respectively have also been reported this result may be explained by the fact that in thinner porous media the straining is greater and adsorption sites are abundant which can result in more reduction of pathogens 4 31 37 the specific surface area is another property of great importance as it contributes to the removal of pollutants and determines the suitability of filtration material to allow biofilm growth and consequently biological degradation processes for organic pollutants in this study it ranged from 118 to 200 m2 g and as expected it was higher and lower than sand 0 152 m2 g and activated carbon 1000 m2 g respectively 37 the total porosity varied from 42 to 74 and was higher than the typical porosity of sand particles 35 this implies that biochar has a better capacity for both water retention and biofilm development 31 3 2 2 configuration and set up of the filtration systems several treatment systems cw gw vg gr have incorporated biochar as a filter material in their configuration to remove organic inorganic and microbiological pollutants from greywater 25 27 three main types of configurations were identified single biochar filter 10 studies multilayer based filter 8 studies and step in chain treatment 10 studies table 4 presents an overview of the system configuration and dimension evaluated in every single study the single biochar filter used a cylinder like shape container made of plastic and glass material it included five parts influent input top gravel layer biochar layer drainage gravel layer and effluent output the top gravel provided uniform distribution of the influent and prevented flotation of biochar particles and water evaporation 36 42 generally water flowed downward under non saturated and intermittent conditions most of the studies used a 2 5 cm depth of gravel in both the top and bottom sections of the filter to facilitate the flow of influent and effluent greywater respectively however depths of 5 cm 36 and 1 4 cm 44 were also reported among the studies the biochar section had a usual bed size of 50 60 cm except for biruktawit 44 and adonadaga et al 47 who used smaller bed heights to prevent the washing of smaller grains of media mosquito nets and wire mesh were installed between the gravel and biochar 47 in addition aluminium foil was used to pack the filters to impede light transmission and hence algae development 31 44 the typical height of the filter was 55 70 cm and although no reason was given columns of long lengths are assumed to provide longer biochar greywater contact time favouring the adsorption of pollutants 36 fig 6a the multilayer filters had a similar configuration to that of single biochar filters main differences were the number height and content of layers a simple multilayer filter composed of sand and biochar 7 39 as well as a complex six layer filter 8 were identified in this study fig 6b sand was among the most common filter material used probably due to its proven superior physicochemical properties to remove water pollutants 10 a broad variety of filter materials has been used in combination with biochar from organic mulch sawdust coconut shell and teff straw inorganic sponge sand gravel iron dust bricks and pebbles up to living one earthworms and soil arguments concerning the height selection of the layers were not further discussed by the authors however the distribution of the filter materials within the filter was reported to follow a particle size basis typically larger particles were in the upper layers while smaller grains in the lower ones favoured the filtering of contaminants as water flows downwards 8 between the studies only niwagaba et al 8 assessed the performance of a large scale multilayer filter as opposed to basnet 35 who did it in a small filter built in a laboratory funnel this literature review also found the use of biochar in filtration processes within defined greywater treatment chain treatment biochar has been utilized either as a single biochar filter 1 5 32 37 43 or a multilayer filter 38 40 48 56 with the same configuration as described previously as can be seen in table 4 typically biochar based column filters were used as a secondary treatment after preliminary and primary treatments with screening and sedimentation respectively fig 6c however some studies employed them as tertiary treatment mainly as a polishing step after biological treatment with cw 5 or bio bed 40 or after remediation with commercial a02 gwtp ecomotive greywater treatment unit 1 fig 6d unlike the two previous configurations that had a primary laboratory approach in this third type several authors evaluated the performance of biochar containing filters at large scale and on site greywater treatment systems 5 37 38 3 2 3 operating conditions of the filtration systems the operational parameters of both the biochar and biochar based filters are different from the studies reported in this literature review some authors evaluated the filter s capacity to withstand variations in the range of organic loading rate olr and hydraulic loading rate hlr 5 8 37 42 while others have assessed fixed values that simulate filter conditions at a large scale high hlr was associated with biofilm washing whereas low hlr caused thinner biofilm and consequently narrowed the internal pores reducing the straining of bacterial particles 6 37 in terms of the period of study each had a different time for performance analysis of the filters from table 4 it can also be seen that 13 4 and 8 studies were carried out in periods longer than 30 between 8 and 29 and shorter than 7 days respectively as expected lab based experiments had shorter assessment times than large scale on site treatment systems 1 5 32 37 the hydraulic residence time hrt was another parameter examined as it is associated with biochar physicochemical properties such as water holding capacity and porosity a minimum and maximum hrt of 30 and 240 h respectively were identified in the literature 5 8 as table 4 shows all reported hrt values were higher than conventional hrt values in the sand 0 5 h and some lower than activated carbon 119 h 31 37 a high hrt value is responsible for the degradation and nitrification of organic matter as it prolongs the contact between greywater and the biochar attached biofilm 44 3 2 4 untreated greywater characteristics greywater refers to wastewater generated in handwashing basins bathrooms washing machines showers kitchen sinks and dishwashers but excluding wastewater streams from toilets 57 according to its source and constituents greywater can be categorized as light and dark greywater the former includes wastewater with high pollutants strength such as laundry and kitchen sink wastewater while the latter includes wastewater with low pollutants concentrations like bathroom and washbasin wastewater 58 due to the absence of urine and faces contained in toilet wastewater in greywater it does not require the same in depth expensive and centralized treatment process as domestic wastewater 59 with the increasing demand for freshwater treated greywater reuse may reduce water needs for crop irrigation laundry and toilet flushing thus leaving the consumption of freshwater sources for primary activities 31 a considerable amount of literature has been published on the physical chemical and microbiological characteristics of greywater overall these studies indicate that the composition of greywater relies on factors such as quality of water source point of origin kitchen bathroom laundry or mixture water consumption style location household industry schools church and geographic location developed and developing countries 57 60 in this literature review the greywater came from various origins table 5 thus its composition was expected to be distinct 3 2 4 1 physical characteristics regarding the physical characteristics table 6 the range of turbidity total dissolved solids tds and total suspended solids tss were 1 24 791 ntu 141 1683 mg l and 5 84 5176 mg l respectively as stated previously these observed high end ranges were associated with the origin of greywater for instance a biochar filtration system operated with musta mal water or greywater from foot washing 38 while qrenawi mahmoud 7 employed kitchen greywater which contains food particles regarding tds owusu boateng et al 33 identified 141 206 mg l in a mixture of greywater in student residence halls and although the value is lower compared to adonadaga et al 47 and chithra dandapani 40 a possible explanation for this might be the demographics and water consumption habits of the water users in the study of owusu boateng et al 33 likewise when it comes to tss the high value of 5176 mg l found by niwagaba et al 8 in a mixture of greywater agrees with the 996 mg l of tss identified by katukiza 61 3 2 4 2 chemical characteristics turning now to the chemical characteristics ph was the parameter measured in most of the studies as can be seen from the table 7 the ph value is close to neutral in most of the greywater samples 1 5 7 44 except for an acidic and alkaline raw greywater of 4 8 and 8 5 reported by mohamed et al 34 and berger 31 respectively although there is no reason given by mohamed et al 34 to explain the acidity of the water it is assumed that it comes from organic compounds in foods however the alkaline greywater from berger 31 is attributed to the detergents and soaps used to prepare the raw synthetic greywater in the case of biological oxygen demand bod5 niwagaba et al 8 and qrenawi mahmoud 7 obtained the highest values with 4667 2198 mg l and 1175 25 mg l respectively it seems possible that the former value is due to a mixture of the kitchen laundry and bathroom streams whereas the latter value is higher than the average value of 604 5 mg l for kitchen greywater suggested by shaikh ahammed 57 and ghaitidak et al 60 similar behaviour was observed for chemical oxygen demand cod however the cod value of 1908 108 mg l described in qrenawi mahmoud 7 is below the average value of 2074 5 mg l stated in shaikh ahammed 57 3 2 4 3 nutrients as shown in table 8 the concentration of nutrients nitrogen n and phosphorus p differ broadly in line with the type of streams as expected most of the reviewed studies indicated total nitrogen tn values below the average range in domestic wastewater 20 80 mg l mainly because of the exclusion of urine faces in greywater 62 high concentrations of tn as shown by berger 31 may be associated with the usage of protein containing cleaning materials employed in the synthetic greywater the concentration of total phosphorus tp also varied from 0 53 0 18 mg l 1 to 90 mg l 39 high tp values are related to the usage of phosphorus containing washing products detergents and soaps in countries where they have not been banned mainly in low and middle income countries 35 3 2 4 4 microbiological characteristics according to maimon et al 63 the presence of pathogenic organisms in greywater represents a risk to people s health when in contact thus the monitoring of microbial pollutants is essential to ensure greywater for safety reuse the main potential sources of microbial contamination are faecal pollution handwashing after using the toilet nappy washing raw food products e g meat and washing children s clothes 39 57 60 table 9 shows the levels of microbial indicators and pathogens in greywater identified in the reviewed studies a total of twelve microbial indicators have been characterized in eight out of the 28 studies including dalahmeh 36 dalahmeh et al 37 and perez mercado et al 42 faecal coliform fc concentrations reported by niwagaba et al 8 4 2 10 7 3 79 10 7 cfu 100 ml and biruktawit 44 2 88 10 3 3 76 10 3 cfu 100 ml were found above and below than fc value of 5 4 10 7 cfu 100 ml described by kariuki et al 64 in a study with similar greywater source and geography 3 2 5 removal mechanisms of pollutants from greywater in bcfs biochar adsorption mechanism is dependent on the heterogeneity of the adsorbent surface and the nature of the pollutant adsorbate in the case of organic contaminants electrostatic attraction hydrophobic sorption hydrogen bond π π electron donor acceptor interactions and pores fillings facilitate the adsorption process 18 the production of biochar at high temperatures causes the dissociation of oxygen containing groups which charges biochar negatively and facilitates its electrostatic attraction toward positively charged pollutants additionally high temperature biochar production originates in biochar surfaces with fewer oxygen and hydrogen containing functional groups which make them less suitable for removing polar organic compounds as their polarity is lowered 18 19 55 under this condition adsorption can take place by hydrogen bonding because of the electrostatic repulsion between both negatively charged biochar and organic compounds in pore filling adsorbate condensation occurs in adsorbent pores depending on their micropore and mesopore volumes 18 42 a low ionic radius of some pollutants promotes their penetration into biochar and as a result biochar s adsorption capacity is increased 18 in the case of soluble contaminants containing hydrophobic functional groups they can be removed by hydrophobic sorption when they are attached to hydrophobic sites from biochar 18 for the removal of inorganic pollutants mainly heavy metals the adsorption occurs through electrostatic attraction ion exchange complexation and co precipitation and physical adsorption mechanisms in complexation and co precipitation metals present in greywater can form either complex with oxide minerals or free carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups available on the biochar surface then they settle physical sorption or form layers precipitation on the biochar surface 18 fig 7 depicts the estimated removal mechanisms happening in bcfs based on existing literature on biochar application for wastewater treatment when biochar is used as a filtration support media in bcfs for greywater treatment several mechanisms are responsible for pollutant removal although the dominant removal mechanism is dependent on several factors such as biochar s physicochemical properties system configuration and operation condition 18 initially suspended solids agglomerate forming large particles that precipitate on the filter surface 18 42 65 next as the smaller particles continue their flow downwards they are strained and adsorbed on the biochar surface while the anaerobic conditions on the deeper filter zones promote the removal of organic matter by hydrolysis 18 36 37 pathogen removal takes place under different mechanisms for instance biofilm formation on the attachment sites of the biochar surface enhances the reduction of pathogens by adsorbing viruses and bacteria through electrostatic attraction 18 likewise the presence of several layers of biofilm on biochar reduces the pore size between biochar particles allowing a larger number of pathogens to be removed by filtration and adsorption 8 18 42 3 2 5 1 physical characteristics of effluent greywater as can be seen in table 10 the two most common parameters to assess the physical aspect of the treated greywater were turbidity and tds overall the removal percentage of turbidity ranged between 70 and 96 in most studies similar reductions of 73 4 and 71 2 were reported in biochar filters operated at rapid 5 l h and slow 3 l h flow rates respectively biochar also had a better performance in removing turbidity than other filter media qrenawi mahmoud 7 and moges et al 1 described a decrease of 95 5 and 84 respectively compared to sand sawdust and filtralite tds was also highly reduced up to 83 4 45 and although no explanation for those values was provided by the studies included in this literature review kaetzl et al 65 argued that both turbidity and tds are removed through successive steps starting with the agglomeration and sedimentation of coarse particles followed by filtration on the upper filter zone and straining and adsorption of fine particles on the biochar locate along the deeper zones of the biochar filter nevertheless an increase in tds was reported by niwagaba et al 8 and yaseen et al 10 possibly due to the lack of biochar rinsing to remove biochar dust from the filter before functioning or the release of particles from biochar natural degradation over time tss was also reduced at high levels between 55 and 99 1 for instance niwagaba et al 8 showed a tss reduction of 86 7 for a biochar filter operated at 36 h hrt the same removal mechanisms for turbidity and tds are accountable for tss reduction temperature is another physical parameter of relevance since it influences bacteria adsorption to porous media according to sidibe 6 bacterial surface polymers become viscous at low temperatures chemisorption and certain types of physical adsorption are reduced and the organisms physiology is altered overall room temperature 25 c was the most common among the reviewed studies table 10 3 2 5 2 chemical characteristics of effluent greywater several chemical parameters were evaluated to assess the efficiency of biochar filters in removing chemical pollutants table 11 in the case of ph the lowest and highest values reported were 6 15 43 and 10 5 44 respectively while most of the reviewed studies reported values closely to 7 neutral large reductions of organic matter cod and bod5 were also achieved with removal above 80 and up to 98 9 and 99 1 reported in most studies respectively several studies have concluded that a large specific surface area is the main driven mechanism for organic matter removal since better adsorption capacity and biofilm development were observed in biochar with smaller effective particle sizes 18 36 66 the decrease in organic matter cod and bod5 was attributed to two consecutive periods driven by physicochemical and biological processes initially the organic matter is absorbed into the reactive sites on the surface of the biochar but as they deplete and biofilm layers develop biological processes are responsible for the breakdown of organic matter 3 2 5 3 nutrient removal from greywater the removal of nitrogen is accomplished through several processes mainly ammonium adsorption microbial assimilation and molecule breakdown through denitrification 36 as can be seen in table 12 the removal of nutrients such as n and p varied in each study basnet 35 reported low total n and p removal of up to 10 and 27 compared to ferric sulphate enriched biochar which was able to reduce n and p concentrations up to 23 and 41 respectively however high removal percentages of 90 94 and 89 3 have also been reported respectively 31 several factors influence the decrease of n and p inside the biochar filter biruktawit 44 found that significant n and p reductions of 94 and 78 8 were achieved in a neutral environment ph 7 biochar grain size also plays a role in nutrient removal fine biochar particles 1 mm eliminated more n 62 and p 52 than medium 1 3 mm and coarse 3 mm biochar 44 however a similar study to biruktawit 44 did not find significant differences in the removal of total n and p when 2 mm and 2 4 7 mm biochar size were evaluated 39 as the size of the biochar particles decreases the surface area increases promoting both adsorption of ammonium and biofilm development in the majority of the studies reviewed the level of ammonium reduction was particularly high as values above 62 were described except for berger 31 who reported 2 7 removal table 12 moreover as noted in table 12 the nitrate concentration removal was more than 60 in various studies and even reached 94 4 in salihu wamdeo 39 meaning that biochar increases nutrient removal rates thereby reducing design residence time this is due to the activity of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria developed under anaerobic conditions on the deeper filter zones which enhances nitrate removal by reducing it to ammonium however although most of the revised studies in this review reported high nitrate reductions other studies such as sidibe 6 and yao et al 67 found biochar without the ability to sorb nitrate perhaps because of a rapid occupation of active adsorption sites on biochar surface which limit the formation of denitrifying bacteria the high nitrate removal reported by salihu wamdeo 39 can be related to the addition of sand into the biochar filter media as previously described by bock et al 68 in studies on denitrifying bioreactors with biochar sand mixtures where nitrate reduction was enhanced 3 2 5 4 microbiological characteristics of effluent greywater several studies have assessed the efficiency of biochar filters in removing model bacterial escherichia coli and enterococcus spp viral bacteriophages ms2 and ɸx174 and protozoan oocyst saccharomyces cerevisiae as they are indicators of faecal contamination presence of human viruses and surrogates for the intestinal track of pathogenic cryptosporidium parvum respectively 36 other studies evaluated microbial removal using a non specific microorganism and a general microbial counting test total bacterial count no 100 ml and most probable number mpn 100 ml 1 5 low log10 reductions of viruses ɸx174 0 9 0 5 and ms2 1 4 0 8 were reported by dalahmeh 36 it was suggested that the low adsorption of the viruses was influenced by the ph of the filter media table 13 which affected the isoelectric point of the viruses ph where a virus molecule is chargeless as the isoelectric point isp of both ɸx174 and ms2 occurs in acidic conditions the alkali medium in the filters limited the adsorption of the viruses 71 additionally the straining process carried out inside the filter media is not effective as the bacterial viruses are of small size 0 02 0 25 μm on the other hand a similar relatively high reduction of salmonella spp was observed in sidibe 6 dalahmeh 36 and molaei 4 of 2 7 2 4 and 3 log10 respectively table 13 these results are likely to be related to a straining mechanism of salmonella spp when flowing through the microspores within the filter media 3 2 6 comparison between biochar and conventional filter media some studies evaluated the use of biochar filters as a replacement for conventional filter media used for greywater cleaning such as activated carbon sand bark rice husk filtralite and sawdust the tss removal percentages above 90 were reported in rice husk rice husk biochar and rice husk activated carbon filters operating with rapid 3 207 l h and slow 0 534 l h flow rates respectively similarly moges et al 1 found that biochar filters performed best in removing turbidity from greywater when used as polishing material in terms of the chemical pollutants both berger 31 and dalahmeh 36 reported similar high cod reductions of 99 and above 94 in biochar and activated carbon filters functioning at an hlr of 0 043 and 0 032 0 2 m3 m2 day respectively salihu wamdeo 39 also reported high treatment efficiencies for both types of filters however found higher cod removal 85 95 in activated carbon filter than in biochar filter 76 90 similarly sidibe 6 found that activated carbon filters were most effective in reducing cod levels than biochar and bark since they reached removals of 96 90 and 82 respectively adonadaga et al 47 on the other hand identified a low cod reduction of 60 in both biochar and sawdust filters but high removal in sand filter 97 65 the presence of nutrients n and p in the effluent greywater was another parameter compared among the filters berger 31 pointed out that filters made from biochar were best at removing tp and phosphate po₄3 89 and 86 respectively than activated carbon filter 78 and 70 respectively salihu wamdeo 39 found an opposite result however emphasizing a decrease in tp content up to 92 similarly to cod removal in adonadaga et al 2020 phosphate removal was higher in the sand 99 92 than in biochar 83 98 filters with the latter better than the sawdust filter 20 52 in the case of nitrogen contradictory findings were described berger 31 and salihu wamdeo 39 achieved removal above 90 in both biochar and activated carbon filters while sidibe 6 reported no reduction again when compared to sand the biochar filter appeared to remove more total nitrogen dalahmeh 36 and adonadaga et al 47 reported reduction percentages of 52 0 and 58 8 compared to 3 0 and 28 3 respectively lastly in terms of microbe reduction biochar removed more salmonella spp 2 72 log10 reductions and e faecalis 1 51 log10 reduction than activated carbon 1 55 and 1 32 log10 reduction respectively and bark 1 43 and 1 26 log10 reduction respectively filters nevertheless biochar filters removed less ms2 and similar ɸx174 compared to the rest of the filters although operating at the same hlr molaei 4 reported that activated carbon filters performed best at removing all microbe pollution parameters previously mentioned 3 2 7 influence of biochar characteristics on removal efficiency biochar s parental material and production conditions determine its physicochemical properties to analyse the influence of biochar characteristics on removal efficiency only the physical properties e g size density and porosity will be considered the impact of chemical properties e g surface functional group will not be discussed since that information was not provided by the studies revised for this literature review dalahmeh 36 reported a converse relationship between biochar particle size and hrt for instance a shorter 66 h hrt was found on bcfs filled with 2 8 mm biochar in comparison to longer 85 h and 87 h ones reported for bcfs using 0 7 mm and 1 4 mm biochar respectively macropores with large particle sizes usually connect creating channels for wastewater flow without enough contact time between pollutants and the filter media under such conditions effluents from filters will contain some non treated greywater since the removal mechanisms will be limited as biochar particle size and fraction within bcfs rule the hrt of the system fine particle sizes smaller than 0 1 mm can lead to clogging and biochar dust affecting the effluent quality in the present review the most common range of particle size was 1 5 mm except for emslie 41 who used particle size of 0 25 2 mm as can be seen in table 3 although particle size is a determinant factor for pollutant removal nine studies in this review failed to provide that information to help understand their relationship with reduction efficiency additionally information regarding the pre rinsing of bcfs filled with 1 mm particle size to remove the biochar dusty fraction was not stated 32 41 44 this means that further studies comparing pre rinsed and non pre rinsed bcfs filled with fine biochar particles and operated under similar conditions are required to understand better the effect of size on insufficient hydraulic conductivity within bcfs in terms of pollutant removal perez mercado et al 42 found that smaller biochar particles indicate higher fractions of micropores which enhances microbe removal by increasing the contact between microbes and adsorption sites on both biofilm and filter media biochar moreover the removal of smaller microorganisms e g bacteria is dominated by adsorption on the biofilm surface nevertheless as reported by sidibe 6 the reduction of larger microbes such as salmonella spp in bcfs is driven by straining processes which are associated with the size and proportion of pores in the filter media similarly the reduction of organic matter and nutrients by biological activity is favoured on the high specific surface area of biochar in this literature review the reported range varied from 118 to 200 m2 g this is because more surface area is available for biofilm to grow and degrade organic matter hydrolysis or remove tn by denitrification routes in anaerobic zones 36 although biochar particle size affects the removal mechanisms taking place on biochar surface it is not possible to conclude what is the exact range of size that allows better removal efficiency since every bcfs reported in this literature review is different in configuration and operating conditions table 4 therefore future research should focus on the optimization of bcfs using a mathematical model to estimate the effect of bcfs s characteristics independent variables on pollutant removal dependent variable 3 2 8 influence of operating conditions on removal efficiency the operating conditions in terms of olr hlr and hrt play a key role in the removal efficiency of greywater pollutants by bcfs for the case of physical pollutants such as tss a longer hrt allows better agglomeration and followed sedimentation of the suspended solids present in the supernatant water 8 18 as sediments settle onto the biochar surface the pore space between biochar particles is reduced enabling the straining of coarse solids and larges microorganisms e g protozoa and amoebas 42 additionally when bcfs treats high strength greywater containing salts and bulking agents from detergents at high hlr salts resulting from the greywater degradation are released increasing the concentration of tds 8 the removal of organic matter under the effect of operating conditions for bcfs was also studied similar bod5 removal percentages of 96 1 and 93 were reported at low 64 l m2 day and high 114 l m2 day hlr respectively similarly dalahmeh 36 found no differences in the decrease of cod and bod5 at hlr of 37 200 l m2 day likewise the olr did not affect the biochar filter s performance to reduce organic matter a reduction above 90 was noted even though the olr ranged from 3 9 to 1580 g bod5 m2 day 4 6 8 37 nevertheless higher cod removal was observed at higher olr suggesting that higher organic loads speed up the microbiological activity thus stimulating the mineralization process 36 67 70 in the case of hrt the elimination of cod and bod5 above 90 was promoted with a longer hrt 8 36 44 the removal of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus depends on the hlr and the physicochemical properties of biochar for instance dalahmeh 36 evaluated the removal of tn and tp in a bcfs operated at 32 200 l m2 day of hlr and found that higher tn removal was achieved at hlr below 50 l m2 day and biochar particle size of 1 4 mm this loading rate and particle size avoided biofilm washing thus favouring tn removal by adsorption of nh4 n on biochar surface biological assimilation and denitrification activity on anaerobic zones the removal of tp on the other hand was less dependent on the hlr but the chemical properties of biochar for instance when sand and biochar filters operate at similar hlr and olr sand filter removes more tp due to its capacity to bind phosphorus with ca fe and al located on the sand surface 36 the operating conditions of biochar filters also play a significant role in the removal of microbes perez mercado et al 42 evaluated the removal of bacterial and viral indicators at hlr higher 200 and 400 l m2 day than conventional hlr for sand filtration treatment 34 l m2 day it was demonstrated that high hlr decreased both the biofilm straining process and contact time between microbes and active sites as thinner biofilm layers formed this affected the microbe removal as a consistent low reduction of 1 log10 was found in each microorganism analysed nevertheless the low olr at which the biochar filter operated 4 5 and 15 g bod5 m2 day caused thinning of the biofilm layers affecting the straining process like the influence of high hlr likewise niwagaba et al 8 observed increases in the elimination of faecal coliforms fc as the retention time increased reduction of up to 95 6 was achieved at 36 h of retention time in comparison to 43 3 at one third retention time table 13 this observed increase in fc removal was attributed to higher microbial retention in the pores of the filter media and biofilm maturity as time prolonged similarly biruktawit 44 identified removal efficiencies of 87 and 90 in filters composed of purely biochar and a mixture of biochar and sand respectively when they functioned at residence times of 6 days overall the studies in this review analysed the effect of operating conditions of bcfs on removal efficiency and drawn reasonings as to how they affected or enhanced the removal mechanisms responsible for pollutants reductions however since the characteristics of bcfs in terms of the type of biochar operation time loading rates layer configuration composition of wastewater and scale are different among the bcfs used in the studies the influence of operating conditions on removal efficiency cannot be generalized but specific to each study therefore further studies are needed to develop integrated design criteria for the construction of bcfs treating greywater for water reuse 3 2 9 influence of filter configuration on removal efficiency as stated previously three types of bcfs configuration were used in the reviewed studies single biochar filter multilayer based filter and as a polishing step for tertiary greywater treatment none of the studies explained the selection of bed size range of 20 70 cm and filter diameter range of 4 3 20 cm and their role in enhancing pollutant removal mechanisms it is assumed that longer columns provide better contact between greywater and active adsorption sites from biochar favouring the physical chemical and biological removal routes to take place 36 the influence of the ratio between bed size and filter diameter on removal efficiency was unexplored in all studies table 4 this is a relevant design parameter considering that airspace can be formed along the filter s walls under non optimum filter diameter leading to the creation of artificial channels where water flows rapidly with less contact with active adsorption sites 69 the operation time is known to determine the maturity of the biochar filter system in terms of the biofilm formation on the biochar surface the operation time in the studies analysed in this review paper oscillates from days to months typically long operated filters develop thinner biofilm layers affecting positively the removal of organic matter nutrients tn and pathogens for instance niwagaba et al 8 reported that extended operation of biochar filters creates anaerobic zones for the denitrifying microorganism in the micro and nanopores of biochar likewise longer assessment periods are useful to determine the maximum adsorption capacity of biochar and the robustness of bcfs under sudden changes in operating conditions when greywater flows continuously regarding this all the studies lacked the provision of breakthrough curves to estimate the time when pollutant removal starts to decrease and therefore biochar s capacity has been reached this means that the removal efficiencies described in tables 10 13 must be carefully analysed as they may not be representative of a particular configuration type besides the use of biochar as a unique filter media biochar has also been used together and as part of a mixture with other filter media table 4 although the removal efficiency among multilayers filters described in this review is not comparable due to differences mainly in layer disposition operation time and loading rate it can be generally assumed that filter media with distinct physicochemical characteristics than biochar boost the pollutant efficiency of bcfs for example the addition of sand layer or sand including mixtures has been shown to diminish the concentration of tp by binding phosphorus with ca fe and al present on sand 36 however further studies are required to determine whether the removal efficiency and longevity of bcfs operating under similar conditions are dependent on the addition of different kinds of filter media particularly an in depth study is needed to understand the existence of changes in removal mechanism dynamics concerning layers disposition and depth table 4 also shows that ten of the reviewed studies evaluated the use of bcfs as part of a greywater treatment chain when comparing the removal efficiency between this type of configuration and single or multilayer bcfss special attention should be given to removal efficiency data given by the authors to represent the overall pollutant removal efficiency of the whole treatment chain or only from the biochar containing filter used as tertiary treatment higher removal efficiencies can be observed for bcfs functioning as a tertiary treatment 5 40 however these values can be overestimated as influent pollutant concentrations were reduced during preliminary treatment screening primary clarifier sedimentation tank and secondary treatment constructed wetlands fig 6 as this type of configuration involves successive steps for greywater treatment further investigation is needed to determine the relationship between durability and cost when compared to the other configuration types additionally the use of biochar along the treatment chain for instance as both adsorbent filter media and substrate for phytoremediation in constructed wetlands can be further explored 3 2 10 treated greywater for water reuse table 14 summarizes the different purposes of reuse of treated greywater that are described in each of the studies reviewed as well as the regulations and suitability of reuse achieved greywater was mainly treated for non potable reuse such as toilet flushing floor washing car washing cloth washing and irrigation of land garden and edible crops however minor reuse purposes for safety effluent discharge 36 45 47 nutrient recycling 35 and potable purposes for ablution 38 were also identified the suitability of treated greywater reuse was assessed mostly under local guidelines of reuse however international wastewater reuse standards such as world health organization who united states environmental protection agency usepa food agricultural organization fao eu guidelines were also used to evaluate compliance with water quality regulations in treated greywater most studies reviewed achieved the reuse regulations meaning that all parameters physical chemical nutrients and microbiological chosen to measure the water quality were met while others emphasized the parameters below the limits established in the regulations 41 47 49 although most studies met reuse standards the meaning of these results must be critically addressed several studies were performed at lab scale filters operated in the short term although high contaminants removal was reached still the performance of the filter at up scale and long term conditions remains unknown additionally a weakness observed in all studies is the failure to address the reasons on which the selection of water quality parameters is based the authors do not explain whether this selection is driven by economic technical or regulatory based reasons the differences in number and type of quality parameters can be seen in tables 6 9 moreover the replicability of biochar filters and successful compliance for greywater reclamation in various studies appears to be limited to national levels since governmental greywater reuse guidelines were used to conclude the suitability of water for reuse only two studies compared the compliance of their results to international wastewater reuse standards 31 39 in a few studies on the other hand authors argued the possibility of reuse based on the positive result of a limited number of water quality parameters for instance both abd rahman et al 38 and emslie 41 concluded that effluent greywater meets drinking water regulations nevertheless very few quality parameters for this category of reuse were analysed to reach this conclusion lastly some studies would appear to be over ambitious in their claims of achieving water quality for crop irrigation out of ten studies treating greywater for irrigation either restricted or unrestricted half of them did not evaluate microbial contamination necessary to prevent reclaimed greywater from harming human health 7 9 32 33 49 3 2 11 potential new areas of research various topics for further investigation could be identified in the reviewed studies perceptions toward greywater reuse among users are fundamental to measuring social acceptability for on site reclaimed greywater treatment systems 72 however only two of the revised studies evaluated this area focusing on greywater reuse for non potable purposes 8 49 further research should be undertaken to investigate the level of social acceptability for greywater reuse for potable purposes additionally future work is required to determine the effect of operating conditions such as water quality on the efficiency of biochar filters to remove pollutants from greywater strong focus should be given to the influence of higher hydraulic and organic loading rates on the cleaning capacity of biochar filters this type of study could help solve unanswered questions about the robustness of biochar filters when exposed to sudden high loads of greywater and organic matter content an optimization study using a mathematical model could help assess the individual influence of bcfs s characteristics on pollutant removal as mentioned earlier the technical and environmental feasibility of biochar filters for greywater reclamation was determined through lab based and short term experiments thus further studies on the same topic but at a pilot and on site scales of long term duration are therefore recommended 7 31 44 in addition there is also plenty of room for further research on the creation of integrated design criteria to dimension biochar filters for greywater treatment which lacked in the studies 36 concerning this single biochar filter could explore the cleaning capacity of smaller biochar particle size and biochar whose parent material is other than wood the main feedstock source in the reviewed studies multilayer biochar filters on the other hand should test different layer configurations mainly position and depth for configurations where bcfs is part of a treatment chain the potential use of biochar as a growth medium for phytoremediation plants in coupled systems between constructed wetlands and bcfs can be explored further as can be seen in table 14 the reuse of treated greywater for non potable purposes has been widely explored there is still much to be done in determining the technical environmental and economic feasibility of using biochar filters to obtain treated greywater of high quality for human contact reuse purposes such as handwashing this implies that microbial removal must comply with strict microbiological local and or international regulations to ensure contact with treated water is safe for human health 73 74 further studies should identify and evaluate the removal of microorganisms other than the limited number seen in the studies reviewed the study of potential natural synergist and antagonist microorganisms is another field with unresolved questions but is highly important as they may induce and enhance the removal of microbial pollution additionally because of the susceptibility of biofilm to sudden changes in environmental conditions its degradation at high and low hlr and olr must be investigated there is also a need for further studies to determine if the removal efficiency and longevity of bcfs under similar conditions vary with the addition of different types of filter media an in depth study is specifically required to better understand the dynamics of layers disposition and depth with removal mechanisms additionally the negative effects of both natural degradation of biochar on effluent quality can be further explored to provide insight into the maximum time of use for potential bcfs users moreover the effect of alkaline greywater resulting from the usage of cleaning products such as detergents and soaps on biofilm degradation should be assessed to ensure biological processes inside the filter are maintained lastly as most of the methods to modify the surface of biochar are of physical and chemical character 75 the search for natural or biological methods is highly necessary they could favour the removal of greywater pollutants and be of easy replicability in low and middle income countries where low cost and nature based onsite wastewater treatment prevail 4 conclusion through a systematic literature review 28 studies from different source types such as articles dissertations and scientific reports have been identified to use biochar in column filtration systems for greywater treatment out of a 10 years period of study a predominance of studies was observed in the last five years and particularly in regions such as asia europe and africa the treatment of greywater from different sources has predominantly been performed in three types of filter configuration single layer biochar filter multilayer biochar based filter and as part of an integrated greywater treatment chain differences in operation conditions have been identified throughout the reviewed studies owing to strategies to achieve country specific water quality for greywater reclamation however the main similarity observed in most of the studies was the use of wood as the main feedstock material several removal processes take place within bcfs such as agglomeration precipitation sedimentation straining adsorption hydrolysis and biological assimilation overall bcfs showed high efficiency in the removal of nutrients and physical and chemical pollutants but not microbial pollutants which still surpass countries permissible limits for greywater reuse the use of treated greywater for non potable purposes such as irrigation toilet flushing laundry and cleaning has been widely studied however the field of greywater treatment for potable purposes is still largely unexplored in general the bcfs technology can be a feasible and sustainable alternative for greywater treatment and application in water scarce regions the following is the supplementary data related

12960,biochar based column filtration systems bcfs for greywater treatment have gained attention in the last decade however a review of the state of the art on this subject has not been conducted leaving the analysis and limitations of the available research still unexplored this paper reviews the current literature to give insights into the technology and identify new areas of investigation this study used a systematic review approach to evaluate the documentation relating to the technology s worldwide status configuration removal mechanisms removal efficiency and water reuse applications in total 28 studies were reported in 16 countries including india and sweden as leading ones three filter column configurations were identified single biochar filter multilayer filter and polishing step in the treatment chain the pollutant removal efficiency of bcfs ranged between 50 and 99 treated greywater is reused mainly for non potable purposes such as toilet flushing cloth washing and crop irrigation overall this technology can be a feasible and sustainable alternative for greywater treatment and application in water scarce regions however further research is needed on social perception toward potable water reuse new feedstocks for biochar production the scaling up and long term assessment evaluation of additional water microbial indicators and the modification of biochar to target specific water reuse purposes graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biochar column filtration system greywater water reuse water scarce regions 1 introduction water is an essential resource for the functioning of ecosystem services that benefit human beings 1 nevertheless nearly 4 billion people faced water scarcity and 2 billion people were settled in countries with water stress by 2019 2 as the world population grows places are urbanized and industry expands quickly both the water demand and amount of wastewater rise significantly 3 wastewater is of concern when discharged untreated in water bodies or soil as it is associated with eutrophication pathogenic pollution damage to soil s properties and mosquito breeding 4 however there are sustainable opportunities for water reclamation from wastewater that could help minimize the freshwater needs and preserve water bodies and soil leading to green development in society 5 as a type of wastewater greywater includes outflows from washbasins bathrooms kitchen sinks and laundry machines and accounts for 50 80 of the total wastewater generated in households and residential buildings 6 unlike sewage wastewater it contains less organic matter and harmful pathogens as it excludes water from toilets which includes urine and faces 7 therefore greywater is safer to manipulate and simpler to treat for reuse in non potable purposes such as crop irrigation garden watering toilet flushing and discharge into water bodies 8 10 biological processes such as membrane bioreactor mbr upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb and rotating biological contactor rbc have been widely used to remove organic matter contaminants in greywater due to their high efficiency however as they are mechanized they tend to be more appropriate for centralized treatment systems 5 efforts to promote a circular economy in the water sector have focused on searching sustainable on site wastewater treatment technologies over the last two decades 11 when compared to centralized systems locally based treatment solutions are characterized by requiring fewer capital costs and energy less maintenance and operation and are affordable in terms of local material availability 12 in the case of greywater nature based solutions such as constructed wetlands cw green walls gw vertical gardens vg and green roofs gr have been used as sustainable treatment techniques resulting in less carbon footprint and less new water demand 13 14 recently the reuse and recycling of waste materials as adsorbents for wastewater treatment has gained attention to find synergistic strategies to boost the circular economy in both the water and waste sectors 15 biochar a charcoal like substance produced by the thermal decomposition of organic material from agricultural and forestry wastes also called biomass in the absence of oxygen pyrolysis is an example of waste based adsorbent material it is widely used as a fertilizer for soil conditioning and carbon sequestration 16 17 new studies however have demonstrated its potential as an adsorbent in wastewater treatment due to its high surface area high porosity and reactive surface functional group 18 19 for instance biochar has been employed in the treatment of stormwater 20 21 municipal 22 agricultural 23 and industrial wastewaters 24 when it comes to greywater treatment several treatment technologies such as cw vg and gr have incorporated biochar as a filter media proving to remove organic and inorganic water pollutants 25 27 over the last decade the use of bcfs for greywater treatment has experienced a surge in interest from the academia community however there is a lack of in depth knowledge about the available literature on this topic therefore the main objective of this study is to systematically gather the available literature from a broad range of publications to provide insights into the existing research and identify new areas of investigation four research questions rq have been proposed to orientate the research process rq1 what is the world s status of research on the use of bcfs to treat greywater rq2 what are the types of configurations and style of operation of bcfs rq3 what is the pollutant removal potential by bcfs in comparison to conventional adsorbents rq4 what are the actual and potential applications of greywater once treated in bcfs 2 methods this study employed the systematic literature review slr approach to assess the existing literature on the topic of greywater treatment technologies and narrow it to the application of bcfs to answer the research questions the study adopted a modified version of the fourteen step approach by tawfik et al 28 and the five step outlined by denyer tranfield 29 in the first phase four objectives were formulated 1 investigate the world s status of research about the use of bcfs for greywater treatment 2 describe the configuration and operation of the treatment system 3 evaluate the suitability of bcfs to remove pollutants in greywater and 4 describe the applications of bcfs in the reuse of treated greywater the second phase comprised the formulation of the research strategy where search terms were defined to carefully examine the existing literature initially subject area related keywords were established and divided into three sets the first one was related to biochar bio char biochar charcoal char the second one to greywater greywater graywater grey water grey water laundry wastewater handwashing wastewater washbasin wastewater dishwashing wastewater cloth washing wastewater kitchen wastewater bathroom wastewater bathroom wastewater shower wastewater and the last one to treatment treatment reclamation and recycling after that sophisticated search strings were constructed using boolean logic and or with all possible combinations among the three sets of keywords a total of 180 search terms were composed before searching in databases supplementary material table s 1 it is worth mentioning that some search strings were redefined to deal with the search format of databases the second phase comprised the formulation of the research strategy where search terms were defined to carefully examine the existing literature initially subject area related keywords were established and divided into three sets the first one was related to biochar bio char biochar charcoal char the second one to greywater greywater graywater grey water grey water laundry wastewater handwashing wastewater washbasin wastewater dishwashing wastewater cloth washing wastewater kitchen wastewater bathroom wastewater bathroom wastewater shower wastewater and the last one to treatment treatment reclamation and recycling after that sophisticated search strings were constructed using boolean logic and or with all possible combinations among the three sets of keywords a total of 180 search terms were composed before searching in databases supplementary material table s 1 it is worth mentioning that some search strings were redefined to deal with the search format of databases as part of the third phase seven well known online publisher databases were selected for literature search google scholar researchgate base sciencedirect ingenta scopus and locate coventry university uk in addition the identification of relevant studies from the publication databases by using the search strings took place in the fourth phase a vigorous channelling process using inclusion exclusion criteria and quality attributes checklist of questions was performed to select the most adequate from the existing literature a total list of eight inclusion exclusion criteria with their rationale was suggested table 1 while a total of four quality attributes qa were applied to the potential studies qa1 does the study discuss the use of biochar in greywater treatment qa2 does the study refer to the use of biochar based column filtration systems in greywater treatment qa3 does the study show empirical results concerning the removal of pollutants in greywater treated in biochar based column filtration units and qa4 does the study provide information about the reuse of treated greywater in potable and or non potable water reuse applications the channelling processing consisted mainly of two steps screening and eligibility at first the total articles and dissertations were identified and stored in the reference management software zotero and duplicated articles were excluded afterwards a title and abstract screening was carried out to narrow the findings to those addressing the publication scope next the eligibility of the articles and dissertations was evaluated thus irrelevant duplicates and non full available texts were removed within the framework of established inclusion and exclusion criteria manual searching was conducted by searching reference lists from the articles and dissertations already screened and doing citation tracking data extraction was the fifth phase and consisted of an in depth reviewing and information collection of the filtered articles and dissertations a data extraction form in the shape of an excel spreadsheet was designed and six categories were proposed to guide the data collection process finally the most relevant studies were analysed and interpreted valuable data to answer the research questions was summarized in an excel spreadsheet then the results and discussion of the thematic content of the chosen studies were reported in a manuscript for further revision and submission to a peer review journal 3 results and discussion 3 1 descriptive analysis at the beginning 4130 sources were found using the set of all possible combinations between the three main sets of keywords this number was shortlisted to 1476 by deleting duplicates manually 233 and through the automatized option in the software zotero 2421 then this number was title and abstract screened and 1415 sources were removed thus a total of 61 sources were assessed for eligibility and 36 were eliminated for being irrelevant to the study focus 31 and lacking full text availability 5 manually 3 sources were added leaving 28 studies for further analysis fig 1 table 2 presents general information and a summary of the studies found 3 1 1 year of publication fig 2 illustrates the yearly distribution of the reviewed studies overall the number of publications fluctuated over the study period of the review 2010 2021 the record of publications had two peaks in 2014 and 2019 when six and seven studies were published respectively the observed increase in the first half could be attributed to an emerging interest in the water sector to seek replacement filter media for activated carbon in wastewater treatment after concerns related to high footprint and high production cost 31 39 unlike the period 2010 2015 toward the end of the second period in 2019 another increase in publishing was observed this result may be explained by the fact the water scarcity problem gained attention worldwide especially in water stress and low and middle income countries promoting the search for locally based materials in the process of decentralized wastewater treatment 7 41 43 45 3 1 2 geographical distribution the geographical distribution of the reviewed studies both by country and continent is represented in figs 3 and 4 respectively fig 3 provides the number of publications based on the authors country of affiliation overall publications were done in 16 countries including palestine sweden and india are the countries with notable contributions with 6 and 5 publications respectively followed by malaysia 3 and ghana 2 while the remaining territories only produced one study each further analysis demonstrated that although sweden and india share similar production in number their research efforts concentrated differently over time nearly 84 of swedish studies 5 were conducted in the period 2012 2016 while 80 of indian publications 4 were finalized between 2016 and 2020 this high research interest in biochar application for greywater remediation in sweden and generally in europe as can be observed in figs 3 and 4 might be due to the implementation of the european union eu circular economy strategy that aims to develop sustainable water recycling systems 50 51 a closer analysis of the european publications that represent 32 of the reviewed studies fig 4 reveals interesting facts they demonstrated that biochar use in greywater remediation has the potential to discharge safely treated wastewater into the environment avoid eutrophication in water bodies 31 36 reuse greywater in irrigation without risk to human health 4 6 37 42 ensure access to safe drinking water 49 and recycle nutrients 35 india and other asian countries such as malaysia and vietnam have also invested in biochar based greywater treatment research asian studies in this literature review accounted for 36 of the total publications fig 4 with india being the leader country unlike europe asian efforts have focused on using biochar in greywater treatment to cope with water shortages 5 32 46 and the absence of sewage systems in small cities to stop pouring untreated wastewater to open land 5 40 fig 4 also shows that several authors based in african countries have investigated the properties of biochar to reclaim greywater and thus reduce the consumption of limited freshwater sources 8 33 44 these efforts are helping african countries to meet the 2030 agenda for sustainable development goals sdgs especially in achieving sdg 3 good health and well being and sdg 6 clean water and sanitation 3 1 3 distribution by type of study fig 5 denotes the distribution by source type of the publications reviewed in this study article type is the main source of information 17 studies followed by dissertations 9 and lastly scientific reports 2 generally scholars mainly published in journals with an approach to zero waste management water and wastewater management and environmental technologies dissertation studies were fragmented into two levels undergraduate 2 and postgraduate 7 while 2 publications were categorized as scientific reports this low number of studies found may be due to the study s focus which includes only publications on the use of biochar based column filtration systems for greywater treatment table 1 although biochar has been widely used in the treatment of different types of wastewater and remediation technologies this study focused only on identifying the state of art only for bcfs used in the regeneration principally of greywater 3 2 content analysis 3 2 1 biochar in filtration systems for greywater treatment biochar can be defined as a carbon rich 85 porous and complex material produced from the pyrolysis hydrothermal carbonization gasification and torrefaction of several types of waste biomass such as agriculture forestry and municipal waste 52 53 today the use of biochar in the water sector has become increasingly popular due to biochar s enhanced physicochemical properties for water wastewater decontamination and remediation 54 specific surface area high porosity high cation exchange capacity ph surface functional groups surface reactivity and mineral composition are the main biochar properties that affect its capability to adsorb organic inorganic and even pathogenic contaminants in water 18 according to yaashikaa et al 55 several factors influence biochar s properties during production including the type of biomass temperature rate of heating retention time and pressure for instance enaime et al 18 concluded that high temperature pyrolysis commonly results in biochar with a larger surface area and pore volume making it ideal for the sorption of organic contaminants while inorganic pollutants can be removed more effectively by biochar produced at low temperature pyrolysis since it has more oxygen containing functional groups given all that has been mentioned identifying biochar characteristics is relevant to assessing its potential in the removal of pollutants from greywater as can be seen in table 3 in this literature review out of the 28 reviewed studies 21 provided information on the biochar used either about its feedstock source or physicochemical properties whereas 7 studies fail to acknowledge this information it is apparent from table 3 that almost all the studies utilized wood based biochar either pruning residues 48 leaves 7 or chopped trees among the authors only salihu wamdeo 39 pointed out that the selection of biochar from high lignin containing feedstock exhibited a molecular structure similar to that of activated carbon and may therefore replace it while the rest of them argued the selection was based primarily on local availability reasons comparing the results of biochar size overall the most common range was 1 5 mm however smaller and larger particle sizes of 0 25 mm 41 and 9 5 mm 45 respectively have also been reported this result may be explained by the fact that in thinner porous media the straining is greater and adsorption sites are abundant which can result in more reduction of pathogens 4 31 37 the specific surface area is another property of great importance as it contributes to the removal of pollutants and determines the suitability of filtration material to allow biofilm growth and consequently biological degradation processes for organic pollutants in this study it ranged from 118 to 200 m2 g and as expected it was higher and lower than sand 0 152 m2 g and activated carbon 1000 m2 g respectively 37 the total porosity varied from 42 to 74 and was higher than the typical porosity of sand particles 35 this implies that biochar has a better capacity for both water retention and biofilm development 31 3 2 2 configuration and set up of the filtration systems several treatment systems cw gw vg gr have incorporated biochar as a filter material in their configuration to remove organic inorganic and microbiological pollutants from greywater 25 27 three main types of configurations were identified single biochar filter 10 studies multilayer based filter 8 studies and step in chain treatment 10 studies table 4 presents an overview of the system configuration and dimension evaluated in every single study the single biochar filter used a cylinder like shape container made of plastic and glass material it included five parts influent input top gravel layer biochar layer drainage gravel layer and effluent output the top gravel provided uniform distribution of the influent and prevented flotation of biochar particles and water evaporation 36 42 generally water flowed downward under non saturated and intermittent conditions most of the studies used a 2 5 cm depth of gravel in both the top and bottom sections of the filter to facilitate the flow of influent and effluent greywater respectively however depths of 5 cm 36 and 1 4 cm 44 were also reported among the studies the biochar section had a usual bed size of 50 60 cm except for biruktawit 44 and adonadaga et al 47 who used smaller bed heights to prevent the washing of smaller grains of media mosquito nets and wire mesh were installed between the gravel and biochar 47 in addition aluminium foil was used to pack the filters to impede light transmission and hence algae development 31 44 the typical height of the filter was 55 70 cm and although no reason was given columns of long lengths are assumed to provide longer biochar greywater contact time favouring the adsorption of pollutants 36 fig 6a the multilayer filters had a similar configuration to that of single biochar filters main differences were the number height and content of layers a simple multilayer filter composed of sand and biochar 7 39 as well as a complex six layer filter 8 were identified in this study fig 6b sand was among the most common filter material used probably due to its proven superior physicochemical properties to remove water pollutants 10 a broad variety of filter materials has been used in combination with biochar from organic mulch sawdust coconut shell and teff straw inorganic sponge sand gravel iron dust bricks and pebbles up to living one earthworms and soil arguments concerning the height selection of the layers were not further discussed by the authors however the distribution of the filter materials within the filter was reported to follow a particle size basis typically larger particles were in the upper layers while smaller grains in the lower ones favoured the filtering of contaminants as water flows downwards 8 between the studies only niwagaba et al 8 assessed the performance of a large scale multilayer filter as opposed to basnet 35 who did it in a small filter built in a laboratory funnel this literature review also found the use of biochar in filtration processes within defined greywater treatment chain treatment biochar has been utilized either as a single biochar filter 1 5 32 37 43 or a multilayer filter 38 40 48 56 with the same configuration as described previously as can be seen in table 4 typically biochar based column filters were used as a secondary treatment after preliminary and primary treatments with screening and sedimentation respectively fig 6c however some studies employed them as tertiary treatment mainly as a polishing step after biological treatment with cw 5 or bio bed 40 or after remediation with commercial a02 gwtp ecomotive greywater treatment unit 1 fig 6d unlike the two previous configurations that had a primary laboratory approach in this third type several authors evaluated the performance of biochar containing filters at large scale and on site greywater treatment systems 5 37 38 3 2 3 operating conditions of the filtration systems the operational parameters of both the biochar and biochar based filters are different from the studies reported in this literature review some authors evaluated the filter s capacity to withstand variations in the range of organic loading rate olr and hydraulic loading rate hlr 5 8 37 42 while others have assessed fixed values that simulate filter conditions at a large scale high hlr was associated with biofilm washing whereas low hlr caused thinner biofilm and consequently narrowed the internal pores reducing the straining of bacterial particles 6 37 in terms of the period of study each had a different time for performance analysis of the filters from table 4 it can also be seen that 13 4 and 8 studies were carried out in periods longer than 30 between 8 and 29 and shorter than 7 days respectively as expected lab based experiments had shorter assessment times than large scale on site treatment systems 1 5 32 37 the hydraulic residence time hrt was another parameter examined as it is associated with biochar physicochemical properties such as water holding capacity and porosity a minimum and maximum hrt of 30 and 240 h respectively were identified in the literature 5 8 as table 4 shows all reported hrt values were higher than conventional hrt values in the sand 0 5 h and some lower than activated carbon 119 h 31 37 a high hrt value is responsible for the degradation and nitrification of organic matter as it prolongs the contact between greywater and the biochar attached biofilm 44 3 2 4 untreated greywater characteristics greywater refers to wastewater generated in handwashing basins bathrooms washing machines showers kitchen sinks and dishwashers but excluding wastewater streams from toilets 57 according to its source and constituents greywater can be categorized as light and dark greywater the former includes wastewater with high pollutants strength such as laundry and kitchen sink wastewater while the latter includes wastewater with low pollutants concentrations like bathroom and washbasin wastewater 58 due to the absence of urine and faces contained in toilet wastewater in greywater it does not require the same in depth expensive and centralized treatment process as domestic wastewater 59 with the increasing demand for freshwater treated greywater reuse may reduce water needs for crop irrigation laundry and toilet flushing thus leaving the consumption of freshwater sources for primary activities 31 a considerable amount of literature has been published on the physical chemical and microbiological characteristics of greywater overall these studies indicate that the composition of greywater relies on factors such as quality of water source point of origin kitchen bathroom laundry or mixture water consumption style location household industry schools church and geographic location developed and developing countries 57 60 in this literature review the greywater came from various origins table 5 thus its composition was expected to be distinct 3 2 4 1 physical characteristics regarding the physical characteristics table 6 the range of turbidity total dissolved solids tds and total suspended solids tss were 1 24 791 ntu 141 1683 mg l and 5 84 5176 mg l respectively as stated previously these observed high end ranges were associated with the origin of greywater for instance a biochar filtration system operated with musta mal water or greywater from foot washing 38 while qrenawi mahmoud 7 employed kitchen greywater which contains food particles regarding tds owusu boateng et al 33 identified 141 206 mg l in a mixture of greywater in student residence halls and although the value is lower compared to adonadaga et al 47 and chithra dandapani 40 a possible explanation for this might be the demographics and water consumption habits of the water users in the study of owusu boateng et al 33 likewise when it comes to tss the high value of 5176 mg l found by niwagaba et al 8 in a mixture of greywater agrees with the 996 mg l of tss identified by katukiza 61 3 2 4 2 chemical characteristics turning now to the chemical characteristics ph was the parameter measured in most of the studies as can be seen from the table 7 the ph value is close to neutral in most of the greywater samples 1 5 7 44 except for an acidic and alkaline raw greywater of 4 8 and 8 5 reported by mohamed et al 34 and berger 31 respectively although there is no reason given by mohamed et al 34 to explain the acidity of the water it is assumed that it comes from organic compounds in foods however the alkaline greywater from berger 31 is attributed to the detergents and soaps used to prepare the raw synthetic greywater in the case of biological oxygen demand bod5 niwagaba et al 8 and qrenawi mahmoud 7 obtained the highest values with 4667 2198 mg l and 1175 25 mg l respectively it seems possible that the former value is due to a mixture of the kitchen laundry and bathroom streams whereas the latter value is higher than the average value of 604 5 mg l for kitchen greywater suggested by shaikh ahammed 57 and ghaitidak et al 60 similar behaviour was observed for chemical oxygen demand cod however the cod value of 1908 108 mg l described in qrenawi mahmoud 7 is below the average value of 2074 5 mg l stated in shaikh ahammed 57 3 2 4 3 nutrients as shown in table 8 the concentration of nutrients nitrogen n and phosphorus p differ broadly in line with the type of streams as expected most of the reviewed studies indicated total nitrogen tn values below the average range in domestic wastewater 20 80 mg l mainly because of the exclusion of urine faces in greywater 62 high concentrations of tn as shown by berger 31 may be associated with the usage of protein containing cleaning materials employed in the synthetic greywater the concentration of total phosphorus tp also varied from 0 53 0 18 mg l 1 to 90 mg l 39 high tp values are related to the usage of phosphorus containing washing products detergents and soaps in countries where they have not been banned mainly in low and middle income countries 35 3 2 4 4 microbiological characteristics according to maimon et al 63 the presence of pathogenic organisms in greywater represents a risk to people s health when in contact thus the monitoring of microbial pollutants is essential to ensure greywater for safety reuse the main potential sources of microbial contamination are faecal pollution handwashing after using the toilet nappy washing raw food products e g meat and washing children s clothes 39 57 60 table 9 shows the levels of microbial indicators and pathogens in greywater identified in the reviewed studies a total of twelve microbial indicators have been characterized in eight out of the 28 studies including dalahmeh 36 dalahmeh et al 37 and perez mercado et al 42 faecal coliform fc concentrations reported by niwagaba et al 8 4 2 10 7 3 79 10 7 cfu 100 ml and biruktawit 44 2 88 10 3 3 76 10 3 cfu 100 ml were found above and below than fc value of 5 4 10 7 cfu 100 ml described by kariuki et al 64 in a study with similar greywater source and geography 3 2 5 removal mechanisms of pollutants from greywater in bcfs biochar adsorption mechanism is dependent on the heterogeneity of the adsorbent surface and the nature of the pollutant adsorbate in the case of organic contaminants electrostatic attraction hydrophobic sorption hydrogen bond π π electron donor acceptor interactions and pores fillings facilitate the adsorption process 18 the production of biochar at high temperatures causes the dissociation of oxygen containing groups which charges biochar negatively and facilitates its electrostatic attraction toward positively charged pollutants additionally high temperature biochar production originates in biochar surfaces with fewer oxygen and hydrogen containing functional groups which make them less suitable for removing polar organic compounds as their polarity is lowered 18 19 55 under this condition adsorption can take place by hydrogen bonding because of the electrostatic repulsion between both negatively charged biochar and organic compounds in pore filling adsorbate condensation occurs in adsorbent pores depending on their micropore and mesopore volumes 18 42 a low ionic radius of some pollutants promotes their penetration into biochar and as a result biochar s adsorption capacity is increased 18 in the case of soluble contaminants containing hydrophobic functional groups they can be removed by hydrophobic sorption when they are attached to hydrophobic sites from biochar 18 for the removal of inorganic pollutants mainly heavy metals the adsorption occurs through electrostatic attraction ion exchange complexation and co precipitation and physical adsorption mechanisms in complexation and co precipitation metals present in greywater can form either complex with oxide minerals or free carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups available on the biochar surface then they settle physical sorption or form layers precipitation on the biochar surface 18 fig 7 depicts the estimated removal mechanisms happening in bcfs based on existing literature on biochar application for wastewater treatment when biochar is used as a filtration support media in bcfs for greywater treatment several mechanisms are responsible for pollutant removal although the dominant removal mechanism is dependent on several factors such as biochar s physicochemical properties system configuration and operation condition 18 initially suspended solids agglomerate forming large particles that precipitate on the filter surface 18 42 65 next as the smaller particles continue their flow downwards they are strained and adsorbed on the biochar surface while the anaerobic conditions on the deeper filter zones promote the removal of organic matter by hydrolysis 18 36 37 pathogen removal takes place under different mechanisms for instance biofilm formation on the attachment sites of the biochar surface enhances the reduction of pathogens by adsorbing viruses and bacteria through electrostatic attraction 18 likewise the presence of several layers of biofilm on biochar reduces the pore size between biochar particles allowing a larger number of pathogens to be removed by filtration and adsorption 8 18 42 3 2 5 1 physical characteristics of effluent greywater as can be seen in table 10 the two most common parameters to assess the physical aspect of the treated greywater were turbidity and tds overall the removal percentage of turbidity ranged between 70 and 96 in most studies similar reductions of 73 4 and 71 2 were reported in biochar filters operated at rapid 5 l h and slow 3 l h flow rates respectively biochar also had a better performance in removing turbidity than other filter media qrenawi mahmoud 7 and moges et al 1 described a decrease of 95 5 and 84 respectively compared to sand sawdust and filtralite tds was also highly reduced up to 83 4 45 and although no explanation for those values was provided by the studies included in this literature review kaetzl et al 65 argued that both turbidity and tds are removed through successive steps starting with the agglomeration and sedimentation of coarse particles followed by filtration on the upper filter zone and straining and adsorption of fine particles on the biochar locate along the deeper zones of the biochar filter nevertheless an increase in tds was reported by niwagaba et al 8 and yaseen et al 10 possibly due to the lack of biochar rinsing to remove biochar dust from the filter before functioning or the release of particles from biochar natural degradation over time tss was also reduced at high levels between 55 and 99 1 for instance niwagaba et al 8 showed a tss reduction of 86 7 for a biochar filter operated at 36 h hrt the same removal mechanisms for turbidity and tds are accountable for tss reduction temperature is another physical parameter of relevance since it influences bacteria adsorption to porous media according to sidibe 6 bacterial surface polymers become viscous at low temperatures chemisorption and certain types of physical adsorption are reduced and the organisms physiology is altered overall room temperature 25 c was the most common among the reviewed studies table 10 3 2 5 2 chemical characteristics of effluent greywater several chemical parameters were evaluated to assess the efficiency of biochar filters in removing chemical pollutants table 11 in the case of ph the lowest and highest values reported were 6 15 43 and 10 5 44 respectively while most of the reviewed studies reported values closely to 7 neutral large reductions of organic matter cod and bod5 were also achieved with removal above 80 and up to 98 9 and 99 1 reported in most studies respectively several studies have concluded that a large specific surface area is the main driven mechanism for organic matter removal since better adsorption capacity and biofilm development were observed in biochar with smaller effective particle sizes 18 36 66 the decrease in organic matter cod and bod5 was attributed to two consecutive periods driven by physicochemical and biological processes initially the organic matter is absorbed into the reactive sites on the surface of the biochar but as they deplete and biofilm layers develop biological processes are responsible for the breakdown of organic matter 3 2 5 3 nutrient removal from greywater the removal of nitrogen is accomplished through several processes mainly ammonium adsorption microbial assimilation and molecule breakdown through denitrification 36 as can be seen in table 12 the removal of nutrients such as n and p varied in each study basnet 35 reported low total n and p removal of up to 10 and 27 compared to ferric sulphate enriched biochar which was able to reduce n and p concentrations up to 23 and 41 respectively however high removal percentages of 90 94 and 89 3 have also been reported respectively 31 several factors influence the decrease of n and p inside the biochar filter biruktawit 44 found that significant n and p reductions of 94 and 78 8 were achieved in a neutral environment ph 7 biochar grain size also plays a role in nutrient removal fine biochar particles 1 mm eliminated more n 62 and p 52 than medium 1 3 mm and coarse 3 mm biochar 44 however a similar study to biruktawit 44 did not find significant differences in the removal of total n and p when 2 mm and 2 4 7 mm biochar size were evaluated 39 as the size of the biochar particles decreases the surface area increases promoting both adsorption of ammonium and biofilm development in the majority of the studies reviewed the level of ammonium reduction was particularly high as values above 62 were described except for berger 31 who reported 2 7 removal table 12 moreover as noted in table 12 the nitrate concentration removal was more than 60 in various studies and even reached 94 4 in salihu wamdeo 39 meaning that biochar increases nutrient removal rates thereby reducing design residence time this is due to the activity of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria developed under anaerobic conditions on the deeper filter zones which enhances nitrate removal by reducing it to ammonium however although most of the revised studies in this review reported high nitrate reductions other studies such as sidibe 6 and yao et al 67 found biochar without the ability to sorb nitrate perhaps because of a rapid occupation of active adsorption sites on biochar surface which limit the formation of denitrifying bacteria the high nitrate removal reported by salihu wamdeo 39 can be related to the addition of sand into the biochar filter media as previously described by bock et al 68 in studies on denitrifying bioreactors with biochar sand mixtures where nitrate reduction was enhanced 3 2 5 4 microbiological characteristics of effluent greywater several studies have assessed the efficiency of biochar filters in removing model bacterial escherichia coli and enterococcus spp viral bacteriophages ms2 and ɸx174 and protozoan oocyst saccharomyces cerevisiae as they are indicators of faecal contamination presence of human viruses and surrogates for the intestinal track of pathogenic cryptosporidium parvum respectively 36 other studies evaluated microbial removal using a non specific microorganism and a general microbial counting test total bacterial count no 100 ml and most probable number mpn 100 ml 1 5 low log10 reductions of viruses ɸx174 0 9 0 5 and ms2 1 4 0 8 were reported by dalahmeh 36 it was suggested that the low adsorption of the viruses was influenced by the ph of the filter media table 13 which affected the isoelectric point of the viruses ph where a virus molecule is chargeless as the isoelectric point isp of both ɸx174 and ms2 occurs in acidic conditions the alkali medium in the filters limited the adsorption of the viruses 71 additionally the straining process carried out inside the filter media is not effective as the bacterial viruses are of small size 0 02 0 25 μm on the other hand a similar relatively high reduction of salmonella spp was observed in sidibe 6 dalahmeh 36 and molaei 4 of 2 7 2 4 and 3 log10 respectively table 13 these results are likely to be related to a straining mechanism of salmonella spp when flowing through the microspores within the filter media 3 2 6 comparison between biochar and conventional filter media some studies evaluated the use of biochar filters as a replacement for conventional filter media used for greywater cleaning such as activated carbon sand bark rice husk filtralite and sawdust the tss removal percentages above 90 were reported in rice husk rice husk biochar and rice husk activated carbon filters operating with rapid 3 207 l h and slow 0 534 l h flow rates respectively similarly moges et al 1 found that biochar filters performed best in removing turbidity from greywater when used as polishing material in terms of the chemical pollutants both berger 31 and dalahmeh 36 reported similar high cod reductions of 99 and above 94 in biochar and activated carbon filters functioning at an hlr of 0 043 and 0 032 0 2 m3 m2 day respectively salihu wamdeo 39 also reported high treatment efficiencies for both types of filters however found higher cod removal 85 95 in activated carbon filter than in biochar filter 76 90 similarly sidibe 6 found that activated carbon filters were most effective in reducing cod levels than biochar and bark since they reached removals of 96 90 and 82 respectively adonadaga et al 47 on the other hand identified a low cod reduction of 60 in both biochar and sawdust filters but high removal in sand filter 97 65 the presence of nutrients n and p in the effluent greywater was another parameter compared among the filters berger 31 pointed out that filters made from biochar were best at removing tp and phosphate po₄3 89 and 86 respectively than activated carbon filter 78 and 70 respectively salihu wamdeo 39 found an opposite result however emphasizing a decrease in tp content up to 92 similarly to cod removal in adonadaga et al 2020 phosphate removal was higher in the sand 99 92 than in biochar 83 98 filters with the latter better than the sawdust filter 20 52 in the case of nitrogen contradictory findings were described berger 31 and salihu wamdeo 39 achieved removal above 90 in both biochar and activated carbon filters while sidibe 6 reported no reduction again when compared to sand the biochar filter appeared to remove more total nitrogen dalahmeh 36 and adonadaga et al 47 reported reduction percentages of 52 0 and 58 8 compared to 3 0 and 28 3 respectively lastly in terms of microbe reduction biochar removed more salmonella spp 2 72 log10 reductions and e faecalis 1 51 log10 reduction than activated carbon 1 55 and 1 32 log10 reduction respectively and bark 1 43 and 1 26 log10 reduction respectively filters nevertheless biochar filters removed less ms2 and similar ɸx174 compared to the rest of the filters although operating at the same hlr molaei 4 reported that activated carbon filters performed best at removing all microbe pollution parameters previously mentioned 3 2 7 influence of biochar characteristics on removal efficiency biochar s parental material and production conditions determine its physicochemical properties to analyse the influence of biochar characteristics on removal efficiency only the physical properties e g size density and porosity will be considered the impact of chemical properties e g surface functional group will not be discussed since that information was not provided by the studies revised for this literature review dalahmeh 36 reported a converse relationship between biochar particle size and hrt for instance a shorter 66 h hrt was found on bcfs filled with 2 8 mm biochar in comparison to longer 85 h and 87 h ones reported for bcfs using 0 7 mm and 1 4 mm biochar respectively macropores with large particle sizes usually connect creating channels for wastewater flow without enough contact time between pollutants and the filter media under such conditions effluents from filters will contain some non treated greywater since the removal mechanisms will be limited as biochar particle size and fraction within bcfs rule the hrt of the system fine particle sizes smaller than 0 1 mm can lead to clogging and biochar dust affecting the effluent quality in the present review the most common range of particle size was 1 5 mm except for emslie 41 who used particle size of 0 25 2 mm as can be seen in table 3 although particle size is a determinant factor for pollutant removal nine studies in this review failed to provide that information to help understand their relationship with reduction efficiency additionally information regarding the pre rinsing of bcfs filled with 1 mm particle size to remove the biochar dusty fraction was not stated 32 41 44 this means that further studies comparing pre rinsed and non pre rinsed bcfs filled with fine biochar particles and operated under similar conditions are required to understand better the effect of size on insufficient hydraulic conductivity within bcfs in terms of pollutant removal perez mercado et al 42 found that smaller biochar particles indicate higher fractions of micropores which enhances microbe removal by increasing the contact between microbes and adsorption sites on both biofilm and filter media biochar moreover the removal of smaller microorganisms e g bacteria is dominated by adsorption on the biofilm surface nevertheless as reported by sidibe 6 the reduction of larger microbes such as salmonella spp in bcfs is driven by straining processes which are associated with the size and proportion of pores in the filter media similarly the reduction of organic matter and nutrients by biological activity is favoured on the high specific surface area of biochar in this literature review the reported range varied from 118 to 200 m2 g this is because more surface area is available for biofilm to grow and degrade organic matter hydrolysis or remove tn by denitrification routes in anaerobic zones 36 although biochar particle size affects the removal mechanisms taking place on biochar surface it is not possible to conclude what is the exact range of size that allows better removal efficiency since every bcfs reported in this literature review is different in configuration and operating conditions table 4 therefore future research should focus on the optimization of bcfs using a mathematical model to estimate the effect of bcfs s characteristics independent variables on pollutant removal dependent variable 3 2 8 influence of operating conditions on removal efficiency the operating conditions in terms of olr hlr and hrt play a key role in the removal efficiency of greywater pollutants by bcfs for the case of physical pollutants such as tss a longer hrt allows better agglomeration and followed sedimentation of the suspended solids present in the supernatant water 8 18 as sediments settle onto the biochar surface the pore space between biochar particles is reduced enabling the straining of coarse solids and larges microorganisms e g protozoa and amoebas 42 additionally when bcfs treats high strength greywater containing salts and bulking agents from detergents at high hlr salts resulting from the greywater degradation are released increasing the concentration of tds 8 the removal of organic matter under the effect of operating conditions for bcfs was also studied similar bod5 removal percentages of 96 1 and 93 were reported at low 64 l m2 day and high 114 l m2 day hlr respectively similarly dalahmeh 36 found no differences in the decrease of cod and bod5 at hlr of 37 200 l m2 day likewise the olr did not affect the biochar filter s performance to reduce organic matter a reduction above 90 was noted even though the olr ranged from 3 9 to 1580 g bod5 m2 day 4 6 8 37 nevertheless higher cod removal was observed at higher olr suggesting that higher organic loads speed up the microbiological activity thus stimulating the mineralization process 36 67 70 in the case of hrt the elimination of cod and bod5 above 90 was promoted with a longer hrt 8 36 44 the removal of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus depends on the hlr and the physicochemical properties of biochar for instance dalahmeh 36 evaluated the removal of tn and tp in a bcfs operated at 32 200 l m2 day of hlr and found that higher tn removal was achieved at hlr below 50 l m2 day and biochar particle size of 1 4 mm this loading rate and particle size avoided biofilm washing thus favouring tn removal by adsorption of nh4 n on biochar surface biological assimilation and denitrification activity on anaerobic zones the removal of tp on the other hand was less dependent on the hlr but the chemical properties of biochar for instance when sand and biochar filters operate at similar hlr and olr sand filter removes more tp due to its capacity to bind phosphorus with ca fe and al located on the sand surface 36 the operating conditions of biochar filters also play a significant role in the removal of microbes perez mercado et al 42 evaluated the removal of bacterial and viral indicators at hlr higher 200 and 400 l m2 day than conventional hlr for sand filtration treatment 34 l m2 day it was demonstrated that high hlr decreased both the biofilm straining process and contact time between microbes and active sites as thinner biofilm layers formed this affected the microbe removal as a consistent low reduction of 1 log10 was found in each microorganism analysed nevertheless the low olr at which the biochar filter operated 4 5 and 15 g bod5 m2 day caused thinning of the biofilm layers affecting the straining process like the influence of high hlr likewise niwagaba et al 8 observed increases in the elimination of faecal coliforms fc as the retention time increased reduction of up to 95 6 was achieved at 36 h of retention time in comparison to 43 3 at one third retention time table 13 this observed increase in fc removal was attributed to higher microbial retention in the pores of the filter media and biofilm maturity as time prolonged similarly biruktawit 44 identified removal efficiencies of 87 and 90 in filters composed of purely biochar and a mixture of biochar and sand respectively when they functioned at residence times of 6 days overall the studies in this review analysed the effect of operating conditions of bcfs on removal efficiency and drawn reasonings as to how they affected or enhanced the removal mechanisms responsible for pollutants reductions however since the characteristics of bcfs in terms of the type of biochar operation time loading rates layer configuration composition of wastewater and scale are different among the bcfs used in the studies the influence of operating conditions on removal efficiency cannot be generalized but specific to each study therefore further studies are needed to develop integrated design criteria for the construction of bcfs treating greywater for water reuse 3 2 9 influence of filter configuration on removal efficiency as stated previously three types of bcfs configuration were used in the reviewed studies single biochar filter multilayer based filter and as a polishing step for tertiary greywater treatment none of the studies explained the selection of bed size range of 20 70 cm and filter diameter range of 4 3 20 cm and their role in enhancing pollutant removal mechanisms it is assumed that longer columns provide better contact between greywater and active adsorption sites from biochar favouring the physical chemical and biological removal routes to take place 36 the influence of the ratio between bed size and filter diameter on removal efficiency was unexplored in all studies table 4 this is a relevant design parameter considering that airspace can be formed along the filter s walls under non optimum filter diameter leading to the creation of artificial channels where water flows rapidly with less contact with active adsorption sites 69 the operation time is known to determine the maturity of the biochar filter system in terms of the biofilm formation on the biochar surface the operation time in the studies analysed in this review paper oscillates from days to months typically long operated filters develop thinner biofilm layers affecting positively the removal of organic matter nutrients tn and pathogens for instance niwagaba et al 8 reported that extended operation of biochar filters creates anaerobic zones for the denitrifying microorganism in the micro and nanopores of biochar likewise longer assessment periods are useful to determine the maximum adsorption capacity of biochar and the robustness of bcfs under sudden changes in operating conditions when greywater flows continuously regarding this all the studies lacked the provision of breakthrough curves to estimate the time when pollutant removal starts to decrease and therefore biochar s capacity has been reached this means that the removal efficiencies described in tables 10 13 must be carefully analysed as they may not be representative of a particular configuration type besides the use of biochar as a unique filter media biochar has also been used together and as part of a mixture with other filter media table 4 although the removal efficiency among multilayers filters described in this review is not comparable due to differences mainly in layer disposition operation time and loading rate it can be generally assumed that filter media with distinct physicochemical characteristics than biochar boost the pollutant efficiency of bcfs for example the addition of sand layer or sand including mixtures has been shown to diminish the concentration of tp by binding phosphorus with ca fe and al present on sand 36 however further studies are required to determine whether the removal efficiency and longevity of bcfs operating under similar conditions are dependent on the addition of different kinds of filter media particularly an in depth study is needed to understand the existence of changes in removal mechanism dynamics concerning layers disposition and depth table 4 also shows that ten of the reviewed studies evaluated the use of bcfs as part of a greywater treatment chain when comparing the removal efficiency between this type of configuration and single or multilayer bcfss special attention should be given to removal efficiency data given by the authors to represent the overall pollutant removal efficiency of the whole treatment chain or only from the biochar containing filter used as tertiary treatment higher removal efficiencies can be observed for bcfs functioning as a tertiary treatment 5 40 however these values can be overestimated as influent pollutant concentrations were reduced during preliminary treatment screening primary clarifier sedimentation tank and secondary treatment constructed wetlands fig 6 as this type of configuration involves successive steps for greywater treatment further investigation is needed to determine the relationship between durability and cost when compared to the other configuration types additionally the use of biochar along the treatment chain for instance as both adsorbent filter media and substrate for phytoremediation in constructed wetlands can be further explored 3 2 10 treated greywater for water reuse table 14 summarizes the different purposes of reuse of treated greywater that are described in each of the studies reviewed as well as the regulations and suitability of reuse achieved greywater was mainly treated for non potable reuse such as toilet flushing floor washing car washing cloth washing and irrigation of land garden and edible crops however minor reuse purposes for safety effluent discharge 36 45 47 nutrient recycling 35 and potable purposes for ablution 38 were also identified the suitability of treated greywater reuse was assessed mostly under local guidelines of reuse however international wastewater reuse standards such as world health organization who united states environmental protection agency usepa food agricultural organization fao eu guidelines were also used to evaluate compliance with water quality regulations in treated greywater most studies reviewed achieved the reuse regulations meaning that all parameters physical chemical nutrients and microbiological chosen to measure the water quality were met while others emphasized the parameters below the limits established in the regulations 41 47 49 although most studies met reuse standards the meaning of these results must be critically addressed several studies were performed at lab scale filters operated in the short term although high contaminants removal was reached still the performance of the filter at up scale and long term conditions remains unknown additionally a weakness observed in all studies is the failure to address the reasons on which the selection of water quality parameters is based the authors do not explain whether this selection is driven by economic technical or regulatory based reasons the differences in number and type of quality parameters can be seen in tables 6 9 moreover the replicability of biochar filters and successful compliance for greywater reclamation in various studies appears to be limited to national levels since governmental greywater reuse guidelines were used to conclude the suitability of water for reuse only two studies compared the compliance of their results to international wastewater reuse standards 31 39 in a few studies on the other hand authors argued the possibility of reuse based on the positive result of a limited number of water quality parameters for instance both abd rahman et al 38 and emslie 41 concluded that effluent greywater meets drinking water regulations nevertheless very few quality parameters for this category of reuse were analysed to reach this conclusion lastly some studies would appear to be over ambitious in their claims of achieving water quality for crop irrigation out of ten studies treating greywater for irrigation either restricted or unrestricted half of them did not evaluate microbial contamination necessary to prevent reclaimed greywater from harming human health 7 9 32 33 49 3 2 11 potential new areas of research various topics for further investigation could be identified in the reviewed studies perceptions toward greywater reuse among users are fundamental to measuring social acceptability for on site reclaimed greywater treatment systems 72 however only two of the revised studies evaluated this area focusing on greywater reuse for non potable purposes 8 49 further research should be undertaken to investigate the level of social acceptability for greywater reuse for potable purposes additionally future work is required to determine the effect of operating conditions such as water quality on the efficiency of biochar filters to remove pollutants from greywater strong focus should be given to the influence of higher hydraulic and organic loading rates on the cleaning capacity of biochar filters this type of study could help solve unanswered questions about the robustness of biochar filters when exposed to sudden high loads of greywater and organic matter content an optimization study using a mathematical model could help assess the individual influence of bcfs s characteristics on pollutant removal as mentioned earlier the technical and environmental feasibility of biochar filters for greywater reclamation was determined through lab based and short term experiments thus further studies on the same topic but at a pilot and on site scales of long term duration are therefore recommended 7 31 44 in addition there is also plenty of room for further research on the creation of integrated design criteria to dimension biochar filters for greywater treatment which lacked in the studies 36 concerning this single biochar filter could explore the cleaning capacity of smaller biochar particle size and biochar whose parent material is other than wood the main feedstock source in the reviewed studies multilayer biochar filters on the other hand should test different layer configurations mainly position and depth for configurations where bcfs is part of a treatment chain the potential use of biochar as a growth medium for phytoremediation plants in coupled systems between constructed wetlands and bcfs can be explored further as can be seen in table 14 the reuse of treated greywater for non potable purposes has been widely explored there is still much to be done in determining the technical environmental and economic feasibility of using biochar filters to obtain treated greywater of high quality for human contact reuse purposes such as handwashing this implies that microbial removal must comply with strict microbiological local and or international regulations to ensure contact with treated water is safe for human health 73 74 further studies should identify and evaluate the removal of microorganisms other than the limited number seen in the studies reviewed the study of potential natural synergist and antagonist microorganisms is another field with unresolved questions but is highly important as they may induce and enhance the removal of microbial pollution additionally because of the susceptibility of biofilm to sudden changes in environmental conditions its degradation at high and low hlr and olr must be investigated there is also a need for further studies to determine if the removal efficiency and longevity of bcfs under similar conditions vary with the addition of different types of filter media an in depth study is specifically required to better understand the dynamics of layers disposition and depth with removal mechanisms additionally the negative effects of both natural degradation of biochar on effluent quality can be further explored to provide insight into the maximum time of use for potential bcfs users moreover the effect of alkaline greywater resulting from the usage of cleaning products such as detergents and soaps on biofilm degradation should be assessed to ensure biological processes inside the filter are maintained lastly as most of the methods to modify the surface of biochar are of physical and chemical character 75 the search for natural or biological methods is highly necessary they could favour the removal of greywater pollutants and be of easy replicability in low and middle income countries where low cost and nature based onsite wastewater treatment prevail 4 conclusion through a systematic literature review 28 studies from different source types such as articles dissertations and scientific reports have been identified to use biochar in column filtration systems for greywater treatment out of a 10 years period of study a predominance of studies was observed in the last five years and particularly in regions such as asia europe and africa the treatment of greywater from different sources has predominantly been performed in three types of filter configuration single layer biochar filter multilayer biochar based filter and as part of an integrated greywater treatment chain differences in operation conditions have been identified throughout the reviewed studies owing to strategies to achieve country specific water quality for greywater reclamation however the main similarity observed in most of the studies was the use of wood as the main feedstock material several removal processes take place within bcfs such as agglomeration precipitation sedimentation straining adsorption hydrolysis and biological assimilation overall bcfs showed high efficiency in the removal of nutrients and physical and chemical pollutants but not microbial pollutants which still surpass countries permissible limits for greywater reuse the use of treated greywater for non potable purposes such as irrigation toilet flushing laundry and cleaning has been widely studied however the field of greywater treatment for potable purposes is still largely unexplored in general the bcfs technology can be a feasible and sustainable alternative for greywater treatment and application in water scarce regions the following is the supplementary data related

12961,the aeration process is the largest energy consumer in wastewater treatment plants wwtp and the optimization of the process based on computational models can offer significant savings for the plant recent theoretical developments have revealed that many of the parameters commonly assumed as constants in aeration modelling have a dynamic nature however there still lacks a universal way to model these factors accurately this work proposed a new framework and optimal time scale for building hybrid machine learning mechanistic oxygen transfer rate models the data used for the modelling were from existing sensors in a full scale wwtp supplemented by a two month field sampling campaign for collecting 15 min of dynamic data including off gas air fraction two machine learning ml models were built the first set was a novel hybrid ml mechanistic model developed to estimate the off gas aeration fraction from wastewater parameters and calculate dynamic alpha per the off gas method the second ml model directly estimated dynamic alpha from wastewater process and operation parameters the performance of the ml models was compared with recalibrated published regression based models results showed that the hybrid ml mechanistic alpha model nse 0 96 and rmse 0 03 were more accurate than the direct ml alpha nse 0 67 and rmse 0 07 and recalibrated regression nse 0 and rmse 0 18 to 0 28 models and therefore could be efficiently applied to predict dynamic alpha factor of an activated sludge plant in addition to typical surfactant indicators such as mlss and cod other parameters like temperature and aeration ammonia concentration were substantial in dynamic off gas and alpha estimation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords dynamic alpha factor dynamic off gas oxygen fraction dynamic aeration model machine learning for off gas aeration fraction modelling activated sludge 1 introduction aeration accounts for 50 to 70 of the energy cost in activated sludge processes treating municipal wastewater 1 4 while the primary function of aeration is to supply oxygen to satisfy the aerobic bacteria demand it also provides the desired complete mixing in activated sludge processes typically for activated sludge processes aeration systems are designed to maintain at least a dissolved oxygen do concentration of 2 mg l 5 combined with subsequent processes contaminants such as organics and nutrients can be removed from the wastewater however an over aeration approach vastly practiced in wastewater operations increases energy demand and negatively impacts the overall energy performance of the plants 6 over the past decades considerable efforts have been made to design and modify the aeration process to reduce energy costs and optimize processes 7 9 the majority of the modern wwtps and process optimization utilize feedback control loops to control the aeration supply however feedback control is often vulnerable to time delay and disturbance especially at larger plants where data collected at one point often is not representative of the whole tank 10 alternatively the concept of dynamic aeration modelling can further be utilized for aeration process control and optimization 11 in this case the dynamic aeration models were used to build feedforward control loops to predict do or required airflow based on real time or forecasted influent data 10 11 åmand et al 10 summarized that by modifying the control system in wwtps the total energy cost of aeration could be saved by 27 on average however one of the standing research questions is the accuracy of the aeration models to capture dynamic aeration and oxygen transfer rate within the process the most accepted aeration models are based on the oxygen mass transfer model eq a 1 in supporting document the transfer resistance at the gas film is generally considered negligible due to the low oxygen solubility in water 12 therefore the driving force for oxygen transfer in this model solely depends on the concentration gradient between the oxygen saturation concentration c and the actual oxygen concentration c that is typically reported as do in routine measurements the overall oxygen mass transfer coefficient kla partially reflects the difference in oxygen transfer rate in wastewater and clean water the kla in wastewater can be expressed with eq a 2 in the supporting document introducing several correction factors 13 table a 1 lists these correction factors and their typical values in municipal wastewater the alpha beta and gamma factors are directly involved in calculating the overall oxygen mass transfer rate these factors can be adjusted to improve the aeration models eq a 1 the alpha factor α is defined as the volumetric mass transfer ratio of oxygen between wastewater and clean water the beta factor β also known as the salinity surface tension correction factor is the ratio of saturation do concentration between wastewater and clean water the beta factor represents the impact of constituents such as salts and suspended solids on the solubility of dissolved oxygen 14 it is well studied that beta only influences 0 05 or less of total mass transfer so that it can be ignored in most cases rodríguez et al 2012 the gamma factor γ represents the influence of temperature t on the oxygen γ θ20 c t the theta factor lies 1 016 1 024 15 therefore the gamma factor only depends on the water temperature t within this temperature range the only and most uncertain correction factor left is the alpha factor with all other factors eliminated alpha factor represents the effect of diffuser design tank geometry and water constituents on the overall oxygen transfer performance in wastewater 16 while the alpha factor was traditionally considered a constant value recent studies suggest that alpha factors fluctuate daily and seasonally and should be considered a dynamic factor 17 however there is still no universally valid approach directly to measure the alpha factor in practice the overall oxygen mass transfer coefficient can be indirectly determined through the off gas method using equation eq a 3 13 this equation is established based on the gas mass balance at a steady state assuming that both co2 and nitrogen are conservative with this equation kla may be estimated based on the measurement values of the total gas volume flow rate of inlet and outlet gases volumetric fractions of oxygen in them and do the estimation of oxygen mass transfer based on this theory has been referred to as the off gas method the off gas method has proven to offer a practical and accurate estimation under process conditions 18 and calculates alpha factor from measured off gas fraction using eq a1 4 although entirely accurate this method is expensive to adapt during operation as it requires additional sensors to measure the volumetric fraction of the outlet gas fraction y i besides the alpha factor measured with this method can only represent the water column of the sampled niche which may not be representative for other regions in the aeration tanks therefore numerous attempts have been made to predict the alpha factor s change with more accessible and cheaper parameters to measure under field conditions 19 21 it has generally been agreed that the impact of surfactants is responsible for the dynamic nature of the alpha factor 3 22 therefore many of these empirical regression models utilized routine measurements that reflect the level of surfactants such as mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and chemical oxygen demand cod as input parameters 19 21 23 24 however the resulting predictions are often too inaccurate due to many assumptions and over simplification that must be made while utilizing these empirical equations like the previous regression models machine learning ml allows engineers to develop data based analytical models ml models make predictions based on real time relationships between input and output data instead of formulated mechanisms however the ml models make significantly fewer assumptions and are proved to be more robust comprehensive and suitable for representing wastewater process units or components where detailed mechanisms remain unclear 25 27 in such a rapidly developing field however numerous ml models exist that each features unique characteristics and has various hyperparameters to be set for optimal performance it is increasingly unrealistic for wastewater engineers to incorporate all the best practices in ml model development into their models the automatic machine learning automl framework offers an easy to use toolset for general ml model developers to flatten the learning curve automl automatically determines the best model and the corresponding hyper parameters to yield the best performance based on the input dataset the model development process can be easily replicated or transferred to a completely different wwtp using site specific input parameters without substantial loss of predictability to date numerous studies have investigated the correlation between the alpha factor and an extensive range of operational parameters but the existing empirical equations often lack precision in predicting the airflow needed for a single wwtp under dynamic operational conditions the objectives of this paper were to i develop accurate models and alternative approaches to predict off gas fraction and dynamic alpha factor in aeration systems ii assess wastewater parameters that influence off gas fraction and dynamic alpha factor values and iii assess the optimal timescale for dynamic alpha modelling 2 methods 2 1 research site description this research was conducted at the adelaide pollution control plant pcp london ontario canada the adelaide pcp is an activated sludge process treatment plant designed for a maximum daily flow capacity of 29 600 cubic meters day m3 d with an approved peak flow rate of 59 200 m3 d currently the plant operates at 82 3 capacity with an average flow of 24 379 m3 d 28 during the study period the coldest and warmest months were march and september with an average stream temperature of 12 4 c and 20 7 c respectively the geometric properties of the unit processes of adelaide pcp are summarized in fig 1 a the wastewater treatment process related to this study consists of primary clarifiers aeration chambers and secondary clarifiers 2 2 data collection the adelaide plant is equipped with do nh4 n tss po4 2 p and density sensors integrated into the supervisory control and data acquisition scasa system the data used for the modelling were obtained from two sources the existing online sensors and a field sampling campaign the sampling frequency sampling location analysis sensor types and average values are summarized in table 1 the online sensor data were collected every 15 min from the raw wastewater channels primary clarifier effluent channels aeration tanks and plant effluent channels the 50 day field campaign collected dynamic cod nh4 n off gas oxygen fraction tss and vss data an autosampler was installed during the campaign to collect hourly samples daily from the primary influent and aeration tanks each hourly sample was collected from 4 sub samples that were grabbed by the autosampler every 15 min the daily 24 field samples were immediately transported to the lab and analyzed for cod hach number 8000 nh4 n hach number 10031 and tss vss us epa method 1684 during the field campaign an invent alphameter 32013 rev 2018 was also deployed at one of the aerations tanks near the do sensors to sample the off gas oxygen concentration released from the aeration tank fig 1 b the alphameter has a net surface intake of 1 m2 and was used to take measurements at 3 4 part of the tank fig 1 b the alphameter was connected to the measurement array on the walkway via pvc tubing and was equipped with a dedicated data acquisition system 2 3 outlier removal all the collected data were first preprocessed by the density based cluster analysis density based spatial clustering of applications with noise dbscan filter for outlier removal 29 as a density based clustering algorithm dbscan classifies a set of points based on their distance from each other points that lie alone in low density regions are marked as outliers dbscan requires the user to define two factors eps and minpts the minpts the minimum number of neighbours within a defined radius eps were set to be 5 for all datasets treated the values of eps were chosen by finding the first strong bend on a k distance graph for each dataset this paper performed dbscan with the python package scikit learn 30 about 5 of the data were considered an outlier and removed the removed data were then treated with the mean substitution method as kang 45 suggested 2 4 parameter calculation the alpha factor α hydraulic retention time hrt and soluble chemical oxygen demand scod were calculated the α factor was calculated as the overall transfer coefficient kla ratio between wastewater and clean water based on the off gas oxygen fraction obtained during the field campaign and other plant operational data eq a 4 hrt was calculated as volume of aeration tank influent flow the scod of plant influent flow and aeration tanks were estimated with the influent tool and activated sludge model provided by the gps x simulation platform respectively 31 the gps x model has been calibrated and validated using an extensive two year dataset from the same plant before using the model for extracting the aeration tank scod concentration corresponding to the field campaign period 2 5 optimal sampling frequency determination the optimal timescale of the input dataset for model development was assessed by averaging and transforming the original data recorded every 15 min intervals to 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 h 6 h and 8 h the resulting new datasets were used to generate pioneer ml models and ten replicate models were built for each timescale tested the accuracy of each model was calculated to quantify the effect of sampling frequency on the model s performance 2 6 auto machine learning processes in this study the autogluon tabular phyton library was used to determine the best model and corresponding hyperparameters automatically the autogluon tabular package an efficient and easy to use python framework is developed by amazon web services aws 32 33 the library has built in prediction tasks that allow automatic hyperparameter tuning model selection ensembling and data preprocessing such as data splits the autogluon automl uses a stacker model involving base and stack model layers the base layer trains individual base models then the base layer s output is concatenated with input features then the stacker model uses predictions of every base model as extra features thus training using both the input dataset and the concat layer output thus improving the model performance except for the dataset the stacker model uses similar model types and hyperparameters to the base models once we have the stack layer the weighting layer implements a selection technique that weights all the models and creates a weighted ensemble model that outperforms all the individual models the base stacker models considered in this study were lightgbmxt lightgbm glighgbmlarge catboost xgboost extratreesmse randomforestmse kneighborsdist kneighborsunif and neuralmetfastal during the automl training less emphasis is placed on hyperparameter tuning of these base models this is contrary to previous single model based approaches that depend on hyperparameter tuning 34 35 rather in the current approach the stacking component and the number of stack layers is what solves most of the problem and hyperparameter tuning adds less importance the input parameters used to develop the model and their value range are summarized in table 1 the data distribution is also shown in fig a 1 a to j in supporting document influent flow hrt pe tss and mlss were normally distributed while the remainder of the datasets were not normally distributed the data were manually checked for normality of the residuals section 3 3 and was standardized to speed up the training process but it was never normalized this decision was made in consideration of the machine learning algorithms used most of the fundamental machine learning models used were tree based that did not assume the normality of the input data data normalization should not significantly impact these types of ml models the performance of the models is evaluated by the root mean squared error rmse during training the train test split configuration was set as a training test ratio of 80 20 a total of 880 datasets were fed into the system for training the study also used a 5 fold cross test case with bagging a total of five models were trained each with its test dataset randomly selected accounting for 20 of the complete dataset in this way the test set was independent and not contaminated with the data used in the training process for each model as the dataset was initially arranged by time the order in which data was fed per epoch iteration could potentially influence the model increasing the training and testing error each split was randomly shuffled before each epoch to avoid bias during training and testing datasets 2 7 regression model calibration in addition to the ml models existing exponential alpha models were explored per the models developed by krampe and krauth 24 and jiang et al 21 using the current dataset the models were expressed as 1 α a e k a parameter whereby a and ka are constants adjusted calibrated by residuals minimization the current study used sludge and wastewater characteristics including mlss and cod as input parameters to calibrate existing regression models the considered regression models include mlss based by baquero rodríguez et al 20 günder 23 and krampe and krauth 24 and cod based by jiang et al 21 table 2 2 8 parameter sensitivity analysis the permutation shuffle importance score built in the autogluon package was used to determine the sensitivity of the ml models to each available input parameter 32 33 the permutation importance score is defined as the decrease in model performance when a single feature value is randomly shuffled 36 all permutation importance scores were calculated on the test set in this study the ml and hybrid ml modelling approach is summarized in fig 2 2 9 model performance evaluation to assess the performance of each model the researchers followed the procedures for goodness of fit measures in dynamic wastewater modelling as suggested by ahnert et al 37 after visual evaluation and tests for fitting the time dependent behaviour the three criteria root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and index of agreement d were applied 38 39 2 rmse t 1 t x x t 2 t 3 nse 1 t 1 t x m t x o t 2 t 1 t x o t x o 2 4 d 1 t 1 t x o t x m t 2 t 1 t x m t x o x o t x o 2 where x m t is modelled parameter and x o t is an observed parameter at time t 3 results and discussion 3 1 data preprocessing and wastewater characterization all operational parameters used in this study were preprocessed with the dbscan clustering algorithm to remove outliers after outlier removal the average hourly data with standard deviation were plotted to assess each parameter s variability within 24 h the average value of off gas oxygen fraction airflow aeration temperature hrt mlss cod scod primary effluent phosphorus and ammonia were 19 21 0 32 12 545 79 1903 46 m3 h 20 46 0 58 c 5 45 1 01 mg l 1380 92 51 97 mg l 276 50 46 14 mg l 142 70 23 63 mg l 3 50 0 59 mg l and 13 67 3 37 mg l respectively table 1 as shown in fig 3 figs a 2 a to f and fig a 3 a to k significant daily fluctuations were observed in the parameter s used to estimate alpha supporting alpha s dynamic nature in aeration systems the off gas oxygen fraction and the hrt showed the most robust average hourly fluctuation within a day among the assessed parameters fig 3 the off gas oxygen fraction was the highest early in the morning reaching its peak at around 7 00 am then decreasing to its minimum at around 1 00 pm before climbing back a potential cause of such fluctuation could be the change in wastewater influent loading in a day the higher loading would cause an increased concentration in the aeration tanks which leads to a lower oxygen concentration in the wastewater and therefore a higher oxygen transfer rate at the water surface this is also supported by the daily average of hrt which shows a similar trend as the off gas oxygen fraction several other parameters such as the temperature mlss po4 3 p and nh4 n did not show significant average hourly fluctuations in a day fig a 2 a b and c this suggested that these parameters may not reflect the daily fluctuation in the alpha factor and therefore models built with them may show limited predictability however the data behaved quite differently when assessing the dynamic data profile fig a 3 a to k than the hourly averages in a day fig a 2 a to f the off gas fraction alpha factor nh4 n mlss cod and temperature data were plotted against time to show the data variability during the field campaign period fig a 3 a to k most of the wastewater and operating parameters showed a higher variability during the field campaign period the oxygen fraction and alpha factor varied from 18 to 20 and 0 3 to 0 9 respectively confirming alpha the dynamic nature of an alpha when the overall dataset was considered a strong relationship was observed between hrt temperature hrt tss and cod with the measured off gas fraction fig a 3 c to h 3 2 optimal sampling frequency determination while developing models to describe wastewater treatment processes one crucial question is how to deal with the uncertainties within the input dataset currently most existing mlss based alpha models are often built upon average values collected and merged from several wastewater treatment plants causing them to be generalizable and lack precision when predicting the dynamic behaviour of a specific plant this study collected 15 min of dynamic data for seven weeks and studies were conducted to accurately identify an optimal sampling frequency to describe the oxygen transfer s dynamic behaviour accurately the analysis of the performance of models was built with seven different sampling frequencies 15 min 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 h 6 h and 8 h each with 5 replicates the 1 h interval group performs better than the 15 min interval group the average rmse nse and index of the agreement for the 1 h interval group were 0 06 0 68 and 0 89 respectively fig 4 however increasing the sampling frequency to 15 min lowered the model performance the poor performance at 15 min data scale shows that the wastewater data collected at shorter times could be unstable introducing noise when the sampling frequency was higher in addition some data were collected by sensors and analyzers in this case the sensors are distributed along with the treatment processes causing unignorable time lag in some datasets hence supporting deficient performance agreement at shorter timescales reducing the sampling frequency to 2 h caused the nse to drop by 0 08 and the index of an agreement to drop by 0 05 the model performance for the 8 h sampling frequency was almost halved compared to that of the 1 h interval models decreasing the accuracy of the models the latter result showed that decreasing sampling frequency affected the prediction accuracy as it may have caused oversimplification of the input data in summary the models developed based on the input dataset of 7 sampling frequencies indicated that the optimal sampling interval for alpha modelling in the adelaide plant was 1 h 3 3 model performance as aeration is both a critical process and is heavily energy intensive in wastewater treatment considerable effort has been made to develop models to predict the dynamic behaviour of the process among numerous factors involved in oxygen mass transfer efficiency in aeration the alpha factor which is dynamic by nature is the most uncertain parameter one popular theory is that the alpha factor is most closely related to the concentration of organic surfactants 22 40 41 based on this theory various attempts to model the alpha factor with parameters reflecting surfactants have been developed 19 21 23 24 most of these models are empirically derived however they often lack precision due to the time varying and highly nonlinear characteristics of wastewater treatment processes on the other hand machine learning and deep learning are practical and efficient when dealing with complicated systems like the previous alpha models these models do not depend on specific theories and generally do not make assumptions about underlying mechanisms except when selecting input parameters in this study the autogloun package was used to develop two different models that are robust with extreme input values an essential characteristic when dealing with wastewater measurements the first set of models referred to as the direct ml alpha model directly estimated alpha from some measurable wastewater parameters model output alpha model inputs aeration nh4 n mlss hrt cod pe tss pe cod pe po4 3 p the second set of ml models referred to herein as the hybrid ml mechanistic alpha model was developed to estimate the off gas aeration fraction from wastewater parameters and subsequently calculated alpha using the estimated off gas fraction using eq a 4 the off gas fraction was developed using inputs of wastewater parameters aeration temperature aeration nh4 n mlss hrt cod pe tss pe cod and pe po4 3 p an off gas fraction as an output the autogloun utilized a total of 10 individual base stack ml models including lightgbmxt lightgbm lighgbmlarge catboost xgboost extratreesmse randomforestmse kneighborsdist kneigh10borsunif and neuralmetfastal to build a weighted ensemble model the hyperparameters of the individual base stack ml models and the weighted ensemble model employed with their corresponding score values are shown in table a 2 a and a 2 b for the direct and hybrid alpha ml models respectively as discussed earlier the approach used by the autogloun for improved performance involves stacking rather than tuning hyperparameters which often leads to overfitting thus the default hyperparameter corresponding to some of the individual models was automatically selected by the automl lightgbmxt showed the highest impact of all the individual models the final ml model used for prediction was based on the weighted ensemble model that showed a slightly higher score than the lightgbmxt fig 5 a to c show the performance of three models built in this study a the direct ml alpha model and b the hybrid ml mechanistic alpha model and c recalibrated published regression models regression models are shown in table 2 the results were based on the 20 test datasets it can be seen how the hybrid ml mechanistic and direct ml models showed a slight discrepancy throughout the long term sampling period between the measured scattered blue and modelled line orange alpha factor values indicating a successful prediction over the long term the agreement of the predicted versus measured values using commonly used wastewater statistics including rmse nse and d the values are summarized in table 2 also the residual error histogram was plotted to assess the error distribution fig a 4 a and b for the hybrid and direct alpha models respectively both distributions confirmed the natural distribution of errors where 95 of the values lay within two standard deviations of the mean values showing no bias and satisfying the ml model assumptions the hybrid alpha model fig 5 b rmse 0 03 nse 0 96 d 0 99 performed better than the direct model fig 5 a rmse 0 07 nse 0 67 d 0 88 possibly because of the limited ability of the latter automl algorithm to model extreme values several alpha factor peaks were often recorded in the afternoon i e from 13 00 to 17 00 reaching a maximum of 0 96 the calculation from the off gas oxygen fraction to the alpha factor could amplify the extreme values from the oxygen fraction outputs allowing a better fit for more extreme value points it is important to recognize that the hybrid alpha model estimated the off gas fraction using automl models and used the modelled off gas fraction to calculate further the alpha factor based on established mechanistic equations the modelling approach primarily provided an alternative to the actual measurement of off gas fractions which were deemed difficult to conduct routinely in the wastewater treatment environment in addition to estimating alpha the off gas fraction model outputs can be used for calculating dynamic oxygen transfer efficiency ote to the authors best knowledge the approach of estimating air fraction has never been considered before and introduced in this study for the first time in this study the empirical equations were recalibrated using the current dataset for the adelaide plant based on these formulations by fitting the coefficients through residual minimization the resulting recalibrated models and performance of the models are shown in table 3 and fig 5 c respectively comparatively the recalibrated regression models reflect only the average of the alpha factor compared to the ml models that successfully captured the daily dynamics of alpha the alpha values directly estimated with these equations have shown significant deviation from the measured values possibly because of the difference in the range of input parameters three out of the four equations listed above estimated the alpha factors with mlss measurements 20 23 24 the average value for mlss at the adelaide plant was 1 4 g l although most studies that reported an alpha mlss relationship claimed to be applicable for ranges between 0 and 30 g l of mlss the input dataset they used to develop these models are often from high strength wastewater or processes that make use of membranes that yields above 7 g l for mlss which is significantly higher than the measurements at adelaide 23 24 baquero rodríguez et al 20 supplemented their input dataset with data collected from a full scale test by diago rosso in 2005 with mlss in the range of 1 4 g l they also introduced a second coefficient in the equation however when adjusting the coefficients with the dataset from adelaide wwtp this study it is found that removing the second coefficient results in a better fit which results in a similar formula to the ones developed by günder 23 and krampe and krauth 24 in comparison with the models developed with automl it is evident that these suggested empirical models based on mlss captured less dynamic behaviour of the alpha factor in the long term thus results from such models can only be used to estimate average alpha values that may not be beneficial for dynamic aeration modelling however the values can still be beneficial for design purposes that require average alpha values jiang et al 21 suggested an empirical relationship between the alpha factor and cod to estimate the dynamic behaviour of the former the cod raw data they used to train their model was the range of 200 1600 mg l 21 which covers the cod level of 130 400 mg l in the adelaide plant although developed in a similar range this model also did not exhibit a strong enough prediction of the dynamic alpha factor one possible explanation is that the cod concentration at the adelaide plant lacked variation in value over the long term which affected its ability to act as an indicator of the alpha factor thus the complexity of the field condition in full scale wastewater treatment facilities such as the adelaide plant might require the involvement of multiple parameters to make an accurate prediction of the alpha factor 3 4 parameter sensitivity analysis in the current study the direct ml and hybrid ml mechanistic models used several parameters to successfully estimate and capture alpha s dynamic nature the study also assessed the sensitivity of the models to each input parameter the current study used the ml method to plot the desired factor alpha against all potential parameters and then remove the least important ones through sensitivity analysis several parameters were identified to be correlated with the alpha factor some of these parameters were never considered in previous studies a total of ten input parameters were fed into the ml models hrt temperature pe cod pe scod based on influent fractionation and aeration tank scod simulated using gps x software pe po4 3 p pe and aeration tank nh4 n pe tss and mlss concentration several other parameters such as do and airflow were not used to estimate the alpha factor as those were directly involved in calculating the experimentally determined alpha values the feature importance rankings for the direct ml and hybrid models built in this paper are summarized in figs 6 and 7 for prediction of the alpha factor directly ml model aeration nh₄ n was consistently the most important parameter fig 6 a to d regarding oxygen fraction prediction hybrid model the influence of temperature overweighted all other parameters fig 7 a to d the results showed that parameters measured within the unit aeration processes matter significantly in alpha prediction models direct alpha models the importance of nh₄ n dropped when replacing the aeration dataset with pe nh₄ n measurements aeration scod calculated from gps x simulation was less crucial than measured aeration cod this is observed in both alpha fig 6 c and oxygen fraction models fig 7 c assorted studies showed that surfactants significantly impact bubble diameter and reduce kla 40 43 mlss tss cod and scod could therefore be seen as appropriate parameters to characterize the behaviour of oxygen transfer rate in the aeration process several other parameters that were not reported to impact oxygen transfer were also correlated with the alpha factor in this study the concentration of nh₄ n in the aeration tank depends on the nitrification efficiency of the plant the ammonia concentration may influence the oxygen demand by altering the chemical driving force in the reaction therefore affecting the alpha factor hrt has been proved to control the cod and nh3 load to the plant and it could influence the do needed for the biological reactions and influence the oxygen transfer rate 44 the temperature of the wastewater also impacts the oxygen transfer rate the temperature would affect the rate of the reactions during the aeration process which changes the do consumption rate and the dissolution rate of oxygen in summary it was found that the data measured from influent flow or pe flow the data directly measured from the aeration tank would improve the modelling accuracy since most wwtp focus more on the quality of influent and effluent flow many fail to access the information within the aeration section therefore it is recommended for modern wwtps to install more sensors to monitor the aeration process to provide a more accurate prediction of the oxygen transfer rate or have a virtual wwtp running in parallel that could provide information on the aeration tank process parameters 4 conclusion this study developed a new framework for efficient and robust modelling of the dynamic alpha factor by estimating the off gas oxygen fraction from activated sludge plants using the ml approach the estimated off gas fraction was then used to calculate alpha factor and compared with the alpha estimates directly from wastewater characteristics using published recalibrated regression equations and an ml approach it was discovered that using a 1 h sampling frequency was the optimal timescale for dynamic alpha modelling for all the models 46 future dynamic models should consider that the optimal sampling frequency for model development could be different from the raw sampling frequency of the sensors for the input parameters the proposed hybrid ml mechanistic approach of estimating off gas fractions showed superior performance over other models rmse 0 03 and nse 0 96 further the ml models that estimated dynamic alpha directly from measurable wastewater parameters and operating conditions showed better performance rmse 0 07 and nse 0 67 to that of recalibrated published regression models rmse 0 18 to 0 28 and nse 0 in addition to the traditionally acknowledged parameters used to predict dynamic alpha the new model includes other input parameters including temperature hrt nh₄ n and po₄3 p which were found crucial to predicting dynamic off gas fraction this study showed that hybrid ml mechanistic models could be an economical efficient and reliable alpha modelling method to optimize the aeration process although ml models have shown high efficiency and accuracy in alpha prediction it has the limitation to producing only black box models further control study is required to elucidate the cause and effect relationship of the new input parameters availability of data the raw and processed datasets used during the

12961,the aeration process is the largest energy consumer in wastewater treatment plants wwtp and the optimization of the process based on computational models can offer significant savings for the plant recent theoretical developments have revealed that many of the parameters commonly assumed as constants in aeration modelling have a dynamic nature however there still lacks a universal way to model these factors accurately this work proposed a new framework and optimal time scale for building hybrid machine learning mechanistic oxygen transfer rate models the data used for the modelling were from existing sensors in a full scale wwtp supplemented by a two month field sampling campaign for collecting 15 min of dynamic data including off gas air fraction two machine learning ml models were built the first set was a novel hybrid ml mechanistic model developed to estimate the off gas aeration fraction from wastewater parameters and calculate dynamic alpha per the off gas method the second ml model directly estimated dynamic alpha from wastewater process and operation parameters the performance of the ml models was compared with recalibrated published regression based models results showed that the hybrid ml mechanistic alpha model nse 0 96 and rmse 0 03 were more accurate than the direct ml alpha nse 0 67 and rmse 0 07 and recalibrated regression nse 0 and rmse 0 18 to 0 28 models and therefore could be efficiently applied to predict dynamic alpha factor of an activated sludge plant in addition to typical surfactant indicators such as mlss and cod other parameters like temperature and aeration ammonia concentration were substantial in dynamic off gas and alpha estimation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords dynamic alpha factor dynamic off gas oxygen fraction dynamic aeration model machine learning for off gas aeration fraction modelling activated sludge 1 introduction aeration accounts for 50 to 70 of the energy cost in activated sludge processes treating municipal wastewater 1 4 while the primary function of aeration is to supply oxygen to satisfy the aerobic bacteria demand it also provides the desired complete mixing in activated sludge processes typically for activated sludge processes aeration systems are designed to maintain at least a dissolved oxygen do concentration of 2 mg l 5 combined with subsequent processes contaminants such as organics and nutrients can be removed from the wastewater however an over aeration approach vastly practiced in wastewater operations increases energy demand and negatively impacts the overall energy performance of the plants 6 over the past decades considerable efforts have been made to design and modify the aeration process to reduce energy costs and optimize processes 7 9 the majority of the modern wwtps and process optimization utilize feedback control loops to control the aeration supply however feedback control is often vulnerable to time delay and disturbance especially at larger plants where data collected at one point often is not representative of the whole tank 10 alternatively the concept of dynamic aeration modelling can further be utilized for aeration process control and optimization 11 in this case the dynamic aeration models were used to build feedforward control loops to predict do or required airflow based on real time or forecasted influent data 10 11 åmand et al 10 summarized that by modifying the control system in wwtps the total energy cost of aeration could be saved by 27 on average however one of the standing research questions is the accuracy of the aeration models to capture dynamic aeration and oxygen transfer rate within the process the most accepted aeration models are based on the oxygen mass transfer model eq a 1 in supporting document the transfer resistance at the gas film is generally considered negligible due to the low oxygen solubility in water 12 therefore the driving force for oxygen transfer in this model solely depends on the concentration gradient between the oxygen saturation concentration c and the actual oxygen concentration c that is typically reported as do in routine measurements the overall oxygen mass transfer coefficient kla partially reflects the difference in oxygen transfer rate in wastewater and clean water the kla in wastewater can be expressed with eq a 2 in the supporting document introducing several correction factors 13 table a 1 lists these correction factors and their typical values in municipal wastewater the alpha beta and gamma factors are directly involved in calculating the overall oxygen mass transfer rate these factors can be adjusted to improve the aeration models eq a 1 the alpha factor α is defined as the volumetric mass transfer ratio of oxygen between wastewater and clean water the beta factor β also known as the salinity surface tension correction factor is the ratio of saturation do concentration between wastewater and clean water the beta factor represents the impact of constituents such as salts and suspended solids on the solubility of dissolved oxygen 14 it is well studied that beta only influences 0 05 or less of total mass transfer so that it can be ignored in most cases rodríguez et al 2012 the gamma factor γ represents the influence of temperature t on the oxygen γ θ20 c t the theta factor lies 1 016 1 024 15 therefore the gamma factor only depends on the water temperature t within this temperature range the only and most uncertain correction factor left is the alpha factor with all other factors eliminated alpha factor represents the effect of diffuser design tank geometry and water constituents on the overall oxygen transfer performance in wastewater 16 while the alpha factor was traditionally considered a constant value recent studies suggest that alpha factors fluctuate daily and seasonally and should be considered a dynamic factor 17 however there is still no universally valid approach directly to measure the alpha factor in practice the overall oxygen mass transfer coefficient can be indirectly determined through the off gas method using equation eq a 3 13 this equation is established based on the gas mass balance at a steady state assuming that both co2 and nitrogen are conservative with this equation kla may be estimated based on the measurement values of the total gas volume flow rate of inlet and outlet gases volumetric fractions of oxygen in them and do the estimation of oxygen mass transfer based on this theory has been referred to as the off gas method the off gas method has proven to offer a practical and accurate estimation under process conditions 18 and calculates alpha factor from measured off gas fraction using eq a1 4 although entirely accurate this method is expensive to adapt during operation as it requires additional sensors to measure the volumetric fraction of the outlet gas fraction y i besides the alpha factor measured with this method can only represent the water column of the sampled niche which may not be representative for other regions in the aeration tanks therefore numerous attempts have been made to predict the alpha factor s change with more accessible and cheaper parameters to measure under field conditions 19 21 it has generally been agreed that the impact of surfactants is responsible for the dynamic nature of the alpha factor 3 22 therefore many of these empirical regression models utilized routine measurements that reflect the level of surfactants such as mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and chemical oxygen demand cod as input parameters 19 21 23 24 however the resulting predictions are often too inaccurate due to many assumptions and over simplification that must be made while utilizing these empirical equations like the previous regression models machine learning ml allows engineers to develop data based analytical models ml models make predictions based on real time relationships between input and output data instead of formulated mechanisms however the ml models make significantly fewer assumptions and are proved to be more robust comprehensive and suitable for representing wastewater process units or components where detailed mechanisms remain unclear 25 27 in such a rapidly developing field however numerous ml models exist that each features unique characteristics and has various hyperparameters to be set for optimal performance it is increasingly unrealistic for wastewater engineers to incorporate all the best practices in ml model development into their models the automatic machine learning automl framework offers an easy to use toolset for general ml model developers to flatten the learning curve automl automatically determines the best model and the corresponding hyper parameters to yield the best performance based on the input dataset the model development process can be easily replicated or transferred to a completely different wwtp using site specific input parameters without substantial loss of predictability to date numerous studies have investigated the correlation between the alpha factor and an extensive range of operational parameters but the existing empirical equations often lack precision in predicting the airflow needed for a single wwtp under dynamic operational conditions the objectives of this paper were to i develop accurate models and alternative approaches to predict off gas fraction and dynamic alpha factor in aeration systems ii assess wastewater parameters that influence off gas fraction and dynamic alpha factor values and iii assess the optimal timescale for dynamic alpha modelling 2 methods 2 1 research site description this research was conducted at the adelaide pollution control plant pcp london ontario canada the adelaide pcp is an activated sludge process treatment plant designed for a maximum daily flow capacity of 29 600 cubic meters day m3 d with an approved peak flow rate of 59 200 m3 d currently the plant operates at 82 3 capacity with an average flow of 24 379 m3 d 28 during the study period the coldest and warmest months were march and september with an average stream temperature of 12 4 c and 20 7 c respectively the geometric properties of the unit processes of adelaide pcp are summarized in fig 1 a the wastewater treatment process related to this study consists of primary clarifiers aeration chambers and secondary clarifiers 2 2 data collection the adelaide plant is equipped with do nh4 n tss po4 2 p and density sensors integrated into the supervisory control and data acquisition scasa system the data used for the modelling were obtained from two sources the existing online sensors and a field sampling campaign the sampling frequency sampling location analysis sensor types and average values are summarized in table 1 the online sensor data were collected every 15 min from the raw wastewater channels primary clarifier effluent channels aeration tanks and plant effluent channels the 50 day field campaign collected dynamic cod nh4 n off gas oxygen fraction tss and vss data an autosampler was installed during the campaign to collect hourly samples daily from the primary influent and aeration tanks each hourly sample was collected from 4 sub samples that were grabbed by the autosampler every 15 min the daily 24 field samples were immediately transported to the lab and analyzed for cod hach number 8000 nh4 n hach number 10031 and tss vss us epa method 1684 during the field campaign an invent alphameter 32013 rev 2018 was also deployed at one of the aerations tanks near the do sensors to sample the off gas oxygen concentration released from the aeration tank fig 1 b the alphameter has a net surface intake of 1 m2 and was used to take measurements at 3 4 part of the tank fig 1 b the alphameter was connected to the measurement array on the walkway via pvc tubing and was equipped with a dedicated data acquisition system 2 3 outlier removal all the collected data were first preprocessed by the density based cluster analysis density based spatial clustering of applications with noise dbscan filter for outlier removal 29 as a density based clustering algorithm dbscan classifies a set of points based on their distance from each other points that lie alone in low density regions are marked as outliers dbscan requires the user to define two factors eps and minpts the minpts the minimum number of neighbours within a defined radius eps were set to be 5 for all datasets treated the values of eps were chosen by finding the first strong bend on a k distance graph for each dataset this paper performed dbscan with the python package scikit learn 30 about 5 of the data were considered an outlier and removed the removed data were then treated with the mean substitution method as kang 45 suggested 2 4 parameter calculation the alpha factor α hydraulic retention time hrt and soluble chemical oxygen demand scod were calculated the α factor was calculated as the overall transfer coefficient kla ratio between wastewater and clean water based on the off gas oxygen fraction obtained during the field campaign and other plant operational data eq a 4 hrt was calculated as volume of aeration tank influent flow the scod of plant influent flow and aeration tanks were estimated with the influent tool and activated sludge model provided by the gps x simulation platform respectively 31 the gps x model has been calibrated and validated using an extensive two year dataset from the same plant before using the model for extracting the aeration tank scod concentration corresponding to the field campaign period 2 5 optimal sampling frequency determination the optimal timescale of the input dataset for model development was assessed by averaging and transforming the original data recorded every 15 min intervals to 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 h 6 h and 8 h the resulting new datasets were used to generate pioneer ml models and ten replicate models were built for each timescale tested the accuracy of each model was calculated to quantify the effect of sampling frequency on the model s performance 2 6 auto machine learning processes in this study the autogluon tabular phyton library was used to determine the best model and corresponding hyperparameters automatically the autogluon tabular package an efficient and easy to use python framework is developed by amazon web services aws 32 33 the library has built in prediction tasks that allow automatic hyperparameter tuning model selection ensembling and data preprocessing such as data splits the autogluon automl uses a stacker model involving base and stack model layers the base layer trains individual base models then the base layer s output is concatenated with input features then the stacker model uses predictions of every base model as extra features thus training using both the input dataset and the concat layer output thus improving the model performance except for the dataset the stacker model uses similar model types and hyperparameters to the base models once we have the stack layer the weighting layer implements a selection technique that weights all the models and creates a weighted ensemble model that outperforms all the individual models the base stacker models considered in this study were lightgbmxt lightgbm glighgbmlarge catboost xgboost extratreesmse randomforestmse kneighborsdist kneighborsunif and neuralmetfastal during the automl training less emphasis is placed on hyperparameter tuning of these base models this is contrary to previous single model based approaches that depend on hyperparameter tuning 34 35 rather in the current approach the stacking component and the number of stack layers is what solves most of the problem and hyperparameter tuning adds less importance the input parameters used to develop the model and their value range are summarized in table 1 the data distribution is also shown in fig a 1 a to j in supporting document influent flow hrt pe tss and mlss were normally distributed while the remainder of the datasets were not normally distributed the data were manually checked for normality of the residuals section 3 3 and was standardized to speed up the training process but it was never normalized this decision was made in consideration of the machine learning algorithms used most of the fundamental machine learning models used were tree based that did not assume the normality of the input data data normalization should not significantly impact these types of ml models the performance of the models is evaluated by the root mean squared error rmse during training the train test split configuration was set as a training test ratio of 80 20 a total of 880 datasets were fed into the system for training the study also used a 5 fold cross test case with bagging a total of five models were trained each with its test dataset randomly selected accounting for 20 of the complete dataset in this way the test set was independent and not contaminated with the data used in the training process for each model as the dataset was initially arranged by time the order in which data was fed per epoch iteration could potentially influence the model increasing the training and testing error each split was randomly shuffled before each epoch to avoid bias during training and testing datasets 2 7 regression model calibration in addition to the ml models existing exponential alpha models were explored per the models developed by krampe and krauth 24 and jiang et al 21 using the current dataset the models were expressed as 1 α a e k a parameter whereby a and ka are constants adjusted calibrated by residuals minimization the current study used sludge and wastewater characteristics including mlss and cod as input parameters to calibrate existing regression models the considered regression models include mlss based by baquero rodríguez et al 20 günder 23 and krampe and krauth 24 and cod based by jiang et al 21 table 2 2 8 parameter sensitivity analysis the permutation shuffle importance score built in the autogluon package was used to determine the sensitivity of the ml models to each available input parameter 32 33 the permutation importance score is defined as the decrease in model performance when a single feature value is randomly shuffled 36 all permutation importance scores were calculated on the test set in this study the ml and hybrid ml modelling approach is summarized in fig 2 2 9 model performance evaluation to assess the performance of each model the researchers followed the procedures for goodness of fit measures in dynamic wastewater modelling as suggested by ahnert et al 37 after visual evaluation and tests for fitting the time dependent behaviour the three criteria root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and index of agreement d were applied 38 39 2 rmse t 1 t x x t 2 t 3 nse 1 t 1 t x m t x o t 2 t 1 t x o t x o 2 4 d 1 t 1 t x o t x m t 2 t 1 t x m t x o x o t x o 2 where x m t is modelled parameter and x o t is an observed parameter at time t 3 results and discussion 3 1 data preprocessing and wastewater characterization all operational parameters used in this study were preprocessed with the dbscan clustering algorithm to remove outliers after outlier removal the average hourly data with standard deviation were plotted to assess each parameter s variability within 24 h the average value of off gas oxygen fraction airflow aeration temperature hrt mlss cod scod primary effluent phosphorus and ammonia were 19 21 0 32 12 545 79 1903 46 m3 h 20 46 0 58 c 5 45 1 01 mg l 1380 92 51 97 mg l 276 50 46 14 mg l 142 70 23 63 mg l 3 50 0 59 mg l and 13 67 3 37 mg l respectively table 1 as shown in fig 3 figs a 2 a to f and fig a 3 a to k significant daily fluctuations were observed in the parameter s used to estimate alpha supporting alpha s dynamic nature in aeration systems the off gas oxygen fraction and the hrt showed the most robust average hourly fluctuation within a day among the assessed parameters fig 3 the off gas oxygen fraction was the highest early in the morning reaching its peak at around 7 00 am then decreasing to its minimum at around 1 00 pm before climbing back a potential cause of such fluctuation could be the change in wastewater influent loading in a day the higher loading would cause an increased concentration in the aeration tanks which leads to a lower oxygen concentration in the wastewater and therefore a higher oxygen transfer rate at the water surface this is also supported by the daily average of hrt which shows a similar trend as the off gas oxygen fraction several other parameters such as the temperature mlss po4 3 p and nh4 n did not show significant average hourly fluctuations in a day fig a 2 a b and c this suggested that these parameters may not reflect the daily fluctuation in the alpha factor and therefore models built with them may show limited predictability however the data behaved quite differently when assessing the dynamic data profile fig a 3 a to k than the hourly averages in a day fig a 2 a to f the off gas fraction alpha factor nh4 n mlss cod and temperature data were plotted against time to show the data variability during the field campaign period fig a 3 a to k most of the wastewater and operating parameters showed a higher variability during the field campaign period the oxygen fraction and alpha factor varied from 18 to 20 and 0 3 to 0 9 respectively confirming alpha the dynamic nature of an alpha when the overall dataset was considered a strong relationship was observed between hrt temperature hrt tss and cod with the measured off gas fraction fig a 3 c to h 3 2 optimal sampling frequency determination while developing models to describe wastewater treatment processes one crucial question is how to deal with the uncertainties within the input dataset currently most existing mlss based alpha models are often built upon average values collected and merged from several wastewater treatment plants causing them to be generalizable and lack precision when predicting the dynamic behaviour of a specific plant this study collected 15 min of dynamic data for seven weeks and studies were conducted to accurately identify an optimal sampling frequency to describe the oxygen transfer s dynamic behaviour accurately the analysis of the performance of models was built with seven different sampling frequencies 15 min 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 h 6 h and 8 h each with 5 replicates the 1 h interval group performs better than the 15 min interval group the average rmse nse and index of the agreement for the 1 h interval group were 0 06 0 68 and 0 89 respectively fig 4 however increasing the sampling frequency to 15 min lowered the model performance the poor performance at 15 min data scale shows that the wastewater data collected at shorter times could be unstable introducing noise when the sampling frequency was higher in addition some data were collected by sensors and analyzers in this case the sensors are distributed along with the treatment processes causing unignorable time lag in some datasets hence supporting deficient performance agreement at shorter timescales reducing the sampling frequency to 2 h caused the nse to drop by 0 08 and the index of an agreement to drop by 0 05 the model performance for the 8 h sampling frequency was almost halved compared to that of the 1 h interval models decreasing the accuracy of the models the latter result showed that decreasing sampling frequency affected the prediction accuracy as it may have caused oversimplification of the input data in summary the models developed based on the input dataset of 7 sampling frequencies indicated that the optimal sampling interval for alpha modelling in the adelaide plant was 1 h 3 3 model performance as aeration is both a critical process and is heavily energy intensive in wastewater treatment considerable effort has been made to develop models to predict the dynamic behaviour of the process among numerous factors involved in oxygen mass transfer efficiency in aeration the alpha factor which is dynamic by nature is the most uncertain parameter one popular theory is that the alpha factor is most closely related to the concentration of organic surfactants 22 40 41 based on this theory various attempts to model the alpha factor with parameters reflecting surfactants have been developed 19 21 23 24 most of these models are empirically derived however they often lack precision due to the time varying and highly nonlinear characteristics of wastewater treatment processes on the other hand machine learning and deep learning are practical and efficient when dealing with complicated systems like the previous alpha models these models do not depend on specific theories and generally do not make assumptions about underlying mechanisms except when selecting input parameters in this study the autogloun package was used to develop two different models that are robust with extreme input values an essential characteristic when dealing with wastewater measurements the first set of models referred to as the direct ml alpha model directly estimated alpha from some measurable wastewater parameters model output alpha model inputs aeration nh4 n mlss hrt cod pe tss pe cod pe po4 3 p the second set of ml models referred to herein as the hybrid ml mechanistic alpha model was developed to estimate the off gas aeration fraction from wastewater parameters and subsequently calculated alpha using the estimated off gas fraction using eq a 4 the off gas fraction was developed using inputs of wastewater parameters aeration temperature aeration nh4 n mlss hrt cod pe tss pe cod and pe po4 3 p an off gas fraction as an output the autogloun utilized a total of 10 individual base stack ml models including lightgbmxt lightgbm lighgbmlarge catboost xgboost extratreesmse randomforestmse kneighborsdist kneigh10borsunif and neuralmetfastal to build a weighted ensemble model the hyperparameters of the individual base stack ml models and the weighted ensemble model employed with their corresponding score values are shown in table a 2 a and a 2 b for the direct and hybrid alpha ml models respectively as discussed earlier the approach used by the autogloun for improved performance involves stacking rather than tuning hyperparameters which often leads to overfitting thus the default hyperparameter corresponding to some of the individual models was automatically selected by the automl lightgbmxt showed the highest impact of all the individual models the final ml model used for prediction was based on the weighted ensemble model that showed a slightly higher score than the lightgbmxt fig 5 a to c show the performance of three models built in this study a the direct ml alpha model and b the hybrid ml mechanistic alpha model and c recalibrated published regression models regression models are shown in table 2 the results were based on the 20 test datasets it can be seen how the hybrid ml mechanistic and direct ml models showed a slight discrepancy throughout the long term sampling period between the measured scattered blue and modelled line orange alpha factor values indicating a successful prediction over the long term the agreement of the predicted versus measured values using commonly used wastewater statistics including rmse nse and d the values are summarized in table 2 also the residual error histogram was plotted to assess the error distribution fig a 4 a and b for the hybrid and direct alpha models respectively both distributions confirmed the natural distribution of errors where 95 of the values lay within two standard deviations of the mean values showing no bias and satisfying the ml model assumptions the hybrid alpha model fig 5 b rmse 0 03 nse 0 96 d 0 99 performed better than the direct model fig 5 a rmse 0 07 nse 0 67 d 0 88 possibly because of the limited ability of the latter automl algorithm to model extreme values several alpha factor peaks were often recorded in the afternoon i e from 13 00 to 17 00 reaching a maximum of 0 96 the calculation from the off gas oxygen fraction to the alpha factor could amplify the extreme values from the oxygen fraction outputs allowing a better fit for more extreme value points it is important to recognize that the hybrid alpha model estimated the off gas fraction using automl models and used the modelled off gas fraction to calculate further the alpha factor based on established mechanistic equations the modelling approach primarily provided an alternative to the actual measurement of off gas fractions which were deemed difficult to conduct routinely in the wastewater treatment environment in addition to estimating alpha the off gas fraction model outputs can be used for calculating dynamic oxygen transfer efficiency ote to the authors best knowledge the approach of estimating air fraction has never been considered before and introduced in this study for the first time in this study the empirical equations were recalibrated using the current dataset for the adelaide plant based on these formulations by fitting the coefficients through residual minimization the resulting recalibrated models and performance of the models are shown in table 3 and fig 5 c respectively comparatively the recalibrated regression models reflect only the average of the alpha factor compared to the ml models that successfully captured the daily dynamics of alpha the alpha values directly estimated with these equations have shown significant deviation from the measured values possibly because of the difference in the range of input parameters three out of the four equations listed above estimated the alpha factors with mlss measurements 20 23 24 the average value for mlss at the adelaide plant was 1 4 g l although most studies that reported an alpha mlss relationship claimed to be applicable for ranges between 0 and 30 g l of mlss the input dataset they used to develop these models are often from high strength wastewater or processes that make use of membranes that yields above 7 g l for mlss which is significantly higher than the measurements at adelaide 23 24 baquero rodríguez et al 20 supplemented their input dataset with data collected from a full scale test by diago rosso in 2005 with mlss in the range of 1 4 g l they also introduced a second coefficient in the equation however when adjusting the coefficients with the dataset from adelaide wwtp this study it is found that removing the second coefficient results in a better fit which results in a similar formula to the ones developed by günder 23 and krampe and krauth 24 in comparison with the models developed with automl it is evident that these suggested empirical models based on mlss captured less dynamic behaviour of the alpha factor in the long term thus results from such models can only be used to estimate average alpha values that may not be beneficial for dynamic aeration modelling however the values can still be beneficial for design purposes that require average alpha values jiang et al 21 suggested an empirical relationship between the alpha factor and cod to estimate the dynamic behaviour of the former the cod raw data they used to train their model was the range of 200 1600 mg l 21 which covers the cod level of 130 400 mg l in the adelaide plant although developed in a similar range this model also did not exhibit a strong enough prediction of the dynamic alpha factor one possible explanation is that the cod concentration at the adelaide plant lacked variation in value over the long term which affected its ability to act as an indicator of the alpha factor thus the complexity of the field condition in full scale wastewater treatment facilities such as the adelaide plant might require the involvement of multiple parameters to make an accurate prediction of the alpha factor 3 4 parameter sensitivity analysis in the current study the direct ml and hybrid ml mechanistic models used several parameters to successfully estimate and capture alpha s dynamic nature the study also assessed the sensitivity of the models to each input parameter the current study used the ml method to plot the desired factor alpha against all potential parameters and then remove the least important ones through sensitivity analysis several parameters were identified to be correlated with the alpha factor some of these parameters were never considered in previous studies a total of ten input parameters were fed into the ml models hrt temperature pe cod pe scod based on influent fractionation and aeration tank scod simulated using gps x software pe po4 3 p pe and aeration tank nh4 n pe tss and mlss concentration several other parameters such as do and airflow were not used to estimate the alpha factor as those were directly involved in calculating the experimentally determined alpha values the feature importance rankings for the direct ml and hybrid models built in this paper are summarized in figs 6 and 7 for prediction of the alpha factor directly ml model aeration nh₄ n was consistently the most important parameter fig 6 a to d regarding oxygen fraction prediction hybrid model the influence of temperature overweighted all other parameters fig 7 a to d the results showed that parameters measured within the unit aeration processes matter significantly in alpha prediction models direct alpha models the importance of nh₄ n dropped when replacing the aeration dataset with pe nh₄ n measurements aeration scod calculated from gps x simulation was less crucial than measured aeration cod this is observed in both alpha fig 6 c and oxygen fraction models fig 7 c assorted studies showed that surfactants significantly impact bubble diameter and reduce kla 40 43 mlss tss cod and scod could therefore be seen as appropriate parameters to characterize the behaviour of oxygen transfer rate in the aeration process several other parameters that were not reported to impact oxygen transfer were also correlated with the alpha factor in this study the concentration of nh₄ n in the aeration tank depends on the nitrification efficiency of the plant the ammonia concentration may influence the oxygen demand by altering the chemical driving force in the reaction therefore affecting the alpha factor hrt has been proved to control the cod and nh3 load to the plant and it could influence the do needed for the biological reactions and influence the oxygen transfer rate 44 the temperature of the wastewater also impacts the oxygen transfer rate the temperature would affect the rate of the reactions during the aeration process which changes the do consumption rate and the dissolution rate of oxygen in summary it was found that the data measured from influent flow or pe flow the data directly measured from the aeration tank would improve the modelling accuracy since most wwtp focus more on the quality of influent and effluent flow many fail to access the information within the aeration section therefore it is recommended for modern wwtps to install more sensors to monitor the aeration process to provide a more accurate prediction of the oxygen transfer rate or have a virtual wwtp running in parallel that could provide information on the aeration tank process parameters 4 conclusion this study developed a new framework for efficient and robust modelling of the dynamic alpha factor by estimating the off gas oxygen fraction from activated sludge plants using the ml approach the estimated off gas fraction was then used to calculate alpha factor and compared with the alpha estimates directly from wastewater characteristics using published recalibrated regression equations and an ml approach it was discovered that using a 1 h sampling frequency was the optimal timescale for dynamic alpha modelling for all the models 46 future dynamic models should consider that the optimal sampling frequency for model development could be different from the raw sampling frequency of the sensors for the input parameters the proposed hybrid ml mechanistic approach of estimating off gas fractions showed superior performance over other models rmse 0 03 and nse 0 96 further the ml models that estimated dynamic alpha directly from measurable wastewater parameters and operating conditions showed better performance rmse 0 07 and nse 0 67 to that of recalibrated published regression models rmse 0 18 to 0 28 and nse 0 in addition to the traditionally acknowledged parameters used to predict dynamic alpha the new model includes other input parameters including temperature hrt nh₄ n and po₄3 p which were found crucial to predicting dynamic off gas fraction this study showed that hybrid ml mechanistic models could be an economical efficient and reliable alpha modelling method to optimize the aeration process although ml models have shown high efficiency and accuracy in alpha prediction it has the limitation to producing only black box models further control study is required to elucidate the cause and effect relationship of the new input parameters availability of data the raw and processed datasets used during the

12962,water is an essential element contributing to human life evidence shows that only a portion of the water from sewage tailings is recovered in the consolidated tailings process the process produces sediments with a high water content that require special storage this is problematic because water trapped in such structures might remain there for a long period this study investigates flocculants that can potentially help these systems in this publication we look at how literature has sought to optimise their formulation to enhance dewatering efficiency and present a clear overview and guidance on the main parameters involved using both theoretical and practical examples we have assembled over 200 references majority published 2020 or earlier in this review article to demonstrate the complexities of designing a flocculation system employing state of the art synthesised organic inorganic and hybrid flocculants we next go over a few of examples of how to use microscopical techniques to learn more about the flocculation mechanism this manuscript can be treated as an illustrative visual comprehensive view of application of flocculants to wastewater systems graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords colloids colloidal matter material design flocculation 1 introduction water is an essential component of human life water makes up around 60 of the human body water is also required to produce food clothes and maintenance of health and the environment 1 therefore clean drinking water is critical everywhere the production of a large amount of hazardous chemical waste by numerous businesses as well as its incorrect disposal exacerbates the water situation to generate clean water or to return the water to operation the industry must cleanse the water to eliminate suspended particles one method of addressing this issue is to employ polymer flocculants there are a couple of steps before one can successfully use polymer flocculants to destabilize particles in each media changing flocculant dose molecular weight mw charge density synthesis of new polymer or employing a mix of flocculants coagulants for maximum efficiency are just a few examples many investigations have been conducted on the mechanism of action of flocculants and settling to improve efficiency for the understanding mechanism of actions some theorists have resorted to modelling and molecular dynamic md simulations 2 others have tried to change polymer flocculants through changing mw or synthesizing random 3 or star co polymer 4 8 new ones or even extracting new ones from nature 9 other researchers have used a variety of polymers including cationic anionic and non ionic polymers together with inorganic salts to increase settling rates and create stronger denser flocs 10 examples of some of the findings in the literature on the subject of using polymer flocculants are anionic flocculant is more effective at increasing the settling speed of slurries than cationic and non ionic flocculants when the ph flocculant dosage and shear rate rose the relative flocculation rate increased at first and subsequently decreased on the other hand as the solid volume percentage of the slurry grew the relative flocculation rate decreased 10 theoretically polymer induced flocculation is generally understood to occur via two primary mechanisms charge patch interaction or charge neutralisation and bridging 11 the sorption of relatively low mw polyelectrolytes on oppositely charged particle surfaces causes the charge patch interaction on the other hand high mw polymers adsorb cumulatively on more than one particle causing flocculation on relatively small flocs charge particle flocculation is generally effective and consistent on the other side bridging flocculation can result in very huge flocs other flocculation and settling mechanisms have been considered such as sweeping flocculation which we shall discuss briefly later polyacrylamide pam is the basis for most commercial polymeric flocculants mentioned in the literature anionic cationic or non ionic this polymer is also modifiable with combinations of comonomers anionic pam the most important category of pam can be made by copolymerizing acrylamide with acrylic aid or partially hydrolysing polyacrylamide the mw of pam may also be easily adjusted throughout the manufacturing process intentional degradation can also tune in the mw of pam pam may be used to construct incredibly long chains due to the nature of condensation polymerization pam charges charge density or length can be modified for instance in the case of kaolinite suspensions with neutral ph any pam flocculant independent of mw or charge type and concentration can accomplish successful flocculation however only a small number of pam flocculants with very precise properties e g very high mw anionic medium charge can stimulate flocculation of oil sands tailings more complex system for treatment 12 according to researchers even with huge mws cationic pam or non ionic pam were unable to flocculate particles in oil sand tailings the solid in tailings on the other hand could only be flocculated with anionic pam flocculants 12 13 however even in the case of anionic pam the residual water contained considerable amounts of fine clays from 1 to 3 wt after flocculation limiting its usage in the bitumen extraction process which needed solids below 0 5 wt these are examples to demonstrate the difficulty in selecting a decent flocculating system aside from kaolinite 14 and fine tailing samples used for flocculation flocculation in the literature has been done on calcite calcium carbonate 15 alumina 16 iron 17 18 carbon nanotubes and so on aside from the modification indicated above to increase flocculation and theories mentioned that explain the flocculation process some researchers have looked at poly n isopropyl acrylamide pnipam copolymers for building smart systems that perform several functions at once such as polymer bridging and floc densification pnipam in the flocculation industry has been studied extensively for instance with rheology authors 19 discovered that gels based on pnipam switch from a free flowing liquid to an elastic gel upon increasing temperature displaying a reverse transition after cooling when both particle and polymer concentrations are above some critical levels suspensions flocculated by bridging show an elastic response at low frequency one polymer chain forms several bridges in bridging flocculation and a sequence of bridges cannot be disrupted by non interacting bonds this indicates that flocs made by pnipam are resilient due to the sensitivity of pnipam to temperature and salinity variations in industrial water dosing these waters with these polymers should be done with caution and successful application of these polymers is more difficult than standard pam based flocculants characterisation of the flocculant flocs and flocculation process is just as important as choosing a flocculant various characterisation approaches have been utilised to better understand the flocculation process including but not limited to turbidity 18 zeta potential 20 afm 21 confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm 22 transmission electron microscopy tem 23 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps 24 rheology 25 26 focused beam reflectance measurement fbrm 27 28 and so on fbrm will be discussed briefly here followed by a microscopy technique to provide a glimpse of characterisation techniques that can improve flocculation knowledge and enhancement a significant characterisation technique is fbrm which is a frequently used technique for measuring flocculation performance fbrm can help comprehend the floc size distribution as a function of shear rate in a typical jar test by monitoring flocs in situ while flocculation is taking place particles with a size range of 0 8 μm to 1000 μm are measured using the fbrm technique and these measurements are commonly grouped into 38 or 90 intervals 29 the diameter of particles flocs can be approximated with chord length values poly aluminium chloride pac was recently studied to see if it may reduce quartz entrainment in a batch mixture of quartz and galena 30 galena commonly known as lead glance is a naturally occurring lead ii sulphide mineral pbs the first set of measurements was performed on the slurry of quartz minerals to assess the efficiency in studying the aggregate formation and assessing the shear resistance of aggregates fbrm and other supplemental approaches were used to investigate the aggregation and dispersion behaviour of quartz and galena successfully in ref 31 the flocculating abilities of two synthesised fe pam and al pam were examined after their adsorption on kaolinite a commercial anionic flocculant was also tested for comparison fbrm device was utilised to assess the results dynamic aggregation in situ the adsorption kinetics of the polymers onto silica and alumina which represent the t and o basal planes of kaolin were also evaluated using a quartz microbalance device al pam fe pam and hydrolysed pam h pam were shown to have good flocculating qualities with h pam being the least effective and more prone to the overdose of the flocculants studied proper mixing had a significant impact on flocculation performance the capacity of al pam and fe pam to bind to both basal planes of kaolin as opposed to h pam which only adsorbs on positively charged aluminium basal planes was linked to their higher flocculating capabilities in polymer adsorption and flocculation of kaolin suspensions electrostatic attraction or repulsion is found as a crucial characteristic using fbrm authors could observe how floc size changes over time a simple yet effective technique for investigation of flocculation process a few fundamental parameters that have a considerable influence on the dewatering flocculation of diverse systems will be investigated in this work this section was kept brief to prevent repetition by citing the same parameters in other published reviews 12 32 then the most intriguing and significant research in literature has been presented that has lately increased the efficiency of the flocculation process in this review paper we compiled over 200 references to highlight the complexity of creating an optimal flocculation system using cutting edge synthetic organic inorganic and hybrid flocculants later to better understand flocculating systems a section on modelling and another on putting flocculants on top of superstructures such as microgels were added readers interested in the general principles of polymer flocculation should read ref 11 the publication s uniqueness stems from the careful selection of contemporary references as well as the inclusion of complex systems such as polymer mounting on microgel particles in addition to tuning chemical systems associated with flocculation mathematical optimization of flocculation was mentioned other reviews published in the literature on the topic of using polymer flocculants are i in ref 33 this reference seeks to examine recent advances in the application of bio based synthetic and stimuli responsive flocculants in the literature ii ref 34 this review looks at bacterial derived flocculants and iii ref 35 looks at biobased flocculants for water purification the approach of the current publication differs from those discussed here in that it examines the issue of flocculant performance from a colloidal perspective providing a clear tool for understanding the flocculation process and potential improvements furthermore the variety of characterisation methods available here provides researchers with an excellent tool for optimising and comprehending their flocculation process 2 important factors the following section will discuss polymers often employed in water treatment as well as the impact of their mw and charges following that dual and smart systems will be investigated and the impact of shear as an extrinsic factor on flocculation will be extensively analysed 2 1 polymers polymeric flocculants cause finely divided particles to agglomerate and segregate into flocs they are classified according to their charges which can be cationic anionic or non ionic they can be classified based on whether they are natural 36 or man made as well we may also categorise them based on whether they are branching 37 linear or star shaped starting from non ionic polymers polyols unhydrolysed polyethers and polyamides are the most common nonionic polymers pam and polyethene oxide are two of the most prevalent nonionic polymeric flocculants used in the mining industry examples of non ionic flocculants are hydrolysed pam neutral charge 38 40 polyacrylic acid polyvinyl sulfate polyethylene oxide peo 41 49 polyacrylamide pam polyvinyl alcohol pva 17 50 55 and polyvinyl pyrrolidone pvp 56 64 positively charged groups such as amino imino or quaternary amino are found in cationic polymeric flocculants examples of positively charged flocculants are poly dimethylammonium chloride pdadmac and diallyl dimethylammonium chloride ddmac 65 71 cationic pam polyethene imine pei 72 76 polyvinyl pyridine pvp poly vinyl benzyl trimethylammonium chloride poly vbtmac 13 the copolymer of 2 dimethylamino ethyl methacrylate dmaema and pnipam 77 pdadmac is the first synthetic polymer to be approved by the us food and drug administration for use in potable water treatment it has a backbone made up of cyclic units and very hydrophilic permanently charged quaternary ammonium groups the topology of polymer can become more complex if the flocculant efficiency needs improvement synthesised polymers with multiple branches i e star shaped polymers are an example of sophisticated polymer structure modification the star shaped 7 8 morphology synthesised copolymer with the dextran and pam grafted arms was described in ref 7 during the production process the dextran preserved a macro coil conformation however no study was done to assess the effect of dosing this polymer for flocculation in another similar study i e tuning topology several cationic star shaped polymers with varying hydrodynamic diameters were used the hydrodynamic diameter measures how bulky the structure is in the solution the findings revealed that a dual component system including a star polymer was more efficient than a single component system this study was effective in demonstrating the dual impact of employing two mechanisms of star polymers in combination with linear ones as well as being a representative of a dual system for optimal flocculation efficiency in another study a star shaped polymer was combined with a polyacryl amide based anionic polymer with a high mw and low charge density to produce extremely good flocculation the amount of polymer required was significantly reduced in this system demonstrating that a star polymer can be combined with a linear polymer and produce efficient flocculation it should be noted that the rate of adsorption and desorption of linear and star shaped polymers are different similarly grated polymer topology is distinct from linear polymers in a recent study 78 cationic kraft lignin kl was grafted with either 2 acryloyloxy ethyl trimethylammonium chloride atac or 2 methacryloyloxy ethyl trimethylammonium methyl sulphate metam kl metam produced bigger and stronger flocs with looser structures than kl atac as a recap in this part we reviewed many different types of polymer flocculants and highlighted some of the research highlights on the selection or manipulation of polymer flocculating systems 2 1 1 mw the most essential polymer parameter impacting flocculation performance is polymer mw longer polymer chains in flocculants with high mw can adsorb onto the surface of several particles at once whereas macromolecules with lower mws adhere to fewer particles as a result as compared to low mw polymers high mw flocculants can achieve quicker solid settling rates polymer mw can have a significant impact on flocculation efficacy furthermore mw is not the only element that influences flocculation the distribution of polymer sizes has an impact as well the distribution of length of polymer chains with the same mw might be very different the structure of the sludge and the qualities of the polymers decide the mw distribution be used in ref 79 scientists discovered that a wider distribution of polymer sizes resulted in greater flocculation for polyacrylic acid while no such effect was observed with the copolymer of acrylamide and quaternary acrylate salt percol discussion on the role of polymer mw on efficiency is subjected to ref 25 according to the research lesser mw counterparts generate denser quicker settling aggregates and have a more dose effective response under mixing mild in general bigger sized flocs formed by greater mw flocculants can permit quicker settling aggregates under strong mixing except for instances where polymer sizes and concentrations might cause entanglement 80 81 in ref 81 it was empirically established that the kaolinite s adsorption ability for pam increased with increasing mw however the ability for adsorption of ultra high mw materials was 20 times lower than that of low and medium mw samples the cause for the reduced adsorption was ascribed to chain entanglement this study demonstrates that a high mw is required for an effective flocculant system but there is an optimal point in other circumstances analogous to the issue of entanglement an increase in mw that is too high results in loose flocs with gel structure due to the trapping of too much water tailing ponds are an example of this disadvantage since the mechanical qualities of flocculated sediments are not good enough to be reclaimable while some studies have found that a high polymer mw improves flocculation 82 others have found no clear evidence 83 such investigations are limited by a small variation in mw a lack of control over flocculation conditions or a single dosing comparison research that questioned the effectiveness of a larger mw yielded even more evidence of such a problem at a fixed mass of polymer lower mw polymers produced a higher number of chains favouring the onset of flocculation at low dosage 84 if greater aggregate sizes are desired the lower mw polymer would be predicted to be less effective at a larger dose in one study 80 sodium catalase concentration 0 01 m in the slurry favoured modest particle coagulation but calcium catalase hurt settling rates even at lower concentrations 0 002 m with the impact on reduced bridging activity that was most noticeable at lower mws the higher the polymer mw the faster the kaolin slurry sedimented authors 13 used pnipam with varying mws number average to make a 2 wt kaolin suspension while keeping the polymer dose constant at 1000 ppm it was obvious that increasing the mw of the polymer enhanced the pace of solid particle settling this finding backed up the theory that flocs develop because of polymer chain bridging and subsequent settling the authors of ref 85 tested two distinct lengths of poly propylene oxide ppo grafts employing either 300 g mol or 1000 g mol macromonomers although it is difficult to detect a link between graft size and flocculating dewatering performance with only two values their findings suggest that ppo grafts with the smallest mw were more efficient with decreased turbidity and a faster settling rate the author attributes this effect to the ppo grafts higher hydrophobicity in comparison to pam and pdadmac authors 86 found that hydrophobic groups improved dewatering performance and reduced turbidity according to ren et al 86 hydrophobically modified polymers are more likely to form bridges with suspended kaolinite particles because the long alky chains may adsorb to more locations on the particles in these conditions hydrophobic substances allow greater mw flocculants to be more effective it should be noted that altering the backbone of the polymer can modify the polymer s lower critical solution temperature lcst if the system is functioning based on the polymer s changing behaviour as a function of temperature lcst is a critical temperature blow in which components of the mixture are miscible for all compositions here water and polymer if hydrophobics comonomers are included in the polymer s backbone the amount of water retained is reduced and the solid content of the sediments is enhanced indeed most researchers think that a better bridge between the polymer and suspended particles would result in stronger flocs and overall performance other studies that indicate increasing mw is beneficial to flocculation aims can be found in refs 83 87 88 for flocculation purposes some of the references 89 in the literature have reported mw of polymer flocculant from 1500 to 8 600 000 g mol most studies require a minimum of a mw in the thousands of g mol range for effective flocculation readers should be aware that the length of a polymer might vary depending on branching ipn or semi ipn repeating unit length mw and other characteristics backbone stiffness 90 and thus mw information alone is insufficient 91 furthermore depending on the charge of the particles the polymer can operate as a charge neutralizer in these instances the mw of the polymer until a certain threshold becomes irrelevant to flocculation since it is used only by the particle surface for charge neutralisation 92 for example in cationic pam chain adsorption promotes flocculation of negatively charged small particles charge neutralisation is the most typical way by which polyacrylamides can reverse the particle surface charge locally collision with a negative patch produces bridging and eventually aggregation nevertheless this mechanism of flocculation is highly limited for low mw polymers other references 80 81 87 report the polymer s mw for their studies and its impact on flocculation however because mw may not be a good criterion due to the reasons stated here the actual length of the polymer under processing ph and temperature should be considered and reported instead the use of high mw anionic pam in the flocculation of negatively charged particles outperforms cationic polymers by enhancing the settling rate and establishing a distinct sediment shape 12 only minimal adsorption is possible due to electrostatic repulsion between kaolinite particles which have a negative charge and the polymer polymer chain expansion caused by repulsion on the other hand results in the creation of loops and tails which lead to the production of huge open structured 12 as a result polymer conformation polymer length is also vital in creating an outstanding flocculating system here it was discovered that mw has a significant impact on flocculation effectiveness for dewatering purposes and that the decisive element for bridging success should be the actual length of the polymer rather than mw information 2 1 2 polymer charge the capacity of the polymer to adsorb on and eventually flocculate particles is influenced by the charge type and density high charge density polymers for example have difficulty adsorbing onto the surfaces of particles of the same charge type such as anionic pam and negatively charged clay particles 93 low to medium charge concentrations on the other hand may be beneficial during polymer adsorption because they encourage the repulsion of charged polymer segments lengthening the polymer chain and boosting the flocculant s total bridging capacity as a result there is an ideal charge density that aids the flocculation process both theoretically and experimentally charge density is primarily determined by the percentage of ionised segments along the polymeric chain ph affects the degree of ionisation of weakly ionising groups like carboxylic acids as a result adjusting ph during flocculation is critical charge density can be represented by the mol of ionised segments however the actual charge of polymers based on theoretical backbone information is insufficient the colloid titration method is also useful for measuring charges the ionicity of the polymer was shown to have a substantial influence on the rate of flocculation settling velocity and bed consolidation in ref 94 the zeta potential of chromite ore tailing had an isoelectric point at ph 7 39 the zeta potential of the net of the particle was positive at acidic ph while negative at alkaline ph the sizes of the particles were also in the micrometre range both ionic and cationic flocculants were shown to be efficient in the flocculation of chromite tailings the results revealed that when the ionic strength and mw were low anionic flocculation characteristics improved but cationic flocculants performed better when the cationic strength and mw were high the success of anionic and cationic pam in flocculation can be related to particle charges that allow for particle flocculation with polymers non ionic pam was shown to be ineffective at flocculating tailing particles the ionicity of the polymer appears to be highly relevant here based on the results findings from the literature on the issue of degree of ionisation demonstrate that for pam or similar polymer flocculants it determines the degree of molecule extension or the enhancement of charge density to perform charge neutralisation more effectively in this section it was shown how surface charge affects the flocculation process in particle suspensions whether strongly charged or not 2 2 smart responsive systems smart responsive polymers are used in paints and coatings as well as food additives and biological applications in this section the application of these same systems for flocculation is examined we generally identify the polymer as temperature sensitive by understanding whether it will become hydrophobic or hydrophilic when the temperature changes polymers like pniapm are distinguished by their ability to transition from hydrophobic to hydrophilic at or below a threshold temperature therefore here temperature is a controlling parameter that can control polymer action in the solution polymer solution phase behaviour is an essential feature in the creation and design of most polymer related processes the upper critical solution temperature ucst and the lower critical solution temperature lcst which both rely on the molar mass and pressure are common solubility thresholds in partially miscible polymer solutions at temperatures below lcst the system is miscible in all proportions partial liquid miscibility begins at lcst and continues to become more immiscible as temperature rises pniapm is a thermo responsive polymer best recognised for its aqueous lcst of 32 c 95 which allows it to be used in a wide range of industries as a result combining a flocculant system with other properties such as conformation tweaking with temperature may result in an even more potent system to put things in context when it comes to smart system usage below are some examples of temperature smart system utilisation that will be discussed following the initial flocculation with rising temperature polymer conformation is extended and fines are captured the temperature is decreased to allow pnipam to evacuate surplus water trapped in flocs however this is an energy intensive process and is usually not favoured in the industry unless inherently warmer water warmer due to process is mixed with a flocculated stream to raise the temperature 96 97 the point of lcst is also modifiable with additives this could be useful if flocculation and polymer extensions need to be changed for instance when electrolytes are added to a non ionic polymer solution the lcst of the polymer can be moved to lower temperatures as an example kanazawa et al 98 reduced the lcst of polymers from 32 to 20 c by adding 1 m of salt this method is intriguing because it reduces the energy required to warm water and makes it more amenable to industrial processes in a nutshell there are various instances of works that exploit this capacity for flocculation which may be found in ref 99 and there is a wealth of literature on lcst of polymer flocculant research that may be found in ref 100 while exploring ucst of a polymer flocculant can be found in ref 101 literature on using lcst and ucst to do water treatment can be found in ref 101 102 another smart system is to have a system to change property based on light two light sensitive copolymers containing various cinnamoyl groups were synthesised in ref 103 and later were used as a flocculant to destabilize a model suspension in employing flocculated system dosage ranged from 0 1 mg g to 5 m g both were efficient flocculating agents however comparatively at the dosage studied they acted similarly to compare the effects to commercial treatments however a greater dosage was required 103 the authors of ref 104 used optogenetics to develop unique technology for water treatment and purification utilizing nano charged dielectric polymeric beads the beads were coated with a photosensitive protein called channel rhodopsin in this method this protein belongs to the rhodopsin family of proteins which are light gated ion channels when these nano charged beads are combined with water they produce a lot of turbidity at first but then the beads begin to attract the colloids in the water since the beads have been covered with a photosensitive protein investigators have been able to regulate the movements of these nanoparticles in water by employing a certain wavelength of light other light sensitive polymers most exploited light sensitive polymers containing azobenzene chromophore can be found in refs 105 106 ph sensitive polymers have weakly acidic or basic ionisable moieties susceptible to protonation or deprotonation which are affected by ph fluctuations 107 the polymer chains desolvate and collapse in water when these ph responsive polymers are not ionized and hydrophobic interactions prevail when the polymer is ionized however the repulsion between chains takes precedence and the polymer becomes strongly solvated in water the ph range for this phase transition may be adjusted in two ways by replacing monomers with ionisable groups with pka values that correspond to the needed operating ph range or by adding hydrophobic moieties into the polymer backbone more hydrophobic moieties are included resulting in structures that are not unionized it has been demonstrated in the literature that altering the charge of a polymer can cause it to extend due to repulsion between charged monomeric units facilitating the bridging mechanism 108 the scope of this text does not allow for the incorporation of the plethora of material now accessible in the literature for various types of polymer polymer flocculants that change properties due to them being multifunctional 109 to recap we only discussed smart systems based on temperature light and ph here because ph indirectly regulates the length of the polymer by varying the quantity of ionisation studies on ph are indirectly associated with studies on polymer charges 2 3 dual multiple systems the employment of two types of flocculants can help to enhance the efficiency and physical qualities of the resulting flocculant mining treatment and pulverized coal separation as well as sewage sludge separation are examples of the application of two stage flocculation flocs created by dual flocculation are bigger and more resistant to shear pressures than those formed by flocculation with only one kind of polymer better floc sturdiness towards shear can be attributed to the formation of denser flocs that are more resistant to hydrodynamic forces during shear charge neutralisation techniques are also more robust to shear than polymer bridging ones due to the formation of many contract direct points between particles 92 the obtained effect is strongly dependent on the flocculant proportion and the use of dose which is usually greater than when only one flocculant is used when employing each polymer specifically al dawery 110 demonstrated that combining a blend of polycarbonate and polyacrylic acid for flocculation results in improved liquid clarity the combination of flocculants could raise the sludge volume index by 70 compared to 40 in the case of polycarbonate alone the generation of fine and shear resistant flocculants was demonstrated after initial charge neutralisation using an ionic flocculant it has long been known that a combination of positively and negatively charged polymers can cause synergistic effects in the coagulation of paper pulp the dual system used for polymer flocculation was poly ethylene oxide phenol formaldehyde peo pfr 111 and fecl3 pam hybrid polymer 112 it is worth noting that making these extensively used organic coagulants flocculants 111 112 is difficult and costly which has limited their usage in wastewater treatment when calcium 8 mm and magnesium 8 mm respectively are added to tailing solutions already containing 20 ppm of the flocculant the initial settling rate increases from 4 to 11 and 13 m h 113 these findings imply that divalent cations can destabilize these clay particle suspensions resulting in a considerable increase in hpam flocculant fine clay flocculation efficiency the hydrodynamic conditions utilised during flocculation have a significant influence on flocculant performance the size and shape of flocs are mostly determined by mixing and the pace at which polymers are added to stimulate collisions between the flocculant macromolecules and the particles mixing energy shear must be provided to the solution successful collisions will result in polymer adsorption and floc production other studies in the literature using dual systems are anionic pam and a nanosized cationic hybrid polymer nhp 114 the following conclusions have been drawn from studies in the literature use one polymer to form loose flocs before adding another polymer to expel water from the flocs 114 making them denser use a low mw polymer for charge neutralisation and then add a high mw polymer to aggregate the destabilised particles 115 use a second polymer for reaggregation of broken flocs 116 use inorganic salts with polymer flocculants 20 and using salt to increase adsorption of polymer onto the particles dual systems can also be mixed of polymers with different mws in ref 92 the authors concluded that mixing polymers with different mws and observing flocculation performance leads to a wider range of effective flocculation across the optimum dosage points as well as larger flocs and faster sample clarification furthermore due to the promotion of charge neutralisation over polymer bridging a little amount of short chain polyacid in the mixture dramatically increased flocs resistance to shear 92 2 4 shear shear ph salt and temperature are examples of non flocculant characteristics here we discuss the influence of shear on flocculation since other parameters are stated periodically in other sections and their impact on flocculation has been mentioned to bring polymer and solids into close contact and promote effective flocculation small particles require more mixing energy however the flocculated aggregates are disrupted under high shear rate conditions either by rupture of attachment sites on the particle surface or scission of covalent bonds inside the bridging polymer chains after floc breakdown depending on the circumstances certain systems go through floc re growth reaggregation using a photometric dispersion analyser pda burgess et al 117 investigated the influence of shear on floc size and flocs re aggregation similarly using a conventional jar test and pda yukselen and gregory 118 investigated the influence of shear on the development and breakup of clay flocs generated by the addition of aluminium sulphate polyaluminum chloride pdadmac and acrylamide copolymers some flocs however are impossible to re aggregate after breaking for example broken kaolin flocs are difficult to re grow in the presence of aluminium according to li et al 119 the mechanism of floc connection and disconnection contributes to an understanding of the outcomes produced under various mixing circumstances as well as floc breakup and regrowth the coagulation process is influenced by the mixing state according to several writers 120 the quick mix can have a significant influence on the ultimate coagulating efficiency although a brief period of quick mixing was required for effective turbidity reduction extended rapid mixing degraded efficiency these findings might be explained by the fact that some polymer adsorption on the surface is loose and drag force at high mixing rates can separate the polymer from the particles surfaces mixing allows polymer molecules to stretch and distribute throughout the mixing volume as well as the identification of successful collision following the adsorption of most of the chain and the creation of flocs continued mixing causes the flocs to degrade when a high mixing power is used the result is deterioration which ultimately affects flocculation efficiency varying polymers have different thresholds for chain sessions due to shear forces depending on temperature acidity salinity and mw and these thresholds should be taken into account during mixing 121 when flocs are split with shear the adsorbed chain can also be disrupted and reformed into flat adsorption on the surface preventing bridges from developing deoxyribonucleic acid dna dynamics can provide clues on how polymers react in a shear flow field shaqfeh and chu as well as coworkers 122 123 studied dna tumbling dynamics in pure shear flow in response to these findings the tumbling dynamics of single dna molecules have been studied in a variety of shear and rotational flows with various weissenberg numbers wi in a shear flow field dna conformation exhibits extension and tumbling motion polymer flocculants depending on mw and rigidity are likely to undergo comparable transitions the impact of linking shear thinning and structural break down under high and long shearing duration was investigated in ref 120 and a considerable variation in yield stress of thinned and flocculated mature fine tailing was discovered to cause cavern development during the mixing operation there is also an optimal mixing time that results in a well flocculated mature fine tailing when water is released from flocs this means that too much or too little shearing is not conducive to excellent flocculation floc strength is determined by inter particle bonding between aggregates components this comprises the floc s bond strength and the number of bonds if the applied tension is greater than the floc s bonding strength the floc will break increased floc compaction is thought to improve floc strength by increasing the number of bonds that hold the aggregate to give an overview of the impact of shear the orientation of dosed polymer can change due to the impact of shear which may affect flocculation rate flocs can break down and re stabilize with shear and magnitude of shear and also noted the initial shear can improve polymer particle mixing 92 124 overall it appears that creating a flocculating system is difficult due to the system s complexity which comprises a polymer particles and a range of factors 3 optimizing flocculation flocculation can be improved by using ideal chemicals such as a mix of small and big macromolecules or differently charged macromolecules as well as mathematical optimization methods we will start with mathematically aided optimization and then go on to various optimization tools involving various substances 3 1 mathematical optimization using models that can capture trends in experimental data mathematical statistical optimization can help any system achieve its optimal points several studies in the literature have focused on the use of artificial neural networks and complete factorial designs to enable the development of improved flocculating devices in this section will be reviewed artificial neural networks in their different forms attempt to obtain data as input and then determine an output such as initial settling rate floc density settling rate and so on 125 this is a type of optimization since reverse engineering can disclose the ideal flocculant system for flocculation by determining what combination of inputs such as ph dosage and inorganic coagulants are required to lessen the weight of studies this strategy cut through the link between different impactful parameters as well recently the potential of aluminium based water treatment residual as a coagulant for dye removal was assessed the effects of changing chemical dosages initial dye concentrations and ph were evaluated in the first experiment the colour removal quantity was later predicted using an artificial neural network 126 the optimization protocol examined here can greatly reduce the timing of the experiment and evaluation a chitosan based flocculant was developed in another study and its morphology and flocculation ability was tested in various water conditions including copper ion and disperse blue 56 127 based on experimental data on polymer synthesis condition dosage and ph an artificial neural network model was constructed to forecast the elimination rate of these two contaminants 127 another study used elman neural networks to forecast flocculant dosage in the drinking water treatment process elman neural networks are in the core design partially recurrent neural networks information on these networks can be read in ref 128 multiple linear regression the radical basis function and optimization based on support vector machines as well as a model based on elman neural networks were among the models developed in the literature a mixed term containing the long term and short term data was incorporated into the model to improve the realism of prediction this enabled the model to encompass periodicity as well as the impact of time on water quality data the authors discovered that the effluent turbidity of the tank was more stable under the guidance of an artificial neural network model than under the guidance of other models 129 therefore modelling using artificial intelligence here was used as an optimization technique for the mere purpose of automation the design of the experiment is a systematic strategy for improving the quality and cost of water treatment processes by developing credible modelling based on a smaller number of experiments the full factorial design is a widely used experimental design strategy that can quantify the primary effect s significance and explain the interaction between effects and parameters 130 in ref 131 a full factorial design was used to investigate the influence of several parameters on water treatment efficacy as well as to examine the interaction between the participants and the efficacy of the flocculation process ph coagulant dosage flocculant dosage pollution loads and a goal variable of turbidity and chemical oxygen demand cod elimination were all considered these findings demonstrated that linear regression models are well suited for capturing experimental data coagulation flocculation is effective for turbidity removal regardless of pollution concentrations in the water according to an analysis of variance anova design study organic matter removal is also more successful in less dirty water according to the findings 131 anova can help neural networks with feature selection 132 3 2 chemical optimization tuning flocculating systems green flocculant and bio flocculant are discussed in the following sections to show how changing chemicals or techniques might affect the outcome of flocculation to lessen the environmental impact of flocculation it is preferable to adopt a system such as green flocculant flocculant system in some of these systems optimization means leaving fewer environmental footprints this requires chemical coagulant optimization 3 2 1 tunning flocculating systems the previous section only reviewed some concepts that have already been addressed extensively in the literature they were mentioned to provide a basic grasp of flocculation in this section we present illustrative instances of advanced investigations in which flocculants were utilised to destabilise suspensions or in some cases cells some elements can be modified to improve the system s flocculating capabilities graphic depictions of these systems will be shown in this section fig 1a displays afm photos belonging to the nanoparticle microgel complex at temperature blow critical temperature nano particle microgel complex is a complex yet innovative flocculating system that can do a better job of flocculation than simple systems if these systems are designed correctly 133 the results in ref reveal that pnipam microgels have a double faced electrostatic behaviour due to their variable charge density at temperatures below lcst they behave as quasi neutral colloids but when collapsed they strongly interact with oppositely charged species 133 fig 1b shows a fluid fine tailing scheme 134 as well as typical flocculation precipitation acquired using afm 135 the settling of particles following flocculation is seen in this illustration unsatisfactory flocculation effectiveness and contamination of pam flocculant leftovers are harmful to the environment and aquatic life the degradation rate of the polymer was tuned in ref 135 measured up to 76 within 4 h showing a competent degrading mechanism to accomplish this rgo tio2 composite material was first created using a simple sol gel process and then photocatalytic polymerization was used to create the rgo tio2 pam composites comb structure in which polymer chains elongated with one another increasing the contact area between the polymer and particles the zeta potential of composites generates a decrease in repulsion between polymer and particles the comb structure was shown to be favourable to the expansion of polymeric chains and enhancing the contact area because it was necessary to remove the pam polymer chains from the water after flocculation the self degradation process was included in the system to address this issue several ways have been offered with photodegradation introduced as a viable solution as a result this complex system is a more intricate variant of pam with an extra degrading mechanism that provides a futuristic approach to frequent limitations seen with pam related formulations enlarging the polymer flocculant can sometimes be more successful at flocculation graft copolymers with different graft ratios and mws were created using batch polymerization in water the mw of the copolymer was found to be inversely linked to its graft ratio estimated at round 0 82 the turbidity removal ratio was 99 and supernatant turbidity was reduced from 13 324 to 150 ntu 136 water bath polymerization was utilised to create graft copolymers with different graft ratios and mws mw was shown to be inversely related to graft ratio ratio estimated at 0 82 the turbidity removal ratio exceeded 99 and the supernatant turbidity was lowered from 13 324 to 150 ntu 136 the poly aluminium chloride acrylamide methacryloxyethyltrimethyl ammonium chloride pac am dmc flocculant was found to be a novel organic inorganic hybrid flocculant in this study due to having a good yield at low applied dosage therefore leaving less chemical residue in waters after flocculation simultaneously it is less hazardous and better for the environment than organic pac and pam 137 after treatment the water content of the flocs generated by the hybrid flocculant was considerably lower than that of the compound and monomer flocculants which can reduce flocculation time the hybrid flocculant had fewer settling flocs whereas the supernatant has more water after flocculation and a greater turbidity removal rate salt resistance was also enhanced with this hybrid flocculant this study also demonstrates that organic inorganic hybrid flocculants outperform single type flocculants 3 2 2 green flocculants this section covers several different types of polymer flocculants as well as some of the research highlights on polymer flocculating system selection and modulation this section will look at more environmentally friendly flocculant systems such as those based on cellulose or chitosan even though man made polymer flocculants have been the most widely utilised thus far due to their excellent flocculation and low cost natural ones have the advantages of being manufactured on a large scale and at a lower cost 138 researchers are studying more bio based flocculants due to their application having better harmony with climate centred policies as a result of new laws aimed towards the manufacture of more environmentally friendly formulations in one notable example to replace pam in fig 2a chitosan graft polyacrylamide chi g pam was created and studied in tandem with the effect of solution salinity for flocculating kaolinite suspensions one notable result was poor flocculation and adsorption at high salinity conditions probably due to more compressed conformations 139 similarly synthesised in ref 140 was 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride cta modified chitosan graft polyacrylamide first the flocculation windows were reported broader than chi g pam due to the polymer chain s more stretched conformation because of improvements in charge neutralisation and bridging flocculation as cta content rose flocculation performance improved furthermore higher cationic degrees resulted in higher efficiency most likely due to improved charge neutralisation capabilities similarly using the same line of thought quaternised cellulose derivatives with varying degrees of substitution were synthesised authors demonstrated that flocculation efficiency increased with the degree of substitution higher cationic degree for both dye and montmorillonite over a wide range of ph values 141 the literature outlines four probable flocculation mechanisms 144 i positively charged flocculants adsorption on negatively charged particles causing surface neutralisation the particle now has no repulsion resulting in aggregation ii patch mechanism the adsorption forms a positive patch on the particle allowing it to link to other particles through patches similar to janus particles 145 for this process to work the distance between charged groups on adsorbed macromolecule on the particle must be smaller than the distance between charges on the particle iii the method by which a macromolecule links to particles 146 iv the falling network of flocculant entraps more particles particles should be bigger than the pore of the descending network creating further flocculation it is possible to have 2 3 mechanism acting in tandem in a flocculating system to improve efficiency while cncs required a slightly larger dose by weight than chitosan cncs required a lower dose when expressed in terms of the number of cationic charges added 142 fig 2b illustrates the difference between chitosan which has a similar molecular structure to cnc and cnc when comparing cncs and chitosan a lower dose of cnc was required to induce effective flocculation of algal cells whereas chitosan achieved polymer bridging and neutralized algal cell walls because of their findings the authors concluded that having stiff flocculants might be more useful for improved flocculation a green flocculant based on branching polyethyleneimine grafted cellulose was created and manufactured successfully 143 to treat kaolin wastewater fig 2c depicts field emission scanning electron microscopy images of two cellulose components and 2 3 dialdehyde cellulose that interacted to generate hyperbranched polyethyleneimine grafted cellulose the first two photos indicate reaction components whereas the last sem image depicts the result flocculant in addition to displaying good flocculation performance has also shown success in eliminating ammonia nitrogen iron and phosphorus these findings suggest that this flocculant is ideal for many wastewater treatment applications in the next part some real world examples of different effluents from various industries will be examined 3 2 3 contaminated waters direct phase separation is a common technique for neutralising the charge of colloidal particles and linking them to form flocs however in some systems charge neutralisation is insufficient or the efficiency is inadequate to address this shortcoming flocculation based on the polymer can be used for a wide range of sewage based fluids these sewage based fluids can come from various industries as an example fig 3a displays the dairy effluent and effluent condition at a dose of 53 mg l flocculant based on pam tailored made with inverse emulsion polymerization clearly flocculant has been successful in removing soft particles from staying suspended in the water in detail the authors of ref 147 created anionic polymer flocculants co and terpolymers that they used to treat dairy effluent wastewater via flocculation the results showed that polyelectrolytes with higher anionic contents performed better in the treatment process and that chemical modification increased hydrophobicity especially when the monomer utilised had a longer hydrophilic aliphatic chain previously better hydrophobicity medium charges and higher mw were linked to better flocculation in agreement with the results of this study the data also show that when a particle s surface has a low charge the hydrophobic impact is strong as is the case in this study permeability is critical in the dewatering process since it represents the difficulty of filtering especially for soft solid materials like sludge flocculants had a strong impact on sludge permeability which exhibited an inverse relationship with filtering pressure in one study 148 essentially the authors investigated the permeability of filter cake by adjusting the dose of various constituents taking into account the impact of flocculation on cake filterability authors 148 concluded that flocculants could change the properties of sludge see fig 3b the organic flocculant cationic pam increased the size of the floc cluster while decreasing the specific surface area and fractal dimension the fractal dimension reduced gradually when the inorganic flocculant dose was increased an inflexion point was identified at poly aluminium chloride and ferric chloride dosages of 40 and 60 mg g respectively when the particle size initially declined and subsequently grew in turn the particular surface area increased first then declined pressure had the same effect on filter cake across all flocculants resulting in a decrease in filter cake permeability this research is significant for sectors that require filtration as part of their solid liquid separation strategies ab block copolymers with four arms and a star shape have the potential to be utilised in industrial flocculation purposes these polymers were created using a two stage aqueous reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer raft polymerization technique 5 these polymers generated quick settling rates and reduced supernatant turbidities as contrasted to a reference random copolymer fig 3c shows a schematic of the use of star polymer vs the random copolymeric version of it six distinct star shaped block copolymers were created these polymers were mixed into a modelled suspension of kaolin slurries with three different ca2 concentrations 0 05 0 10 and 0 50 m the efficiency of the control random block copolymer reduced considerably as the amount of ca2 increased in contrast the star shaped copolymers displayed outstanding stability in floc settling speeds and supernatant turbidity despite high ca2 levels 5 because of its well built chain this flocculant is more resilient in dealing with hard waters with high ionic strength the impacts of shear mw temperature and other factors dynamics and how polymer conformation changes after a collision were demonstrated in the introduction the rate of flocculation is a direct reflection of particle collision success furthermore in particle plus flocculant systems the folding behaviour of the polymer coil bound to the surface of particles is also crucial according to ref 150 even the inclusion of a little polyanion can considerably reduce the flocculating action of cationic flocculants this suppressive effect can be explained by a decrease in the effective collision radius induced by the swollen polymer coil shrinking because of an oppositely charged polymer link all of these studies demonstrate the significance of polymer conformation in the solution phase as well as the re conformation process when it comes into contact with the surface of colloidal particles at the start of flocculation as a result the effective size in the transient condition spanning continuously adjusting collision time and the metastable state of adsorption should be thoroughly investigated the authors have compared the initial stage dynamics of flocculation of positively charged latex particles flocculated by negative charges polyelectrolytes polyelectrolytes complexes linear polyelectrolytes and polyelectrolytes complexes microgels with a negative charge and positively charged linear polyelectrolytes in ref 149 the purpose of this study was to highlight the effect of the less deformable character of microgels compared to liner polymers as well as the function of polyelectrolyte aggregation on the rising rate of flocculation fig 3d illustrates a schematic that attempts to demonstrate the distinction similarly the impact of polymer structure on flocculation efficiency is investigated in this study the bioapplication of flocculants will be addressed in the following part in this regard these waters fall within the category of industrial water such as algae growth and harvesting that occurs in water media 4 bio applications coagulation flocculation and centrifugation are harvesting techniques used in algae biotechnology flocculation is a unique harvesting technique used here for microalgal cells such as botryococcus braunii b braunii and chlorella ellipsoidea c ellipsoidea that were harvested with varied dosage requirements 151 fig 4a shows a representation of this procedure as microalgae cells were matured in ref 151 they became progressively negatively charged by pairing a negatively charged and high extracellular polymeric substances eps content with a high mw and positively charged polymer charge neutralisation and bridging facilitated flocculation a similar mechanism was applied in ref 152 for microalgae collection in one similar study using flocculant alum consumption was severely reduced alum coagulant consumption was reduced from 77 6 to 4 5 mg g after using extracellular polymer components produced from microalgae scenedesmus acuminatus at a level of just 3 2 mg g 9 as a result careful flocculation formula selection is critical and it is optimizable because contamination of algae and its viability is critical in this application the flocculant should be carefully calibrated and selected dye removal from water is a flocculation process adaptable especially in the case of pigment removal carboxylated cellulose nanofiber with the highest aspect ratio of 144 was extracted from waste ginger fibres 154 fig 4b shows a super sorbent constructed of cnf aerogel adsorbing methylene blue dye from underneath silicone oil silicone oil was not picked up by cnf aerogel but it was quickly absorbed when it encountered methylene blue as a result this sorbet is an excellent substrate for removing colours from silicone oil like methylene blue mb 154 the incorporation of hydrophobic medicines with low oral bioavailability into nanoparticles nps is an appealing technique for enhancing gastrointestinal dissolution kinetics one way of performing nanoformulation is flash nanoprecipitation i e a scalable process for encapsulating water insolvable therapeutics into nanoparticles that can lower the barrier to their dissolution inside the body the report in ref 155 explains how to concentrate cellulose polymer stabilised nanoparticles using a ph driven reversible flocculation method nanoparticles were first stabilised by anionic hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate using flash nanoprecipitation particles were then concentrated 50 fold by acid induced flocculation and redispersed at neutral ph thus reducing drying time by many folds 155 these findings support the notion of reversible ph controlled flocculation as a viable method for concentrating large quantities of electrostatically stable nanoparticles the 50 fold concertation factor achieved in their research was an arbitrary choice according to theoretical authors and much greater concentrations are attainable schematic developed by the researchers 155 are displayed in fig 4c flocculation concepts can also be extended to cells from the standpoint of colloidal flocculation cellular flocs employing a cellulose nanofiber modified with a concentrated polymer brush are reported in ref 156 the affinity relationship between the proteins cells and polymer brush is crucial for cellular flocculation and gene expression analysis according to cell adsorption studies 156 microalgae harvesting is related to cell scaffolding by the sense of polymer flocculation which was discussed before 5 simulation and flocculation md simulations were used to study the process of dispersion and aggregation of nanoparticles implanted in a polymeric medium these simulations can accurately reflect the system under consideration for parameters like temperature pressure and volume fraction but they are insufficient to address the real world stability of colloidal dispersion as demonstrated by the tests shown below the amount of polymer flocculant supplied to colloidal particles has a significant impact on the system s stability to account for these findings different bridging mechanisms have been proposed to describe the coagulant process the model developed by la mer et al 157 158 for instance can explain experimental results under extremely narrow conditions such as low polymer concentrations early phases of flocculation and so on apart from models computational modelling has been extensively employed to study particle aggregation for instance the dimerization energy of asphaltenes increases with the number of aromatic rings in the aromatic core but stays constant with different alkyl side chain lengths according to reports 159 161 asphaltene dispersion behaviour in model solvent mixtures is altered by cashew nutshell liquid cardanol and polycardanol 162 163 the simulated outcomes closely mirror the observed patterns in experiments allowing researchers to get a better understanding of the chemical processes behind cardanol and polymer stability and precipitation similarly the synergistic adsorption of two types of polymers on the basal surface of montmorillonite was studied in aqueous settings 164 the interplay of particle and chitosan electrostatic attraction hydrogen bonding between chitosan and pam and attraction between chitosan and nanoparticles was related to polymer synergistic adsorption the modelling findings provided a mechanical foundation for the experimentally observed synergistic flocculation by including multiple polymers 164 although numerous polymers have been used to promote synergetic flocculation in the literature the underlying process has remained unknown making it difficult to investigate them directly with characterisation tools the examination of these interactions is limited to models and simulations indicating the considerable applicability of these techniques in addition to experiments 165 as per x ray diffraction the magnesium precipitates are predominantly composed of brucite crystals adsorption is predominantly caused by deprotonated oxygen from the acrylic group of mining aggregates 166 as a statistical description of adsorbed polymers simple conformations with loops trains and tails have been proposed 167 carbon percentages in trains and loops are frequently low in comparison to carbon fractions in tails demonstrating a willingness to build polymer bridges through tails in all conditions fig 5a shows a side view of hpam in a typical conformation on brucite and kaolinite surfaces in 0 6 m nacl solution at 300 k and ph 11 red represents oxygen blue represents sodium cyan represents chloride carbon and pink represents magnesium aluminium brucite features numerous connections large loops and short tails as compared to kaolinite and quartz the hpam chain is adsorbed in quartz at a single point the electrostatic repulsion of quartz and kaolinite with the anionic acrylate groups of hpam prevents the creation of loops and trains the results of this study show that the process of polymer flocculation varies depending on particle size from system to system similarly in ref 167 md simulation was used to explore the influence of nacl concentration on the configuration of an anionic polyelectrolyte and its chemisorption on a quartz surface at ph values much over the isoelectric threshold two opposing forces influenced the entire flocculation process fig 5b depicts the self assembly of ctac a cationic surfactant and a non anionic polymer in the presence of sodium salicylate nasal because ctac pam nasal solution is worm like it has a greater viscosity than the original solution 168 the md simulation is used to examine ctac and polymer self assembly process which experiment cannot reveal these molecule level changes flocculation is influenced by three stages first ctab molecules self assemble and the pam chain begins to coil ctac molecules then combine to create larger spherical micelles salicylate has access to the micelles centre and can compete for hydrophobic interactions the polymer chain leads micelles to congregate and form worm like micelles in the third phase finally polymer chain formation creates an entangled network and an interpenetrating network the interaction mechanism between several biocompatible polymers and the fe3o4 surface was explored at the atomic level in fig 5c using md modelling 169 the flexibility of the polymer chain was discovered to be the most important factor influencing the form of the polymer on this surface chitosan and dextran reacted with the fe3o4 surface more strongly than the other polymers the researchers believe that the high flexibility of polymer chains contributes to the compact structure of fe3o4 this study also showed that a robust interface may easily form between a polymer with hydrogen bond functionality and the fe3o4 surface and that the polymer s flexibility can help in the formation of a thick layer of polymer on the surface clearly the conclusions of this study relate to the previous discussion of polymer conformation and flexibility a team of scientists created a model that can be used to forecast the flocculation kinetics of a papermaking process in advance the model also allows authors to select the operating conditions and flocculant that will create aggregates with specific attributes and hence performance a population balance model was constructed for the flocculation of particles containing polyelectrolytes of extraordinarily high mw medium charge density and various degrees of branching to depict the flocculation bridging process the model incorporates aggregation breaking and flocs rearranging all at the same time furthermore the number of polymer branches influences the radius of gyration if the number of branches is raised while the mw of the polymer remains constant the polymer radius of gyration must likewise drop 170 the floc restructures and the flocculation rate decrease as the radius of gyration decreases it was discovered in this section that simulations can considerably improve understanding of polymer behaviour at the surface particle and help us design more optimal flocculating systems to categorise the data on using flocculant shifting polymer such as changing mw manipulating dosage to achieve an optimal dosage or increase efficiency changing charge density manipulating polymer lcst or ucst and utilisation of dual coagulant systems in a table the data on using flocculant shifting polymer such as changing mw manipulating dosage to achieve an optimal dosage or increase efficiency changing charge density manipulating polymer lcst or ucst table 1 summarises some of the studies discussed in this study filtration and mixing as previously indicated are post flocculation activities and have been kept out of this section table 1 the research path is based on polymer classifications dosage and charge density modulation smart responsive system adaption and the incorporation of various flocculant or flocculating chemicals in the table multiple dual system besides employing multiple polymers also refers to a combination of polymer and coagulant that can charge neutralize particles individually for better polymer adherence to the particles it appears that adjusting polymer dosage to generate flocculation is one of the parameters nearly solely experimented with in most published studies it is also obvious from the statistics in the table that responsive systems receive the least attention due to their strictly scientific application while real wastewater systems are made up of a variety of substances organic and inorganic rendering these systems ineffectual 6 characterisation of flocs this section covers optical microscopy om sem tem afm and clsm other characterisation methods may be used to study flocs such as x ray diffraction xrd x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fourier transforms infrared ftir rheology and so on however due to space limits will not be mentioned particles in suspensions and gels have been seen using optical microscopy sem tem afm and clsm each strategy has a distinct edge over the other optical microscopy is widely available because of the ease with which it can prepare samples yet its resolution is restricted the greatest attainable point to point resolution is governed by a basic set of physical constraints thus exceeding this intrinsic limitation of resolution is difficult with visible light when the lateral distance between two objects is less than half the wavelength of light optical equipment is limited in its capacity to distinguish between them this is known as the diffraction barrier sem and tem on the other hand provide high resolution but they both need sample preparation which depending on the sample can be time consuming despite not having an optical origin like sem and tem clsm has the most complicated sample preparation method since the samples require tagging with a fluorescent dye that preferentially remains on intended spots confocal microscopy on the other hand is the least intrusive microscopy method that allows for live imaging of materials in the subsequent sections each of these methods with their application is reviewed 6 1 om after researching optical microscopy findings in the literature it was revealed that due to its ease of use optical microscopy offers a wide range of applications in polymer floc systems in ref 181 optical microscopy was used to investigate the film formed within a liquid droplet on a solid surface as a result of evaporation and convection which resulted in the production of a contact line when the solvent was completely evaporated from the non ionic pam solution a coating was created on the glass surface and morphology was investigated using afm and optical microscopy pam is coiled in an acidic solution and may be adsorbed on the surface in a dot like pattern the adhesion was strong due to the strong contact between the carboxylic group of pam and the silica hydroxide of the glass surface the distribution of adsorbed pam was also found to be random the coiled pam adsorbed on the glass in a spot form again in a neutral solution however as pam molecules from a strip along the flow direction the contact was weaker the largely hydrolysed alkali treated pam caused repulsion and unflooding of molecules in the solution indicating that the contact between pam and glass surface was modest the polymer membrane was discovered to flow from the centre outward to the contract line area the molecules spread outward forming a rice spike pattern the form and size of the flocs were assessed using an optical microscope in ref 182 the influence of ion destabilisation on particle coagulation was investigated in this work the goal of this study was to see if the natural and biodegradable polysaccharide fucoidan fd might be used as a flocculating agent 182 this study clearly showed that calcium ions can improve flocculation of fd aluminium oxide particles system through screening of double layer that made the interaction between polymer chain and surface of particle easier furthermore the scientists postulated that divalent calcium ions may interact with bio flocculant anionic groups if these double chains adsorb on the surface of nanoparticles the resulting aggregate can be bigger and heavier increasing the likelihood of flocculation as seen using an optical microscope 6 2 sem flocs have been seen using scanning electron microscopy in the literature for example abbasi moud et al 183 employed sem to investigate the differences in morphology of cnc coagulated structures when particle and salt combinations were varied the findings of linear and nonlinear rheology were rationalised using morphological information gained from sem image analysis sem is excellent for viewing the structure of flocs in general because it exposes the structural stacking of particles which varies according to the technique of synthesis and processing conditions sem is particularly useful for determining the morphology of self assembled structures nevertheless the technology s resolution range is insufficient for determining the morphology of the particles themselves if they are nanometric in size individual particles with nanometric sizes can be spotted using field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem fe sem achieves a resolution of better than 1 nm at a 30 kv accelerating voltage using sem in ref 168 authors examined the effect of different kinds of starch on the flocs dimension of hematite particles it was illustrated that the average size and projected area of flocs increase with the increase in dosage sem revealed a variance in apparent flocculation performance due to differences in molecular structure according to the authors the structural properties of flocs such as size distribution form and fractal dimension were investigated using static light scattering and cryo sem in ref 184 the scientists discovered that the main particles in flocs appear to be submicron platelets using sem furthermore flocs appear to have a fractal dimension 2 09 that is comparable to that of flocculation in the reaction limited cluster cluster aggregation phase of flocculation clusters get denser in this phase because the structure is not produced through the diffusion restricted cluster cluster aggregation regime furthermore the substantial porosity found shows that the interior structure of the floc might have a big enough liquid permeability to accommodate tiny primary particles polymers appear to be joining fundamental particles which is in line with the findings of other researchers 185 due to the sensitivity of these structures to electron bombardment it has been suggested that collecting cryogenically frozen polymer chains is fundamentally problematic according to some writers 185 thicker strands are caused by the loss of water caused by generating freezing conditions which causes the polymer network to collapse and aggregate sem can also reveal the appropriate flocculant dose sem pictures revealed that an ideal polymer dose of 1000 ppm results in an internal floc structure with two distinct zones of decreased porosity and open channels indicating that this arrangement allows for efficient water squeeze out of pores 177 cryo sem can also reveal the effect of salt addition on the morphological features of un flocculated slurries 186 the different charge particles of kaolinite as known leads to edge to face edge to edge and face to face structures face to face orientation is absent in raw slurry owing to repulsive force between particles however with the presence of coagulants face to face orientation is more prominent even when there is considerable space between layers later the shape of kaolinite particles was studied in the presence of salt and flocculant the particle exhibited predominantly edge to edge and edge to face orientation 187 and positive zeta potential in the presence of a high mw polymer and a high nacl concentration indicating a significant contact between the polymer and the particle a partly cross linked polymer was used to make flocculates for calcium chloride slurries this flocculant had semi particulate entities and polymer chains aligned in a 3 d dimension resulting in stronger sediment and less retained water as well as a greater aggregate face to face packing structure 186 6 3 tem due to the shorter de broglie wavelength of the electron beam tem is capable of imaging at better resolution than optical microscopy and sem 188 other advantages of tem over sem include 1 the target point in the sample may be accurately selected i e strips of the sample can be scanned with an accuracy of roughly 20 nm 2 sample preparation is relatively rapid and 3 the sample can be obtained from an endless variety of materials the purpose of tem is to evaluate the distribution and dispersion of fillers in suspensions as well as the particle morphology tem pictures reveal the structure of individual particles as well as their condition of aggregation dispersion allowing for quantitative analysis of the samples the fractal dimension of floc clusters generated by salt addition was determined using tem images in a recent publication by abbasi moud et al 189 given the relevance of tem in defining flocs suspensions the use of tem in the future especially for identifying particle placement in the hydrogel after employment cannot be ruled out tem has a benefit over sem in that it can provide fractal dimensions of flocs clusters the morphology of alkaline lignin and lignin was investigated using tem images in references and it was discovered that alkaline lignin had a scattered structure commercial lignin on the other hand had a branchy structure and was easy to aggregate based on these observations the authors concluded that the chemical composition of the two polymers differed similarly lignin based flocculant had a self assembled entangled structure while papermaking sludge based flocculant had a branching structure with multiple side chains because of the branching structure of papermaking sludge based flocculant there was more contact area between the polymer and the dye particles resulting in a greater dye removal efficacy in the papermaking sludge based flocculant scenario conclusions concerning various methods of interaction and flocculation may be drawn from the inferences made here based on the structure of the flocculant before dosing the morphology of kaolin tio2 polyacrylamide pam organic inorganic composite flocculant was studied using tem in ref 190 the presence of titanium dioxide on kaolin was demonstrated using tem by evaluating interplanar spacing which was reported to be 0 242 nm equal to 103 crystal lattice of titanium dioxide the presence of polymer was further demonstrated by the weakening of the edge shaping phenomena indicating that polymer did indeed coat the particle s surface in this case tem was employed in conjunction with visualisation as a characterising method to verify the synthesis of a composite flocculant system 6 4 afm afm is a powerful tool for investigating cnc clusters and individual particles this versatile technique is not only able to capture the morphology of particles at high resolution but also measure interactions between chemical species mounted on the sharp tip of afm and cnc particles the latter refers to the usage of afm in the force spectroscopy mode while the former refers to the topography imaging mode 191 compared to other microscopical methods afm offers several benefits afm offers a far better spatial resolution than optical microscopy methods allowing it to view individual particles high resolution pictures may also be obtained using sem and tem although a complicated sample preparation process may compromise the structural integrity of materials afm imaging requires essentially minimal sample preparation since it maps the sample by direct contact between the afm tip and the sample in some cases afm can measure the forces acting between two items in addition to providing a technique of visualisation in this situation the forces operating between the probe and the surface may be analysed and numerous conclusions regarding interactions can be formed for example by modifying the afm tip it can investigate the intermolecular interactions that occur when various substances are adsorbed on mineral surfaces quantitatively 192 a review of the literature reveals that afm may be used to discern more data about polymer flocculated particles for example in ref 193 the authors discovered that the ph of the solution is significant in the interaction of polymer and solid particles the adhesion forces measured by afm may be divided into two categories bare force and flocculation forces at a ph of 10 flocculation forces reached maximum levels allowing for settling tests and flocculation measurements increased effective binding sites between coal particles and polymer extended chains were attributable to the increased bridging interaction in a similarly conducted study 14 the interaction between the particle surfaces and polymers in different solution environments was investigated by afm force measurement to further reveal the interaction mechanisms the model kaolinite substrate and silica probe were placed in a cell filled with the polymer solution to measure the adhesion forces in two polymer solutions for the investigation anionic pam and a flocculant based on chitosan and pdmdaac when the silicon probe was pushed towards the silica surface in an anionic pam solution the usual force curve exhibited a high repulsion starting at a distance of 40 nm the afm detected a long range 150 nm attraction with a magnitude of 0 25 nn when the probe was withdrawn from the substrate this long range adhesion can be attributed to polymer bridging when the probe was moved towards the silica surface in the chitosan pdmdaac example an attractive force was measured at 100 nm this is due to electrostatic attraction between the probe and the surface which is negatively charged and positively charged afm may also be used to examine the flocs after flocculation and illustrate how they expand however this characteristic of afm is identical to that of sem and tem thus it will not be discussed here to summarise afm appears to be a flexible method that can demonstrate the number of interactions in a variety of conditions in contrast to other microscopy techniques that can only provide information about the microstructure 6 5 clsm clsm is a sophisticated method that uses tagging to examine the structure of colloids and soft materials in situ 189 194 195 the clsm as a characterizing tool was chosen because of the recent increase in its use and the clarity it provides in the analysis of flocculation systems 22 196 this approach can also distinguish between distinct labelled components in this part we will briefly discuss case studies from the literature that employed clsm to explore flocculation and flocculated systems it is clear from the literature that there is a general interest in using confocal microscopy to investigate the interior architecture of flocs the authors of ref 196 investigated the influence of partly hydrophobic grafted polymers on flocculation and dewatering of mature fine tailing samples using clsm the authors used rheology and confocal laser scanning microscopy to investigate how graft density impacts first its dispersion in water and flocculation efficiency in terms of solid content as well as the flocs long term behaviour 3 dimensional confocal laser scanning pictures revealed spatial distributions of water within flocculated sludges allowing the performance of flocculants to be assessed according to the report increasing the graft density traps more water within flocs reducing the additional procedures required to boost dewatering rates confocal revealed how loosely particles are following flocculation which may be used as an additional criterion to choose polymer flocculants capable of producing more dense flocs in the same way laser imaging may be used to analyse the structure of sedimented flocs the authors of reference 22 aimed to study the molecular behaviour of particle flocculant interactions and their link to floc structure which is crucial for constructing tailing treatment with enhanced consolidation rates a three dimensional quantitative link between flocculation state and bulk sediment structure characteristics was used to study a non invasive in situ imaging of floc formation and subsequent sediment microstructure polymer driven suspended particulate matter flocs are a frequently used approach in a variety of applications ranging from water treatment to composite material manufacture aggregates generated by edge face dominated structures require less polymeric dosing when formed at low ph but those formed at high ph require more polymeric dosing it has previously been discovered that the size of the bentonite aggregate influences the inner floc structure flocs composed of smaller aggregates had strongly interconnected network mechanical characteristics whereas flocs composed of larger aggregates had a less interconnected patchy interior structure the authors used a series of 2 d confocal shots to build 3 d images of flocs 197 a comparison of data at ph 3 4 5 and 11 reveals that the internal floc structure does not change as ph increases but the zeta potential and mode of aggregation edge face to face face do the findings indicate that primary particle size determines internal floc structure whereas primary particle shape controls polymer adsorption and optimal polymer dose similarly the authors of ref 198 show that changing the ionic strength changes the microstructures of the polymer bentonite floc which can be seen using clsm the structure of flocs changed from networked to patched assembly the flocs had a tightly networked structure when the ionic strength was 10 mm but a patchy structure when the ionic strength was higher internal floc structure was investigated in these two samples using clsm as a function of ph and ionic strength sludge flocs are microreactors that absorb and break down pollutants to have a better understanding of sludge operations thorough information on floc structure is required anaerobic treatment is an important method for reducing the volume of waste activated sludge and producing biogas before sludge dewatering flocculants are routinely employed to enhance filtration rates 199 the sensitivity of oxygen concentration distribution within agglomerates to rapid changes in ambient oxygen levels was studied using microsensors the reaction time for the electrode in the floc core was five times quicker than in the original sludge flocs following polyelectrolyte flocculation the increased floc size was primarily responsible for the increase in total mass transfer resistance fluorescence in situ and clsm are two methods used in this study in some cases an extra strategy is necessary to validate the results obtained by current characterisation approaches the fractal dimensions of two different cationic polymers agglomerated e coli strains were calculated 200 the form factor is used to calculate the fractal dimension at large scattering angles static light scattering calculations using hard sphere particle simulations provide wildly disparate findings at varying flocculation periods the fractal dimensions calculated using static light scattering and clsm are very similar 1 90 to 2 19 clsm was used to corroborate the results of static light scattering in this case anaerobically digested sludge is difficult to dewater 201 due to the release of microbial chemicals traditional flocculation procedures are hampered by excessive chemical dosing and solid increase carboxylated chitosan and chitosan performed well in terms of sludge dewatering improvement in terms of filtration resistance and capillary suction time the flocculation effectiveness of these chitosan based flocculants was recently evaluated using clsm clsm demonstrated that protein like compounds accumulated during flocculation enhancing sludge dewatering efficacy it is appealing to nano formulate poorly water soluble medications to improve the dynamics of oral dissolution the translation is hampered by the dilution and drying of dilute nanoparticle concentrations the reference paper 155 describes a ph driven reversible flocculation approach for concentrating nanoparticles stabilised with a cellulose polymer due to the release of microbial compounds anaerobically digested sludge is difficult to dewater 201 traditional flocculation techniques suffer from heavy chemical dosing and solid increase in terms of resistance to filtration and capillary suction time carboxylated chitosan and chitosan fared well in sludge dewatering improvement clsm was recently used to evaluate the flocculation efficacy of these chitosan based flocculants clsm revealed that protein like substances gathered under flocculation conditions promoting sludge dewatering performance it is attractive to nano formulate poorly water soluble drugs to enhance the kinetics of oral dissolution the concentration and drying of dilute nanoparticle suspensions are a barrier to translation a ph driven reversible flocculation technique for concentrating nanoparticles stabilised with cellulose polymer is described in the reference paper 155 using temporal resolution confocal imaging the scientists evaluated flocculation kinetics and the effects of crucial conditions such as ph rheological properties and nanoparticle concentration furthermore high resolution microscopy was used to determine the fractal dimension of the agglomerates to better understand the flocculation mechanism the fractal dimeson effect of parameters was explored in addition to developing the inner structure of flocs confocal images may also be used to investigate soft particle flocculation in the system such as microemulsion polysaccharide stabilisers are commonly used by food manufacturers to improve the consistency and physiological shelf life of oil in water microemulsions such as salad dressings the most common explanation for their hydrocolloid s stabilising impact is that it regulates the aqueous phase s rheology the addition of a very tiny amount of xanthan gum 0 1 wt results in the coalescence of moderately saturated emulsions supported by protein sodium caseinate or a non ionic surfactant tween 20 the emulsions can readily withstand several days if not months of exposure to further identify the basic process the authors of ref 202 investigated the texture of a sodium caseinate based emulsion in the presence of xanthan gum using clsm in the polysaccharides range of concentrations of 0 03 0 05 wt the scientists observed time dependent microscopic division into oil rich and oil poor zones relaxation coarsening and coalescence was seen in these locations the interfacial tension shifted the elongated architecture of the phase s separation xanthan rich domain into more circular geometries especially after the stirring stopped as the xanthan concentration grew the rate of this reaction slowed this can be attributed to the viscoelasticity of the xanthan containing domains or the viscoelasticity of the surrounding regions microstructural alterations were completely prevented at higher xanthan concentrations confocal microscopy may also be used to investigate polymer attachment onto components polymer absorption on cellulose nanofibril sheets was examined by researchers 203 as a dispersion xyloglucan was shown to soften and loosen the aggregate structure of something like the film but had no impact on aggregation in this work additional polymer adsorption upon cellulose nanofibril suspension aggregation was investigated using confocal microscopy in biology and industry polymer composites have been widely used topology has been found to have a major influence on polymeric fluid rheology the authors 204 show that linear dna and microtubule composites exhibit considerably nonmonotonic elasticity and stiffness the confocal images assisted in measuring the decrease in force response at higher microtubule concentrations as the concentration of microtubules grew more bundling occurred as seen by brighter clusters with bigger voids that reduced network connection this decreased connection weakens the microtubules and lowers contact with the dna resulting in less structural support confocal microscopy was used to explore the localization of an attached polymer in a lamellar liquid crystalline dispersion a portion of this pure polymer sodium polyacrylate homo polymer molecules is labelled and appears as continuous background in the microscopic pictures 205 an unanticipated aggregation phenomenon combining positively charged poly l lysine and negatively charged gold nanoparticles is claimed to occur 206 water filled silica hollow microspheres are generated when negatively charged sio2 particles are introduced to a solution containing gold nanoparticles a structural examination of a hollow sphere using confocal laser scanning microscopy reveals that poly l lysine is found within the hollow sphere primarily in the silica shell wall the hollow sphere self assembled by flocculation where aggregation is charge driven between gold nanoparticles and poly l lysine serves as the first stage in the fabrication process to conclude confocal can be used directly to analyse the internal structure of flocs or indirectly to study effects such as understanding mechanism loose versus tight flocs suggesting that the process of assembly has been diffusion restricted rather than reaction limited confocal may also be used to find various labelled portions inside flocs such as when hollow spheres are formed overall confocal imaging as a versatile technology can help researchers build better flocculation systems 7 conclusions and future direction the flocculation is discussed in this study as well as the effect of the various parameter on its efficiency the results of research on the effects of ph mw system type shear dose and some speciality polymers on flocculation efficacy based on thorough literature analysis were reviewed to summarise findings it was demonstrated in the effect of the mw section that reporting mw alone does not indicate whether flocculant capacity is present furthermore salinity related research explains why dual systems inorganic organic type are used in the literature later it was demonstrated that flocculant conformation or a complex flocculant is vital in getting good yield in flocculation practice one notable example is hpam whose coil extension is strongly dependent on the degree of hydrolysis of this polymer indeed the fluorescence tagging results demonstrate that the polymer assumes a more stretched shape as the degree of hydrolysis increases the rate of polymer adsorption and the relaxation of adsorbed chains are also important factors in flocculant performance when the charges of particles and polymers are contrasting polyelectrolytes adapt to a flat adsorption structure mostly by electrostatic patch interaction when the pace of relaxation is low or there exists repulsion between polymer and particles the collision of the particles can happen while chains stretched out which will lead to polymer bridging the sequence of comonomers polymerized into the polymer the rigidity of the backbone 207 topology branch size how many branches 208 sequence of branches branches on one side of the backbone or both ingredients of the polymer 209 functionalization ph temperature proximity to other polymers of small molecules 210 and other factors should all be considered when posing the polymer in space 211 213 according to a recent analysis of the research polymer flocculants help solids settle faster but sediment consolidation is not improved in most cases because of their loosely packed structure pam induced sediments for example have the density of a low solid indeed the flocs are open in certain regions without the employment of additional technologies compressing huge amounts of entrapped fluids is challenging the development of more effective flocculant pam polymers is viewed as critical to improving the performance of these devices dramatically alternatives to the pam polymers addressed in this study include dual systems and temperature sensitive polymers for example temperature sensitive polymers according to the research can increase sediment consolidation through a more effective flocculation mechanism however little research has been conducted on the range of their applicability in real contaminated water and their toxicity on several water based species is unknown most studies in this paper focus solely on pam based flocculants due to their high mw for flocculation and the approach to achieving good flocculation is mostly changing polymer dose finally several viewing techniques such as om sem tem and afm can be utilised to visualize either flocs or flocculants these approaches might be used to determine adhesion force synthesis success and polymer conformation in space among other things clsm imaging may be utilised directly to examine the internal structure of flocs or indirectly to investigate consequences such as mechanism understanding clsm imaging may also be used to locate different labelled parts inside flocs such as when hollow spheres are created overall confocal imaging as a flexible technique can assist researchers in developing improved flocculation systems in a summary we concluded in this study that the efficiency of water treatment based on polymers is still in its early stages and that additional research is needed to fully exploit the potential of these flocculants the kinetics of polymer adsorption the kinetic and thermodynamic equilibrium of polymer adsorbed the effect of molecules on polymer adsorption parameters that can improve adsorption and prevent floc destabilisation owing to shear and so on are yet unclear furthermore a polymer only system may not be sufficient for good flocculation and alternative strategies to strengthen the polymer s adherence to particles should be investigated for better outcomes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
12962,water is an essential element contributing to human life evidence shows that only a portion of the water from sewage tailings is recovered in the consolidated tailings process the process produces sediments with a high water content that require special storage this is problematic because water trapped in such structures might remain there for a long period this study investigates flocculants that can potentially help these systems in this publication we look at how literature has sought to optimise their formulation to enhance dewatering efficiency and present a clear overview and guidance on the main parameters involved using both theoretical and practical examples we have assembled over 200 references majority published 2020 or earlier in this review article to demonstrate the complexities of designing a flocculation system employing state of the art synthesised organic inorganic and hybrid flocculants we next go over a few of examples of how to use microscopical techniques to learn more about the flocculation mechanism this manuscript can be treated as an illustrative visual comprehensive view of application of flocculants to wastewater systems graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords colloids colloidal matter material design flocculation 1 introduction water is an essential component of human life water makes up around 60 of the human body water is also required to produce food clothes and maintenance of health and the environment 1 therefore clean drinking water is critical everywhere the production of a large amount of hazardous chemical waste by numerous businesses as well as its incorrect disposal exacerbates the water situation to generate clean water or to return the water to operation the industry must cleanse the water to eliminate suspended particles one method of addressing this issue is to employ polymer flocculants there are a couple of steps before one can successfully use polymer flocculants to destabilize particles in each media changing flocculant dose molecular weight mw charge density synthesis of new polymer or employing a mix of flocculants coagulants for maximum efficiency are just a few examples many investigations have been conducted on the mechanism of action of flocculants and settling to improve efficiency for the understanding mechanism of actions some theorists have resorted to modelling and molecular dynamic md simulations 2 others have tried to change polymer flocculants through changing mw or synthesizing random 3 or star co polymer 4 8 new ones or even extracting new ones from nature 9 other researchers have used a variety of polymers including cationic anionic and non ionic polymers together with inorganic salts to increase settling rates and create stronger denser flocs 10 examples of some of the findings in the literature on the subject of using polymer flocculants are anionic flocculant is more effective at increasing the settling speed of slurries than cationic and non ionic flocculants when the ph flocculant dosage and shear rate rose the relative flocculation rate increased at first and subsequently decreased on the other hand as the solid volume percentage of the slurry grew the relative flocculation rate decreased 10 theoretically polymer induced flocculation is generally understood to occur via two primary mechanisms charge patch interaction or charge neutralisation and bridging 11 the sorption of relatively low mw polyelectrolytes on oppositely charged particle surfaces causes the charge patch interaction on the other hand high mw polymers adsorb cumulatively on more than one particle causing flocculation on relatively small flocs charge particle flocculation is generally effective and consistent on the other side bridging flocculation can result in very huge flocs other flocculation and settling mechanisms have been considered such as sweeping flocculation which we shall discuss briefly later polyacrylamide pam is the basis for most commercial polymeric flocculants mentioned in the literature anionic cationic or non ionic this polymer is also modifiable with combinations of comonomers anionic pam the most important category of pam can be made by copolymerizing acrylamide with acrylic aid or partially hydrolysing polyacrylamide the mw of pam may also be easily adjusted throughout the manufacturing process intentional degradation can also tune in the mw of pam pam may be used to construct incredibly long chains due to the nature of condensation polymerization pam charges charge density or length can be modified for instance in the case of kaolinite suspensions with neutral ph any pam flocculant independent of mw or charge type and concentration can accomplish successful flocculation however only a small number of pam flocculants with very precise properties e g very high mw anionic medium charge can stimulate flocculation of oil sands tailings more complex system for treatment 12 according to researchers even with huge mws cationic pam or non ionic pam were unable to flocculate particles in oil sand tailings the solid in tailings on the other hand could only be flocculated with anionic pam flocculants 12 13 however even in the case of anionic pam the residual water contained considerable amounts of fine clays from 1 to 3 wt after flocculation limiting its usage in the bitumen extraction process which needed solids below 0 5 wt these are examples to demonstrate the difficulty in selecting a decent flocculating system aside from kaolinite 14 and fine tailing samples used for flocculation flocculation in the literature has been done on calcite calcium carbonate 15 alumina 16 iron 17 18 carbon nanotubes and so on aside from the modification indicated above to increase flocculation and theories mentioned that explain the flocculation process some researchers have looked at poly n isopropyl acrylamide pnipam copolymers for building smart systems that perform several functions at once such as polymer bridging and floc densification pnipam in the flocculation industry has been studied extensively for instance with rheology authors 19 discovered that gels based on pnipam switch from a free flowing liquid to an elastic gel upon increasing temperature displaying a reverse transition after cooling when both particle and polymer concentrations are above some critical levels suspensions flocculated by bridging show an elastic response at low frequency one polymer chain forms several bridges in bridging flocculation and a sequence of bridges cannot be disrupted by non interacting bonds this indicates that flocs made by pnipam are resilient due to the sensitivity of pnipam to temperature and salinity variations in industrial water dosing these waters with these polymers should be done with caution and successful application of these polymers is more difficult than standard pam based flocculants characterisation of the flocculant flocs and flocculation process is just as important as choosing a flocculant various characterisation approaches have been utilised to better understand the flocculation process including but not limited to turbidity 18 zeta potential 20 afm 21 confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm 22 transmission electron microscopy tem 23 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps 24 rheology 25 26 focused beam reflectance measurement fbrm 27 28 and so on fbrm will be discussed briefly here followed by a microscopy technique to provide a glimpse of characterisation techniques that can improve flocculation knowledge and enhancement a significant characterisation technique is fbrm which is a frequently used technique for measuring flocculation performance fbrm can help comprehend the floc size distribution as a function of shear rate in a typical jar test by monitoring flocs in situ while flocculation is taking place particles with a size range of 0 8 μm to 1000 μm are measured using the fbrm technique and these measurements are commonly grouped into 38 or 90 intervals 29 the diameter of particles flocs can be approximated with chord length values poly aluminium chloride pac was recently studied to see if it may reduce quartz entrainment in a batch mixture of quartz and galena 30 galena commonly known as lead glance is a naturally occurring lead ii sulphide mineral pbs the first set of measurements was performed on the slurry of quartz minerals to assess the efficiency in studying the aggregate formation and assessing the shear resistance of aggregates fbrm and other supplemental approaches were used to investigate the aggregation and dispersion behaviour of quartz and galena successfully in ref 31 the flocculating abilities of two synthesised fe pam and al pam were examined after their adsorption on kaolinite a commercial anionic flocculant was also tested for comparison fbrm device was utilised to assess the results dynamic aggregation in situ the adsorption kinetics of the polymers onto silica and alumina which represent the t and o basal planes of kaolin were also evaluated using a quartz microbalance device al pam fe pam and hydrolysed pam h pam were shown to have good flocculating qualities with h pam being the least effective and more prone to the overdose of the flocculants studied proper mixing had a significant impact on flocculation performance the capacity of al pam and fe pam to bind to both basal planes of kaolin as opposed to h pam which only adsorbs on positively charged aluminium basal planes was linked to their higher flocculating capabilities in polymer adsorption and flocculation of kaolin suspensions electrostatic attraction or repulsion is found as a crucial characteristic using fbrm authors could observe how floc size changes over time a simple yet effective technique for investigation of flocculation process a few fundamental parameters that have a considerable influence on the dewatering flocculation of diverse systems will be investigated in this work this section was kept brief to prevent repetition by citing the same parameters in other published reviews 12 32 then the most intriguing and significant research in literature has been presented that has lately increased the efficiency of the flocculation process in this review paper we compiled over 200 references to highlight the complexity of creating an optimal flocculation system using cutting edge synthetic organic inorganic and hybrid flocculants later to better understand flocculating systems a section on modelling and another on putting flocculants on top of superstructures such as microgels were added readers interested in the general principles of polymer flocculation should read ref 11 the publication s uniqueness stems from the careful selection of contemporary references as well as the inclusion of complex systems such as polymer mounting on microgel particles in addition to tuning chemical systems associated with flocculation mathematical optimization of flocculation was mentioned other reviews published in the literature on the topic of using polymer flocculants are i in ref 33 this reference seeks to examine recent advances in the application of bio based synthetic and stimuli responsive flocculants in the literature ii ref 34 this review looks at bacterial derived flocculants and iii ref 35 looks at biobased flocculants for water purification the approach of the current publication differs from those discussed here in that it examines the issue of flocculant performance from a colloidal perspective providing a clear tool for understanding the flocculation process and potential improvements furthermore the variety of characterisation methods available here provides researchers with an excellent tool for optimising and comprehending their flocculation process 2 important factors the following section will discuss polymers often employed in water treatment as well as the impact of their mw and charges following that dual and smart systems will be investigated and the impact of shear as an extrinsic factor on flocculation will be extensively analysed 2 1 polymers polymeric flocculants cause finely divided particles to agglomerate and segregate into flocs they are classified according to their charges which can be cationic anionic or non ionic they can be classified based on whether they are natural 36 or man made as well we may also categorise them based on whether they are branching 37 linear or star shaped starting from non ionic polymers polyols unhydrolysed polyethers and polyamides are the most common nonionic polymers pam and polyethene oxide are two of the most prevalent nonionic polymeric flocculants used in the mining industry examples of non ionic flocculants are hydrolysed pam neutral charge 38 40 polyacrylic acid polyvinyl sulfate polyethylene oxide peo 41 49 polyacrylamide pam polyvinyl alcohol pva 17 50 55 and polyvinyl pyrrolidone pvp 56 64 positively charged groups such as amino imino or quaternary amino are found in cationic polymeric flocculants examples of positively charged flocculants are poly dimethylammonium chloride pdadmac and diallyl dimethylammonium chloride ddmac 65 71 cationic pam polyethene imine pei 72 76 polyvinyl pyridine pvp poly vinyl benzyl trimethylammonium chloride poly vbtmac 13 the copolymer of 2 dimethylamino ethyl methacrylate dmaema and pnipam 77 pdadmac is the first synthetic polymer to be approved by the us food and drug administration for use in potable water treatment it has a backbone made up of cyclic units and very hydrophilic permanently charged quaternary ammonium groups the topology of polymer can become more complex if the flocculant efficiency needs improvement synthesised polymers with multiple branches i e star shaped polymers are an example of sophisticated polymer structure modification the star shaped 7 8 morphology synthesised copolymer with the dextran and pam grafted arms was described in ref 7 during the production process the dextran preserved a macro coil conformation however no study was done to assess the effect of dosing this polymer for flocculation in another similar study i e tuning topology several cationic star shaped polymers with varying hydrodynamic diameters were used the hydrodynamic diameter measures how bulky the structure is in the solution the findings revealed that a dual component system including a star polymer was more efficient than a single component system this study was effective in demonstrating the dual impact of employing two mechanisms of star polymers in combination with linear ones as well as being a representative of a dual system for optimal flocculation efficiency in another study a star shaped polymer was combined with a polyacryl amide based anionic polymer with a high mw and low charge density to produce extremely good flocculation the amount of polymer required was significantly reduced in this system demonstrating that a star polymer can be combined with a linear polymer and produce efficient flocculation it should be noted that the rate of adsorption and desorption of linear and star shaped polymers are different similarly grated polymer topology is distinct from linear polymers in a recent study 78 cationic kraft lignin kl was grafted with either 2 acryloyloxy ethyl trimethylammonium chloride atac or 2 methacryloyloxy ethyl trimethylammonium methyl sulphate metam kl metam produced bigger and stronger flocs with looser structures than kl atac as a recap in this part we reviewed many different types of polymer flocculants and highlighted some of the research highlights on the selection or manipulation of polymer flocculating systems 2 1 1 mw the most essential polymer parameter impacting flocculation performance is polymer mw longer polymer chains in flocculants with high mw can adsorb onto the surface of several particles at once whereas macromolecules with lower mws adhere to fewer particles as a result as compared to low mw polymers high mw flocculants can achieve quicker solid settling rates polymer mw can have a significant impact on flocculation efficacy furthermore mw is not the only element that influences flocculation the distribution of polymer sizes has an impact as well the distribution of length of polymer chains with the same mw might be very different the structure of the sludge and the qualities of the polymers decide the mw distribution be used in ref 79 scientists discovered that a wider distribution of polymer sizes resulted in greater flocculation for polyacrylic acid while no such effect was observed with the copolymer of acrylamide and quaternary acrylate salt percol discussion on the role of polymer mw on efficiency is subjected to ref 25 according to the research lesser mw counterparts generate denser quicker settling aggregates and have a more dose effective response under mixing mild in general bigger sized flocs formed by greater mw flocculants can permit quicker settling aggregates under strong mixing except for instances where polymer sizes and concentrations might cause entanglement 80 81 in ref 81 it was empirically established that the kaolinite s adsorption ability for pam increased with increasing mw however the ability for adsorption of ultra high mw materials was 20 times lower than that of low and medium mw samples the cause for the reduced adsorption was ascribed to chain entanglement this study demonstrates that a high mw is required for an effective flocculant system but there is an optimal point in other circumstances analogous to the issue of entanglement an increase in mw that is too high results in loose flocs with gel structure due to the trapping of too much water tailing ponds are an example of this disadvantage since the mechanical qualities of flocculated sediments are not good enough to be reclaimable while some studies have found that a high polymer mw improves flocculation 82 others have found no clear evidence 83 such investigations are limited by a small variation in mw a lack of control over flocculation conditions or a single dosing comparison research that questioned the effectiveness of a larger mw yielded even more evidence of such a problem at a fixed mass of polymer lower mw polymers produced a higher number of chains favouring the onset of flocculation at low dosage 84 if greater aggregate sizes are desired the lower mw polymer would be predicted to be less effective at a larger dose in one study 80 sodium catalase concentration 0 01 m in the slurry favoured modest particle coagulation but calcium catalase hurt settling rates even at lower concentrations 0 002 m with the impact on reduced bridging activity that was most noticeable at lower mws the higher the polymer mw the faster the kaolin slurry sedimented authors 13 used pnipam with varying mws number average to make a 2 wt kaolin suspension while keeping the polymer dose constant at 1000 ppm it was obvious that increasing the mw of the polymer enhanced the pace of solid particle settling this finding backed up the theory that flocs develop because of polymer chain bridging and subsequent settling the authors of ref 85 tested two distinct lengths of poly propylene oxide ppo grafts employing either 300 g mol or 1000 g mol macromonomers although it is difficult to detect a link between graft size and flocculating dewatering performance with only two values their findings suggest that ppo grafts with the smallest mw were more efficient with decreased turbidity and a faster settling rate the author attributes this effect to the ppo grafts higher hydrophobicity in comparison to pam and pdadmac authors 86 found that hydrophobic groups improved dewatering performance and reduced turbidity according to ren et al 86 hydrophobically modified polymers are more likely to form bridges with suspended kaolinite particles because the long alky chains may adsorb to more locations on the particles in these conditions hydrophobic substances allow greater mw flocculants to be more effective it should be noted that altering the backbone of the polymer can modify the polymer s lower critical solution temperature lcst if the system is functioning based on the polymer s changing behaviour as a function of temperature lcst is a critical temperature blow in which components of the mixture are miscible for all compositions here water and polymer if hydrophobics comonomers are included in the polymer s backbone the amount of water retained is reduced and the solid content of the sediments is enhanced indeed most researchers think that a better bridge between the polymer and suspended particles would result in stronger flocs and overall performance other studies that indicate increasing mw is beneficial to flocculation aims can be found in refs 83 87 88 for flocculation purposes some of the references 89 in the literature have reported mw of polymer flocculant from 1500 to 8 600 000 g mol most studies require a minimum of a mw in the thousands of g mol range for effective flocculation readers should be aware that the length of a polymer might vary depending on branching ipn or semi ipn repeating unit length mw and other characteristics backbone stiffness 90 and thus mw information alone is insufficient 91 furthermore depending on the charge of the particles the polymer can operate as a charge neutralizer in these instances the mw of the polymer until a certain threshold becomes irrelevant to flocculation since it is used only by the particle surface for charge neutralisation 92 for example in cationic pam chain adsorption promotes flocculation of negatively charged small particles charge neutralisation is the most typical way by which polyacrylamides can reverse the particle surface charge locally collision with a negative patch produces bridging and eventually aggregation nevertheless this mechanism of flocculation is highly limited for low mw polymers other references 80 81 87 report the polymer s mw for their studies and its impact on flocculation however because mw may not be a good criterion due to the reasons stated here the actual length of the polymer under processing ph and temperature should be considered and reported instead the use of high mw anionic pam in the flocculation of negatively charged particles outperforms cationic polymers by enhancing the settling rate and establishing a distinct sediment shape 12 only minimal adsorption is possible due to electrostatic repulsion between kaolinite particles which have a negative charge and the polymer polymer chain expansion caused by repulsion on the other hand results in the creation of loops and tails which lead to the production of huge open structured 12 as a result polymer conformation polymer length is also vital in creating an outstanding flocculating system here it was discovered that mw has a significant impact on flocculation effectiveness for dewatering purposes and that the decisive element for bridging success should be the actual length of the polymer rather than mw information 2 1 2 polymer charge the capacity of the polymer to adsorb on and eventually flocculate particles is influenced by the charge type and density high charge density polymers for example have difficulty adsorbing onto the surfaces of particles of the same charge type such as anionic pam and negatively charged clay particles 93 low to medium charge concentrations on the other hand may be beneficial during polymer adsorption because they encourage the repulsion of charged polymer segments lengthening the polymer chain and boosting the flocculant s total bridging capacity as a result there is an ideal charge density that aids the flocculation process both theoretically and experimentally charge density is primarily determined by the percentage of ionised segments along the polymeric chain ph affects the degree of ionisation of weakly ionising groups like carboxylic acids as a result adjusting ph during flocculation is critical charge density can be represented by the mol of ionised segments however the actual charge of polymers based on theoretical backbone information is insufficient the colloid titration method is also useful for measuring charges the ionicity of the polymer was shown to have a substantial influence on the rate of flocculation settling velocity and bed consolidation in ref 94 the zeta potential of chromite ore tailing had an isoelectric point at ph 7 39 the zeta potential of the net of the particle was positive at acidic ph while negative at alkaline ph the sizes of the particles were also in the micrometre range both ionic and cationic flocculants were shown to be efficient in the flocculation of chromite tailings the results revealed that when the ionic strength and mw were low anionic flocculation characteristics improved but cationic flocculants performed better when the cationic strength and mw were high the success of anionic and cationic pam in flocculation can be related to particle charges that allow for particle flocculation with polymers non ionic pam was shown to be ineffective at flocculating tailing particles the ionicity of the polymer appears to be highly relevant here based on the results findings from the literature on the issue of degree of ionisation demonstrate that for pam or similar polymer flocculants it determines the degree of molecule extension or the enhancement of charge density to perform charge neutralisation more effectively in this section it was shown how surface charge affects the flocculation process in particle suspensions whether strongly charged or not 2 2 smart responsive systems smart responsive polymers are used in paints and coatings as well as food additives and biological applications in this section the application of these same systems for flocculation is examined we generally identify the polymer as temperature sensitive by understanding whether it will become hydrophobic or hydrophilic when the temperature changes polymers like pniapm are distinguished by their ability to transition from hydrophobic to hydrophilic at or below a threshold temperature therefore here temperature is a controlling parameter that can control polymer action in the solution polymer solution phase behaviour is an essential feature in the creation and design of most polymer related processes the upper critical solution temperature ucst and the lower critical solution temperature lcst which both rely on the molar mass and pressure are common solubility thresholds in partially miscible polymer solutions at temperatures below lcst the system is miscible in all proportions partial liquid miscibility begins at lcst and continues to become more immiscible as temperature rises pniapm is a thermo responsive polymer best recognised for its aqueous lcst of 32 c 95 which allows it to be used in a wide range of industries as a result combining a flocculant system with other properties such as conformation tweaking with temperature may result in an even more potent system to put things in context when it comes to smart system usage below are some examples of temperature smart system utilisation that will be discussed following the initial flocculation with rising temperature polymer conformation is extended and fines are captured the temperature is decreased to allow pnipam to evacuate surplus water trapped in flocs however this is an energy intensive process and is usually not favoured in the industry unless inherently warmer water warmer due to process is mixed with a flocculated stream to raise the temperature 96 97 the point of lcst is also modifiable with additives this could be useful if flocculation and polymer extensions need to be changed for instance when electrolytes are added to a non ionic polymer solution the lcst of the polymer can be moved to lower temperatures as an example kanazawa et al 98 reduced the lcst of polymers from 32 to 20 c by adding 1 m of salt this method is intriguing because it reduces the energy required to warm water and makes it more amenable to industrial processes in a nutshell there are various instances of works that exploit this capacity for flocculation which may be found in ref 99 and there is a wealth of literature on lcst of polymer flocculant research that may be found in ref 100 while exploring ucst of a polymer flocculant can be found in ref 101 literature on using lcst and ucst to do water treatment can be found in ref 101 102 another smart system is to have a system to change property based on light two light sensitive copolymers containing various cinnamoyl groups were synthesised in ref 103 and later were used as a flocculant to destabilize a model suspension in employing flocculated system dosage ranged from 0 1 mg g to 5 m g both were efficient flocculating agents however comparatively at the dosage studied they acted similarly to compare the effects to commercial treatments however a greater dosage was required 103 the authors of ref 104 used optogenetics to develop unique technology for water treatment and purification utilizing nano charged dielectric polymeric beads the beads were coated with a photosensitive protein called channel rhodopsin in this method this protein belongs to the rhodopsin family of proteins which are light gated ion channels when these nano charged beads are combined with water they produce a lot of turbidity at first but then the beads begin to attract the colloids in the water since the beads have been covered with a photosensitive protein investigators have been able to regulate the movements of these nanoparticles in water by employing a certain wavelength of light other light sensitive polymers most exploited light sensitive polymers containing azobenzene chromophore can be found in refs 105 106 ph sensitive polymers have weakly acidic or basic ionisable moieties susceptible to protonation or deprotonation which are affected by ph fluctuations 107 the polymer chains desolvate and collapse in water when these ph responsive polymers are not ionized and hydrophobic interactions prevail when the polymer is ionized however the repulsion between chains takes precedence and the polymer becomes strongly solvated in water the ph range for this phase transition may be adjusted in two ways by replacing monomers with ionisable groups with pka values that correspond to the needed operating ph range or by adding hydrophobic moieties into the polymer backbone more hydrophobic moieties are included resulting in structures that are not unionized it has been demonstrated in the literature that altering the charge of a polymer can cause it to extend due to repulsion between charged monomeric units facilitating the bridging mechanism 108 the scope of this text does not allow for the incorporation of the plethora of material now accessible in the literature for various types of polymer polymer flocculants that change properties due to them being multifunctional 109 to recap we only discussed smart systems based on temperature light and ph here because ph indirectly regulates the length of the polymer by varying the quantity of ionisation studies on ph are indirectly associated with studies on polymer charges 2 3 dual multiple systems the employment of two types of flocculants can help to enhance the efficiency and physical qualities of the resulting flocculant mining treatment and pulverized coal separation as well as sewage sludge separation are examples of the application of two stage flocculation flocs created by dual flocculation are bigger and more resistant to shear pressures than those formed by flocculation with only one kind of polymer better floc sturdiness towards shear can be attributed to the formation of denser flocs that are more resistant to hydrodynamic forces during shear charge neutralisation techniques are also more robust to shear than polymer bridging ones due to the formation of many contract direct points between particles 92 the obtained effect is strongly dependent on the flocculant proportion and the use of dose which is usually greater than when only one flocculant is used when employing each polymer specifically al dawery 110 demonstrated that combining a blend of polycarbonate and polyacrylic acid for flocculation results in improved liquid clarity the combination of flocculants could raise the sludge volume index by 70 compared to 40 in the case of polycarbonate alone the generation of fine and shear resistant flocculants was demonstrated after initial charge neutralisation using an ionic flocculant it has long been known that a combination of positively and negatively charged polymers can cause synergistic effects in the coagulation of paper pulp the dual system used for polymer flocculation was poly ethylene oxide phenol formaldehyde peo pfr 111 and fecl3 pam hybrid polymer 112 it is worth noting that making these extensively used organic coagulants flocculants 111 112 is difficult and costly which has limited their usage in wastewater treatment when calcium 8 mm and magnesium 8 mm respectively are added to tailing solutions already containing 20 ppm of the flocculant the initial settling rate increases from 4 to 11 and 13 m h 113 these findings imply that divalent cations can destabilize these clay particle suspensions resulting in a considerable increase in hpam flocculant fine clay flocculation efficiency the hydrodynamic conditions utilised during flocculation have a significant influence on flocculant performance the size and shape of flocs are mostly determined by mixing and the pace at which polymers are added to stimulate collisions between the flocculant macromolecules and the particles mixing energy shear must be provided to the solution successful collisions will result in polymer adsorption and floc production other studies in the literature using dual systems are anionic pam and a nanosized cationic hybrid polymer nhp 114 the following conclusions have been drawn from studies in the literature use one polymer to form loose flocs before adding another polymer to expel water from the flocs 114 making them denser use a low mw polymer for charge neutralisation and then add a high mw polymer to aggregate the destabilised particles 115 use a second polymer for reaggregation of broken flocs 116 use inorganic salts with polymer flocculants 20 and using salt to increase adsorption of polymer onto the particles dual systems can also be mixed of polymers with different mws in ref 92 the authors concluded that mixing polymers with different mws and observing flocculation performance leads to a wider range of effective flocculation across the optimum dosage points as well as larger flocs and faster sample clarification furthermore due to the promotion of charge neutralisation over polymer bridging a little amount of short chain polyacid in the mixture dramatically increased flocs resistance to shear 92 2 4 shear shear ph salt and temperature are examples of non flocculant characteristics here we discuss the influence of shear on flocculation since other parameters are stated periodically in other sections and their impact on flocculation has been mentioned to bring polymer and solids into close contact and promote effective flocculation small particles require more mixing energy however the flocculated aggregates are disrupted under high shear rate conditions either by rupture of attachment sites on the particle surface or scission of covalent bonds inside the bridging polymer chains after floc breakdown depending on the circumstances certain systems go through floc re growth reaggregation using a photometric dispersion analyser pda burgess et al 117 investigated the influence of shear on floc size and flocs re aggregation similarly using a conventional jar test and pda yukselen and gregory 118 investigated the influence of shear on the development and breakup of clay flocs generated by the addition of aluminium sulphate polyaluminum chloride pdadmac and acrylamide copolymers some flocs however are impossible to re aggregate after breaking for example broken kaolin flocs are difficult to re grow in the presence of aluminium according to li et al 119 the mechanism of floc connection and disconnection contributes to an understanding of the outcomes produced under various mixing circumstances as well as floc breakup and regrowth the coagulation process is influenced by the mixing state according to several writers 120 the quick mix can have a significant influence on the ultimate coagulating efficiency although a brief period of quick mixing was required for effective turbidity reduction extended rapid mixing degraded efficiency these findings might be explained by the fact that some polymer adsorption on the surface is loose and drag force at high mixing rates can separate the polymer from the particles surfaces mixing allows polymer molecules to stretch and distribute throughout the mixing volume as well as the identification of successful collision following the adsorption of most of the chain and the creation of flocs continued mixing causes the flocs to degrade when a high mixing power is used the result is deterioration which ultimately affects flocculation efficiency varying polymers have different thresholds for chain sessions due to shear forces depending on temperature acidity salinity and mw and these thresholds should be taken into account during mixing 121 when flocs are split with shear the adsorbed chain can also be disrupted and reformed into flat adsorption on the surface preventing bridges from developing deoxyribonucleic acid dna dynamics can provide clues on how polymers react in a shear flow field shaqfeh and chu as well as coworkers 122 123 studied dna tumbling dynamics in pure shear flow in response to these findings the tumbling dynamics of single dna molecules have been studied in a variety of shear and rotational flows with various weissenberg numbers wi in a shear flow field dna conformation exhibits extension and tumbling motion polymer flocculants depending on mw and rigidity are likely to undergo comparable transitions the impact of linking shear thinning and structural break down under high and long shearing duration was investigated in ref 120 and a considerable variation in yield stress of thinned and flocculated mature fine tailing was discovered to cause cavern development during the mixing operation there is also an optimal mixing time that results in a well flocculated mature fine tailing when water is released from flocs this means that too much or too little shearing is not conducive to excellent flocculation floc strength is determined by inter particle bonding between aggregates components this comprises the floc s bond strength and the number of bonds if the applied tension is greater than the floc s bonding strength the floc will break increased floc compaction is thought to improve floc strength by increasing the number of bonds that hold the aggregate to give an overview of the impact of shear the orientation of dosed polymer can change due to the impact of shear which may affect flocculation rate flocs can break down and re stabilize with shear and magnitude of shear and also noted the initial shear can improve polymer particle mixing 92 124 overall it appears that creating a flocculating system is difficult due to the system s complexity which comprises a polymer particles and a range of factors 3 optimizing flocculation flocculation can be improved by using ideal chemicals such as a mix of small and big macromolecules or differently charged macromolecules as well as mathematical optimization methods we will start with mathematically aided optimization and then go on to various optimization tools involving various substances 3 1 mathematical optimization using models that can capture trends in experimental data mathematical statistical optimization can help any system achieve its optimal points several studies in the literature have focused on the use of artificial neural networks and complete factorial designs to enable the development of improved flocculating devices in this section will be reviewed artificial neural networks in their different forms attempt to obtain data as input and then determine an output such as initial settling rate floc density settling rate and so on 125 this is a type of optimization since reverse engineering can disclose the ideal flocculant system for flocculation by determining what combination of inputs such as ph dosage and inorganic coagulants are required to lessen the weight of studies this strategy cut through the link between different impactful parameters as well recently the potential of aluminium based water treatment residual as a coagulant for dye removal was assessed the effects of changing chemical dosages initial dye concentrations and ph were evaluated in the first experiment the colour removal quantity was later predicted using an artificial neural network 126 the optimization protocol examined here can greatly reduce the timing of the experiment and evaluation a chitosan based flocculant was developed in another study and its morphology and flocculation ability was tested in various water conditions including copper ion and disperse blue 56 127 based on experimental data on polymer synthesis condition dosage and ph an artificial neural network model was constructed to forecast the elimination rate of these two contaminants 127 another study used elman neural networks to forecast flocculant dosage in the drinking water treatment process elman neural networks are in the core design partially recurrent neural networks information on these networks can be read in ref 128 multiple linear regression the radical basis function and optimization based on support vector machines as well as a model based on elman neural networks were among the models developed in the literature a mixed term containing the long term and short term data was incorporated into the model to improve the realism of prediction this enabled the model to encompass periodicity as well as the impact of time on water quality data the authors discovered that the effluent turbidity of the tank was more stable under the guidance of an artificial neural network model than under the guidance of other models 129 therefore modelling using artificial intelligence here was used as an optimization technique for the mere purpose of automation the design of the experiment is a systematic strategy for improving the quality and cost of water treatment processes by developing credible modelling based on a smaller number of experiments the full factorial design is a widely used experimental design strategy that can quantify the primary effect s significance and explain the interaction between effects and parameters 130 in ref 131 a full factorial design was used to investigate the influence of several parameters on water treatment efficacy as well as to examine the interaction between the participants and the efficacy of the flocculation process ph coagulant dosage flocculant dosage pollution loads and a goal variable of turbidity and chemical oxygen demand cod elimination were all considered these findings demonstrated that linear regression models are well suited for capturing experimental data coagulation flocculation is effective for turbidity removal regardless of pollution concentrations in the water according to an analysis of variance anova design study organic matter removal is also more successful in less dirty water according to the findings 131 anova can help neural networks with feature selection 132 3 2 chemical optimization tuning flocculating systems green flocculant and bio flocculant are discussed in the following sections to show how changing chemicals or techniques might affect the outcome of flocculation to lessen the environmental impact of flocculation it is preferable to adopt a system such as green flocculant flocculant system in some of these systems optimization means leaving fewer environmental footprints this requires chemical coagulant optimization 3 2 1 tunning flocculating systems the previous section only reviewed some concepts that have already been addressed extensively in the literature they were mentioned to provide a basic grasp of flocculation in this section we present illustrative instances of advanced investigations in which flocculants were utilised to destabilise suspensions or in some cases cells some elements can be modified to improve the system s flocculating capabilities graphic depictions of these systems will be shown in this section fig 1a displays afm photos belonging to the nanoparticle microgel complex at temperature blow critical temperature nano particle microgel complex is a complex yet innovative flocculating system that can do a better job of flocculation than simple systems if these systems are designed correctly 133 the results in ref reveal that pnipam microgels have a double faced electrostatic behaviour due to their variable charge density at temperatures below lcst they behave as quasi neutral colloids but when collapsed they strongly interact with oppositely charged species 133 fig 1b shows a fluid fine tailing scheme 134 as well as typical flocculation precipitation acquired using afm 135 the settling of particles following flocculation is seen in this illustration unsatisfactory flocculation effectiveness and contamination of pam flocculant leftovers are harmful to the environment and aquatic life the degradation rate of the polymer was tuned in ref 135 measured up to 76 within 4 h showing a competent degrading mechanism to accomplish this rgo tio2 composite material was first created using a simple sol gel process and then photocatalytic polymerization was used to create the rgo tio2 pam composites comb structure in which polymer chains elongated with one another increasing the contact area between the polymer and particles the zeta potential of composites generates a decrease in repulsion between polymer and particles the comb structure was shown to be favourable to the expansion of polymeric chains and enhancing the contact area because it was necessary to remove the pam polymer chains from the water after flocculation the self degradation process was included in the system to address this issue several ways have been offered with photodegradation introduced as a viable solution as a result this complex system is a more intricate variant of pam with an extra degrading mechanism that provides a futuristic approach to frequent limitations seen with pam related formulations enlarging the polymer flocculant can sometimes be more successful at flocculation graft copolymers with different graft ratios and mws were created using batch polymerization in water the mw of the copolymer was found to be inversely linked to its graft ratio estimated at round 0 82 the turbidity removal ratio was 99 and supernatant turbidity was reduced from 13 324 to 150 ntu 136 water bath polymerization was utilised to create graft copolymers with different graft ratios and mws mw was shown to be inversely related to graft ratio ratio estimated at 0 82 the turbidity removal ratio exceeded 99 and the supernatant turbidity was lowered from 13 324 to 150 ntu 136 the poly aluminium chloride acrylamide methacryloxyethyltrimethyl ammonium chloride pac am dmc flocculant was found to be a novel organic inorganic hybrid flocculant in this study due to having a good yield at low applied dosage therefore leaving less chemical residue in waters after flocculation simultaneously it is less hazardous and better for the environment than organic pac and pam 137 after treatment the water content of the flocs generated by the hybrid flocculant was considerably lower than that of the compound and monomer flocculants which can reduce flocculation time the hybrid flocculant had fewer settling flocs whereas the supernatant has more water after flocculation and a greater turbidity removal rate salt resistance was also enhanced with this hybrid flocculant this study also demonstrates that organic inorganic hybrid flocculants outperform single type flocculants 3 2 2 green flocculants this section covers several different types of polymer flocculants as well as some of the research highlights on polymer flocculating system selection and modulation this section will look at more environmentally friendly flocculant systems such as those based on cellulose or chitosan even though man made polymer flocculants have been the most widely utilised thus far due to their excellent flocculation and low cost natural ones have the advantages of being manufactured on a large scale and at a lower cost 138 researchers are studying more bio based flocculants due to their application having better harmony with climate centred policies as a result of new laws aimed towards the manufacture of more environmentally friendly formulations in one notable example to replace pam in fig 2a chitosan graft polyacrylamide chi g pam was created and studied in tandem with the effect of solution salinity for flocculating kaolinite suspensions one notable result was poor flocculation and adsorption at high salinity conditions probably due to more compressed conformations 139 similarly synthesised in ref 140 was 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride cta modified chitosan graft polyacrylamide first the flocculation windows were reported broader than chi g pam due to the polymer chain s more stretched conformation because of improvements in charge neutralisation and bridging flocculation as cta content rose flocculation performance improved furthermore higher cationic degrees resulted in higher efficiency most likely due to improved charge neutralisation capabilities similarly using the same line of thought quaternised cellulose derivatives with varying degrees of substitution were synthesised authors demonstrated that flocculation efficiency increased with the degree of substitution higher cationic degree for both dye and montmorillonite over a wide range of ph values 141 the literature outlines four probable flocculation mechanisms 144 i positively charged flocculants adsorption on negatively charged particles causing surface neutralisation the particle now has no repulsion resulting in aggregation ii patch mechanism the adsorption forms a positive patch on the particle allowing it to link to other particles through patches similar to janus particles 145 for this process to work the distance between charged groups on adsorbed macromolecule on the particle must be smaller than the distance between charges on the particle iii the method by which a macromolecule links to particles 146 iv the falling network of flocculant entraps more particles particles should be bigger than the pore of the descending network creating further flocculation it is possible to have 2 3 mechanism acting in tandem in a flocculating system to improve efficiency while cncs required a slightly larger dose by weight than chitosan cncs required a lower dose when expressed in terms of the number of cationic charges added 142 fig 2b illustrates the difference between chitosan which has a similar molecular structure to cnc and cnc when comparing cncs and chitosan a lower dose of cnc was required to induce effective flocculation of algal cells whereas chitosan achieved polymer bridging and neutralized algal cell walls because of their findings the authors concluded that having stiff flocculants might be more useful for improved flocculation a green flocculant based on branching polyethyleneimine grafted cellulose was created and manufactured successfully 143 to treat kaolin wastewater fig 2c depicts field emission scanning electron microscopy images of two cellulose components and 2 3 dialdehyde cellulose that interacted to generate hyperbranched polyethyleneimine grafted cellulose the first two photos indicate reaction components whereas the last sem image depicts the result flocculant in addition to displaying good flocculation performance has also shown success in eliminating ammonia nitrogen iron and phosphorus these findings suggest that this flocculant is ideal for many wastewater treatment applications in the next part some real world examples of different effluents from various industries will be examined 3 2 3 contaminated waters direct phase separation is a common technique for neutralising the charge of colloidal particles and linking them to form flocs however in some systems charge neutralisation is insufficient or the efficiency is inadequate to address this shortcoming flocculation based on the polymer can be used for a wide range of sewage based fluids these sewage based fluids can come from various industries as an example fig 3a displays the dairy effluent and effluent condition at a dose of 53 mg l flocculant based on pam tailored made with inverse emulsion polymerization clearly flocculant has been successful in removing soft particles from staying suspended in the water in detail the authors of ref 147 created anionic polymer flocculants co and terpolymers that they used to treat dairy effluent wastewater via flocculation the results showed that polyelectrolytes with higher anionic contents performed better in the treatment process and that chemical modification increased hydrophobicity especially when the monomer utilised had a longer hydrophilic aliphatic chain previously better hydrophobicity medium charges and higher mw were linked to better flocculation in agreement with the results of this study the data also show that when a particle s surface has a low charge the hydrophobic impact is strong as is the case in this study permeability is critical in the dewatering process since it represents the difficulty of filtering especially for soft solid materials like sludge flocculants had a strong impact on sludge permeability which exhibited an inverse relationship with filtering pressure in one study 148 essentially the authors investigated the permeability of filter cake by adjusting the dose of various constituents taking into account the impact of flocculation on cake filterability authors 148 concluded that flocculants could change the properties of sludge see fig 3b the organic flocculant cationic pam increased the size of the floc cluster while decreasing the specific surface area and fractal dimension the fractal dimension reduced gradually when the inorganic flocculant dose was increased an inflexion point was identified at poly aluminium chloride and ferric chloride dosages of 40 and 60 mg g respectively when the particle size initially declined and subsequently grew in turn the particular surface area increased first then declined pressure had the same effect on filter cake across all flocculants resulting in a decrease in filter cake permeability this research is significant for sectors that require filtration as part of their solid liquid separation strategies ab block copolymers with four arms and a star shape have the potential to be utilised in industrial flocculation purposes these polymers were created using a two stage aqueous reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer raft polymerization technique 5 these polymers generated quick settling rates and reduced supernatant turbidities as contrasted to a reference random copolymer fig 3c shows a schematic of the use of star polymer vs the random copolymeric version of it six distinct star shaped block copolymers were created these polymers were mixed into a modelled suspension of kaolin slurries with three different ca2 concentrations 0 05 0 10 and 0 50 m the efficiency of the control random block copolymer reduced considerably as the amount of ca2 increased in contrast the star shaped copolymers displayed outstanding stability in floc settling speeds and supernatant turbidity despite high ca2 levels 5 because of its well built chain this flocculant is more resilient in dealing with hard waters with high ionic strength the impacts of shear mw temperature and other factors dynamics and how polymer conformation changes after a collision were demonstrated in the introduction the rate of flocculation is a direct reflection of particle collision success furthermore in particle plus flocculant systems the folding behaviour of the polymer coil bound to the surface of particles is also crucial according to ref 150 even the inclusion of a little polyanion can considerably reduce the flocculating action of cationic flocculants this suppressive effect can be explained by a decrease in the effective collision radius induced by the swollen polymer coil shrinking because of an oppositely charged polymer link all of these studies demonstrate the significance of polymer conformation in the solution phase as well as the re conformation process when it comes into contact with the surface of colloidal particles at the start of flocculation as a result the effective size in the transient condition spanning continuously adjusting collision time and the metastable state of adsorption should be thoroughly investigated the authors have compared the initial stage dynamics of flocculation of positively charged latex particles flocculated by negative charges polyelectrolytes polyelectrolytes complexes linear polyelectrolytes and polyelectrolytes complexes microgels with a negative charge and positively charged linear polyelectrolytes in ref 149 the purpose of this study was to highlight the effect of the less deformable character of microgels compared to liner polymers as well as the function of polyelectrolyte aggregation on the rising rate of flocculation fig 3d illustrates a schematic that attempts to demonstrate the distinction similarly the impact of polymer structure on flocculation efficiency is investigated in this study the bioapplication of flocculants will be addressed in the following part in this regard these waters fall within the category of industrial water such as algae growth and harvesting that occurs in water media 4 bio applications coagulation flocculation and centrifugation are harvesting techniques used in algae biotechnology flocculation is a unique harvesting technique used here for microalgal cells such as botryococcus braunii b braunii and chlorella ellipsoidea c ellipsoidea that were harvested with varied dosage requirements 151 fig 4a shows a representation of this procedure as microalgae cells were matured in ref 151 they became progressively negatively charged by pairing a negatively charged and high extracellular polymeric substances eps content with a high mw and positively charged polymer charge neutralisation and bridging facilitated flocculation a similar mechanism was applied in ref 152 for microalgae collection in one similar study using flocculant alum consumption was severely reduced alum coagulant consumption was reduced from 77 6 to 4 5 mg g after using extracellular polymer components produced from microalgae scenedesmus acuminatus at a level of just 3 2 mg g 9 as a result careful flocculation formula selection is critical and it is optimizable because contamination of algae and its viability is critical in this application the flocculant should be carefully calibrated and selected dye removal from water is a flocculation process adaptable especially in the case of pigment removal carboxylated cellulose nanofiber with the highest aspect ratio of 144 was extracted from waste ginger fibres 154 fig 4b shows a super sorbent constructed of cnf aerogel adsorbing methylene blue dye from underneath silicone oil silicone oil was not picked up by cnf aerogel but it was quickly absorbed when it encountered methylene blue as a result this sorbet is an excellent substrate for removing colours from silicone oil like methylene blue mb 154 the incorporation of hydrophobic medicines with low oral bioavailability into nanoparticles nps is an appealing technique for enhancing gastrointestinal dissolution kinetics one way of performing nanoformulation is flash nanoprecipitation i e a scalable process for encapsulating water insolvable therapeutics into nanoparticles that can lower the barrier to their dissolution inside the body the report in ref 155 explains how to concentrate cellulose polymer stabilised nanoparticles using a ph driven reversible flocculation method nanoparticles were first stabilised by anionic hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate using flash nanoprecipitation particles were then concentrated 50 fold by acid induced flocculation and redispersed at neutral ph thus reducing drying time by many folds 155 these findings support the notion of reversible ph controlled flocculation as a viable method for concentrating large quantities of electrostatically stable nanoparticles the 50 fold concertation factor achieved in their research was an arbitrary choice according to theoretical authors and much greater concentrations are attainable schematic developed by the researchers 155 are displayed in fig 4c flocculation concepts can also be extended to cells from the standpoint of colloidal flocculation cellular flocs employing a cellulose nanofiber modified with a concentrated polymer brush are reported in ref 156 the affinity relationship between the proteins cells and polymer brush is crucial for cellular flocculation and gene expression analysis according to cell adsorption studies 156 microalgae harvesting is related to cell scaffolding by the sense of polymer flocculation which was discussed before 5 simulation and flocculation md simulations were used to study the process of dispersion and aggregation of nanoparticles implanted in a polymeric medium these simulations can accurately reflect the system under consideration for parameters like temperature pressure and volume fraction but they are insufficient to address the real world stability of colloidal dispersion as demonstrated by the tests shown below the amount of polymer flocculant supplied to colloidal particles has a significant impact on the system s stability to account for these findings different bridging mechanisms have been proposed to describe the coagulant process the model developed by la mer et al 157 158 for instance can explain experimental results under extremely narrow conditions such as low polymer concentrations early phases of flocculation and so on apart from models computational modelling has been extensively employed to study particle aggregation for instance the dimerization energy of asphaltenes increases with the number of aromatic rings in the aromatic core but stays constant with different alkyl side chain lengths according to reports 159 161 asphaltene dispersion behaviour in model solvent mixtures is altered by cashew nutshell liquid cardanol and polycardanol 162 163 the simulated outcomes closely mirror the observed patterns in experiments allowing researchers to get a better understanding of the chemical processes behind cardanol and polymer stability and precipitation similarly the synergistic adsorption of two types of polymers on the basal surface of montmorillonite was studied in aqueous settings 164 the interplay of particle and chitosan electrostatic attraction hydrogen bonding between chitosan and pam and attraction between chitosan and nanoparticles was related to polymer synergistic adsorption the modelling findings provided a mechanical foundation for the experimentally observed synergistic flocculation by including multiple polymers 164 although numerous polymers have been used to promote synergetic flocculation in the literature the underlying process has remained unknown making it difficult to investigate them directly with characterisation tools the examination of these interactions is limited to models and simulations indicating the considerable applicability of these techniques in addition to experiments 165 as per x ray diffraction the magnesium precipitates are predominantly composed of brucite crystals adsorption is predominantly caused by deprotonated oxygen from the acrylic group of mining aggregates 166 as a statistical description of adsorbed polymers simple conformations with loops trains and tails have been proposed 167 carbon percentages in trains and loops are frequently low in comparison to carbon fractions in tails demonstrating a willingness to build polymer bridges through tails in all conditions fig 5a shows a side view of hpam in a typical conformation on brucite and kaolinite surfaces in 0 6 m nacl solution at 300 k and ph 11 red represents oxygen blue represents sodium cyan represents chloride carbon and pink represents magnesium aluminium brucite features numerous connections large loops and short tails as compared to kaolinite and quartz the hpam chain is adsorbed in quartz at a single point the electrostatic repulsion of quartz and kaolinite with the anionic acrylate groups of hpam prevents the creation of loops and trains the results of this study show that the process of polymer flocculation varies depending on particle size from system to system similarly in ref 167 md simulation was used to explore the influence of nacl concentration on the configuration of an anionic polyelectrolyte and its chemisorption on a quartz surface at ph values much over the isoelectric threshold two opposing forces influenced the entire flocculation process fig 5b depicts the self assembly of ctac a cationic surfactant and a non anionic polymer in the presence of sodium salicylate nasal because ctac pam nasal solution is worm like it has a greater viscosity than the original solution 168 the md simulation is used to examine ctac and polymer self assembly process which experiment cannot reveal these molecule level changes flocculation is influenced by three stages first ctab molecules self assemble and the pam chain begins to coil ctac molecules then combine to create larger spherical micelles salicylate has access to the micelles centre and can compete for hydrophobic interactions the polymer chain leads micelles to congregate and form worm like micelles in the third phase finally polymer chain formation creates an entangled network and an interpenetrating network the interaction mechanism between several biocompatible polymers and the fe3o4 surface was explored at the atomic level in fig 5c using md modelling 169 the flexibility of the polymer chain was discovered to be the most important factor influencing the form of the polymer on this surface chitosan and dextran reacted with the fe3o4 surface more strongly than the other polymers the researchers believe that the high flexibility of polymer chains contributes to the compact structure of fe3o4 this study also showed that a robust interface may easily form between a polymer with hydrogen bond functionality and the fe3o4 surface and that the polymer s flexibility can help in the formation of a thick layer of polymer on the surface clearly the conclusions of this study relate to the previous discussion of polymer conformation and flexibility a team of scientists created a model that can be used to forecast the flocculation kinetics of a papermaking process in advance the model also allows authors to select the operating conditions and flocculant that will create aggregates with specific attributes and hence performance a population balance model was constructed for the flocculation of particles containing polyelectrolytes of extraordinarily high mw medium charge density and various degrees of branching to depict the flocculation bridging process the model incorporates aggregation breaking and flocs rearranging all at the same time furthermore the number of polymer branches influences the radius of gyration if the number of branches is raised while the mw of the polymer remains constant the polymer radius of gyration must likewise drop 170 the floc restructures and the flocculation rate decrease as the radius of gyration decreases it was discovered in this section that simulations can considerably improve understanding of polymer behaviour at the surface particle and help us design more optimal flocculating systems to categorise the data on using flocculant shifting polymer such as changing mw manipulating dosage to achieve an optimal dosage or increase efficiency changing charge density manipulating polymer lcst or ucst and utilisation of dual coagulant systems in a table the data on using flocculant shifting polymer such as changing mw manipulating dosage to achieve an optimal dosage or increase efficiency changing charge density manipulating polymer lcst or ucst table 1 summarises some of the studies discussed in this study filtration and mixing as previously indicated are post flocculation activities and have been kept out of this section table 1 the research path is based on polymer classifications dosage and charge density modulation smart responsive system adaption and the incorporation of various flocculant or flocculating chemicals in the table multiple dual system besides employing multiple polymers also refers to a combination of polymer and coagulant that can charge neutralize particles individually for better polymer adherence to the particles it appears that adjusting polymer dosage to generate flocculation is one of the parameters nearly solely experimented with in most published studies it is also obvious from the statistics in the table that responsive systems receive the least attention due to their strictly scientific application while real wastewater systems are made up of a variety of substances organic and inorganic rendering these systems ineffectual 6 characterisation of flocs this section covers optical microscopy om sem tem afm and clsm other characterisation methods may be used to study flocs such as x ray diffraction xrd x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fourier transforms infrared ftir rheology and so on however due to space limits will not be mentioned particles in suspensions and gels have been seen using optical microscopy sem tem afm and clsm each strategy has a distinct edge over the other optical microscopy is widely available because of the ease with which it can prepare samples yet its resolution is restricted the greatest attainable point to point resolution is governed by a basic set of physical constraints thus exceeding this intrinsic limitation of resolution is difficult with visible light when the lateral distance between two objects is less than half the wavelength of light optical equipment is limited in its capacity to distinguish between them this is known as the diffraction barrier sem and tem on the other hand provide high resolution but they both need sample preparation which depending on the sample can be time consuming despite not having an optical origin like sem and tem clsm has the most complicated sample preparation method since the samples require tagging with a fluorescent dye that preferentially remains on intended spots confocal microscopy on the other hand is the least intrusive microscopy method that allows for live imaging of materials in the subsequent sections each of these methods with their application is reviewed 6 1 om after researching optical microscopy findings in the literature it was revealed that due to its ease of use optical microscopy offers a wide range of applications in polymer floc systems in ref 181 optical microscopy was used to investigate the film formed within a liquid droplet on a solid surface as a result of evaporation and convection which resulted in the production of a contact line when the solvent was completely evaporated from the non ionic pam solution a coating was created on the glass surface and morphology was investigated using afm and optical microscopy pam is coiled in an acidic solution and may be adsorbed on the surface in a dot like pattern the adhesion was strong due to the strong contact between the carboxylic group of pam and the silica hydroxide of the glass surface the distribution of adsorbed pam was also found to be random the coiled pam adsorbed on the glass in a spot form again in a neutral solution however as pam molecules from a strip along the flow direction the contact was weaker the largely hydrolysed alkali treated pam caused repulsion and unflooding of molecules in the solution indicating that the contact between pam and glass surface was modest the polymer membrane was discovered to flow from the centre outward to the contract line area the molecules spread outward forming a rice spike pattern the form and size of the flocs were assessed using an optical microscope in ref 182 the influence of ion destabilisation on particle coagulation was investigated in this work the goal of this study was to see if the natural and biodegradable polysaccharide fucoidan fd might be used as a flocculating agent 182 this study clearly showed that calcium ions can improve flocculation of fd aluminium oxide particles system through screening of double layer that made the interaction between polymer chain and surface of particle easier furthermore the scientists postulated that divalent calcium ions may interact with bio flocculant anionic groups if these double chains adsorb on the surface of nanoparticles the resulting aggregate can be bigger and heavier increasing the likelihood of flocculation as seen using an optical microscope 6 2 sem flocs have been seen using scanning electron microscopy in the literature for example abbasi moud et al 183 employed sem to investigate the differences in morphology of cnc coagulated structures when particle and salt combinations were varied the findings of linear and nonlinear rheology were rationalised using morphological information gained from sem image analysis sem is excellent for viewing the structure of flocs in general because it exposes the structural stacking of particles which varies according to the technique of synthesis and processing conditions sem is particularly useful for determining the morphology of self assembled structures nevertheless the technology s resolution range is insufficient for determining the morphology of the particles themselves if they are nanometric in size individual particles with nanometric sizes can be spotted using field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem fe sem achieves a resolution of better than 1 nm at a 30 kv accelerating voltage using sem in ref 168 authors examined the effect of different kinds of starch on the flocs dimension of hematite particles it was illustrated that the average size and projected area of flocs increase with the increase in dosage sem revealed a variance in apparent flocculation performance due to differences in molecular structure according to the authors the structural properties of flocs such as size distribution form and fractal dimension were investigated using static light scattering and cryo sem in ref 184 the scientists discovered that the main particles in flocs appear to be submicron platelets using sem furthermore flocs appear to have a fractal dimension 2 09 that is comparable to that of flocculation in the reaction limited cluster cluster aggregation phase of flocculation clusters get denser in this phase because the structure is not produced through the diffusion restricted cluster cluster aggregation regime furthermore the substantial porosity found shows that the interior structure of the floc might have a big enough liquid permeability to accommodate tiny primary particles polymers appear to be joining fundamental particles which is in line with the findings of other researchers 185 due to the sensitivity of these structures to electron bombardment it has been suggested that collecting cryogenically frozen polymer chains is fundamentally problematic according to some writers 185 thicker strands are caused by the loss of water caused by generating freezing conditions which causes the polymer network to collapse and aggregate sem can also reveal the appropriate flocculant dose sem pictures revealed that an ideal polymer dose of 1000 ppm results in an internal floc structure with two distinct zones of decreased porosity and open channels indicating that this arrangement allows for efficient water squeeze out of pores 177 cryo sem can also reveal the effect of salt addition on the morphological features of un flocculated slurries 186 the different charge particles of kaolinite as known leads to edge to face edge to edge and face to face structures face to face orientation is absent in raw slurry owing to repulsive force between particles however with the presence of coagulants face to face orientation is more prominent even when there is considerable space between layers later the shape of kaolinite particles was studied in the presence of salt and flocculant the particle exhibited predominantly edge to edge and edge to face orientation 187 and positive zeta potential in the presence of a high mw polymer and a high nacl concentration indicating a significant contact between the polymer and the particle a partly cross linked polymer was used to make flocculates for calcium chloride slurries this flocculant had semi particulate entities and polymer chains aligned in a 3 d dimension resulting in stronger sediment and less retained water as well as a greater aggregate face to face packing structure 186 6 3 tem due to the shorter de broglie wavelength of the electron beam tem is capable of imaging at better resolution than optical microscopy and sem 188 other advantages of tem over sem include 1 the target point in the sample may be accurately selected i e strips of the sample can be scanned with an accuracy of roughly 20 nm 2 sample preparation is relatively rapid and 3 the sample can be obtained from an endless variety of materials the purpose of tem is to evaluate the distribution and dispersion of fillers in suspensions as well as the particle morphology tem pictures reveal the structure of individual particles as well as their condition of aggregation dispersion allowing for quantitative analysis of the samples the fractal dimension of floc clusters generated by salt addition was determined using tem images in a recent publication by abbasi moud et al 189 given the relevance of tem in defining flocs suspensions the use of tem in the future especially for identifying particle placement in the hydrogel after employment cannot be ruled out tem has a benefit over sem in that it can provide fractal dimensions of flocs clusters the morphology of alkaline lignin and lignin was investigated using tem images in references and it was discovered that alkaline lignin had a scattered structure commercial lignin on the other hand had a branchy structure and was easy to aggregate based on these observations the authors concluded that the chemical composition of the two polymers differed similarly lignin based flocculant had a self assembled entangled structure while papermaking sludge based flocculant had a branching structure with multiple side chains because of the branching structure of papermaking sludge based flocculant there was more contact area between the polymer and the dye particles resulting in a greater dye removal efficacy in the papermaking sludge based flocculant scenario conclusions concerning various methods of interaction and flocculation may be drawn from the inferences made here based on the structure of the flocculant before dosing the morphology of kaolin tio2 polyacrylamide pam organic inorganic composite flocculant was studied using tem in ref 190 the presence of titanium dioxide on kaolin was demonstrated using tem by evaluating interplanar spacing which was reported to be 0 242 nm equal to 103 crystal lattice of titanium dioxide the presence of polymer was further demonstrated by the weakening of the edge shaping phenomena indicating that polymer did indeed coat the particle s surface in this case tem was employed in conjunction with visualisation as a characterising method to verify the synthesis of a composite flocculant system 6 4 afm afm is a powerful tool for investigating cnc clusters and individual particles this versatile technique is not only able to capture the morphology of particles at high resolution but also measure interactions between chemical species mounted on the sharp tip of afm and cnc particles the latter refers to the usage of afm in the force spectroscopy mode while the former refers to the topography imaging mode 191 compared to other microscopical methods afm offers several benefits afm offers a far better spatial resolution than optical microscopy methods allowing it to view individual particles high resolution pictures may also be obtained using sem and tem although a complicated sample preparation process may compromise the structural integrity of materials afm imaging requires essentially minimal sample preparation since it maps the sample by direct contact between the afm tip and the sample in some cases afm can measure the forces acting between two items in addition to providing a technique of visualisation in this situation the forces operating between the probe and the surface may be analysed and numerous conclusions regarding interactions can be formed for example by modifying the afm tip it can investigate the intermolecular interactions that occur when various substances are adsorbed on mineral surfaces quantitatively 192 a review of the literature reveals that afm may be used to discern more data about polymer flocculated particles for example in ref 193 the authors discovered that the ph of the solution is significant in the interaction of polymer and solid particles the adhesion forces measured by afm may be divided into two categories bare force and flocculation forces at a ph of 10 flocculation forces reached maximum levels allowing for settling tests and flocculation measurements increased effective binding sites between coal particles and polymer extended chains were attributable to the increased bridging interaction in a similarly conducted study 14 the interaction between the particle surfaces and polymers in different solution environments was investigated by afm force measurement to further reveal the interaction mechanisms the model kaolinite substrate and silica probe were placed in a cell filled with the polymer solution to measure the adhesion forces in two polymer solutions for the investigation anionic pam and a flocculant based on chitosan and pdmdaac when the silicon probe was pushed towards the silica surface in an anionic pam solution the usual force curve exhibited a high repulsion starting at a distance of 40 nm the afm detected a long range 150 nm attraction with a magnitude of 0 25 nn when the probe was withdrawn from the substrate this long range adhesion can be attributed to polymer bridging when the probe was moved towards the silica surface in the chitosan pdmdaac example an attractive force was measured at 100 nm this is due to electrostatic attraction between the probe and the surface which is negatively charged and positively charged afm may also be used to examine the flocs after flocculation and illustrate how they expand however this characteristic of afm is identical to that of sem and tem thus it will not be discussed here to summarise afm appears to be a flexible method that can demonstrate the number of interactions in a variety of conditions in contrast to other microscopy techniques that can only provide information about the microstructure 6 5 clsm clsm is a sophisticated method that uses tagging to examine the structure of colloids and soft materials in situ 189 194 195 the clsm as a characterizing tool was chosen because of the recent increase in its use and the clarity it provides in the analysis of flocculation systems 22 196 this approach can also distinguish between distinct labelled components in this part we will briefly discuss case studies from the literature that employed clsm to explore flocculation and flocculated systems it is clear from the literature that there is a general interest in using confocal microscopy to investigate the interior architecture of flocs the authors of ref 196 investigated the influence of partly hydrophobic grafted polymers on flocculation and dewatering of mature fine tailing samples using clsm the authors used rheology and confocal laser scanning microscopy to investigate how graft density impacts first its dispersion in water and flocculation efficiency in terms of solid content as well as the flocs long term behaviour 3 dimensional confocal laser scanning pictures revealed spatial distributions of water within flocculated sludges allowing the performance of flocculants to be assessed according to the report increasing the graft density traps more water within flocs reducing the additional procedures required to boost dewatering rates confocal revealed how loosely particles are following flocculation which may be used as an additional criterion to choose polymer flocculants capable of producing more dense flocs in the same way laser imaging may be used to analyse the structure of sedimented flocs the authors of reference 22 aimed to study the molecular behaviour of particle flocculant interactions and their link to floc structure which is crucial for constructing tailing treatment with enhanced consolidation rates a three dimensional quantitative link between flocculation state and bulk sediment structure characteristics was used to study a non invasive in situ imaging of floc formation and subsequent sediment microstructure polymer driven suspended particulate matter flocs are a frequently used approach in a variety of applications ranging from water treatment to composite material manufacture aggregates generated by edge face dominated structures require less polymeric dosing when formed at low ph but those formed at high ph require more polymeric dosing it has previously been discovered that the size of the bentonite aggregate influences the inner floc structure flocs composed of smaller aggregates had strongly interconnected network mechanical characteristics whereas flocs composed of larger aggregates had a less interconnected patchy interior structure the authors used a series of 2 d confocal shots to build 3 d images of flocs 197 a comparison of data at ph 3 4 5 and 11 reveals that the internal floc structure does not change as ph increases but the zeta potential and mode of aggregation edge face to face face do the findings indicate that primary particle size determines internal floc structure whereas primary particle shape controls polymer adsorption and optimal polymer dose similarly the authors of ref 198 show that changing the ionic strength changes the microstructures of the polymer bentonite floc which can be seen using clsm the structure of flocs changed from networked to patched assembly the flocs had a tightly networked structure when the ionic strength was 10 mm but a patchy structure when the ionic strength was higher internal floc structure was investigated in these two samples using clsm as a function of ph and ionic strength sludge flocs are microreactors that absorb and break down pollutants to have a better understanding of sludge operations thorough information on floc structure is required anaerobic treatment is an important method for reducing the volume of waste activated sludge and producing biogas before sludge dewatering flocculants are routinely employed to enhance filtration rates 199 the sensitivity of oxygen concentration distribution within agglomerates to rapid changes in ambient oxygen levels was studied using microsensors the reaction time for the electrode in the floc core was five times quicker than in the original sludge flocs following polyelectrolyte flocculation the increased floc size was primarily responsible for the increase in total mass transfer resistance fluorescence in situ and clsm are two methods used in this study in some cases an extra strategy is necessary to validate the results obtained by current characterisation approaches the fractal dimensions of two different cationic polymers agglomerated e coli strains were calculated 200 the form factor is used to calculate the fractal dimension at large scattering angles static light scattering calculations using hard sphere particle simulations provide wildly disparate findings at varying flocculation periods the fractal dimensions calculated using static light scattering and clsm are very similar 1 90 to 2 19 clsm was used to corroborate the results of static light scattering in this case anaerobically digested sludge is difficult to dewater 201 due to the release of microbial chemicals traditional flocculation procedures are hampered by excessive chemical dosing and solid increase carboxylated chitosan and chitosan performed well in terms of sludge dewatering improvement in terms of filtration resistance and capillary suction time the flocculation effectiveness of these chitosan based flocculants was recently evaluated using clsm clsm demonstrated that protein like compounds accumulated during flocculation enhancing sludge dewatering efficacy it is appealing to nano formulate poorly water soluble medications to improve the dynamics of oral dissolution the translation is hampered by the dilution and drying of dilute nanoparticle concentrations the reference paper 155 describes a ph driven reversible flocculation approach for concentrating nanoparticles stabilised with a cellulose polymer due to the release of microbial compounds anaerobically digested sludge is difficult to dewater 201 traditional flocculation techniques suffer from heavy chemical dosing and solid increase in terms of resistance to filtration and capillary suction time carboxylated chitosan and chitosan fared well in sludge dewatering improvement clsm was recently used to evaluate the flocculation efficacy of these chitosan based flocculants clsm revealed that protein like substances gathered under flocculation conditions promoting sludge dewatering performance it is attractive to nano formulate poorly water soluble drugs to enhance the kinetics of oral dissolution the concentration and drying of dilute nanoparticle suspensions are a barrier to translation a ph driven reversible flocculation technique for concentrating nanoparticles stabilised with cellulose polymer is described in the reference paper 155 using temporal resolution confocal imaging the scientists evaluated flocculation kinetics and the effects of crucial conditions such as ph rheological properties and nanoparticle concentration furthermore high resolution microscopy was used to determine the fractal dimension of the agglomerates to better understand the flocculation mechanism the fractal dimeson effect of parameters was explored in addition to developing the inner structure of flocs confocal images may also be used to investigate soft particle flocculation in the system such as microemulsion polysaccharide stabilisers are commonly used by food manufacturers to improve the consistency and physiological shelf life of oil in water microemulsions such as salad dressings the most common explanation for their hydrocolloid s stabilising impact is that it regulates the aqueous phase s rheology the addition of a very tiny amount of xanthan gum 0 1 wt results in the coalescence of moderately saturated emulsions supported by protein sodium caseinate or a non ionic surfactant tween 20 the emulsions can readily withstand several days if not months of exposure to further identify the basic process the authors of ref 202 investigated the texture of a sodium caseinate based emulsion in the presence of xanthan gum using clsm in the polysaccharides range of concentrations of 0 03 0 05 wt the scientists observed time dependent microscopic division into oil rich and oil poor zones relaxation coarsening and coalescence was seen in these locations the interfacial tension shifted the elongated architecture of the phase s separation xanthan rich domain into more circular geometries especially after the stirring stopped as the xanthan concentration grew the rate of this reaction slowed this can be attributed to the viscoelasticity of the xanthan containing domains or the viscoelasticity of the surrounding regions microstructural alterations were completely prevented at higher xanthan concentrations confocal microscopy may also be used to investigate polymer attachment onto components polymer absorption on cellulose nanofibril sheets was examined by researchers 203 as a dispersion xyloglucan was shown to soften and loosen the aggregate structure of something like the film but had no impact on aggregation in this work additional polymer adsorption upon cellulose nanofibril suspension aggregation was investigated using confocal microscopy in biology and industry polymer composites have been widely used topology has been found to have a major influence on polymeric fluid rheology the authors 204 show that linear dna and microtubule composites exhibit considerably nonmonotonic elasticity and stiffness the confocal images assisted in measuring the decrease in force response at higher microtubule concentrations as the concentration of microtubules grew more bundling occurred as seen by brighter clusters with bigger voids that reduced network connection this decreased connection weakens the microtubules and lowers contact with the dna resulting in less structural support confocal microscopy was used to explore the localization of an attached polymer in a lamellar liquid crystalline dispersion a portion of this pure polymer sodium polyacrylate homo polymer molecules is labelled and appears as continuous background in the microscopic pictures 205 an unanticipated aggregation phenomenon combining positively charged poly l lysine and negatively charged gold nanoparticles is claimed to occur 206 water filled silica hollow microspheres are generated when negatively charged sio2 particles are introduced to a solution containing gold nanoparticles a structural examination of a hollow sphere using confocal laser scanning microscopy reveals that poly l lysine is found within the hollow sphere primarily in the silica shell wall the hollow sphere self assembled by flocculation where aggregation is charge driven between gold nanoparticles and poly l lysine serves as the first stage in the fabrication process to conclude confocal can be used directly to analyse the internal structure of flocs or indirectly to study effects such as understanding mechanism loose versus tight flocs suggesting that the process of assembly has been diffusion restricted rather than reaction limited confocal may also be used to find various labelled portions inside flocs such as when hollow spheres are formed overall confocal imaging as a versatile technology can help researchers build better flocculation systems 7 conclusions and future direction the flocculation is discussed in this study as well as the effect of the various parameter on its efficiency the results of research on the effects of ph mw system type shear dose and some speciality polymers on flocculation efficacy based on thorough literature analysis were reviewed to summarise findings it was demonstrated in the effect of the mw section that reporting mw alone does not indicate whether flocculant capacity is present furthermore salinity related research explains why dual systems inorganic organic type are used in the literature later it was demonstrated that flocculant conformation or a complex flocculant is vital in getting good yield in flocculation practice one notable example is hpam whose coil extension is strongly dependent on the degree of hydrolysis of this polymer indeed the fluorescence tagging results demonstrate that the polymer assumes a more stretched shape as the degree of hydrolysis increases the rate of polymer adsorption and the relaxation of adsorbed chains are also important factors in flocculant performance when the charges of particles and polymers are contrasting polyelectrolytes adapt to a flat adsorption structure mostly by electrostatic patch interaction when the pace of relaxation is low or there exists repulsion between polymer and particles the collision of the particles can happen while chains stretched out which will lead to polymer bridging the sequence of comonomers polymerized into the polymer the rigidity of the backbone 207 topology branch size how many branches 208 sequence of branches branches on one side of the backbone or both ingredients of the polymer 209 functionalization ph temperature proximity to other polymers of small molecules 210 and other factors should all be considered when posing the polymer in space 211 213 according to a recent analysis of the research polymer flocculants help solids settle faster but sediment consolidation is not improved in most cases because of their loosely packed structure pam induced sediments for example have the density of a low solid indeed the flocs are open in certain regions without the employment of additional technologies compressing huge amounts of entrapped fluids is challenging the development of more effective flocculant pam polymers is viewed as critical to improving the performance of these devices dramatically alternatives to the pam polymers addressed in this study include dual systems and temperature sensitive polymers for example temperature sensitive polymers according to the research can increase sediment consolidation through a more effective flocculation mechanism however little research has been conducted on the range of their applicability in real contaminated water and their toxicity on several water based species is unknown most studies in this paper focus solely on pam based flocculants due to their high mw for flocculation and the approach to achieving good flocculation is mostly changing polymer dose finally several viewing techniques such as om sem tem and afm can be utilised to visualize either flocs or flocculants these approaches might be used to determine adhesion force synthesis success and polymer conformation in space among other things clsm imaging may be utilised directly to examine the internal structure of flocs or indirectly to investigate consequences such as mechanism understanding clsm imaging may also be used to locate different labelled parts inside flocs such as when hollow spheres are created overall confocal imaging as a flexible technique can assist researchers in developing improved flocculation systems in a summary we concluded in this study that the efficiency of water treatment based on polymers is still in its early stages and that additional research is needed to fully exploit the potential of these flocculants the kinetics of polymer adsorption the kinetic and thermodynamic equilibrium of polymer adsorbed the effect of molecules on polymer adsorption parameters that can improve adsorption and prevent floc destabilisation owing to shear and so on are yet unclear furthermore a polymer only system may not be sufficient for good flocculation and alternative strategies to strengthen the polymer s adherence to particles should be investigated for better outcomes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
12963,a rotating advanced oxidation contactor raoc equipped with tio2 zeolite composite sheets was developed to inactivate the plant pathogenic bacterium ralstonia solanacearum in drainage solution ds from a hydroponic system the inactivation efficiency of r solanacearum in ds and pure culture solution ps by the raoc was compared with that achieved by a submerged composite sheet photocatalysis reactor sspr the initial number of living bacteria n 0 was adjusted to around 106 107 cfu ml 1 the inactivation efficiency of r solanacearum by the sspr at 4 0 107 cfu ml 1 of n 0 significantly decreased compared with that at 1 8 106 cfu ml 1 of n 0 owing to the attenuation of uv intensity by light absorption and scattering by solids derived from r solanacearum while the raoc achieved 2 log inactivation during 24 h of treatment regardless of n 0 the inactivation of r solanacearum by the raoc decelerated after 6 h possibly because of competition for reactive oxygen species between r solanacearum and products accumulated by inactivation of r solanacearum the ratio of rate constants for inactivation of r solanacearum in ds to that in ps by the raoc was 8 times that for the sspr this shows that the raoc greatly mitigates the light attenuation and inhibitory effects of coexisting substances on inactivation of r solanacearum in the ds the raoc is therefore a promising and upscalable photocatalytic reactor for efficient inactivation of r solanacearum in ds graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords rotating advanced oxidation contactor tio2 zeolite composite sheet ralstonia solanacearum inactivation hydroponic system drainage solution 1 introduction the global population will rise from around 7 billion people in 2010 to nearly 10 billion by 2050 1 and food production in 2050 will need to be increased by 56 compared with that in 2010 2 agriculture plays an essential role in food production soil culture has greatly contributed to vegetable production but suffers problems such as excessive use of water 3 4 emission of greenhouse gases including nitrous oxide 5 6 and occurrence of soilborne diseases 7 8 thus hydroponic culture an approach for growing plants without soil that involves using nutrient solutions in water has been used in farming as an alternative to soil culture the closed hydroponic system enables one to save water and nutrients by cyclic use of the drainage solution ds and exhibits higher yield per unit area than soil culture 9 11 although the hydroponic system can avoid occurrence of soilborne diseases plant pathogens can invade the system via various routes such as from the substrate seeding and soil surrounding the hydroponic greenhouse 12 resulting in significant decrease in crop yield disinfection of the ds to inactivate plant pathogens e g fusarium spp has been explored by a wide variety of approaches such as heating 13 membrane filtration 14 15 chlorination 16 liming 17 ozonation 18 corona plasma 18 23 ultraviolet uv irradiation 24 and photocatalysis 25 26 heating and membrane filtration have limitations such as high running cost and a requirement for periodic cleaning maintenance although chlorination is cost effective continuous addition of chlorine may have an adverse impact on the plants such as formation of chloramines which have detrimental effects via the reaction of ammonia and residual chlorine or sodium hypochlorite in the nutrient solution 16 27 ozonation and corona plasma generate highly reactive oxygen species e g hydroxyl radicals and a huge amount of electrical energy is required for the operation inactivation of plant pathogens using uv irradiation and a photocatalyst such as titanium dioxide tio2 has been reported 24 26 28 29 photocatalysts produce reactive oxygen species e g hydroxyl radicals under uv irradiation and photocatalysis is expected to be an energy saving advanced oxidation process aop because sunlight can be used as the light source however the efficiency of inactivating pathogens by uv based aops including photocatalysis decreases with increasing reactor volume because of scattering and attenuation of light in water 28 29 economic losses due to bacterial wilt disease which is caused by the soilborne plant pathogenic bacterium ralstonia solanacearum are a growing agricultural concern worldwide infection of hydroponically cultivated tomato solanum lycopersicum by r solanacearum has been reported 30 r solanacearum infects into plant root and colonizes the intercellular spaces of the root subsequently r solanacearum invades xylem vessels and reduces sap flow by growth of bacterial cells and formation of exopolysaccharide slime resulting in the development of wilting symptoms 31 32 in closed hydroponic systems r solanacearum is diffused throughout the cultivation facility in the recirculating ds and eradicating r solanacearum is very difficult after the appearance of symptoms hence development of disinfection techniques for ds containing r solanacearum is urgently required corona plasma is the only technology that has been applied for r solanacearum inactivation and the corona discharge reactor showed good performance in repetitively and continuously inactivating r solanacearum in artificial nutrient solution 19 21 23 however previous studies have not assessed the inactivation of r solanacearum in an actual ds and have not considered the inhibitory effects of coexisting substances in the ds on the inactivation efficiency we previously investigated the ds water quality from hydroponic system and revealed that ds contains a wide variety of coexisting substances at high concentration 33 evaluating the inactivation efficiency in actual ds instead of artificial nutrient solution is also important because some of organic compounds such as carboxylates exhibit a lower reactivity with hydroxyl radicals 34 35 in addition the corona discharge reactor requires continuous air flow as well as high voltage to produce reactive oxygen species and is hard to scale up from an engineering viewpoint the development of an upscalable reactor for inactivating r solanacearum in ds is of great importance we have fabricated a composite sheet with tio2 and adsorbent e g zeolite using a papermaking technique to easily separate the functional materials from treated water 36 37 and developed a rotating advanced oxidation contactor raoc equipped with the tio2 zeolite composite sheets 38 39 in the raoc the top part of the disk is illuminated with uv light for photocatalysis and the bottom part of the disk is immersed in water for adsorption of organic contaminants by rotating the disk the photocatalysis and adsorption occur continuously the raoc shows excellent performance for removing trace organic contaminants from actual wastewater and greatly mitigates the inhibitory effects of coexisting substances in addition to light attenuation as the photocatalysis is performed in an extremely thin water film 40 41 we have found that water temperature and uv intensity are key factors for controlling the performance of raoc treatment 41 42 and this technology is expected to be cost effective and energy saving for treatment of organic contaminants in reverse osmosis concentrate from water reuse 43 44 the raoc is an upscalable reactor and applicable to actual wastewater treatment systems to remove trace organic contaminants however no previous research has applied the raoc to disinfection of ds infested by r solanacearum in this study the efficiency of inactivation of r solanacearum by an raoc equipped with tio2 zeolite composite sheets was evaluated in comparison with that by a submerged composite sheet photocatalysis reactor sspr in addition fluorescent protein labelled r solanacearum was used to estimate the material that captures and inactivates the r solanacearum in the tio2 zeolite composite sheet the inhibitory effects of coexisting substances in the ds on inactivation of r solanacearum were investigated by comparing the inactivation efficiencies in pure culture solution ps and ds to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of development of an upscalable photocatalytic reactor to inactivate r solanacearum in ds 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the sources of chemicals are provided in appendix a text s1 r solanacearum strain oe1 1 45

detection limit and the ds was stored at 4 c after filtration with glass fiber filtration papers whatman gf b pittsburg pa usa because the ds might contain bacteria in addition to r solanacearum the ds was sterilized at 121 c for 30 min using a high pressure steam sterilizer mls 3030 phc holdings corporation tokyo japan before conducting disinfection experiments and r solanacearum cells were added to the sterilized ds the ds water quality before and after sterilization is shown in appendix a table s1 2 2 configuration of reactors the polyethylene terephthalate pet fiber zeolite tio2 and

preparation and physiochemical properties of the tio2 zeolite composite sheet are shown in our previous study 37 we previously confirmed that tio2 and zeolite particles were uniformly dispersed within tio2 zeolite composite sheet and the composite sheet has high durability toward uv irradiation 37 in the present study the sspr and raoc were configured as shown in fig 1 in the sspr the tio2 zeolite composite sheet with effective area of 9 cm2 1 8 cm 5 cm was completely immersed in a glass vial filled with test culture solution 0 05 l and the vial was illuminated with a uva light source λ 350 400 nm maximum wavelength 365 nm fl287 bl365 raytronics corporation saitama japan a uva light source was chosen because solar light is expected to be used in future applications in the raoc two pieces of tio2 zeolite composite sheet with an effective area of 449 cm2 for each piece were fixed one on each side on a disk with diameter of 24 cm the bottom part of the disk 45 of the disk area was submerged in a tank 25 cm 7 cm 14 5 cm filled with test culture solution 2 l for adsorption and the top part of the disk 55 of the disk area was illuminated with the uva light source fl287 bl365 to achieve photocatalysis the rotation speed of the disk was controlled at 10 rpm by a motor a uv radiometer uv 340c custom corporation tokyo japan was used to measure the uv intensity at the surface of the vial or disk 2 3 inactivation of r solanacearum cultures of r solanacearum for inactivation were prepared by diluting the bacterial cells using ps or ds and the number of initial living bacteria n 0 was adjusted to around 106 107 cfu ml 1 in this study 10 mm mgso4 was used as the ps inactivation tests of r solanacearum were performed using the sspr or raoc the experimental conditions are summarized in table 2 r solanacearum was used in runs x1 x7 and gfp labelled r solanacearum was used in runs y1 y5 runs x1 and y1 y4 were conducted in dark and runs x2 x7 were performed with uv illumination of 1 mw cm 2 corresponding to a uv fluence rate of 3 6 103 mj cm 2 h 1 in run y5 four pieces of sheet with an effective area of 224 5 cm2 for each piece were fixed on a disk with a surface area of 898 cm2 and the experiment was performed during 0 6 h in dark and 6 12 h with uv illumination of 1 mw cm 2 the water temperature was adjusted to 25 1 c at the designated time 1 or 10 ml of treated solution was taken and the number of living bacteria n and the uv spectrum were measured the glassware and reactor were sterilized before conducting disinfection experiments all tests were carried out twice 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 quantitative methods n 0 and n were measured using the dilution plate technique the sample was diluted using 10 mm mgso4 and 100 μl of sample were spread on a plate containing bg medium 46 to measure the n in the sheet we referred the standard methods for dna extraction 48 the sheet sample 2 cm2 immersed in the ps 1 ml was vortexed for 5 s and the n in the solution was measured to selectively incubate r solanacearum the antibiotic polymyxin b sulfate was added to the bg medium 49 the plate was incubated at 28 c in the dark and colonies were counted after 48 h 50 a spectrophotometer biospec 1600 shimadzu corporation kyoto japan was used with a quartz cell light path length 1 cm to measure absorbance at 660 nm a 660 365 nm a 365 and 230 nm a 230 and the initial values a 0 660 a 0 365 and a 0 230 in runs x2 x5 are summarized in table 2 the bacterial distribution on the sheets was observed using epifluorescence microscope bx51 olympus optical co tokyo japan analytical methods for dissolved organic carbon doc and inorganic ions are given in appendix a text s2 2 4 2 kinetic analysis chick watson model 51 52 has been used for analyzing the inactivation kinetics of bacterial pathogens by photocatalysis 53 54 thus the model was used in this study chick watson equation is expressed as follows 1 dn dt kn where k is the rate constant for inactivating r solanacearum h 1 and t is uv irradiation time h the definitions of n and n 0 are given above 2 4 3 statistical analysis the effect of n 0 on r solanacearum inactivation and the inhibition of inactivation of r solanacearum by coexisting substances in ds were evaluated by statistically analyzing the rate constant for r solanacearum inactivation one tailed t test for equal variances was performed using microsoft excel version 16 60 the significance level was set at p value 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 inactivation of r solanacearum in the ps by the sspr the inactivation behaviors of r solanacearum in ps by the sspr are shown in fig 2a runs x1 x3 in run x1 dark conditions log n n 0 slightly decreased until 2 h through adsorption by the tio2 zeolite composite sheet and then gradually increased during 3 24 h by bacterial growth in run x2 with uv irradiation log n n 0 continuously decreased and nearly 2 log inactivation was achieved during 24 h of sspr treatment we confirmed that r solanacearum continued to grow in the absence of the composite sheet and uv irradiation and it was not inactivated by irradiation with the uva light used in this study fig s1 this shows that r solanacearum is inactivated through photocatalysis by the tio2 zeolite composite sheet under uv irradiation in run x3 with uv irradiation only 0 5 log reduction was observed during 24 h of sspr treatment and the inactivation efficiency of r solanacearum in run x3 significantly decreased compared with that in run x2 because a linear relationship was observed between ln n n 0 and time during 0 6 h the k for inactivation of r solanacearum were determined from the slopes of the regression lines during 0 6 h fig s2 the k value in run x3 k x3 3 20 10 2 h 1 was an order of magnitude lower than that in run x2 k x2 4 09 10 1 h 1 the behaviors of gfp labelled r solanacearum in ps by the sspr are shown in fig 3a runs y1 y4 in runs y1 y4 log n n 0 did not change the n in the sheet is shown in fig 4 in runs y1 y4 the living bacteria were detected from each sheet this indicates that the gfp labelled r solanacearum was captured by the sheet the fluorescence images of each sheet after 6 h of sspr treatment are shown in fig 5 the pet fibers are narrow fig 5a b c and d and flocs containing tio2 particles were observed inside the fiber network fig 5c and d although flocs of zeolite particles could not be observed by fluorescence microscopy fig 5b we previously confirmed that particles of tio2 and zeolite are uniformly dispersed within the tio2 zeolite composite sheet by scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy 37 the gfp labelled r solanacearum was observed on pet fiber and the flocs of tio2 particles from all types of sheet fig 5a b c and d and mainly observed on pet fibers we deduce that pet fibers in the tio2 zeolite composite sheet play an important role in capturing r solanacearum time profiles of a 660 and a 365 are shown in fig 6 a 660 is used to evaluate the turbidity of water containing solids the value of a 0 660 in run x3 was higher than that in run x2 as was n 0 table 2 because more solids derived from r solanacearum were observed in run x3 a decrease in a 660 a 0 660 due to the sspr treatment was confirmed in both run x2 and run x3 fig 6a during 24 h of sspr treatment a 660 a 0 660 reached zero in run x2 while it remained around 0 5 in run x3 a 365 was also measured because a uva light source whose maximum wavelength was 365 nm was used in this study the values of a 365 a 0 365 at 24 h in run x2 and run x3 were 0 18 and 0 46 respectively fig 6b this indicates that uv absorbing substances remained at a higher concentration in run x3 than in run x2 and the photon flux on the tio2 surface in run x3 was lower than that in run x2 previous studies showed that solids strongly affect the photocatalytic performance of tio2 because of light scattering by the solids 55 56 we deduce that the significant decrease in k value with increase in n 0 from 1 8 106 cfu ml 1 to 4 0 107 cfu ml 1 might be attributed to the attenuation of uv intensity by light absorption and scattering by solids derived from r solanacearum 3 2 inactivation of r solanacearum in ps by the raoc the inactivation behaviors of r solanacearum in ps by the raoc are shown in fig 2b runs x4 and x5 the raoc successfully inactivated r solanacearum under uv irradiation and 2 log inactivation was achieved during 24 h of raoc treatment in both runs x4 and x5 the inactivation behavior in run x5 was similar to that in run x4 despite the presence of r solanacearum at one order of magnitude higher n 0 in run y5 log n n 0 was almost stable during 0 6 h and decreased during 6 12 h fig 3b as shown in fig 4 the n in the pet fiber sheet and zeolite sheet at 6 h was almost same with that at 12 h while the n in the tio2 sheet and tio2 zeolite composite sheet at 12 h was significantly lower than that at 6 h this shows that r solanacearum is inactivated through tio2 uv photocatalysis therefore r solanacearum captured by the sheet is inactivated through photocatalysis by the tio2 zeolite composite sheet under uv irradiation from the behavior of a 660 a 0 660 fig 6a the solids were completely removed during 24 h of raoc treatment in both runs x4 and x5 the values of a 365 a 0 365 at 24 h in run x4 and run x5 were 0 17 and 0 05 respectively fig 6b this indicates that almost all uv absorbing substances were removed during 24 h of raoc treatment during 24 h of the raoc treatment in both runs x4 and x5 although the rate of inactivation of r solanacearum by sspr in run x3 significantly decreased compared with that in run x2 owing to the attenuation of uv intensity by solids p 0 05 the k value in run x4 k x4 7 02 10 1 h 1 was almost the same as that in run x5 k x5 4 92 10 1 h 1 p 0 05 to quantitatively evaluate the effect of n 0 on r solanacearum inactivation by each reactor ratios of k values during 0 6 h k x3 k x2 k x5 k x4 were calculated and k x5 k x4 was compared with k x3 k x2 k x5 k x4 7 01 10 1 was around 9 times higher than k x3 k x2 7 82 10 2 showing that the raoc greatly improves the attenuation of uv intensity compared with the sspr 3 3 deceleration of inactivation of r solanacearum in ps during treatment behaviors of log n n 0 during 0 6 h were different from those during 6 24 h in runs x2 x4 and x5 fig 2 regression lines during 0 6 and 6 24 h were drawn fig s2 and the k values in each time range in runs x2 x5 were determined from the slopes of the regression lines fig 7a in runs x2 x4 and x5 the k values during 6 24 h 1 33 10 1 h 1 in run x2 9 64 10 2 h 1 in run x4 and 1 04 10 1 h 1 in run x5 were significantly lower than those during 0 6 h 4 09 10 1 h 1 in run x2 7 02 10 1 h 1 in run x4 and 4 92 10 1 h 1 in run x5 in run x3 the k value during 6 24 h 4 98 10 2 h 1 was almost same as that during 0 6 h 3 20 10 2 h 1 because the r solanacearum was hardly inactivated by the sspr singh et al 2016 applied a pulsed power technique to inactivate escherichia coli which is a gram negative bacterium in water and investigated the inactivation mechanism of e coli by the reactive oxygen species including hydroxyl radicals 57 they found that inactivation of e coli proceeds in sequence by formation of micropores caused by damage to the cell wall and cellular membrane leakage from the cytoplasm cell clumping and accumulation of cell debris they also mentioned that formation of micropores leads to release of proteins to the outside of the cell and dna inside the cell is damaged by the reactive oxygen species resulting in the inactivation of e coli benabbou et al and marugán et al explored the kinetics of inactivation of e coli by photocatalysis using tio2 and mentioned that the competition for reactive oxygen species between e coli and the organic matter derived from inactivated e coli is important for modeling 58 60 r solanacearum is also a gram negative bacterium and the inactivation mechanism of r solanacearum might be similar to that of e coli organic matter containing aromatic moieties or peptide bonds e g protein and phenol absorbs light at 230 nm while dna exhibits weak absorption of light at 230 nm 61 thus the behavior of a 230 was explored to monitor the release of organic matter from the cell if cell membranes were being damaged fig 7b a 660 and a 365 tended to decrease with the treatment fig 6 but the behavior of a 230 was totally different in run x2 a 230 a 0 230 increased until 4 h and then decreased during 4 24 h in run x3 a 230 a 0 230 tended to increase until 24 h in run x4 a 230 a 0 230 decreased until 3 h and then became stable in run x5 a 230 a 0 230 decreased until 2 h and then continuously increased until 24 h the increase in a 230 might be attributed to proteins released outside the cell and products derived from cell lysis in previous studies deactivation of tio2 by accumulation of organic compounds has been reported 62 63 the deactivation of tio2 by accumulation of byproducts may be a reason for the deceleration of inactivation of r solanacearum we deduce that the inactivation of r solanacearum decelerated after 6 h possibly because of competition for reactive oxygen species between r solanacearum and the products accumulated by inactivation of r solanacearum 3 4 inhibitory effects of coexisting substances in the ds on inactivation of r solanacearum by sspr in run x6 the inactivation efficiency of r solanacearum in ds by the sspr was assessed fig 8 log n n 0 slightly decreased and only 0 1 log reduction was observed during 6 h of sspr treatment the k value in run x6 k x6 4 74 10 2 h 1 was an order of magnitude lower than that in run x2 k x2 4 09 10 1 h 1 despite n 0 being nearly the same this shows that coexisting substances in the ds strongly inhibited the inactivation of r solanacearum p 0 05 the ds used in this study contains organics and inorganics at high concentration table 1 in hydroponic systems organic matter is released from substrate and plant roots to the culture solution some organics absorb uv light and decrease the production of hydroxyl radicals and holes h 64 66 anions such as hco3 co3 2 scavenge hydroxyl radicals and are strong inhibitors of photocatalysis of target compounds 67 therefore the sspr is not an applicable reactor for the inactivation of r solanacearum in ds and development of a reactor that mitigates the light attenuation and inhibitory effects of coexisting substances is essential 3 5 mitigation of inhibitory effects of coexisting substances in the ds on r solanacearum inactivation by the raoc in run x7 the inactivation efficiency of r solanacearum in ds by using the raoc was investigated and 2 log inactivation was achieved during 24 h of raoc treatment fig 8 the k value during 0 6 h in run x7 k x7 6 44 10 1 h 1 was nearly same as that in run x4 k x4 7 02 10 1 h 1 showing that the raoc mitigates the inhibitory effects of coexisting substances in the ds on inactivation of r solanacearum p 0 05 the sspr could not inactivate r solanacearum in the ds because of strong inhibition by coexisting substances in contrast the raoc showed excellent performance in inactivation of r solanacearum for quantitative evaluation of the mitigation of inhibition the ratio of k values in ps and ds by each reactor k x6 k x2 k x7 k x4 was determined k x7 k x4 9 17 10 1 was nearly 8 times k x6 k x2 1 16 10 1 demonstrating that the raoc strongly mitigates the inhibitory effects of coexisting substances in the ds on inactivation of r solanacearum in the raoc the attenuation of uv intensity by water was negligible we previously found that a raoc effectively removed 1 4 dioxane from landfill leachate containing coexisting substances at high concentration and discussed the mechanism of mitigation of the inhibitory effects of the coexisting substances 40 in the raoc the attenuation of uv intensity is negligible because the average thickness of the water film that is formed on the disk is only 1 3 102 μm and the very thin water film contributed to efficient removal of 1 4 dioxane from landfill leachate 40 the mechanism of mitigation of the inhibition of r solanacearum inactivation might be similar to that reported in our previous study corona plasma based inactivation technology for r solanacearum has been reported 19 21 23 but previous studies have not determined the inactivation efficiency of r solanacearum in actual ds in addition the corona plasma reactor cannot easily be scaled up because the corona plasma is generated in a very narrow cylinder under high voltage and continuous air flow the raoc showed excellent performance in the inactivation of r solanacearum in the ds under irradiation by uva light which is abundant in sunlight and thus this will be an energy saving reactor for the disinfection of ds containing r solanacearum the raoc is therefore a promising and upscalable photocatalytic reactor for efficiently inactivating r solanacearum in ds 4 conclusions in this study an raoc equipped with tio2 zeolite composite sheets was developed to inactivate r solanacearum in ds the inactivation efficiency of r solanacearum in the ds by the raoc was evaluated by comparing with that by a sspr inhibitory effects of coexisting substances in the ds on the inactivation of r solanacearum were investigated the mechanism of mitigation of the inhibition was also assessed the main findings are the sspr inactivated r solanacearum in the ps through photocatalysis by the tio2 zeolite composite sheet but the inactivation efficiency at 4 0 107 cfu ml 1 of n 0 significantly decreased compared with that at 1 8 106 cfu ml 1 of n 0 owing to the attenuation of uv intensity by light absorption and scattering by solids derived from r solanacearum the gfp labelled r solanacearum was mainly observed on pet fibers in the tio2 zeolite composite sheet the raoc achieved 2 log inactivation during 24 h of treatment regardless of n 0 r solanacearum captured by the sheet was inactivated through photocatalysis by the tio2 zeolite composite sheet under uv irradiation k x5 k x4 was around 9 times higher than k x3 k x2 this shows that the raoc greatly improves the attenuation of uv intensity compared with the sspr a deceleration of inactivation of r solanacearum and an increase in a 230 were observed in runs x2 x5 the increase in a 230 might be attributed to proteins released outside the cell and products derived from cell lysis we deduce that the inactivation of r solanacearum decelerated after 6 h possibly because of competition for reactive oxygen species between living r solanacearum and the products accumulated by inactivation of r solanacearum coexisting substances in the ds strongly inhibited the inactivation of r solanacearum by the sspr only 0 1 log reduction was observed during 6 h of sspr treatment in contrast the raoc showed excellent performance in inactivation of r solanacearum in the ds and 2 log inactivation was achieved during 24 h of raoc treatment k x7 was nearly the same as k x4 and k x7 k x4 was nearly 8 times k x6 k x2 showing that the raoc mitigates the light attenuation and inhibitory effects of coexisting substances on inactivation of r solanacearum in the ds this might be because of the very thin water film used by the raoc the raoc is a promising and upscalable photocatalytic reactor for efficiently inactivating r solanacearum in ds declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

12963,a rotating advanced oxidation contactor raoc equipped with tio2 zeolite composite sheets was developed to inactivate the plant pathogenic bacterium ralstonia solanacearum in drainage solution ds from a hydroponic system the inactivation efficiency of r solanacearum in ds and pure culture solution ps by the raoc was compared with that achieved by a submerged composite sheet photocatalysis reactor sspr the initial number of living bacteria n 0 was adjusted to around 106 107 cfu ml 1 the inactivation efficiency of r solanacearum by the sspr at 4 0 107 cfu ml 1 of n 0 significantly decreased compared with that at 1 8 106 cfu ml 1 of n 0 owing to the attenuation of uv intensity by light absorption and scattering by solids derived from r solanacearum while the raoc achieved 2 log inactivation during 24 h of treatment regardless of n 0 the inactivation of r solanacearum by the raoc decelerated after 6 h possibly because of competition for reactive oxygen species between r solanacearum and products accumulated by inactivation of r solanacearum the ratio of rate constants for inactivation of r solanacearum in ds to that in ps by the raoc was 8 times that for the sspr this shows that the raoc greatly mitigates the light attenuation and inhibitory effects of coexisting substances on inactivation of r solanacearum in the ds the raoc is therefore a promising and upscalable photocatalytic reactor for efficient inactivation of r solanacearum in ds graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords rotating advanced oxidation contactor tio2 zeolite composite sheet ralstonia solanacearum inactivation hydroponic system drainage solution 1 introduction the global population will rise from around 7 billion people in 2010 to nearly 10 billion by 2050 1 and food production in 2050 will need to be increased by 56 compared with that in 2010 2 agriculture plays an essential role in food production soil culture has greatly contributed to vegetable production but suffers problems such as excessive use of water 3 4 emission of greenhouse gases including nitrous oxide 5 6 and occurrence of soilborne diseases 7 8 thus hydroponic culture an approach for growing plants without soil that involves using nutrient solutions in water has been used in farming as an alternative to soil culture the closed hydroponic system enables one to save water and nutrients by cyclic use of the drainage solution ds and exhibits higher yield per unit area than soil culture 9 11 although the hydroponic system can avoid occurrence of soilborne diseases plant pathogens can invade the system via various routes such as from the substrate seeding and soil surrounding the hydroponic greenhouse 12 resulting in significant decrease in crop yield disinfection of the ds to inactivate plant pathogens e g fusarium spp has been explored by a wide variety of approaches such as heating 13 membrane filtration 14 15 chlorination 16 liming 17 ozonation 18 corona plasma 18 23 ultraviolet uv irradiation 24 and photocatalysis 25 26 heating and membrane filtration have limitations such as high running cost and a requirement for periodic cleaning maintenance although chlorination is cost effective continuous addition of chlorine may have an adverse impact on the plants such as formation of chloramines which have detrimental effects via the reaction of ammonia and residual chlorine or sodium hypochlorite in the nutrient solution 16 27 ozonation and corona plasma generate highly reactive oxygen species e g hydroxyl radicals and a huge amount of electrical energy is required for the operation inactivation of plant pathogens using uv irradiation and a photocatalyst such as titanium dioxide tio2 has been reported 24 26 28 29 photocatalysts produce reactive oxygen species e g hydroxyl radicals under uv irradiation and photocatalysis is expected to be an energy saving advanced oxidation process aop because sunlight can be used as the light source however the efficiency of inactivating pathogens by uv based aops including photocatalysis decreases with increasing reactor volume because of scattering and attenuation of light in water 28 29 economic losses due to bacterial wilt disease which is caused by the soilborne plant pathogenic bacterium ralstonia solanacearum are a growing agricultural concern worldwide infection of hydroponically cultivated tomato solanum lycopersicum by r solanacearum has been reported 30 r solanacearum infects into plant root and colonizes the intercellular spaces of the root subsequently r solanacearum invades xylem vessels and reduces sap flow by growth of bacterial cells and formation of exopolysaccharide slime resulting in the development of wilting symptoms 31 32 in closed hydroponic systems r solanacearum is diffused throughout the cultivation facility in the recirculating ds and eradicating r solanacearum is very difficult after the appearance of symptoms hence development of disinfection techniques for ds containing r solanacearum is urgently required corona plasma is the only technology that has been applied for r solanacearum inactivation and the corona discharge reactor showed good performance in repetitively and continuously inactivating r solanacearum in artificial nutrient solution 19 21 23 however previous studies have not assessed the inactivation of r solanacearum in an actual ds and have not considered the inhibitory effects of coexisting substances in the ds on the inactivation efficiency we previously investigated the ds water quality from hydroponic system and revealed that ds contains a wide variety of coexisting substances at high concentration 33 evaluating the inactivation efficiency in actual ds instead of artificial nutrient solution is also important because some of organic compounds such as carboxylates exhibit a lower reactivity with hydroxyl radicals 34 35 in addition the corona discharge reactor requires continuous air flow as well as high voltage to produce reactive oxygen species and is hard to scale up from an engineering viewpoint the development of an upscalable reactor for inactivating r solanacearum in ds is of great importance we have fabricated a composite sheet with tio2 and adsorbent e g zeolite using a papermaking technique to easily separate the functional materials from treated water 36 37 and developed a rotating advanced oxidation contactor raoc equipped with the tio2 zeolite composite sheets 38 39 in the raoc the top part of the disk is illuminated with uv light for photocatalysis and the bottom part of the disk is immersed in water for adsorption of organic contaminants by rotating the disk the photocatalysis and adsorption occur continuously the raoc shows excellent performance for removing trace organic contaminants from actual wastewater and greatly mitigates the inhibitory effects of coexisting substances in addition to light attenuation as the photocatalysis is performed in an extremely thin water film 40 41 we have found that water temperature and uv intensity are key factors for controlling the performance of raoc treatment 41 42 and this technology is expected to be cost effective and energy saving for treatment of organic contaminants in reverse osmosis concentrate from water reuse 43 44 the raoc is an upscalable reactor and applicable to actual wastewater treatment systems to remove trace organic contaminants however no previous research has applied the raoc to disinfection of ds infested by r solanacearum in this study the efficiency of inactivation of r solanacearum by an raoc equipped with tio2 zeolite composite sheets was evaluated in comparison with that by a submerged composite sheet photocatalysis reactor sspr in addition fluorescent protein labelled r solanacearum was used to estimate the material that captures and inactivates the r solanacearum in the tio2 zeolite composite sheet the inhibitory effects of coexisting substances in the ds on inactivation of r solanacearum were investigated by comparing the inactivation efficiencies in pure culture solution ps and ds to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of development of an upscalable photocatalytic reactor to inactivate r solanacearum in ds 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the sources of chemicals are provided in appendix a text s1 r solanacearum strain oe1 1 45 was selected as the target strain in this study and was incubated in b medium 46 by shaking at 28 c for 24 h to reach stationary phase nearly 109 colony forming units cfu ml 1 to visualize the distribution of r solanacearum on the sheets a green fluorescent protein gfp labelled r solanacearum strain oe1 1 gfp labelled r solanacearum 47 was used the ds from a hydroponic system for eggplant cultivation kochi japan was collected on december 18 2019 the ds quality is summarized in table 1 electric conductivity and ph of the ds were measured immediately after sampling the wide range of electric conductivity value was observed 20 472 ms m 1 in our previous study 33 and the value measured in present study was within the range suspended solids concentration in the ds was below the detection limit and the ds was stored at 4 c after filtration with glass fiber filtration papers whatman gf b pittsburg pa usa because the ds might contain bacteria in addition to r solanacearum the ds was sterilized at 121 c for 30 min using a high pressure steam sterilizer mls 3030 phc holdings corporation tokyo japan before conducting disinfection experiments and r solanacearum cells were added to the sterilized ds the ds water quality before and after sterilization is shown in appendix a table s1 2 2 configuration of reactors the polyethylene terephthalate pet fiber zeolite tio2 and

tio2 sheet containing 6 25 g of pet fibers and 3 125 g of tio2 and tio2 zeolite composite sheet containing 6 25 g of pet fibers 3 125 g of zeolite and 3 125 g of tio2 were obtained the details of preparation and physiochemical properties of the tio2 zeolite composite sheet are shown in our previous study 37 we previously confirmed that tio2 and zeolite particles were uniformly dispersed within tio2 zeolite composite sheet and the composite sheet has high durability toward uv irradiation 37 in the present study the sspr and raoc were configured as shown in fig 1 in the sspr the tio2 zeolite composite sheet with effective area of 9 cm2 1 8 cm 5 cm was completely immersed in a glass vial filled with test culture solution 0 05 l and the vial was illuminated with a uva light source λ 350 400 nm maximum wavelength 365 nm fl287 bl365 raytronics corporation saitama japan a uva light source was chosen because solar light is expected to be used in future applications in the raoc two pieces of tio2 zeolite composite sheet with an effective area of 449 cm2 for each piece were fixed one on each side on a disk with diameter of 24 cm the bottom part of the disk 45 of the disk area was submerged in a tank 25 cm 7 cm 14 5 cm filled with test culture solution 2 l for adsorption and the top part of the disk 55 of the disk area was illuminated with the uva light source fl287 bl365 to achieve photocatalysis the rotation speed of the disk was controlled at 10 rpm by a motor a uv radiometer uv 340c custom corporation tokyo japan was used to measure the uv intensity at the surface of the vial or disk 2 3 inactivation of r solanacearum cultures of r solanacearum for inactivation were prepared by diluting the bacterial cells using ps or ds and the number of initial living bacteria n 0 was adjusted to around 106 107 cfu ml 1 in this study 10 mm mgso4 was used as the ps inactivation tests of r solanacearum were performed using the sspr or raoc the experimental conditions are summarized in table 2 r solanacearum was used in runs x1 x7 and gfp labelled r solanacearum was used in runs y1 y5 runs x1 and y1 y4 were conducted in dark and runs x2 x7 were performed with uv illumination of 1 mw cm 2 corresponding to a uv fluence rate of 3 6 103 mj cm 2 h 1 in run y5 four pieces of sheet with an effective area of 224 5 cm2 for each piece were fixed on a disk with a surface area of 898 cm2 and the experiment was performed during 0 6 h in dark and 6 12 h with uv illumination of 1 mw cm 2 the water temperature was adjusted to 25 1 c at the designated time 1 or 10 ml of treated solution was taken and the number of living bacteria n and the uv spectrum were measured the glassware and reactor were sterilized before conducting disinfection experiments all tests were carried out twice 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 quantitative methods n 0 and n were measured using the dilution plate technique the sample was diluted using 10 mm mgso4 and 100 μl of sample were spread on a plate containing bg medium 46 to measure the n in the sheet we referred the standard methods for dna extraction 48 the sheet sample 2 cm2 immersed in the ps 1 ml was vortexed for 5 s and the n in the solution was measured to selectively incubate r solanacearum the antibiotic polymyxin b sulfate was added to the bg medium 49 the plate was incubated at 28 c in the dark and colonies were counted after 48 h 50 a spectrophotometer biospec 1600 shimadzu corporation kyoto japan was used with a quartz cell light path length 1 cm to measure absorbance at 660 nm a 660 365 nm a 365 and 230 nm a 230 and the initial values a 0 660 a 0 365 and a 0 230 in runs x2 x5 are summarized in table 2 the bacterial distribution on the sheets was observed using epifluorescence microscope bx51 olympus optical co tokyo japan analytical methods for dissolved organic carbon doc and inorganic ions are given in appendix a text s2 2 4 2 kinetic analysis chick watson model 51 52 has been used for analyzing the inactivation kinetics of bacterial pathogens by photocatalysis 53 54 thus the model was used in this study chick watson equation is expressed as follows 1 dn dt kn where k is the rate constant for inactivating r solanacearum h 1 and t is uv irradiation time h the definitions of n and n 0 are given above 2 4 3 statistical analysis the effect of n 0 on r solanacearum inactivation and the inhibition of inactivation of r solanacearum by coexisting substances in ds were evaluated by statistically analyzing the rate constant for r solanacearum inactivation one tailed t test for equal variances was performed using microsoft excel version 16 60 the significance level was set at p value 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 inactivation of r solanacearum in the ps by the sspr the inactivation behaviors of r solanacearum in ps by the sspr are shown in fig 2a runs x1 x3 in run x1 dark conditions log n n 0 slightly decreased until 2 h through adsorption by the tio2 zeolite composite sheet and then gradually increased during 3 24 h by bacterial growth in run x2 with uv irradiation log n n 0 continuously decreased and nearly 2 log inactivation was achieved during 24 h of sspr treatment we confirmed that r solanacearum continued to grow in the absence of the composite sheet and uv irradiation and it was not inactivated by irradiation with the uva light used in this study fig s1 this shows that r solanacearum is inactivated through photocatalysis by the tio2 zeolite composite sheet under uv irradiation in run x3 with uv irradiation only 0 5 log reduction was observed during 24 h of sspr treatment and the inactivation efficiency of r solanacearum in run x3 significantly decreased compared with that in run x2 because a linear relationship was observed between ln n n 0 and time during 0 6 h the k for inactivation of r solanacearum were determined from the slopes of the regression lines during 0 6 h fig s2 the k value in run x3 k x3 3 20 10 2 h 1 was an order of magnitude lower than that in run x2 k x2 4 09 10 1 h 1 the behaviors of gfp labelled r solanacearum in ps by the sspr are shown in fig 3a runs y1 y4 in runs y1 y4 log n n 0 did not change the n in the sheet is shown in fig 4 in runs y1 y4 the living bacteria were detected from each sheet this indicates that the gfp labelled r solanacearum was captured by the sheet the fluorescence images of each sheet after 6 h of sspr treatment are shown in fig 5 the pet fibers are narrow fig 5a b c and d and flocs containing tio2 particles were observed inside the fiber network fig 5c and d although flocs of zeolite particles could not be observed by fluorescence microscopy fig 5b we previously confirmed that particles of tio2 and zeolite are uniformly dispersed within the tio2 zeolite composite sheet by scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy 37 the gfp labelled r solanacearum was observed on pet fiber and the flocs of tio2 particles from all types of sheet fig 5a b c and d and mainly observed on pet fibers we deduce that pet fibers in the tio2 zeolite composite sheet play an important role in capturing r solanacearum time profiles of a 660 and a 365 are shown in fig 6 a 660 is used to evaluate the turbidity of water containing solids the value of a 0 660 in run x3 was higher than that in run x2 as was n 0 table 2 because more solids derived from r solanacearum were observed in run x3 a decrease in a 660 a 0 660 due to the sspr treatment was confirmed in both run x2 and run x3 fig 6a during 24 h of sspr treatment a 660 a 0 660 reached zero in run x2 while it remained around 0 5 in run x3 a 365 was also measured because a uva light source whose maximum wavelength was 365 nm was used in this study the values of a 365 a 0 365 at 24 h in run x2 and run x3 were 0 18 and 0 46 respectively fig 6b this indicates that uv absorbing substances remained at a higher concentration in run x3 than in run x2 and the photon flux on the tio2 surface in run x3 was lower than that in run x2 previous studies showed that solids strongly affect the photocatalytic performance of tio2 because of light scattering by the solids 55 56 we deduce that the significant decrease in k value with increase in n 0 from 1 8 106 cfu ml 1 to 4 0 107 cfu ml 1 might be attributed to the attenuation of uv intensity by light absorption and scattering by solids derived from r solanacearum 3 2 inactivation of r solanacearum in ps by the raoc the inactivation behaviors of r solanacearum in ps by the raoc are shown in fig 2b runs x4 and x5 the raoc successfully inactivated r solanacearum under uv irradiation and 2 log inactivation was achieved during 24 h of raoc treatment in both runs x4 and x5 the inactivation behavior in run x5 was similar to that in run x4 despite the presence of r solanacearum at one order of magnitude higher n 0 in run y5 log n n 0 was almost stable during 0 6 h and decreased during 6 12 h fig 3b as shown in fig 4 the n in the pet fiber sheet and zeolite sheet at 6 h was almost same with that at 12 h while the n in the tio2 sheet and tio2 zeolite composite sheet at 12 h was significantly lower than that at 6 h this shows that r solanacearum is inactivated through tio2 uv photocatalysis therefore r solanacearum captured by the sheet is inactivated through photocatalysis by the tio2 zeolite composite sheet under uv irradiation from the behavior of a 660 a 0 660 fig 6a the solids were completely removed during 24 h of raoc treatment in both runs x4 and x5 the values of a 365 a 0 365 at 24 h in run x4 and run x5 were 0 17 and 0 05 respectively fig 6b this indicates that almost all uv absorbing substances were removed during 24 h of raoc treatment during 24 h of the raoc treatment in both runs x4 and x5 although the rate of inactivation of r solanacearum by sspr in run x3 significantly decreased compared with that in run x2 owing to the attenuation of uv intensity by solids p 0 05 the k value in run x4 k x4 7 02 10 1 h 1 was almost the same as that in run x5 k x5 4 92 10 1 h 1 p 0 05 to quantitatively evaluate the effect of n 0 on r solanacearum inactivation by each reactor ratios of k values during 0 6 h k x3 k x2 k x5 k x4 were calculated and k x5 k x4 was compared with k x3 k x2 k x5 k x4 7 01 10 1 was around 9 times higher than k x3 k x2 7 82 10 2 showing that the raoc greatly improves the attenuation of uv intensity compared with the sspr 3 3 deceleration of inactivation of r solanacearum in ps during treatment behaviors of log n n 0 during 0 6 h were different from those during 6 24 h in runs x2 x4 and x5 fig 2 regression lines during 0 6 and 6 24 h were drawn fig s2 and the k values in each time range in runs x2 x5 were determined from the slopes of the regression lines fig 7a in runs x2 x4 and x5 the k values during 6 24 h 1 33 10 1 h 1 in run x2 9 64 10 2 h 1 in run x4 and 1 04 10 1 h 1 in run x5 were significantly lower than those during 0 6 h 4 09 10 1 h 1 in run x2 7 02 10 1 h 1 in run x4 and 4 92 10 1 h 1 in run x5 in run x3 the k value during 6 24 h 4 98 10 2 h 1 was almost same as that during 0 6 h 3 20 10 2 h 1 because the r solanacearum was hardly inactivated by the sspr singh et al 2016 applied a pulsed power technique to inactivate escherichia coli which is a gram negative bacterium in water and investigated the inactivation mechanism of e coli by the reactive oxygen species including hydroxyl radicals 57 they found that inactivation of e coli proceeds in sequence by formation of micropores caused by damage to the cell wall and cellular membrane leakage from the cytoplasm cell clumping and accumulation of cell debris they also mentioned that formation of micropores leads to release of proteins to the outside of the cell and dna inside the cell is damaged by the reactive oxygen species resulting in the inactivation of e coli benabbou et al and marugán et al explored the kinetics of inactivation of e coli by photocatalysis using tio2 and mentioned that the competition for reactive oxygen species between e coli and the organic matter derived from inactivated e coli is important for modeling 58 60 r solanacearum is also a gram negative bacterium and the inactivation mechanism of r solanacearum might be similar to that of e coli organic matter containing aromatic moieties or peptide bonds e g protein and phenol absorbs light at 230 nm while dna exhibits weak absorption of light at 230 nm 61 thus the behavior of a 230 was explored to monitor the release of organic matter from the cell if cell membranes were being damaged fig 7b a 660 and a 365 tended to decrease with the treatment fig 6 but the behavior of a 230 was totally different in run x2 a 230 a 0 230 increased until 4 h and then decreased during 4 24 h in run x3 a 230 a 0 230 tended to increase until 24 h in run x4 a 230 a 0 230 decreased until 3 h and then became stable in run x5 a 230 a 0 230 decreased until 2 h and then continuously increased until 24 h the increase in a 230 might be attributed to proteins released outside the cell and products derived from cell lysis in previous studies deactivation of tio2 by accumulation of organic compounds has been reported 62 63 the deactivation of tio2 by accumulation of byproducts may be a reason for the deceleration of inactivation of r solanacearum we deduce that the inactivation of r solanacearum decelerated after 6 h possibly because of competition for reactive oxygen species between r solanacearum and the products accumulated by inactivation of r solanacearum 3 4 inhibitory effects of coexisting substances in the ds on inactivation of r solanacearum by sspr in run x6 the inactivation efficiency of r solanacearum in ds by the sspr was assessed fig 8 log n n 0 slightly decreased and only 0 1 log reduction was observed during 6 h of sspr treatment the k value in run x6 k x6 4 74 10 2 h 1 was an order of magnitude lower than that in run x2 k x2 4 09 10 1 h 1 despite n 0 being nearly the same this shows that coexisting substances in the ds strongly inhibited the inactivation of r solanacearum p 0 05 the ds used in this study contains organics and inorganics at high concentration table 1 in hydroponic systems organic matter is released from substrate and plant roots to the culture solution some organics absorb uv light and decrease the production of hydroxyl radicals and holes h 64 66 anions such as hco3 co3 2 scavenge hydroxyl radicals and are strong inhibitors of photocatalysis of target compounds 67 therefore the sspr is not an applicable reactor for the inactivation of r solanacearum in ds and development of a reactor that mitigates the light attenuation and inhibitory effects of coexisting substances is essential 3 5 mitigation of inhibitory effects of coexisting substances in the ds on r solanacearum inactivation by the raoc in run x7 the inactivation efficiency of r solanacearum in ds by using the raoc was investigated and 2 log inactivation was achieved during 24 h of raoc treatment fig 8 the k value during 0 6 h in run x7 k x7 6 44 10 1 h 1 was nearly same as that in run x4 k x4 7 02 10 1 h 1 showing that the raoc mitigates the inhibitory effects of coexisting substances in the ds on inactivation of r solanacearum p 0 05 the sspr could not inactivate r solanacearum in the ds because of strong inhibition by coexisting substances in contrast the raoc showed excellent performance in inactivation of r solanacearum for quantitative evaluation of the mitigation of inhibition the ratio of k values in ps and ds by each reactor k x6 k x2 k x7 k x4 was determined k x7 k x4 9 17 10 1 was nearly 8 times k x6 k x2 1 16 10 1 demonstrating that the raoc strongly mitigates the inhibitory effects of coexisting substances in the ds on inactivation of r solanacearum in the raoc the attenuation of uv intensity by water was negligible we previously found that a raoc effectively removed 1 4 dioxane from landfill leachate containing coexisting substances at high concentration and discussed the mechanism of mitigation of the inhibitory effects of the coexisting substances 40 in the raoc the attenuation of uv intensity is negligible because the average thickness of the water film that is formed on the disk is only 1 3 102 μm and the very thin water film contributed to efficient removal of 1 4 dioxane from landfill leachate 40 the mechanism of mitigation of the inhibition of r solanacearum inactivation might be similar to that reported in our previous study corona plasma based inactivation technology for r solanacearum has been reported 19 21 23 but previous studies have not determined the inactivation efficiency of r solanacearum in actual ds in addition the corona plasma reactor cannot easily be scaled up because the corona plasma is generated in a very narrow cylinder under high voltage and continuous air flow the raoc showed excellent performance in the inactivation of r solanacearum in the ds under irradiation by uva light which is abundant in sunlight and thus this will be an energy saving reactor for the disinfection of ds containing r solanacearum the raoc is therefore a promising and upscalable photocatalytic reactor for efficiently inactivating r solanacearum in ds 4 conclusions in this study an raoc equipped with tio2 zeolite composite sheets was developed to inactivate r solanacearum in ds the inactivation efficiency of r solanacearum in the ds by the raoc was evaluated by comparing with that by a sspr inhibitory effects of coexisting substances in the ds on the inactivation of r solanacearum were investigated the mechanism of mitigation of the inhibition was also assessed the main findings are the sspr inactivated r solanacearum in the ps through photocatalysis by the tio2 zeolite composite sheet but the inactivation efficiency at 4 0 107 cfu ml 1 of n 0 significantly decreased compared with that at 1 8 106 cfu ml 1 of n 0 owing to the attenuation of uv intensity by light absorption and scattering by solids derived from r solanacearum the gfp labelled r solanacearum was mainly observed on pet fibers in the tio2 zeolite composite sheet the raoc achieved 2 log inactivation during 24 h of treatment regardless of n 0 r solanacearum captured by the sheet was inactivated through photocatalysis by the tio2 zeolite composite sheet under uv irradiation k x5 k x4 was around 9 times higher than k x3 k x2 this shows that the raoc greatly improves the attenuation of uv intensity compared with the sspr a deceleration of inactivation of r solanacearum and an increase in a 230 were observed in runs x2 x5 the increase in a 230 might be attributed to proteins released outside the cell and products derived from cell lysis we deduce that the inactivation of r solanacearum decelerated after 6 h possibly because of competition for reactive oxygen species between living r solanacearum and the products accumulated by inactivation of r solanacearum coexisting substances in the ds strongly inhibited the inactivation of r solanacearum by the sspr only 0 1 log reduction was observed during 6 h of sspr treatment in contrast the raoc showed excellent performance in inactivation of r solanacearum in the ds and 2 log inactivation was achieved during 24 h of raoc treatment k x7 was nearly the same as k x4 and k x7 k x4 was nearly 8 times k x6 k x2 showing that the raoc mitigates the light attenuation and inhibitory effects of coexisting substances on inactivation of r solanacearum in the ds this might be because of the very thin water film used by the raoc the raoc is a promising and upscalable photocatalytic reactor for efficiently inactivating r solanacearum in ds declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

12964,microalgae have promising applications in wastewater treatment due to their ability to use nitrogen phosphorous and organic carbon as nutrients for the production of valuable biomass and lipids among attached cultivation systems twin layer is a technology in which most of the research has been conducted using synthetic wastewater for microalgae growth and biofuel production moreover source and substrate layers used in twin layer technology are costly limiting its widespread application in the present study potential of horizontal twin layer system tls was assessed for treatment of non sterilized real wastewater and microalgae production moreover novel and cost effective buckram membrane and kraft paper were used as source and substrate layers respectively results indicated that biomass productivity of scenedesmus sp was 5 32 and 4 76 g m 2 d 1 in raw municipal rww and wetland treated municipal wastewater wtww respectively specific growth rate of 0 29 d 1 and carbon capture rate of 2 27 g m 2 d 1 was achieved in rww the maximum removal capacity of nh4 n tkn cod and po4 3 p was 1050 1194 3437 and 105 mg m 2 d 1 respectively in rww lipid biosynthesis was also higher in rww with enhanced productivity of 0 93 g m 2 d 1 compared to 0 78 g m 2 d 1 in wtww the findings of this study demonstrate the feasibility of using horizontal tls for efficient recovery of nutrients from wastewater via algal based lipid production graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords horizontal twin layer system real wastewater treatment nutrient recovery biomass and lipids production carbon capture 1 introduction freshwater is essential for economic and societal development of human beings water demand in many countries is increasing due to continuous improvement in living standards population increase and economic growth 1 by 2030 nearly half of the world population will be facing water shortage developing countries like pakistan will be facing severe water scarcity as compared to developed countries 2 water availability in pakistan has drastically reduced compared to 1299 m3 capita in 1996 97 by 2025 it is predicted to be 700 m3 capita which is less than international standard of 1500 m3 capita 3 wastewater generated in pakistan should be treated and reused to overcome water scarcity and shortage in pakistan municipal sector contributes 3 06 billion m3of the total wastewater generation which is 4 43 billion m3 4 municipal wastewater mw when discharged untreated results in air water and soil pollution treatment of mw is very important before its final disposal 5 different conventional treatment methods such as suspended or attached growth of mixed bacterial cultures activated sludge systems moving bed biofilm reactors trickling filters are often used to treat mw these methods ensure that major contaminants such as nitrogen phosphorus and organic matter are effectively removed and treated wastewater is safely disposed of or reused they do however have high energy consumption operational cost and sludge production as well as making a significant impact to global warming through increasing on site and off site greenhouse gas emissions as a result over the last decade a lot of research has been done for developing alternative cost effective techniques for mw treatment microalgae cultivation has received a lot of attention as an alternative solution due to their capability of sustainable wastewater treatment co2 capture and ecofriendly biofuel production 6 8 cultivation of microalgae in mw medium can simultaneously produce biomass for biofuel production and remove nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous by utilizing them as macronutrients for their growth and maintenance of photosynthetic metabolism 9 10 open ponds and closed photo bioreactors have been used for wastewater treatment using microalgae over the past few decades 11 14 large scale application of these systems is limited due to slow biomass production high energy cost of harvesting enhanced space requirement and ease of contamination 15 the attached cultivation of microalgae is a promising technology to avoid these problems 16 18 it is the growth of microalgae on the surface of the substrate in the form of biofilm which can be harvested by scraping since no separation of algal biomass from wastewater is required 19 as a result the biomass produced is more concentrated compared to the conventional suspension system which contains 99 water and 1 microalgae energy requirement for dewatering of microalgae is significantly decreased by 99 7 in attached cultivation compared to suspended systems 20 higher biomass productivity is obtained in biofilm systems due to better light availability enhancing the photosynthetic efficiency 21 22 additional benefits of attached cultivation of microalgae include less water consumption increased efficiency of co2 o2 exchange small space requirement and enhanced wastewater treatment 20 wastewater treatment systems based on algal biofilms have been commonly used and some common examples are revolving algal biofilm reactor 23 algal turf scrubber 24 and flat plate algal biofilm reactor 25 detachment of algal cells is frequently faced in these systems because nutrients are distributed by a constant or intermittent flow of liquid over biofilm surface moreover flow of wastewater medium over biofilm surface causes contamination in some biofilm systems 26 twin layer is a cell immobilization technique in which water is fully excluded from the biofilm surface thus microalgae cannot be contaminated by pollutants or microorganisms in twin layer system tls microalgae is immobilized on microporous substrate layer under the substrate layer macroporous second layer known as source layer is present which provides the wastewater or nutrient media 27 tls has been operated in two orientations vertical and horizontal 28 31 vertical tls has previously been used for treatment of wastewater shi et al 27 studied treatment of synthetic wastewater using protran reinforced nitrocellulose membrane and glass fibre fleece as source and substrate layer respectively no contamination and loss of microalgal cells was reported during the experiment phosphate and ammonium nitrogen was removed 91 and 96 respectively by scenedesmus rubescens in another study prototype scale vertical twin layer photobioreactor was studied for efficient removal of nitrogen and phosphorous from real municipal wastewater halochlorella rubescens was immobilized on nylon fibre membrane and municipal wastewater was supplied by reinforced glass fibre mesh the removal of phosphate phosphorous and ammonium nitrogen from secondary wastewater was 78 9 and 100 while the initial concentration was 3 81 and 11 10 mg l 1 respectively 32 in vertical tls wastewater medium is not equally distributed among source and substrate layer reducing the overall efficiency of wastewater treatment and biomass production however this problem of vertical tls can be overcome by horizontal tls potential of horizontal tls was studied by zhang et al 31 for the production of biomass and astaxanthin using bg 11 nutrient media maximum biomass and astaxanthin production of 6 6 g m 2 d 1 and 160 mg m 2 d 1 was reported using 100 μmol m 2 s 1 light intensity similarly do et al 33 evaluated production of astaxanthin in h pluvialis strain ccac0125 using bg 11medium on angled twin layer porous substrate bioreactor in another study ettlia sp yc001 was cultivated on horizontal twin layer system for lipid production using bg 11 nutrient medium the maximum lipid productivity of 4 2 g m 2 d 1 was achieved with 7 co2 at 500 μe m 2 s 1 light intensity 34 however no study to date has evaluated the performance of horizontal tls for treatment of real wastewater moreover in all the studies conducted on horizontal tls source layer used were filter paper glass fibre non woven and glass fibre mesh while substrate layer used were either nitrate cellulose nylon membrane cellulose acetate or nitrocellulose membrane 31 33 34 huge cost of us 2 us 5 per square meter associated with these source and substrate layers makes large scale application of this system difficult 26 the current study uses novel cost effective and ecofriendly buckram membrane and kraft paper as source and substrate layer respectively for the treatment of real raw municipal wastewater rww and wetland treated municipal wastewater wtww the main objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the potential of horizontal tls for real wastewater remediation and nutrient recovery 2 to evaluate effect of rww and wtww on production of biomass lipid and pigments of scenedesmus sp moreover growth kinetic parameters of biomass productivity specific growth rate and doubling time of scenedesmus sp were also studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgal strain and culture conditions niva chl 99 scenedesmus sp used in this study was obtained from

sufficient algal biomass for immobilization and use in wastewater treatment cultures were added to 500 ml aerated flasks after 2 3 weeks of algal growth the cultures were transferred to 2 l flasks incubated at a light intensity of 75 μmol m 2 s 1 supplied with bench air filtered through 0 22 μm cellulose acetate syringe filters 2 2 wastewater collection rww and wtww was collected in 6 l plastic bottles directly from the inlet of wastewater treatment plant and outlet of wetland treatment facility at national university of sciences and technology nust islamabad respectively rww and wtww were filtered through 1 μm whatman filter paper and stored at 4 c before characterization and use in further experimentation both wastewater were characterised for their ph electrical conductivity ec through multimeter inolab ph cond 720 germany and turbidity using turbidity meter ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n total kjeldhal nitrogen tkn inorganic phosphorous as phosphate phosphorous po4 3 p and chemical oxygen demand cod were also measured by standard methods 37 2 3 experimental set up for horizontal twin layer system fig 1 shows laboratory scale set up of horizontal tls it was made up of polymethyl methacrylate pmma chamber having a length width height of 90 cm 66 cm 12 cm it is further divided into four inner channels each channel is a multilayered structure that consists of from bottom to top pmma base a source layer of buckram membrane 79 92 g m 2 and a top substrate layer of kraft paper 60 g m 2 with immobilized algae forming algal disk to form an algal disk algal cells were immobilized on kraft paper by filtration using vacuum filtration assembly the inoculated area of kraft paper was 0 00125 m2 per disk at an initial microalgae dry weight density of 5 g m 2 a total of 20 algal disks were placed on top of the buckram membrane for each channel horizontal tls was tilted at 15 along the horizontal axis so that the culture medium supplied at the top of each channel could flow down by gravity in this way wastewater was equally distributed to both buckram membrane and algal disks five 12 w led lamps producing cool and white light were placed on the top of each channel photosynthetic flux density of 200 μmol m 2 s 1 at each algal disk was measured through quantum sensor apogee quantum sensor mq 500 usa all four channels were supplied with atmospheric carbon dioxide using an air pump through a gas hole present at the side of the pmma chamber all the experiments were run under ambient conditions 2 4 horizontal twin layer system performance for wastewater treatment rww and wtww were used to evaluate the performance of horizontal tls in terms of nutrient removal biomass lipids and pigment production before wastewater treatment immobilized algae on kraft paper was acclimatized for 3 days on horizontal tls using z8 medium after acclimatization phase 2 l rww and wtww was supplied with the help of peristaltic pump lead 15 48 china at the flow rate of 3 ml min 1 for 4 days the system was operated continuously by recirculating both wastewater without the addition of fresh medium throughout the treatment period 100 ml of wastewater was sampled daily from the flasks after proper mixing sampled wastewater was filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filters and analysed for nh4 n tkn no2 n po4 3 p and cod respectively 2 5 analysis and calculations 2 5 1 dry biomass of scenedesmus sp and growth kinetics scenedemsus sp dry biomass was measured on horizontal tls in terms of biomass production and productivity briefly at the end of each experiment kraft paper with algal biofilm was harvested and dried at 105 c for 12 h biomass production p in g m 2 and biomass productivity px in g m 2 d 1 were determined by eqs 1 and 2 respectively 31 1 p dw 2 dw 1 footprint area where dw1 is dry weight of kraft paper alone and dw2 is dry weight of filter and microalgae on final day 2 px dwt dw 0 time where dwt and dw0 are dry weight of biomass on final and initial day of the experiment the specific growth rate μ d 1 of scenedesmus sp was determined by using eq 3 38 3 μ ln x f ln x i t f t i where xf and xi are the final and initial dry biomass g m 2 at final tf and initial time ti d the doubling time td of scenedesmus sp was calculated by using a specific growth rate as given in eq 4 39 4 td ln 2 μ carbon content cc w w of microalgae cells at the end of the experiment was estimated using eq 5 through a method developed by adams et al 40 5 c c vs ts 1 8 where vs is volatile solids and ts is total solids the vs was measured through the gravimetric method carbon capture rate comprising both organic carbon from wastewater and atmospheric co2 was determined in g m 2 d 1 using eq 6 41 6 ccr c c p max as wastewater contain substantial amount of organic carbon which needs to be subtracted to calculate atmospheric co2 fixation since in the present study we did not measured total organic carbon toc removal from wastewater so if we suppose cod removal from wastewater is equivalent to total organic carbon toc then we can calculate atmospheric co2 fixation rate rco2 in g m 2 d 1 using eq 7 41 42 7 rco 2 ccr toc 0 toc 4 4 where toc0 and toc4 are total organic carbon from wastewater at days 0 and 4 of the experiment respectively 2 5 2 analysis of nutrient removal the nutrients measured in rww and wtww during 4 days of the treatment were nh4 n tkn no2 n po4 3 p and cod for analysis samples were collected daily and were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter paper all the analysis of nutrient

volume of the medium used t is the time for which experiment was run and as is the area of the substrate layer 2 5 3 statistical analysis all tests were performed in triplicate and results are presented in the form of mean with standard deviation statistical software origin 8 origin lab corporation usa was used to perform analysis of variance anova with a p value of 0 05 indicating statistical significance to further investigate variations among nutrient removal biomass lipid and pigment production the tukey test was used 2 6 lipids production the lipids were extracted via bligh and dyer method 44 for lipids estimation wet algal sample equivalent to 0 l g of dry biomass was added in falcon tube containing 2 1 methanol chloroform mixture these tubes were incubated at 37 c and 120 rpm for 24 h organic phase was separated and same procedure was repeated for remaining algal biomass after merging two organic phases 5 ml of chloroform and 9 ml of distilled water was added having final ratio of 2 2 1 8 v v v for methanol chloroform and water the chloroform layer containing lipids was separated by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min it was then evaporated by drying in the oven memmert unb 400 germany at 37 c followed by desiccation for 2 h the lipid content of scenedesmus sp was calculated by eq 11 45 11 lipid content weight of oil weight of raw material 100 the lipid production in mg m 2 and productivity in mg m 2 d 1 was estimated by eqs 12 and 13 respectively 45 12 lipid production lipid content microalgae dry weight 13 lipid productivity lipid production days 2 7 pigment production chlorophyll a b and carotenoids were extracted from 1 g wet algal biomass by using 100 acetone absorbance of extract was measured at 662 nm 645 nm and 470 nm using uv visible spectrophotometer t60uv britain respectively concentration of pigments in μg l 1 were measured by using eqs 14 15 and 16 46 14 chlorophyll a c a 11 75 a 662 2 350 a 645 15 chlorophyll b c b 18 61 a 645 3 960 a 662 16 carotenoids 1000 a 470 2 270 c a 81 4 c b 227 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of wastewater physicochemical characteristics of rww and wtww are presented in table 1 both rww and wtww were alkaline in nature having ph of 8 23 and 8 07 respectively the ec of 1 15 and 1 38 ms cm 1 in wastewaters might be due to heavy load of salts and pollutants 47 concentration of readily available nh4 n in rww and wtww was 47 and 14 mg l 1 nh4 n value in rww was in accordance with the range 20 70 mg l 1 estimated in different strength municipal wastewaters 48 however in wtww it was lower than that reported in literature this might be because it was removed by plants during its treatment in wetland 49 concentration of po4 3 p in rww was 2 98 times higher than wtww which is in agreement to values of 5 20 mg l 1 reported in literature 50 however concentration of trace metal such as fe zn and mn was 14 4 23 68 and 58 8 higher in wtww compared to rww respectively this can be beneficial for stimulating growth of microalgae using wtww on horizontal tls in general physicochemical properties of rww and wtww indicated presence of essential macro and micro nutrients which can be utilized by microalgae for biomass production resulting in ecofriendly blue prints 3 2 biomass productivity and carbon capture rate on horizontal twin layer system fig 2a b depicts biomass production and productivity of scenedesmus sp using rww and wtww on horizontal tls biomass production in rww wastewater was higher than wtww which was 37 29 g m 2 higher nh4 n and po4 3 p concentration in rww resulted in higher biomass production compared to wtww biomass productivity achieved by scenedesmus sp on horizontal tls was 5 32 and 4 75 g m 2 d 1 in rww and wtww respectively biomass production and productivity in rww and wtww was significantly different at p 0 05 in rww biomass production and productivity was enhanced by 11 compared to wtww the biomass productivity in the present study was 3 54 times higher than 1 5 g m 2 d 1 obtained during cultivation of tetraselmis by using modified f 2 medium on vertical twin layer photobioreactor 29 however biomass productivity of 6 3 g m 2 d 1 obtained during application of prototype scale vertical twin layer system for treatment of municipal wastewater using halochlorella rubescens was 0 85 times higher than present study 32 the reason for lower productivity compared to above mentioned study might be replacement of wastewater with time providing more nutrients to microalgae for its growth which was not done in the present study carbon capture rate of scenedesmus sp during mixotrophic cultivation in rww and wtww on horizontal tls is shown in fig 2b carbon contents cc wt of scenedesmus sp cultivated on horizontal tls was 41 5 in the present work carbon capture rate comprising both atmospheric co2 and organic carbon from wastewater by scenedesmus sp were 2 27 and 1 97 g m 2 d 1 for rww and wtww respectively atmospheric co2 fixed by microalgae cultivated in rww and wtww was 0 03 and 0 029 g m 2 d 1 in mixotrophic conditions co2 fixation rate decreases as both organic carbon and co2 is utilized as part of the cell body 51 in present study no pure co2 was provided and microalgae was cultivated in mixotrophic mode therefore co2 fixation rate is negligible compared to organic carbon fixation from wastewater organic carbon fixation rate in rww and wtww increased by 2 24 and 1 94 g m 2 d 1 compared to atmospheric co2 fixation rate similarly gao et al 41 studied carbon fixation rate during mixotrophic cultivation of microalgae in a membrane photobioreactor using wastewater organic carbon and co2 fixation rate of 42 82 and 6 505 mg l 1 d 1 was achieved when initial carbon in wastewater was 163 73 mg c d 1 atmospheric co2 fixation rate increased by 17 33 in rww compared to wtww which was due to higher biomass productivity in rww 52 likewise dasan et al 53 reported that the co2 fixation rate decreased from 68 in the fresh medium to 25 in the spent medium due to a decrease in biomass productivity from 0 087 to 0 037 g l 1 d 1 when chlorella vulgaris was cultivated in a sequential flow bubble column photobioreactor using fresh and spent medium statistically significant difference was observed between carbon capture rate of rww and wtww by scenedesmus sp in another study guo et al 54 reported a co2 fixation rate of 8 75 g m 2 d 1 when scenedesmus obliquus fachb 13 immobilized on modified surface of nickel foam was cultivated using bg 11 medium which was supplemented with 10 co2 as a carbon source the co2 fixation rate reported in this study was higher than present study as no additional co2 was provided other than atmospheric concentrations 3 3 growth kinetics of scenedesmus sp on horizontal twin layer system growth kinetics of scenedesmus sp including specific growth rate and doubling time is demonstrated in fig 3 specific growth rate and doubling time are important parameters as they show rate at which biomass production increases higher specific growth rate and lower doubling time in rww was achieved by microalgae maximum specific growth rate of 0 29 d 1 was obtained in rww which is 6 89 higher than wtww doubling time was higher in wtww indicating that more time was taken by microalgae to get doubled leading to lower biomass productivity and specific growth rate higher nutrient concentration in rww favored increased specific growth rate and less doubling time 36 the specific growth rate of 0 29 and 0 27 d 1 in rww and wtww were higher than 0 26 d 1 reported for suspension culture of botryococcus sp cultivated in erlenmeyer flasks using domestic wastewater 55 doubling time for scenedesmus sp cultivated on horizontal tls in rww was 6 9 less than wtww both specific growth rate and doubling time in rww had p 0 05 having r2 of 0 95 indicating that it was significantly different from wtww 3 4 nutrient removal by scenedesmus sp on horizontal twin layer system 3 4 1 removal of nitrogenous compounds temporal variations in nitrogen species in the form of nh4 n tkn and no2 n during the growth of scenedesmus sp in rww and wtww on horizontal tls are shown in fig 4a b and c a linear decrease in concentration of nh4 n tkn and no2 n was observed over time in rww and wtww lower removal of 13 44 and 20 72 mg l 1 of nh4 n and tkn was obtained by scenedesmus sp in wtww decreased removal of nutrients in wtww can be attributed to less biomass production and difference in the initial nutrient concentration however higher no2 n removal of 1 22 mg l 1 was observed in wtww which is because wtww had 98 34 higher initial concentration of no2 n compared to rww highest removal of 42 and 47 75 mg l 1 for nh4 n and tkn was observed in rww which is statistically significant from removal of these nutrients in wtww p 0 05 higher nutrient concentration and oxidation of nitrogen species by bacteria might be the reason for increased mass removal in rww 56 removal of tkn and no2 n was slower compared to nh4 n by scenedesmus sp cultivated in rww and wtww this indicates the preference of microalgae towards nh4 n when cultivated on horizontal tls a similar trend was observed by rosli et al 57 when chlorella vulgaris was cultivated in n rich wastewater using polyurethane pu foam as support material in a fluidized bed bioreactor microalgae cultivated on pu preferred nh4 n for uptake over other forms of nitrogen such as no2 n and no3 n this is because nh4 n is already in the reduced form and microalgae require less energy for its transformation and uptake compared to oxidized forms of nitrogen fig 5a b and c represents removal capacity removal rate and removal efficiency of nh4 n tkn and no2 n high removal capacity and removal rate of nh4 n and tkn was obtained in rww compared to wtww however opposite trend was observed in case of removal efficiency increased removal efficiencies of 89 48 and 83 95 were obtained in wtww for nh4 n and tkn respectively highest removal capacity and removal rate of 1092 mg m 2 d 1 and 10 5 mg l 1 d 1 for nh4 n was obtained in rww shi et al 32 reported nutrient removal rate of 5 52 mg l 1 d 1 was obtained when halochlorella rubescens ccac 0126 was cultivated on vertical twin layer photo bioreactor using bio phosphorous tank municipal wastewater this removal rate was lower than 10 5 mg l 1 d 1 of nh4 n removed in the present study which might be due to fluctuating light intensity from 22 to 200 μmol m 2 s 1 much higher tkn removal capacity of 2300 mg m 2 d 1 was reported using conveyor belt like flexible materials on revolving algal biofilm rab reactor for the treatment of municipal wastewater 58 the reason for high removal capacity was because the rab system was operated in semi continuous mode with surface area of 43 5 m2 which was 1933 folds higher than area used for treatment of wastewater in the present study 3 4 2 phosphate phosphorous removal fig 4d demonstrate po4 3 p removal in rww and wtww over time on horizontal tls concentration of po4 3 p decreases with time in both wastewater the maximum removal of 4 18 mg l 1 was obtained in rww which was 65 13 higher than wtww removal of po4 3 p in rww was significantly different in comparison to wtww with p 0 05 highest removal of po4 3 p observed in rww is due to increased biomass productivity 59 another possible reason might be increased precipitation of po4 3 p in rww with ca and mg ion 60 removal capacity removal rate and removal efficiency of po4 3 p is presented in fig 5a b and c removal capacity of 104 61 and 36 26 mg m 2 d 1 in rww and wtww was reaped by scenedesmus sp respectively when cultivated on horizontal tls yu et al 43 reported po4 3 p removal capacity of 140 mg m 2 d 1 by scenedesmus sp cultivated on inclined algal biofilm reactor using anaerobically digested effluent diluted with seawater it was 1 34 times higher than removal capacity attained in the present study which might be due to increase complexity of the effluent used in that study highest po4 3 p removal rate of 1 04 mg l 1 d 1 was obtained by scenedesmus sp cultivated in rww su et al 61 reported that scenedesmus rubescens when cultivated in effluent of secondary clarifier showed removal rate of 0 76 mg l 1 d 1 which was 1 37 times lower than present study this might be due to less light intensity of 129 μmol m 2 s 1 used in the study resulting in lower biomass production and removal rate of po4 3 p removal capacity and removal rate of po4 3 p was increased by 65 compared to wtww however removal efficiency of phosphate phosphorous was 3 55 higher in wtww compared to rww this can be due to lower concentration leading to increased removal efficiency in wtww table 2 shows comparison of current horizontal tls based on buckram membrane and kraft paper in terms of nutrient removal and biomass productivity with other studies which depicts feasibility of treating rww and wtww 3 4 3 cod removal removal of cod in rww and wtww over time by scenedesmus sp on horizontal tls is depicted in fig 4e cod concentration decreased in both rww and wtww with time however decrease in cod concentration was slow compared to other macronutrients maximum removal of 137 46 mg l 1 was achieved in rww which is 14 77 higher than wtww cod removal capacity removal rate and removal efficiency is presented in fig 5a b and c removal efficiency of 29 91 and 39 49 was obtained in rww and wtww respectively su et al 62 obtained removal efficiency of 90 by growing microalgae with different ratios of activated sludge in another study amini et al 63 reported 77 removal of cod by cultivating chlorella vulgaris in municipal wastewater lower removal efficiencies in the present study might be attributed to lack of organic carbon decomposition 62 higher cod removal capacity and removal rate was observed in rww which was 3436 62 mg m 2 d 1 and 34 36 mg l 1 d 1 respectively the removal rate and capacity of cod increased by 14 77 in rww compared to wtww however much higher removal capacity of 20 750 mg m 2 d 1 was obtained by growing microalgae in vertical algal biofilm raceway pond using synthetic municipal wastewater 64 lower removal capacity of cod in the present study might be because scenedesmus sp also utilized atmospheric co2 and favored both autotrophic and heterotrophic mode of growth 65 comparison of the quality characteristics of treated rww and wtww produced by the horizontal tls with the limit values suggested by national environmental quality standards neqs set by the pakistan government 66 and eu directive 91 271 67 for wastewater disposal to the aquatic environment is shown in table 3 microalgae efficiently utilized nitrogen and phosphorous as macronutrients for their growth and decreased their concentration in wastewater therefore nutrients such as nh4 n tkn no2 n and po4 3 p in treated rww and wtww meet the standards of the neqs and eu legislation however observed concentrations of cod in treated rww and wtww did not meet the discharge limits set by neqs and eu legislation therefore rww and wtww effluent cannot be discharged directly into the aquatic environment without further treatment to meet the discharge limits experiment of wastewater treatment by microalgae on horizontal tls can be run for a longer time as neqs and eu directive 91 271 regulations also set limit values for pathogens disinfection should be applied to the treated effluent before its discharge or reuse 3 5 lipids and pigment production lipid content of scenedesmus sp cultivated in rww and wtww is shown in fig 6a biomass cultivated in rww and wtww had lipid content of 17 5 and 16 4 respectively lipid content in rww was 1 06 folds higher than wtww lower lipid content in wtww was due to less biomass production compared to rww increased biomass production leads to high lipid yield in microalgae 68 similar results were reported by zhang et al 69 having lipid content in the range of 12 52 to 19 83 however much higher lipid content of 60 could be achieved under nutrient stress conditions and by optimizing algal strain selection 70 nutrient deficiency could stimulate accumulation of more lipids than the usual yield in attached growth algal biomass 71 lipid production and productivities of harvested algal biomass in rww and wtww treatment are depicted in fig 6b maximum lipid production and productivity of 6 52 g m 2 and 0 93 g m 2 d 1 was achieved by scenedesmus sp in rww tukey test showed significant difference in lipid content production and productivity among rww and wtww at p 0 05 lipid production and productivity increased by 16 47 in rww compared to wtww higher lipid content of 52 71 was achieved by scenedesmus sp when cultivated on inclined algal biofilm reactor using anaerobically digested kitchen effluent 43 such high content was achieved by stress conditions caused by addition of phytohormones in the effluent however no stress conditions due to nutrient depletion or any other factor occurred in the present study leading to lower lipid content important pigment for estimating photosynthetic efficiency and microalgal growth is chlorophyll total chlorophyll content consisting of chlorophyll a chl a and chlorophyll b chl b increases with increase in biomass production as depicted in fig 7 the initial concentration of total chlorophyll content was 60 μg g 1 and reached a maximum of 140 14 μg g 1 chl a 108 65 chl b 27 87 μg g 1 in scenedesmus sp by the end of the treatment period of rww the increase in chlorophyll content was due to uptake of nutrients and soluble organic fractions of rww and wtww 72 chlorophyll content in rww was enhanced by 4 48 compared to wtww highest carotenoid content of 52 76 μg g 1 was attained by scenedesmus sp in rww which was 1 01 folds higher compared to wtww prominent role in the accumulation of chlorophyll is played by atp and nadph which also catalyse co2 fixation resulting in production of secondary metabolite like carotenoids they play vital role in protecting microalgae by preventing membrane lipid peroxidation under stress conditions the increase in the pigment concentration results in improved photosynthetic activity due to the transmission of the absorbed light and conversion into biomass 73 3 6 future implications outstanding performance of the scenedesmus sp was achieved in the horizontal tls with rww and wtww demonstrating the feasibility of the algal biofilm technology for the treatment of municipal wastewater at a large scale based on the results of present study the average nutrient removal could be about 1 69 103 1 88 103 1 75 102 kg ha year of nh4 n tkn and po4 3 p respectively the quantity of produced biomass and lipids is estimated to be 1 94 103 and 3 42 103 kg ha year however these are theoretical values that are calculated based on the results of lab scale study which can differ in reality due to variations in wastewater characteristics and operational conditions the biomass produced on large scale will be rich in nutrients and can be used as a fertilizer after extraction of lipids for biofuel production as revealed in this study higher nutrient concentration does not necessarily increase microalgal biomass productivity exponentially in the present study nh4 n in rww was 70 21 higher than wtww however biomass in rww increased by10 28 compared to wtww therefore future studies can be conducted on maintaining balance between residual pollutants concentration in the municipal wastewater and microalgae production so that cost effective microalgae cultivation can be completed without risking the water environment the lipid content in the present study was lower as experiment was completed when maximum nutrients were removed from rww and wtww in order to enhance lipid content of the microalgae for biofuel production duration of experiment can be increased resulting in nutrient stress conditions and enhancing lipid production use of horizontal tls for municipal wastewater treatment is a win win approach which can not only efficiently treat wastewater and recover nutrients but also produce biomass for pigment lipid protein and carbohydrate production 4 conclusion horizontal tls showed significant treatment efficiency of real wastewater and resulted in the production of biomass and accumulation of lipids novel and low cost buckram membrane and kraft paper on horizontal tls as source and substrate layer respectively were effectively utilized the maximum biomass and lipid production of 37 29 and 6 53 g m 2 was achieved in rww respectively nutrient removal of ammonium total kjeldhal nitrogen inorganic phosphate and chemical oxygen demand was 89 48 78 91 82 24 and 29 91 in rww respectively overall this study confirmed the potential of horizontal tls for carbon capture biomass and lipid production and effective nutrient recovery from real wastewater declaration of

12964,microalgae have promising applications in wastewater treatment due to their ability to use nitrogen phosphorous and organic carbon as nutrients for the production of valuable biomass and lipids among attached cultivation systems twin layer is a technology in which most of the research has been conducted using synthetic wastewater for microalgae growth and biofuel production moreover source and substrate layers used in twin layer technology are costly limiting its widespread application in the present study potential of horizontal twin layer system tls was assessed for treatment of non sterilized real wastewater and microalgae production moreover novel and cost effective buckram membrane and kraft paper were used as source and substrate layers respectively results indicated that biomass productivity of scenedesmus sp was 5 32 and 4 76 g m 2 d 1 in raw municipal rww and wetland treated municipal wastewater wtww respectively specific growth rate of 0 29 d 1 and carbon capture rate of 2 27 g m 2 d 1 was achieved in rww the maximum removal capacity of nh4 n tkn cod and po4 3 p was 1050 1194 3437 and 105 mg m 2 d 1 respectively in rww lipid biosynthesis was also higher in rww with enhanced productivity of 0 93 g m 2 d 1 compared to 0 78 g m 2 d 1 in wtww the findings of this study demonstrate the feasibility of using horizontal tls for efficient recovery of nutrients from wastewater via algal based lipid production graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords horizontal twin layer system real wastewater treatment nutrient recovery biomass and lipids production carbon capture 1 introduction freshwater is essential for economic and societal development of human beings water demand in many countries is increasing due to continuous improvement in living standards population increase and economic growth 1 by 2030 nearly half of the world population will be facing water shortage developing countries like pakistan will be facing severe water scarcity as compared to developed countries 2 water availability in pakistan has drastically reduced compared to 1299 m3 capita in 1996 97 by 2025 it is predicted to be 700 m3 capita which is less than international standard of 1500 m3 capita 3 wastewater generated in pakistan should be treated and reused to overcome water scarcity and shortage in pakistan municipal sector contributes 3 06 billion m3of the total wastewater generation which is 4 43 billion m3 4 municipal wastewater mw when discharged untreated results in air water and soil pollution treatment of mw is very important before its final disposal 5 different conventional treatment methods such as suspended or attached growth of mixed bacterial cultures activated sludge systems moving bed biofilm reactors trickling filters are often used to treat mw these methods ensure that major contaminants such as nitrogen phosphorus and organic matter are effectively removed and treated wastewater is safely disposed of or reused they do however have high energy consumption operational cost and sludge production as well as making a significant impact to global warming through increasing on site and off site greenhouse gas emissions as a result over the last decade a lot of research has been done for developing alternative cost effective techniques for mw treatment microalgae cultivation has received a lot of attention as an alternative solution due to their capability of sustainable wastewater treatment co2 capture and ecofriendly biofuel production 6 8 cultivation of microalgae in mw medium can simultaneously produce biomass for biofuel production and remove nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous by utilizing them as macronutrients for their growth and maintenance of photosynthetic metabolism 9 10 open ponds and closed photo bioreactors have been used for wastewater treatment using microalgae over the past few decades 11 14 large scale application of these systems is limited due to slow biomass production high energy cost of harvesting enhanced space requirement and ease of contamination 15 the attached cultivation of microalgae is a promising technology to avoid these problems 16 18 it is the growth of microalgae on the surface of the substrate in the form of biofilm which can be harvested by scraping since no separation of algal biomass from wastewater is required 19 as a result the biomass produced is more concentrated compared to the conventional suspension system which contains 99 water and 1 microalgae energy requirement for dewatering of microalgae is significantly decreased by 99 7 in attached cultivation compared to suspended systems 20 higher biomass productivity is obtained in biofilm systems due to better light availability enhancing the photosynthetic efficiency 21 22 additional benefits of attached cultivation of microalgae include less water consumption increased efficiency of co2 o2 exchange small space requirement and enhanced wastewater treatment 20 wastewater treatment systems based on algal biofilms have been commonly used and some common examples are revolving algal biofilm reactor 23 algal turf scrubber 24 and flat plate algal biofilm reactor 25 detachment of algal cells is frequently faced in these systems because nutrients are distributed by a constant or intermittent flow of liquid over biofilm surface moreover flow of wastewater medium over biofilm surface causes contamination in some biofilm systems 26 twin layer is a cell immobilization technique in which water is fully excluded from the biofilm surface thus microalgae cannot be contaminated by pollutants or microorganisms in twin layer system tls microalgae is immobilized on microporous substrate layer under the substrate layer macroporous second layer known as source layer is present which provides the wastewater or nutrient media 27 tls has been operated in two orientations vertical and horizontal 28 31 vertical tls has previously been used for treatment of wastewater shi et al 27 studied treatment of synthetic wastewater using protran reinforced nitrocellulose membrane and glass fibre fleece as source and substrate layer respectively no contamination and loss of microalgal cells was reported during the experiment phosphate and ammonium nitrogen was removed 91 and 96 respectively by scenedesmus rubescens in another study prototype scale vertical twin layer photobioreactor was studied for efficient removal of nitrogen and phosphorous from real municipal wastewater halochlorella rubescens was immobilized on nylon fibre membrane and municipal wastewater was supplied by reinforced glass fibre mesh the removal of phosphate phosphorous and ammonium nitrogen from secondary wastewater was 78 9 and 100 while the initial concentration was 3 81 and 11 10 mg l 1 respectively 32 in vertical tls wastewater medium is not equally distributed among source and substrate layer reducing the overall efficiency of wastewater treatment and biomass production however this problem of vertical tls can be overcome by horizontal tls potential of horizontal tls was studied by zhang et al 31 for the production of biomass and astaxanthin using bg 11 nutrient media maximum biomass and astaxanthin production of 6 6 g m 2 d 1 and 160 mg m 2 d 1 was reported using 100 μmol m 2 s 1 light intensity similarly do et al 33 evaluated production of astaxanthin in h pluvialis strain ccac0125 using bg 11medium on angled twin layer porous substrate bioreactor in another study ettlia sp yc001 was cultivated on horizontal twin layer system for lipid production using bg 11 nutrient medium the maximum lipid productivity of 4 2 g m 2 d 1 was achieved with 7 co2 at 500 μe m 2 s 1 light intensity 34 however no study to date has evaluated the performance of horizontal tls for treatment of real wastewater moreover in all the studies conducted on horizontal tls source layer used were filter paper glass fibre non woven and glass fibre mesh while substrate layer used were either nitrate cellulose nylon membrane cellulose acetate or nitrocellulose membrane 31 33 34 huge cost of us 2 us 5 per square meter associated with these source and substrate layers makes large scale application of this system difficult 26 the current study uses novel cost effective and ecofriendly buckram membrane and kraft paper as source and substrate layer respectively for the treatment of real raw municipal wastewater rww and wetland treated municipal wastewater wtww the main objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the potential of horizontal tls for real wastewater remediation and nutrient recovery 2 to evaluate effect of rww and wtww on production of biomass lipid and pigments of scenedesmus sp moreover growth kinetic parameters of biomass productivity specific growth rate and doubling time of scenedesmus sp were also studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgal strain and culture conditions niva chl 99 scenedesmus sp used in this study was obtained from

sufficient algal biomass for immobilization and use in wastewater treatment cultures were added to 500 ml aerated flasks after 2 3 weeks of algal growth the cultures were transferred to 2 l flasks incubated at a light intensity of 75 μmol m 2 s 1 supplied with bench air filtered through 0 22 μm cellulose acetate syringe filters 2 2 wastewater collection rww and wtww was collected in 6 l plastic bottles directly from the inlet of wastewater treatment plant and outlet of wetland treatment facility at national university of sciences and technology nust islamabad respectively rww and wtww were filtered through 1 μm whatman filter paper and stored at 4 c before characterization and use in further experimentation both wastewater were characterised for their ph electrical conductivity ec

phosphorous po4 3 p and chemical oxygen demand cod were also measured by standard methods 37 2 3 experimental set up for horizontal twin layer system fig 1 shows laboratory scale set up of horizontal tls it was made up of polymethyl methacrylate pmma chamber having a length width height of 90 cm 66 cm 12 cm it is further divided into four inner channels each channel is a multilayered structure that consists of from bottom to top pmma base a source layer of buckram membrane 79 92 g m 2 and a top substrate layer of kraft paper 60 g m 2 with immobilized algae forming algal disk to form an algal disk algal cells were immobilized on kraft paper by filtration using vacuum filtration assembly the inoculated area of kraft paper was 0 00125 m2 per disk at an initial microalgae dry weight density of 5 g m 2 a total of 20 algal disks were placed on top of the buckram membrane for each channel horizontal tls was tilted at 15 along the horizontal axis so that the culture medium supplied at the top of each channel could flow down by gravity in this way wastewater was equally distributed to both buckram membrane and algal disks five 12 w led lamps producing cool and white light were placed on the top of each channel photosynthetic flux density of 200 μmol m 2 s 1 at each algal disk was measured through quantum sensor apogee quantum sensor mq 500 usa all four channels were supplied with atmospheric carbon dioxide using an air pump through a gas hole present at the side of the pmma chamber all the experiments were run under ambient conditions 2 4 horizontal twin layer system performance for wastewater treatment rww and wtww were used to evaluate the performance of horizontal tls in terms of nutrient removal biomass lipids and pigment production before wastewater treatment immobilized algae on kraft paper was acclimatized for 3 days on horizontal tls using z8 medium after acclimatization phase 2 l rww and wtww was supplied with the help of peristaltic pump lead 15 48 china at the flow rate of 3 ml min 1 for 4 days the system was operated continuously by recirculating both wastewater without the addition of fresh medium throughout the treatment period 100 ml of wastewater was sampled daily from the flasks after proper mixing sampled wastewater was filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filters and analysed for nh4 n tkn no2 n po4 3 p and cod respectively 2 5 analysis and calculations 2 5 1 dry biomass of scenedesmus sp and growth kinetics scenedemsus sp dry biomass was measured on horizontal tls in terms of biomass production and productivity briefly at the end of each experiment kraft paper with algal biofilm was harvested and dried at 105 c for 12 h biomass production p in g m 2 and biomass productivity px in g m 2 d 1 were determined by eqs 1 and 2 respectively 31 1 p dw 2 dw 1 footprint area where dw1 is dry weight of kraft paper alone and dw2 is dry weight of filter and microalgae on final day 2 px dwt dw 0 time where dwt and dw0 are dry weight of biomass on final and initial day of the experiment the specific growth rate μ d 1 of scenedesmus sp was determined by using eq 3 38 3 μ ln x f ln x i t f t i where xf and

carbon content cc w w of microalgae cells at the end of the experiment was estimated using eq 5 through a method developed by adams et al 40 5 c c vs ts 1 8 where vs is volatile solids and ts is total solids the vs was measured through the gravimetric method carbon capture rate comprising both organic carbon from wastewater and atmospheric co2 was determined in g m 2 d 1 using eq 6 41 6 ccr c c p max as wastewater contain substantial amount of organic carbon which needs to be subtracted to calculate atmospheric co2 fixation since in the present study we did not measured total organic carbon toc removal from wastewater so if we suppose cod removal from wastewater is equivalent to total organic carbon toc then we can calculate atmospheric co2 fixation rate rco2 in g m 2 d 1 using eq 7 41 42 7 rco 2 ccr toc 0 toc 4 4 where toc0 and toc4 are total organic carbon from wastewater at days 0 and 4 of the experiment respectively 2 5 2 analysis of nutrient removal the nutrients measured in rww and wtww during 4 days of the treatment were nh4 n tkn no2 n po4 3 p and cod for analysis samples were collected daily and were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter paper all the analysis of nutrient

volume of the medium used t is the time for which experiment was run and as is the area of the substrate layer 2 5 3 statistical analysis all tests were performed in triplicate and results are presented in the form of mean with standard deviation statistical software origin 8 origin lab corporation usa was used to perform analysis of variance anova with a p value of 0 05 indicating statistical significance to further investigate variations among nutrient removal biomass lipid and pigment production the tukey test was used 2 6 lipids production the lipids were extracted via bligh and dyer method 44 for lipids estimation wet algal sample equivalent to 0 l g of dry biomass was added in falcon tube containing 2 1 methanol chloroform mixture these tubes were incubated at 37 c and 120 rpm for 24 h organic phase was separated and same procedure was repeated for remaining algal biomass after merging two organic phases 5 ml of chloroform and 9 ml of distilled water was added having final ratio of 2 2 1 8 v v v for methanol chloroform and water the chloroform layer containing lipids was separated by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min it was then evaporated by drying in the oven memmert unb 400 germany at 37 c followed by desiccation for 2 h the lipid content of scenedesmus sp was calculated by eq 11 45 11 lipid content weight of oil weight of raw material 100 the lipid production in mg m 2 and productivity in mg m 2 d 1 was estimated by eqs 12 and 13 respectively 45 12 lipid production lipid content microalgae dry weight 13 lipid productivity lipid production days 2 7 pigment production chlorophyll a b and carotenoids were extracted from 1 g wet algal biomass by using 100 acetone absorbance of extract was measured at 662 nm 645 nm and 470 nm using uv visible spectrophotometer t60uv britain respectively concentration of pigments in μg l 1 were measured by using eqs 14 15 and 16 46 14 chlorophyll a c a 11 75 a 662 2 350 a 645 15 chlorophyll b c b 18 61 a 645 3 960 a 662 16 carotenoids 1000 a 470 2 270 c a 81 4 c b 227 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of wastewater physicochemical characteristics of rww and wtww are presented in table 1 both rww and wtww were alkaline in nature having ph of 8 23 and 8 07 respectively the ec of 1 15 and 1 38 ms cm 1 in wastewaters might be due to heavy load of salts and pollutants 47 concentration of readily available nh4 n in rww and wtww was 47 and 14 mg l 1 nh4 n value in rww was in accordance with the range 20 70 mg l 1 estimated in different strength municipal wastewaters 48 however in wtww it was lower than that reported in literature this might be because it was removed by plants during its treatment in wetland 49 concentration of po4 3 p in rww was 2 98 times higher than wtww which is in agreement to values of 5 20 mg l 1 reported in literature 50 however concentration of trace metal such as fe zn and mn was 14 4 23 68 and 58 8 higher in wtww compared to rww respectively this can be beneficial for stimulating growth of microalgae using wtww on horizontal tls in general physicochemical properties of rww and wtww indicated presence of essential macro and micro nutrients which can be utilized by microalgae for biomass production resulting in ecofriendly blue prints 3 2 biomass productivity and carbon capture rate on horizontal twin layer system fig 2a b depicts biomass production and productivity of scenedesmus sp using rww and wtww on horizontal tls biomass production in rww wastewater was higher than wtww which was 37 29 g m 2 higher nh4 n and po4 3 p concentration in rww resulted in higher biomass production compared to wtww biomass productivity achieved by scenedesmus sp on horizontal tls was 5 32 and 4 75 g m 2 d 1 in rww and wtww respectively biomass production and productivity in rww and wtww was significantly different at p 0 05 in rww biomass production and productivity was enhanced by 11 compared to wtww the biomass productivity in the present study was 3 54 times higher than 1 5 g m 2 d 1 obtained during cultivation of tetraselmis by using modified f 2 medium on vertical twin layer photobioreactor 29 however biomass productivity of 6 3 g m 2 d 1 obtained during application of prototype scale vertical twin layer system for treatment of municipal wastewater using halochlorella rubescens was 0 85 times higher than present study 32 the reason for lower productivity compared to above mentioned study might be replacement of wastewater with time providing more nutrients to microalgae for its growth which was not done in the present study carbon capture rate of scenedesmus sp during mixotrophic cultivation in rww and wtww on horizontal tls is shown in fig 2b carbon contents cc wt of scenedesmus sp cultivated on horizontal tls was 41 5 in the present work carbon capture rate comprising both atmospheric co2 and organic carbon from wastewater by scenedesmus sp were 2 27 and 1 97 g m 2 d 1 for rww and wtww respectively atmospheric co2 fixed by microalgae cultivated in rww and wtww was 0 03 and 0 029 g m 2 d 1 in mixotrophic conditions co2 fixation rate decreases as both organic carbon and co2 is utilized as part of the cell body 51 in present study no pure co2 was provided and microalgae was cultivated in mixotrophic mode therefore co2 fixation rate is negligible compared to organic carbon fixation from wastewater organic carbon fixation rate in rww and wtww increased by 2 24 and 1 94 g m 2 d 1 compared to atmospheric co2 fixation rate similarly gao et al 41 studied carbon fixation rate during mixotrophic cultivation of microalgae in a membrane photobioreactor using wastewater organic carbon and co2 fixation rate of 42 82 and 6 505 mg l 1 d 1 was achieved when initial carbon in wastewater was 163 73 mg c d 1 atmospheric co2 fixation rate increased by 17 33 in rww compared to wtww which was due to higher biomass productivity in rww 52 likewise dasan et al 53 reported that the co2 fixation rate decreased from 68 in the fresh medium to 25 in the spent medium due to a decrease in biomass productivity from 0 087 to 0 037 g l 1 d 1 when chlorella vulgaris was cultivated in a sequential flow bubble column photobioreactor using fresh and spent medium statistically significant difference was observed between carbon capture rate of rww and wtww by scenedesmus sp in another study guo et al 54 reported a co2 fixation rate of 8 75 g m 2 d 1 when scenedesmus obliquus fachb 13 immobilized on modified surface of nickel foam was cultivated using bg 11 medium which was supplemented with 10 co2 as a carbon source the co2 fixation rate reported in this study was higher than present study as no additional co2 was provided other than atmospheric concentrations 3 3 growth kinetics of scenedesmus sp on horizontal twin layer system growth kinetics of scenedesmus sp including specific growth rate and doubling time is demonstrated in fig 3 specific growth rate and doubling time are important parameters as they show rate at which biomass production increases higher specific growth rate and lower doubling time in rww was achieved by microalgae maximum specific growth rate of 0 29 d 1 was obtained in rww which is 6 89 higher than wtww doubling time was higher in wtww indicating that more time was taken by microalgae to get doubled leading to lower biomass productivity and specific growth rate higher nutrient concentration in rww favored increased specific growth rate and less doubling time 36 the specific growth rate of 0 29 and 0 27 d 1 in rww and wtww were higher than 0 26 d 1 reported for suspension culture of botryococcus sp cultivated in erlenmeyer flasks using domestic wastewater 55 doubling time for scenedesmus sp cultivated on horizontal tls in rww was 6 9 less than wtww both specific growth rate and doubling time in rww had p 0 05 having r2 of 0 95 indicating that it was significantly different from wtww 3 4 nutrient removal by scenedesmus sp on horizontal twin layer system 3 4 1 removal of nitrogenous compounds temporal variations in nitrogen species in the form of nh4 n tkn and no2 n during the growth of scenedesmus sp in rww and wtww on horizontal tls are shown in fig 4a b and c a linear decrease in concentration of nh4 n tkn and no2 n was observed over time in rww and wtww lower removal of 13 44 and 20 72 mg l 1 of nh4 n and tkn was obtained by scenedesmus sp in wtww decreased removal of nutrients in wtww can be attributed to less biomass production and difference in the initial nutrient concentration however higher no2 n removal of 1 22 mg l 1 was observed in wtww which is because wtww had 98 34 higher initial concentration of no2 n compared to rww highest removal of 42 and 47 75 mg l 1 for nh4 n and tkn was observed in rww which is statistically significant from removal of these nutrients in wtww p 0 05 higher nutrient concentration and oxidation of nitrogen species by bacteria might be the reason for increased mass removal in rww 56 removal of tkn and no2 n was slower compared to nh4 n by scenedesmus sp cultivated in rww and wtww this indicates the preference of microalgae towards nh4 n when cultivated on horizontal tls a similar trend was observed by rosli et al 57 when chlorella vulgaris was cultivated in n rich wastewater using polyurethane pu foam as support material in a fluidized bed bioreactor microalgae cultivated on pu preferred nh4 n for uptake over other forms of nitrogen such as no2 n and no3 n this is because nh4 n is already in the reduced form and microalgae require less energy for its transformation and uptake compared to oxidized forms of nitrogen fig 5a b and c represents removal capacity removal rate and removal efficiency of nh4 n tkn and no2 n high removal capacity and removal rate of nh4 n and tkn was obtained in rww compared to wtww however opposite trend was observed in case of removal efficiency increased removal efficiencies of 89 48 and 83 95 were obtained in wtww for nh4 n and tkn respectively highest removal capacity and removal rate of 1092 mg m 2 d 1 and 10 5 mg l 1 d 1 for nh4 n was obtained in rww shi et al 32 reported nutrient removal rate of 5 52 mg l 1 d 1 was obtained when halochlorella rubescens ccac 0126 was cultivated on vertical twin layer photo bioreactor using bio phosphorous tank municipal wastewater this removal rate was lower than 10 5 mg l 1 d 1 of nh4 n removed in the present study which might be due to fluctuating light intensity from 22 to 200 μmol m 2 s 1 much higher tkn removal capacity of 2300 mg m 2 d 1 was reported using conveyor belt like flexible materials on revolving algal biofilm rab reactor for the treatment of municipal wastewater 58 the reason for high removal capacity was because the rab system was operated in semi continuous mode with surface area of 43 5 m2 which was 1933 folds higher than area used for treatment of wastewater in the present study 3 4 2 phosphate phosphorous removal fig 4d demonstrate po4 3 p removal in rww and wtww over time on horizontal tls concentration of po4 3 p decreases with time in both wastewater the maximum removal of 4 18 mg l 1 was obtained in rww which was 65 13 higher than wtww removal of po4 3 p in rww was significantly different in comparison to wtww with p 0 05 highest removal of po4 3 p observed in rww is due to increased biomass productivity 59 another possible reason might be increased precipitation of po4 3 p in rww with ca and mg ion 60 removal capacity removal rate and removal efficiency of po4 3 p is presented in fig 5a b and c removal capacity of 104 61 and 36 26 mg m 2 d 1 in rww and wtww was reaped by scenedesmus sp respectively when cultivated on horizontal tls yu et al 43 reported po4 3 p removal capacity of 140 mg m 2 d 1 by scenedesmus sp cultivated on inclined algal biofilm reactor using anaerobically digested effluent diluted with seawater it was 1 34 times higher than removal capacity attained in the present study which might be due to increase complexity of the effluent used in that study highest po4 3 p removal rate of 1 04 mg l 1 d 1 was obtained by scenedesmus sp cultivated in rww su et al 61 reported that scenedesmus rubescens when cultivated in effluent of secondary clarifier showed removal rate of 0 76 mg l 1 d 1 which was 1 37 times lower than present study this might be due to less light intensity of 129 μmol m 2 s 1 used in the study resulting in lower biomass production and removal rate of po4 3 p removal capacity and removal rate of po4 3 p was increased by 65 compared to wtww however removal efficiency of phosphate phosphorous was 3 55 higher in wtww compared to rww this can be due to lower concentration leading to increased removal efficiency in wtww table 2 shows comparison of current horizontal tls based on buckram membrane and kraft paper in terms of nutrient removal and biomass productivity with other studies which depicts feasibility of treating rww and wtww 3 4 3 cod removal removal of cod in rww and wtww over time by scenedesmus sp on horizontal tls is depicted in fig 4e cod concentration decreased in both rww and wtww with time however decrease in cod concentration was slow compared to other macronutrients maximum removal of 137 46 mg l 1 was achieved in rww which is 14 77 higher than wtww cod removal capacity removal rate and removal efficiency is presented in fig 5a b and c removal efficiency of 29 91 and 39 49 was obtained in rww and wtww respectively su et al 62 obtained removal efficiency of 90 by growing microalgae with different ratios of activated sludge in another study amini et al 63 reported 77 removal of cod by cultivating chlorella vulgaris in municipal wastewater lower removal efficiencies in the present study might be attributed to lack of organic carbon decomposition 62 higher cod removal capacity and removal rate was observed in rww which was 3436 62 mg m 2 d 1 and 34 36 mg l 1 d 1 respectively the removal rate and capacity of cod increased by 14 77 in rww compared to wtww however much higher removal capacity of 20 750 mg m 2 d 1 was obtained by growing microalgae in vertical algal biofilm raceway pond using synthetic municipal wastewater 64 lower removal capacity of cod in the present study might be because scenedesmus sp also utilized atmospheric co2 and favored both autotrophic and heterotrophic mode of growth 65 comparison of the quality characteristics of treated rww and wtww produced by the horizontal tls with the limit values suggested by national environmental quality standards neqs set by the pakistan government 66 and eu directive 91 271 67 for wastewater disposal to the aquatic environment is shown in table 3 microalgae efficiently utilized nitrogen and phosphorous as macronutrients for their growth and decreased their concentration in wastewater therefore nutrients such as nh4 n tkn no2 n and po4 3 p in treated rww and wtww meet the standards of the neqs and eu legislation however observed concentrations of cod in treated rww and wtww did not meet the discharge limits set by neqs and eu legislation therefore rww and wtww effluent cannot be discharged directly into the aquatic environment without further treatment to meet the discharge limits experiment of wastewater treatment by microalgae on horizontal tls can be run for a longer time as neqs and eu directive 91 271 regulations also set limit values for pathogens disinfection should be applied to the treated effluent before its discharge or reuse 3 5 lipids and pigment production lipid content of scenedesmus sp cultivated in rww and wtww is shown in fig 6a biomass cultivated in rww and wtww had lipid content of 17 5 and 16 4 respectively lipid content in rww was 1 06 folds higher than wtww lower lipid content in wtww was due to less biomass production compared to rww increased biomass production leads to high lipid yield in microalgae 68 similar results were reported by zhang et al 69 having lipid content in the range of 12 52 to 19 83 however much higher lipid content of 60 could be achieved under nutrient stress conditions and by optimizing algal strain selection 70 nutrient deficiency could stimulate accumulation of more lipids than the usual yield in attached growth algal biomass 71 lipid production and productivities of harvested algal biomass in rww and wtww treatment are depicted in fig 6b maximum lipid production and productivity of 6 52 g m 2 and 0 93 g m 2 d 1 was achieved by scenedesmus sp in rww tukey test showed significant difference in lipid content production and productivity among rww and wtww at p 0 05 lipid production and productivity increased by 16 47 in rww compared to wtww higher lipid content of 52 71 was achieved by scenedesmus sp when cultivated on inclined algal biofilm reactor using anaerobically digested kitchen effluent 43 such high content was achieved by stress conditions caused by addition of phytohormones in the effluent however no stress conditions due to nutrient depletion or any other factor occurred in the present study leading to lower lipid content important pigment for estimating photosynthetic efficiency and microalgal growth is chlorophyll total chlorophyll content consisting of chlorophyll a chl a and chlorophyll b chl b increases with increase in biomass production as depicted in fig 7 the initial concentration of total chlorophyll content was 60 μg g 1 and reached a maximum of 140 14 μg g 1 chl a 108 65 chl b 27 87 μg g 1 in scenedesmus sp by the end of the treatment period of rww the increase in chlorophyll content was due to uptake of nutrients and soluble organic fractions of rww and wtww 72 chlorophyll content in rww was enhanced by 4 48 compared to wtww highest carotenoid content of 52 76 μg g 1 was attained by scenedesmus sp in rww which was 1 01 folds higher compared to wtww prominent role in the accumulation of chlorophyll is played by atp and nadph which also catalyse co2 fixation resulting in production of secondary metabolite like carotenoids they play vital role in protecting microalgae by preventing membrane lipid peroxidation under stress conditions the increase in the pigment concentration results in improved photosynthetic activity due to the transmission of the absorbed light and conversion into biomass 73 3 6 future implications outstanding performance of the scenedesmus sp was achieved in the horizontal tls with rww and wtww demonstrating the feasibility of the algal biofilm technology for the treatment of municipal wastewater at a large scale based on the results of present study the average nutrient removal could be about 1 69 103 1 88 103 1 75 102 kg ha year of nh4 n tkn and po4 3 p respectively the quantity of produced biomass and lipids is estimated to be 1 94 103 and 3 42 103 kg ha year however these are theoretical values that are calculated based on the results of lab scale study which can differ in reality due to variations in wastewater characteristics and operational conditions the biomass produced on large scale will be rich in nutrients and can be used as a fertilizer after extraction of lipids for biofuel production as revealed in this study higher nutrient concentration does not necessarily increase microalgal biomass productivity exponentially in the present study nh4 n in rww was 70 21 higher than wtww however biomass in rww increased by10 28 compared to wtww therefore future studies can be conducted on maintaining balance between residual pollutants concentration in the municipal wastewater and microalgae production so that cost effective microalgae cultivation can be completed without risking the water environment the lipid content in the present study was lower as experiment was completed when maximum nutrients were removed from rww and wtww in order to enhance lipid content of the microalgae for biofuel production duration of experiment can be increased resulting in nutrient stress conditions and enhancing lipid production use of horizontal tls for municipal wastewater treatment is a win win approach which can not only efficiently treat wastewater and recover nutrients but also produce biomass for pigment lipid protein and carbohydrate production 4 conclusion horizontal tls showed significant treatment efficiency of real wastewater and resulted in the production of biomass and accumulation of lipids novel and low cost buckram membrane and kraft paper on horizontal tls as source and substrate layer respectively were effectively utilized the maximum biomass and lipid production of 37 29 and 6 53 g m 2 was achieved in rww respectively nutrient removal of ammonium total kjeldhal nitrogen inorganic phosphate and chemical oxygen demand was 89 48 78 91 82 24 and 29 91 in rww respectively overall this study confirmed the potential of horizontal tls for carbon capture biomass and lipid production and effective nutrient recovery from real wastewater declaration of
