21205,the ship domain is a concept commonly proposed as a safety assessment criterion in planning collision avoidance manoeuvres of a ship or its safe route the work presents authors methods for determining an effective ship domain based on tests using electronic chart display and information system ecdis simulator the tests were conducted on non autonomous real time models of ships steered by expert navigators domains were determined for ships of different sizes and speeds the ship domain was approximated to an ellipse the study covered absolute and relative domains the latter defined in ship length units the dependence of the domain shape and size on ship size and speed has been analysed and described the formulated analytical relationships enable us to determine the domain of a ship varying in size and speed keywords collision avoidance manoeuvres simulation research ship domain safety zone ship encounters collision risk restricted area ship speed 1 introduction the safety of navigation requires continuous analysis and assessment of navigational situation by shipboard navigational aids situational assessment is aimed to detect a dangerous situation and involves the determination of a navigational safety level situations at sea should be analysed and assessed by using specific criteria those commonly employed in navigational practice include the closest point of approach cpa time to cpa tcpa bow crossing range bcr and time to bow crossing range tbcr in restricted navigational areas the situation assessment criteria cpa tcpa bcr tbcr as well as the automatic acquisition ring turn out to be insufficient these criteria in a restricted area are usually difficult to use and require experience in their interpretation the ship domain draws increasing attention as a tool for navigational situation analysis and assessment pietrzykowski 2008 pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 the ship domain is usually defined as an area around the ship that navigators want to maintain declarative domain or maintain clear of other objects effective domain coldwell 1983 fujii and tanaka 1971 goodwin 1975 pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 many factors affect the domain shape and size for instance area parameters ship size and type ship course and speed visibility hydrometeorological conditions navigational obstructions etc the human factor is also important navigators knowledge and experience in the first place this diversity of factors renders determining the domain and its practical application difficult the automatic acquisition ring in the arpa and the safety frame in the ecdis system are forms of ship domain the former a ring on the screen with own ship in the centre has a radius defined by the navigator the crossing of the ring by surface vessels activates an alarm ecdis s safety frame is a rectangle its side lengths and ship s position inside are defined by the navigator in this solution the ship does not need to be placed centrally if the rectangle area is violated by a hydrographic object e g safety depth contour which is a navigational risk navigational warning alarm will be raised the ship domain is proposed as a criterion in assessing navigational safety for collision avoidance purposes the violation of the domain area by objects detected by the radar arpa or ais is identified as a dangerous event research is mainly aimed to determine a ship domain in situations of an encounter with other ships it seems purposeful to define a ship domain that will include other surface and underwater objects existing charted objects navigational dangers plotted by the navigator etc diversity of such objects requires separate research on this subject 1 1 background with wide access to real ais data simulation tests may seem unnecessary one argument in favour of simulation tests is their capability to select and analyse parameters not available in the ais such as hydrometeorological conditions including visibility sea state wind force currents level of education and professional experience of navigators including their degree sea service nationality besides advanced and realistic simulators of today allow for varying and repeating scenarios analyses based exclusively on real data may fail to consider certain aspects important for test results data may be incomplete recorded at large intervals not including ship waterplane points as zhou zheng observed wielgosz and pietrzykowski 2012 the minimum cpa and tcpa are difficult to be estimated from the real ais data because navigators seldom encounter the critical situations in which two ships nearly collide in practice the work approaches the problem of ship domain determination based on simulation tests that enable selective analysis of factors affecting domain shape and size 1 2 literature review the concept of domain appeared in marine navigation in the early 1970s in 1971 fuji and tanaka published the results of research into the traffic capacity of fairways fujii and tanaka 1971 they observed that the so called effective domain affects traffic capacity they defined effective domain as an area around a ship underway that most of the navigators preferred not to violate those authors defined and described the impact of several factors on the shape and size of the domain the concept of ship domain was defined in 1975 by goodwin 1975 as an effective area around the ship that the navigator would like to maintain clear of other ships and fixed objects according to goodwin factors affecting the shape and size of the domain included psychological aspect for instance navigators experience physical properties of own ship average speed and general factors affecting all ships in an area such as traffic density or weather conditions the ship domain in restricted waters was examined by coldwell 1983 his priority was to determine the risk of collision in restricted areas based on the concept of ship domain he analysed the impact of ship size on its domain he presented an elliptical domain with semiaxes length and the centre position dependent on ship size the application of the domain as a criterion for navigational safety assessment in an open sea area was described by pietrzykowski uriasz pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 in 1993 zhao wu and wang zhao et al 1993 presented the theory of fuzzy boundary of ship domain and identified factors that affect the shape and size of the domain pietrzykowski pietrzykowski et al 2018b proposed a definition of fuzzy domain broadening the definition of fuzzy boundary of the domain formulated by zhao wu wang zhao et al 1993 pietrzykowski fuzzy domain is compatible with their concept as it defines the area around the ship that should remain clear of other objects and additionally takes into account various values of navigational safety level to determine the level of navigational safety pietrzykowski proposed to use artificial neural networks with fuzzy logic pietrzykowski 2008 the concept of dynamic fuzzy domain was proposed in 2018 by zhou zheng zhou and zheng 2019 the determination of crisp non fuzzy domain by using artificial neural network was proposed by zhu xu and lin zhu et al 2001 to determine a ship domain they used a three layer feed forward neural network trained by the method of backpropagation of errors liu et al 2016 proposed dynamic ship domain models for capacity analysis of restricted water channels expanded analytical models of the domain were introduced by wang et al 2009 who later introduced the concept of dynamic quaternion domain wang 2010 2013 zhang meng zhang and meng 2019 introduced model of probabilistic ship domain wide access to ais data enabled analyses of ship tracks domains and determination of safety levels in 2013 hansen et al published the results of real tests of a ship s domain based on recorded ais data hansen et al 2013 they presented the results in the form of density plots where ship lengths were expressed as relative values similar tests were conducted by gucma marcjan gucma and marcjan 2012 silveira et al 2015 and pietrzykowski et al 2018a simulation tests for the determination of safety levels and risk assessment were carried out by davis dove stockel davis et al 1980 pietrzykowski wielgosz pietrzykowski et al 2012 kang et al 2019 and others the impact of ship size and speed on the shape and size of the domain is presented by wielgosz pietrzykowski wielgosz and pietrzykowski 2012 in his works wielgosz introduced the concept of declarative domain wielgosz 2016a and hydrographic domain wielgosz 2016b and investigated the impact of water area size on ship domain wielgosz 2017 pietrzykowski siemianowicz wielgosz pietrzykowski et al 2018b analysed the impact of visibility on the shape and size of domain in restricted waters ship domains were also reviewed by szlapczynski szlapczynski szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 and hörteborn et al 8 the problem of determining a safe ship trajectory taking account of ship domain was studied inter alia by szlapczyński szłapczyński 2006 the use of domain and artificial potential fields in collision avoidance manoeuvres were proposed by wang et al 2017 the said domains are two dimensional their extension into 3d domains comprises ship draft and air draft 3d domain characteristics and proposals for determining the third dimension are presented in rutkowski 2002 3d domains in port areas were described by cheng et al 2017 they assumed that ship domain is an area 2d domain or part of space 3d domain around the examined object that will enable the navigator to visually assess ship s navigational safety and to determine navigational risk this article focuses on 2d domains and methods of their determination based on simulation tests 2 materials and methods 2 1 environment of simulation tests the effective domain an area around a ship that navigators maintain clear of other objects was determined by simulation tests using an ecdis simulator the method allowed us to implement scenarios of ship encounters the ecdis simulator consists of eight independent stations ships navitrainer 4000 from transas each connected to one ecdis station installed at the maritime university of szczecin the simulator can run any scenario of ship encounter situations in selected areas offering a variety of ship models each ship model enables the operator to fully use the shipboard equipment water area visualization allows conducting visual observation and the navigator can use the systems normally found on the ship s bridge including the arpa and ais scenarios the ship models have full manoeuvring capabilities by course and speed alterations the test station consisted of an ecdis simulator and an ais data recorder developed and made at the maritime university of szczecin the device allows recording standard data transmitted by ships ais systems at 1 s frequency seven stations are manned by training course participants each able to use shipboard equipment and control ship movement by course and speed alteration each test participant can see a target ship by eye bridge view or by using shipboard devices radar arpa ais ecdis a target ship is moving without course or speed alterations whether it is a give way or stand on vessel course participants have been informed that the target ship is manned and may perform manoeuvres as an exercise starts so does the recording of ais data from all ships participating in the experiment seven independent own ships and a target ship six encounter situations and three models of vessels were selected for the tests for these scenarios were created and saved allowing multiple reproductions of the initial situation from which each navigator could later perform at his discretion representing the most typical events the following encounters were selected initial relative bearing 045 the manoeuvring ship has no right of way crossing 045 initial relative bearing 315 the manoeuvring ship has the right of way crossing 315 initial relative bearing 000 two ships proceeding on opposite or reciprocal courses head on situation initial relative bearing 180 overtaking the manoeuvring ship has no right of way overtaking 1 initial relative bearing 180 360 overtaking the manoeuvring ship has the right of way is being overtaken despite being a stand on vessel it has to perform manoeuvres as the overtaking ship takes no action overtaking 2 initial relative bearing 112 5 scenario that in sea practice has had varying interpretations overtaking or crossing courses the initial deployment of the vessels in the executed scenarios is presented in fig 1 with the course up display of the radar headings in each scenario were different suitable for the situation in the area each scenario was executed five times resulting in 30 35 individual passages of ships manoeuvring in each scenario depending on the number of ecdis course participants in total 160 passages performed scenarios were recorded which multiplied by six or seven participants resulted in 1036 individual passages a single scenario depending on the encounter and type of ship took 10 20 min three models of ships of different sizes were used further referred to as large medium and small table 1 to examine the impact of ship size three groups of scenarios were prepared each including six encounter situations large ship encounters understood as encounters of a large ship with a large ship medium ship encounters understood as encounters involving two medium size ships small ship encounters understood as encounters of a small ship with another small ship initially in each encounter the ships were proceeding at their full manoeuvring speed so that the navigator could make a manoeuvre by altering course and or speed to examine the impact of ship speed variants three separate groups of scenarios were prepared six encounters in each group low high speed manoeuvring ship proceeds at a speed approximately twice slower than the non manoeuvring ship steaming full ahead referred as speed variant 1 equal speeds both ships move initially at the same speed referred as speed variant 2 high low speed manoeuvring ship sails at manoeuvring full ahead approximately twice faster than that of the non manoeuvring ship s speed referred as speed variant 3 in testing the speed impact all scenarios were executed by a medium size ship whose full manoeuvring speed was 18 9 knots further herein interpreted as high low speed is understood as 9 5 knots corresponding to engine setting slow ahead the equal speeds were approximately 16 knots participants of simulation tests were at the time attending a training course conducted by the marine officers training centre mus professional experience of the participants was not considered in the tests it was assumed that their duties at sea include being in charge of navigational watch or commanding the ship two sea areas selected for tests were the confined waters of the singapore strait and the dover strait both areas in terms of size traffic intensity and presence of traffic separation schemes are similar and known to most navigators from their sea service experience in fact the vessel traffic in both straits is known to be the densest in the world 2 2 method of domain determination the first step in analysis and further calculations for all scenarios was to determine ship trajectories actual trajectories in an example scenario crossing 045 are presented in fig 2 it shows a single trajectory of a non manoeuvring ship on a constant course red arrow and speeds hdg 190 v 18 9 kn and a bunch of 35 trajectories of manoeuvring ships blue arrow with the same initial parameters here hdg0 280 v0 18 9 kn initially the manoeuvring ship sees the target ship on the relative bearing 45 and cpa close to zero this situation according to the collision regulations obliges the ship to give way to the target ship the trajectories show a diversity of the manoeuvres performed in respect to the direction and size of course alteration time of starting the manoeuvre and speed changes the graphical display of the situations was mainly aimed to evaluate the correctness of recorded data so that further calculations are made from data without gross errors data processed in this way are used for determining the effective domain of own manoeuvring ship and the effective domain of the non manoeuvring target ship after the assessment and acceptance of the recorded data relative trajectories were determined the first step to identify the ship domain the relative trajectories determined separately for the non manoeuvring and manoeuvring ships are shown in fig 3 the x and y axes were swapped because in navigation the x axis is usually associated with the ship centre line while the y axis is transverse fig 3 a presents a non manoeuvring ship red symbol in the centre and manoeuvring ships are visible on its various relative bearings distances are given in metres in the y x system where the x axis is the centre line of the non manoeuvring ship fig 3 b shows a manoeuvring ship blue symbol in the centre of the system with marked contours of non manoeuvring ships this is a form of cumulative view from the manoeuvring ship showing how the contours of non manoeuvring ships were set relative to it our tests went beyond available analyses of only two points own ship target ship where the endpoints of measured distances are not defined the recorded positions are those of ship antennas in most cases the navigational bridges of global navigation satellite systems in this study the examined ship contours had seven large and small ships or five medium ship points on the waterplane fig 4 depending on the actual waterplane shape the number of points depends on the ship waterplane shape to calculate the coordinates of established waterplane points the positions of navigational system antennas were taken recorded data of the manoeuvring and non manoeuvring ships the adopted traces of other ships were the waterplane points on the set relative bearings closest to the centre of the central ship fig 5 ship traces are recorded at fixed intervals δt on relative bearings rb i i 1 n in the 000 359 range and discretization δ rb i a ship domain d s is determined by its boundary b ds with a specific discretization of relative bearings e g δrb 1 the ship domain boundary b ds is represented by a broken line passing through n points p di i 1 2 n lying on relative bearings at distances d drbi from the ship s centre e g waterplane centre 1 b d s p d 1 p d 2 p d i p d n i 1 2 n where b ds is a set of points determining the domain boundary the size of ship domain d s on each relative bearing is then described by distances of points of domain boundary from the ship centre on the respective relative bearings 2 d s r b i d r b i some authors use the concept of minimum domain understood as an area that must be free from other objects in general it is an area where no other object has been recorded although in some cases single violations are permitted gucma and marcjan 2012 the minimum domain b dsmin is determined by a set of n points 3 b d s m i n p d 1 m i n p d 2 m i n p d i m i n p d n m i n the size of ship domain d smin on each relative bearing is then described as follows 4 d s m i n r b i m i n l 1 m d r b i l where d r b i l denotes a distance of l th trace of a target ship from own ship on a relative bearing r b i m is the number of recorded ship traces from a practical point of view the mean and maximum domains are also interesting sets of points determining the mean and maximum domains are defined as follows 5 b d s m e a n p d 1 m e a n p d 2 m e a n p d i m e a n p d n m e a n 6 b d s m a x p d 1 m a x p d 2 m a x p d i m a x p d n m a x the sizes of mean domain d smean and maximum domain d smax on particular relative bearings are equal to 7 d s m e a n r b i 1 m l 1 m d r b i l 8 d s m a x r b i m a x l 1 m d r b i l the developed method of determining a ship effective domain is called a method of partial domains two other methods of domain designation were also developed method of ship traces and method of trace density but both had some shortcomings and imperfections this method is understood as the determination of partial domains initially separately for a non manoeuvring ship fig 6 a and a manoeuvring ship fig 6 b successively for each scenario finally all partial domains are merged three domains are calculated in each case minimum mean and maximum fig 6 a shows a centrally located non manoeuvring ship with points of partial domains maximum mean minimum distances displayed on relative bearings with 10 degree discretization the concept of partial domains is understood as respectively the longest mean and shortest distances recorded on each relative bearing in each passage 30 35 individual passages conducted in a given scenario the minimum domain is determined from equations eq 3 eq 4 mean domains equations eq 5 eq 7 and maximum domains equations eq 6 eq 8 are determined similarly the partial domains obtained by this method in individually examined scenarios do not cover all relative bearings to obtain a complete full image of domains partial values were aggregated in one file containing partial data from all scenarios in this way aggregated domains were obtained for the non manoeuvring ship fig 7 a and a manoeuvring ship fig 7 b the aggregated minimum domain d spmin determined from partial domains is defined by a set of n points 9 b d s p m i n p d p 1 m i n p d p 2 m i n p d p i m i n p d p n m i n the size of aggregated minimum domain d spmin on each relative bearing is described as follows 10 d d s p m i n r b i m i n 1 j k d p r b i min j m i n 1 j k m i n l 1 m d p r b i i j j 1 2 k where d p r b i min j denotes a distance from a minimum domain point to the ship s centre on a relative bearing r b i for j th partial domain corresponding to j th scenario where k is the number of partial domains sets of points defining mean and maximum partial domains are similarly defined 11 b d s p

domain d spmax on specific relative bearings are 13 d d s p m e a n r b i m i n 1 j k d p r b i m e a n j m i n 1 j k 1 m i 1 m d p r b i l 14 d d s p m a x r b i m i n 1 j k d p r b i max j m i n 1 j k m i n l 1 m d p r b i i j where d p r b i m e a n j denotes a distance from a mean domain point to the ship s centre on a relative bearing r b i for a manoeuvring ship d p r b i max j denotes a distance from a maximum domain point to the ship s centre on a relative bearing r b i for a non manoeuvring ship the algorithm for determining aggregated domains by the method of partial domains is shown in fig 8 the principle of combining partial domains from specific scenarios is shown in fig 9 fig 9 a depicts two selected partial mean domains of manoeuvring ship in the scenarios crossing 045 black asterisks and line and head on blue diamonds and line for simplification only points on the port side and ahead of the ship blue contour at point x 0 y 0 are shown the section representing the smallest distances from the ship on each relative bearing was selected from each scenario from thus correlated data two sections were selected and joined red line in diagram b this operation was conducted for all scenarios in each group a simplified sketch of a selected aggregated domain of a ship blue contour in the centre in fig 10 presents partial domains in black green blue purple and yellow for different scenarios while the red line marks the selected aggregated domain to sum up the partial domains were combined into aggregated domains as described above by equations eq 10 eq 13 eq 14 separately for manoeuvring and non manoeuvring ships the domains of manoeuvring and non manoeuvring ships were integrated to obtain a final integrated domain of the ship under examination the whole process of integrating the domains is shown in fig 11 a complete image of aggregated domains of ships of examined sizes and speed variants was obtained by integrating the domains of non manoeuvring and manoeuvring ships the symbol placed in the centre of the diagram marks a medium ship obtained from manoeuvring and non manoeuvring ships fig 12 aggregated minimum mean and maximum domains were integrated independently during data integration the corresponding distances on the same relative bearings were analysed the following algorithm of integration was used 1 maximum domain for each relative bearing the greatest value is selected 2 mean domain mean arithmetic value is calculated for each relative bearing fig 12 3 minimum domain for each relative bearing the smaller value is selected ship domain boundaries b i d s p m i n b i d s p m e a n b i d s p m a x for the integrated minimum mean and maximum domains d ispmin d ispmean d ispmax of manoeuvring and non manoeuvring ships are defined as 15 b i d s p m i n p i d p 1 m i n p i d p 2 m i n p i d p i m i n p i d p n m i n i 1 2 n 16 b i d s p m e a n p i d p 1 m e a n p i d p 2 m e a n p i d p i m e a n p i d p n m e a n i 1 2 n 17 b i d s p m a x p i d p 1 m a x p i d p 2 m a x p i d p i m a x p i d p n m a x i 1 2 n then the domains are written as follows 18 d i s p m i n r b i m i n d r b i min m a n d r b i min n o n m a n 19 d i s p m e a n r b i 1 2 d r b i m e a n m a n d r b i m e a n n o n m a n 20 d i s p m a x r b i m a x d r b i max m a n d r b i max n o n m a n where d r b i min m a n denotes a distance from a boundary point of minimum domain to the ship s centre on a relative bearing r b i for a manoeuvring ship d r b i min n o n m a n denotes a distance from a boundary point of minimum domain to the ship s centre r b i on a relative bearing for a non manoeuvring ship d r b i m e a n m a n denotes a distance from a boundary point of mean domain to the ship s centre on a relative bearing r b i for a manoeuvring ship d r b i m e a n n o n m a n denotes a distance from a boundary point of mean domain to the ship s centre on a relative bearing r b i for a non manoeuvring ship d r b i max m a n denotes a distance from a boundary point of maximum domain to the ship s centre on a relative bearing r b i for a manoeuvring ship d r b i max n o n m a n denotes a distance from a point of maximum domain to the ship s centre on a relative bearing r b i for a non manoeuvring ship thus obtained data shown in the diagrams as sets of points with coordinates x i y i used for further determination of domain shape and size are roughly elliptical with visible deviations from a regular ellipse this is due to the adopted method of data collection based on predefined scenarios in which ships are initially in the same position and only after a given scenario begins to be executed ships follow a track preferred by the navigator appropriate course and or speed alteration this leads to an increased density of recorded positions near the initial position of the target ship in reality ships relative bearings and distances would be similar not the same which would result in a more regular elliptical shape of the domain as known from other sources therefore the data so compiled had to be approximated as discussed in section 2 3 distances obtained on each relative bearing are expressed in metres for absolute domains dividing each distance by the length of a ship in the given group of scenarios we get relative distances expressed in ship lengths enabling us to introduce the concept of relative domain 2 3 approximation process the absolute and relative domains obtained by the method of partial domains were approximated one advantage of this approach is that a solution can be found very fast because the search for solution is performed using a population of candidate possible solutions a group of points instead of starting from a single point classical optimisation methods commonly used conditions for termination of the algorithm are a minimum of the fitness function or fixed number of generations in our study the criterion for termination of the algorithm was the number of generations 100 iterations additionally the algorithm was performed ten times for each domain approximation the final solution was determined from those ten solutions using the minimum fitness function criterion the approximation was aimed at smoothing the data and obtaining four parameters of ellipses representing the domains of ships of the examined sizes and speed combinations in all cases the maximum mean and minimum domains were approximated it follows from our research and other available publications that a ship domain is elliptical the overall parametric equation of the ellipse is this 21 x t x 0 a c o s t cos α b sin t sin α 22 y t y 0 a cos t sin α b sin t cos α where a semi major axis b semi minor axis x 0 offset of the ellipse centre along x axis y 0 offset of the ellipse centre along y axis α angle of rotation of the major axis t angle 0 t 2π with no rotation or inclination of the ellipse α 0 the equation assumes this form 23 x t x 0 a cos t 24 y t y 0 b sin t the block diagram of the approximation process is presented in fig 14 chromosomes forming a genotype are the four ellipse parameters x 0 y 0 a b the total distance between the boundaries of the real domain and that ellipse estimated on preset relative bearings was adopted as the measure of fitness the best fitted domain was considered to be one with the minimum value of fitness function equations eq 25 eq 26 the relative bearings taken for analysis had 10 discretization the fitness function takes this form 25 d min i 0 n d i 26 d i x i x 0 2 y i y 0 2 where d sum of distances on all examined relative bearings d i difference of the i th distance on a relative bearing x i coordinate x of the i th point of the approximated ellipse x 0 coordinate x of a point recorded on a specific relative bearing y i coordinate y of the i th point of the approximated ellipse y 0 coordinate y of a point recorded on a specific relative bearing when fitting ellipses i e domains for each ship boundaries for the chromosomes were inserted i e limit values that based on preliminary analysis the particular parameters could assume the limits were chosen from an analysis of the data presented in the previous section 3 results impact of ship size and speed on the effective domain shape and size 3 1 effective domains of different size ships presented below are selected domains of a medium size ship approximated using genetic algorithms fig 8 displays three domains before approximation one can see a roughly elliptical shape and shifted domain centres relative to the own ship position in the centre after approximation groups of four parameters of ellipses x 0 y 0 a b were obtained for each domain table 2 the result of approximation is presented in fig 15 a showing original data and superimposed approximated ellipses the approximation looks highly accurate which confirms that the method has been chosen correctly the same approximation process was used for all variants of ship size and speeds separately for absolute and relative values input relative values were obtained by dividing absolute distances on all relative bearings by the length of the ship concerned approximated ellipses of relative domains of a medium ship are presented in fig 15 b 3 2 effective ship domains for different speed variants the procedures described in the previous section were also used for three speed variants of two ships with calculations of absolute and relative values some results for absolute and relative domains are presented in table 3 ship domains for the high low speed variant before approximation are presented in fig 16 the visible offset of the centre of minimum and mean domains difficult to be unequivocally identified by other methods justifies the application of advanced methods of approximation by genetic algorithms fig 17 combines original data with the approximated ellipses of ship integrated domains a and relative domains b 3 3 impact of ship size and speed on ship domain the further analysis focuses on mean domains as they correspond to the safety level ρ 0 5 this level is generally interpreted as a boundary between safe and dangerous situations in navigation this relates to a distance most navigators will choose to pass a ship of specific size and speed other levels of safety can be determined by using the maximum and minimum domains the maximum domain can be an equivalent of the safety level ρ 1 and interpreted as the maximum acceptable passing distance chosen by a careful navigator the minimum domain herein determined reflects the safety level ρ 0 whose limit was not crossed in the tests although accidental or intentional breach of that boundary by other ships is possible 3 3 1 impact of ship size on the effective domain it is natural for a human to change safety limits as object parameters change regarding ships this means that safety areas increase along with the size of the ship the mean absolute domains of ships of three different sizes are given in fig 18 one can notice that the bigger the ship the bigger the domain becomes fig 18 shows absolute domains whose parameters are expressed in metres to get relative domains we should convert the units of measure that is to rescale the chart to relative units l ship s length by dividing the distances by ship s length based on the tests and analyses it was found that relationships between relative domains are opposite to those between absolute domains in other words the smaller the ship the bigger its relative domain is figs 19 and 20 fig 19 compares ellipses of mean absolute domains of ships of different size the diagram illustrates the head up orientation the green circle represents the reference value r 1 rescaled for the chart a mean effective absolute domain of a large ship the blue and red ellipses represent the coefficient value of distances on each relative bearing for two ships respectively large medium and large small the assumed values do not exceed 1 the relative domains are shown similarly in fig 20 the reference domain is a mean domain of a large ship after rescaling depicted as the green circle with a radius r 1 the blue and red ellipses represent values of the coefficient of distance on different relative bearings of two ships medium large and small large the values exceed 1 which means that relative domains of ships get larger as the ship size decreases although an analysis of such data presentation could be one of the approaches in examining the impact of ship size it would be very difficult to find a relatively simple mathematical formula therefore further investigation of the ship size and speed is restricted to the length of domain semiaxes and position of the centre as the impact of ship size on absolute and relative domains varies as found in this study the impact of ship size on two types of domain is presented below mean absolute domains of ships of three different sizes are given in fig 18 it shows that the ship domain increases along with ship length the domain is shifted relative to the position of the navigator located in the centre of the coordinate system and that the ellipse centre changes as the ship size changes the parameters of these ellipses as well as the ellipses for relative domains are shown in table 4 27 y a i x b i c i where a i b i c i are function coefficients the function parameters of four domain types absolute and relative domains ships of different size and speed for the semi major coefficients a ia b ia c ia and semi minor axis coefficients a ib b ib c ib i 1 7 were approximated by the non linear least squares method in this case lengths of semi major and semi minor axes as a function of ship length have this form 28 a f a l l 29 b f b l l where 30 f a

curves red and blue dashed lines for the semi major and semi minor axes respectively the function coefficients for the major and minor semiaxes of the domain for ships of different sizes i 1 2 and equal speed are specified in table 5 see fig 22 for a larger amount of data size of ships the fitness could have slightly different values of coefficients but this would not change the nature of the curves and relationships found the relationship between ship size and the relative domain was examined similarly to the above tests approximated parameters of mean relative domains were used for the

and for three different speed variants the calculations used the coefficients given therein the obtained sets of points are marked in the chart by diamonds and different colours green blue and red respectively for speed variants high low equal low high similar operations were performed for the semi minor axis fig 25 from a bunch of curves thus obtained it is possible to determine lengths of the domain semi major and semi minor axes for a given ship size and speed variant figs 24 and 25 show how the ship size and speed affect the lengths of semi major and semi minor axes for the ship domain herein the mean absolute domain the data represented by a bunch of curves allow determining the lengths of the semi major and semi minor axes for a set ship length and speed variant by interpolation between the curves and value readout on the y axis an example of finding the length of the domain semi major axis of a ship 220 m long is shown by purple arrows in fig 24 based on the previous separate mathematical descriptions of ship size and speed impact on the lengths of semi major and semi minor axes under consideration and after an analysis of the bunches of curves shown in figs 24

to examine the ellipse centre offset dependent on ship size and speed were determined by using the same method as in examining semiaxes length changes linearly approximated offsets of the ellipse

discussion we have determined mathematical relationships between the ship domain size lengths of ellipse major and semi minor axes and ship size and speed the same relations apply to absolute and relative domains the only difference is in coefficients used in the said relationships taking into account the scope of the tests including ship size and speed we can assume that the relationships hold true for ship length ranging from 95 to 261 3 m and speed from slow ahead to full ahead if a 10 15 extrapolation of length and speed is accepted domains could be determined for small ships of the coaster type 80 m in length to panamax ships 294 m long this scope represents a vast majority of cargo and passenger ships trading internationally the presented method of ship domain determination based on simulation tests have advantages and limitations one advantage of the method of partial domains is its straightforward and unambiguous determination of the minimum mean and maximum domains this method of domain determination allows us to account for ship contours and position of ship s antennas consequently the analysis can be based on the shortest actual passing distances as expected we found an explicit dependence of domain size and shape on the ship size examining the impact of ship speed on the shape and size of ship domain we predicted it would be greater the observed impact however was less considerable than we expected this calls for more accurate analysis because in domains determined by analytical methods described in available publications this dependence is stronger research has shown that a ship proceeding at a relatively slow speed tries to maintain longer distances to other ships i e greater domain which is contrary to common belief that the domain increases along with ship s speed regardless of the speed the ratio of domain length to width is approximately 2 1 an interesting relationship has observed between absolute and relative domains as expected the larger ship has a greater absolute domain than the smaller of two ships involved for relative domains expressed in ship lengths the relationship is opposite the smaller ship has a greater domain than the larger ship fig 20 this may occur because navigators tend to strictly stick to customarily adopted distances for passing another ship e g 2 nm 1 nm 0 5 nm or because assessing a situation they use the minimum turning circle diameter stated in ship lengths 5 conclusions this study examines the impact of ship size and speed on domain shape and size in a restricted area based on simulation tests these allow us to investigate how certain factors affect the ship domain parameters three methods of ship domain determination are presented partial domains ship traces and trace density to determine domains of various size ships proceeding at various speeds we chose to use the method of partial domains minimum mean and maximum domains were determined we consider absolute domains with parameters expressed in metres and relative domains expressed as ship lengths each domain was approximated to an ellipse with the ship s centre offset out of the ellipse axis a considerable impact of the ship size on domain shape and size was found while ship speed turns out to have a smaller impact on the domain shape and size mathematical relations between domain shape and size and ship size and speed were formulated these relationships allow us to determine domains of cargo and passenger ships operating internationally it was ascertained that the changes in relative domain shape and size depending on ship size and speed variants are not the same as changes in absolute domains the research will be continued to examine other factors affecting ship domain shape and size and to implement the

21205,the ship domain is a concept commonly proposed as a safety assessment criterion in planning collision avoidance manoeuvres of a ship or its safe route the work presents authors methods for determining an effective ship domain based on tests using electronic chart display and information system ecdis simulator the tests were conducted on non autonomous real time models of ships steered by expert navigators domains were determined for ships of different sizes and speeds the ship domain was approximated to an ellipse the study covered absolute and relative domains the latter defined in ship length units the dependence of the domain shape and size on ship size and speed has been analysed and described the formulated analytical relationships enable us to determine the domain of a ship varying in size and speed keywords collision avoidance manoeuvres simulation research ship domain safety zone ship encounters collision risk restricted area ship speed 1 introduction the safety of navigation requires continuous analysis and assessment of navigational situation by shipboard navigational aids situational assessment is aimed to detect a dangerous situation and involves the determination of a navigational safety level situations at sea should be analysed and assessed by using specific criteria those commonly employed in navigational practice include the closest point of approach cpa time to cpa tcpa bow crossing range bcr and time to bow crossing range tbcr in restricted navigational areas the situation assessment criteria cpa tcpa bcr tbcr as well as the automatic acquisition ring turn out to be insufficient these criteria in a restricted area are usually difficult to use and require experience in their interpretation the ship domain draws increasing attention as a tool for navigational situation analysis and assessment pietrzykowski 2008 pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 the ship domain is usually defined as an area around the ship that navigators want to maintain declarative domain or maintain clear of other objects effective domain coldwell 1983 fujii and tanaka 1971 goodwin 1975 pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 many factors affect the domain shape and size for instance area parameters ship size and type ship course and speed visibility hydrometeorological conditions navigational obstructions etc the human factor is also important navigators knowledge and experience in the first place this diversity of factors renders determining the domain and its practical application difficult the automatic acquisition ring in the arpa and the safety frame in the ecdis system are forms of ship domain the former a ring on the screen with own ship in the centre has a radius defined by the navigator the crossing of the ring by surface vessels activates an alarm ecdis s safety frame is a rectangle its side lengths and ship s position inside are defined by the navigator in this solution the ship does not need to be placed centrally if the rectangle area is violated by a hydrographic object e g safety depth contour which is a navigational risk navigational warning alarm will be raised the ship domain is proposed as a criterion in assessing navigational safety for collision avoidance purposes the violation of the domain area by objects detected by the radar arpa or ais is identified as a dangerous event research is mainly aimed to determine a ship domain in situations of an encounter with other ships it seems purposeful to define a ship domain that will include other surface and underwater objects existing charted objects navigational dangers plotted by the navigator etc diversity of such objects requires separate research on this subject 1 1 background with wide access to real ais data simulation tests may seem unnecessary one argument in favour of simulation tests is their capability to select and analyse parameters not available in the ais such as hydrometeorological conditions including visibility sea state wind force currents level of education and professional experience of navigators including their degree sea service nationality besides advanced and realistic simulators of today allow for varying and repeating scenarios analyses based exclusively on real data may fail to consider certain aspects important for test results data may be incomplete recorded at large intervals not including ship waterplane points as zhou zheng observed wielgosz and pietrzykowski 2012 the minimum cpa and tcpa are difficult to be estimated from the real ais data because navigators seldom encounter the critical situations in which two ships nearly collide in practice the work approaches the problem of ship domain determination based on simulation tests that enable selective analysis of factors affecting domain shape and size 1 2 literature review the concept of domain appeared in marine navigation in the early 1970s in 1971 fuji and tanaka published the results of research into the traffic capacity of fairways fujii and tanaka 1971 they observed that the so called effective domain affects traffic capacity they defined effective domain as an area around a ship underway that most of the navigators preferred not to violate those authors defined and described the impact of several factors on the shape and size of the domain the concept of ship domain was defined in 1975 by goodwin 1975 as an effective area around the ship that the navigator would like to maintain clear of other ships and fixed objects according to goodwin factors affecting the shape and size of the domain included psychological aspect for instance navigators experience physical properties of own ship average speed and general factors affecting all ships in an area such as traffic density or weather conditions the ship domain in restricted waters was examined by coldwell 1983 his priority was to determine the risk of collision in restricted areas based on the concept of ship domain he analysed the impact of ship size on its domain he presented an elliptical domain with semiaxes length and the centre position dependent on ship size the application of the domain as a criterion for navigational safety assessment in an open sea area was described by pietrzykowski uriasz pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 in 1993 zhao wu and wang zhao et al 1993 presented the theory of fuzzy boundary of ship domain and identified factors that affect the shape and size of the domain pietrzykowski pietrzykowski et al 2018b proposed a definition of fuzzy domain broadening the definition of fuzzy boundary of the domain formulated by zhao wu wang zhao et al 1993 pietrzykowski fuzzy domain is compatible with their concept as it defines the area around the ship that should remain clear of other objects and additionally takes into account various values of navigational safety level to determine the level of navigational safety pietrzykowski proposed to use artificial neural networks with fuzzy logic pietrzykowski 2008 the concept of dynamic fuzzy domain was proposed in 2018 by zhou zheng zhou and zheng 2019 the determination of crisp non fuzzy domain by using artificial neural network was proposed by zhu xu and lin zhu et al 2001 to determine a ship domain they used a three layer feed forward neural network trained by the method of backpropagation of errors liu et al 2016 proposed dynamic ship domain models for capacity analysis of restricted water channels expanded analytical models of the domain were introduced by wang et al 2009 who later introduced the concept of dynamic quaternion domain wang 2010 2013 zhang meng zhang and meng 2019 introduced model of probabilistic ship domain wide access to ais data enabled analyses of ship tracks domains and determination of safety levels in 2013 hansen et al published the results of real tests of a ship s domain based on recorded ais data hansen et al 2013 they presented the results in the form of density plots where ship lengths were expressed as relative values similar tests were conducted by gucma marcjan gucma and marcjan 2012 silveira et al 2015 and pietrzykowski et al 2018a simulation tests for the determination of safety levels and risk assessment were carried out by davis dove stockel davis et al 1980 pietrzykowski wielgosz pietrzykowski et al 2012 kang et al 2019 and others the impact of ship size and speed on the shape and size of the domain is presented by wielgosz pietrzykowski wielgosz and pietrzykowski 2012 in his works wielgosz introduced the concept of declarative domain wielgosz 2016a and hydrographic domain wielgosz 2016b and investigated the impact of water area size on ship domain wielgosz 2017 pietrzykowski siemianowicz wielgosz pietrzykowski et al 2018b analysed the impact of visibility on the shape and size of domain in restricted waters ship domains were also reviewed by szlapczynski szlapczynski szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 and hörteborn et al 8 the problem of determining a safe ship trajectory taking account of ship domain was studied inter alia by szlapczyński szłapczyński 2006 the use of domain and artificial potential fields in collision avoidance manoeuvres were proposed by wang et al 2017 the said domains are two dimensional their extension into 3d domains comprises ship draft and air draft 3d domain characteristics and proposals for determining the third dimension are presented in rutkowski 2002 3d domains in port areas were described by cheng et al 2017 they assumed that ship domain is an area 2d domain or part of space 3d domain around the examined object that will enable the navigator to visually assess ship s navigational safety and to determine navigational risk this article focuses on 2d domains and methods of their determination based on simulation tests 2 materials and methods 2 1 environment of simulation tests the effective domain an area around a ship that navigators maintain clear of other objects was determined by simulation tests using an ecdis simulator the method allowed us to implement scenarios of ship encounters the ecdis simulator consists of eight independent stations ships navitrainer 4000 from transas each connected to one ecdis station installed at the maritime university of szczecin the simulator can run any scenario of ship encounter situations in selected areas offering a variety of ship models each ship model enables the operator to fully use the shipboard equipment water area visualization allows conducting visual observation and the navigator can use the systems normally found on the ship s bridge including the arpa and ais scenarios the ship models have full manoeuvring capabilities by course and speed alterations the test station consisted of an ecdis simulator and an ais data recorder developed and made at the maritime university of szczecin the device allows recording standard data transmitted by ships ais systems at 1 s frequency seven stations are manned by training course participants each able to use shipboard equipment and control ship movement by course and speed alteration each test participant can see a target ship by eye bridge view or by using shipboard devices radar arpa ais ecdis a target ship is moving without course or speed alterations whether it is a give way or stand on vessel course participants have been informed that the target ship is manned and may perform manoeuvres as an exercise starts so does the recording of ais data from all ships participating in the experiment seven independent own ships and a target ship six encounter situations and three models of vessels were selected for the tests for these scenarios were created and saved allowing multiple reproductions of the initial situation from which each navigator could later perform at his discretion representing the most typical events the following encounters were selected initial relative bearing 045 the manoeuvring ship has no right of way crossing 045 initial relative bearing 315 the manoeuvring ship has the right of way crossing 315 initial relative bearing 000 two ships proceeding on opposite or reciprocal courses head on situation initial relative bearing 180 overtaking the manoeuvring ship has no right of way overtaking 1 initial relative bearing 180 360 overtaking the manoeuvring ship has the right of way is being overtaken despite being a stand on vessel it has to perform manoeuvres as the overtaking ship takes no action overtaking 2 initial relative bearing 112 5 scenario that in sea practice has had varying interpretations overtaking or crossing courses the initial deployment of the vessels in the executed scenarios is presented in fig 1 with the course up display of the radar headings in each scenario were different suitable for the situation in the area each scenario was executed five times resulting in 30 35 individual passages of ships manoeuvring in each scenario depending on the number of ecdis course participants in total 160 passages performed scenarios were recorded which multiplied by six or seven participants resulted in 1036 individual passages a single scenario depending on the encounter and type of ship took 10 20 min three models of ships of different sizes were used further referred to as large medium and small table 1 to examine the impact of ship size three groups of scenarios were prepared each including six encounter situations large ship encounters understood as encounters of a large ship with a large ship medium ship encounters understood as encounters involving two medium size ships small ship encounters understood as encounters of a small ship with another small ship initially in each encounter the ships were proceeding at their full manoeuvring speed so that the navigator could make a manoeuvre by altering course and or speed to examine the impact of ship speed variants three separate groups of scenarios were prepared six encounters in each group low high speed manoeuvring ship proceeds at a speed approximately twice slower than the non manoeuvring ship steaming full ahead referred as speed variant 1 equal speeds both ships move initially at the same speed referred as speed variant 2 high low speed manoeuvring ship sails at manoeuvring full ahead approximately twice faster than that of the non manoeuvring ship s speed referred as speed variant 3 in testing the speed impact all scenarios were executed by a medium size ship whose full manoeuvring speed was 18 9 knots further herein interpreted as high low speed is understood as 9 5 knots corresponding to engine setting slow ahead the equal speeds were approximately 16 knots participants of simulation tests were at the time attending a training course conducted by the marine officers training centre mus professional experience of the participants was not considered in the tests it was assumed that their duties at sea include being in charge of navigational watch or commanding the ship two sea areas selected for tests were the confined waters of the singapore strait and the dover strait both areas in terms of size traffic intensity and presence of traffic separation schemes are similar and known to most navigators from their sea service experience in fact the vessel traffic in both straits is known to be the densest in the world 2 2 method of domain determination the first step in analysis and further calculations for all scenarios was to determine ship trajectories actual trajectories in an example scenario crossing 045 are presented in fig 2 it shows a single trajectory of a non manoeuvring ship on a constant course red arrow and speeds hdg 190 v 18 9 kn and a bunch of 35 trajectories of manoeuvring ships blue arrow with the same initial parameters here hdg0 280 v0 18 9 kn initially the manoeuvring ship sees the target ship on the relative bearing 45 and cpa close to zero this situation according to the collision regulations obliges the ship to give way to the target ship the trajectories show a diversity of the manoeuvres performed in respect to the direction and size of course alteration time of starting the manoeuvre and speed changes the graphical display of the situations was mainly aimed to evaluate the correctness of recorded data so that further calculations are made from data without gross errors data processed in this way are used for determining the effective domain of own manoeuvring ship and the effective domain of the non manoeuvring target ship after the assessment and acceptance of the recorded data relative trajectories were determined the first step to identify the ship domain the relative trajectories determined separately for the non manoeuvring and manoeuvring ships are shown in fig 3 the x and y axes were swapped because in navigation the x axis is usually associated with the ship centre line while the y axis is transverse fig 3 a presents a non manoeuvring ship red symbol in the centre and manoeuvring ships are visible on its various relative bearings distances are given in metres in the y x system where the x axis is the centre line of the non manoeuvring ship fig 3 b shows a manoeuvring ship blue symbol in the centre of the system with marked contours of non manoeuvring ships this is a form of cumulative view from the manoeuvring ship showing how the contours of non manoeuvring ships were set relative to it our tests went beyond available analyses of only two points own ship target ship where the endpoints of measured distances are not defined the recorded positions are those of ship antennas in most cases the navigational bridges of global navigation satellite systems in this study the examined ship contours had seven large and small ships or five medium ship points on the waterplane fig 4 depending on the actual waterplane shape the number of points depends on the ship waterplane shape to calculate the coordinates of established waterplane points the positions of navigational system antennas were taken recorded data of the manoeuvring and non manoeuvring ships the adopted traces of other ships were the waterplane points on the set relative bearings closest to the centre of the central ship fig 5 ship traces are recorded at fixed intervals δt on relative bearings rb i i 1 n in the 000 359 range and discretization δ rb i a ship domain d s is determined by its boundary b ds with a specific discretization of relative bearings e g δrb 1 the ship domain boundary b ds is represented by a broken line passing through n points p di i 1 2 n lying on relative bearings at distances d drbi from the ship s centre e g waterplane centre 1 b d s p d 1 p d 2 p d i p d n i 1 2 n where b ds is a set of points determining the domain boundary the size of ship domain d s on each relative bearing is then described by distances of points of domain boundary from the ship centre on the respective relative bearings 2 d s r b i d r b i some authors use the concept of minimum domain understood as an area that must be free from other objects in general it is an area where no other object has been recorded although in some cases single violations are permitted gucma and marcjan 2012 the minimum domain b dsmin is determined by a set of n points 3 b d s m i n p d 1 m i n p d 2 m i n p d i m i n p d n m i n the size of ship domain d smin on each relative bearing is then described as follows 4 d s m i n r b i m i n l 1 m d r b i l where d r b i l denotes a distance of l th trace of a target ship from own ship on a relative bearing r b i m is the number of recorded ship traces from a practical point of view the mean and maximum domains are also interesting sets of points determining the mean and maximum domains are defined as follows 5 b d s m e a n p d 1 m e a n p d 2 m e a n p d i m e a n p d n m e a n 6 b d s m a x p d 1 m a x p d 2 m a x p d i m a x p d n m a x the sizes of mean domain d smean and maximum domain d smax on particular relative bearings are equal to 7 d s m e a n r b i 1 m l 1 m d r b i l 8 d s m a x r b i m a x l 1 m d r b i l the developed method of determining a ship effective domain is called a method of partial domains two other methods of domain designation were also developed method of ship traces and method of trace density but both had some shortcomings and imperfections this method is understood as the determination of partial domains initially separately for a non manoeuvring ship fig 6 a and a manoeuvring ship fig 6 b successively for each scenario finally all partial domains are merged three domains are calculated in each case minimum mean and maximum fig 6 a shows a centrally located non manoeuvring ship with points of partial domains maximum mean minimum distances displayed on relative bearings with 10 degree discretization the concept of partial domains is understood as respectively the longest mean and shortest distances recorded on each relative bearing in each passage 30 35 individual passages conducted in a given scenario the minimum domain is determined from equations eq 3 eq 4 mean domains equations eq 5 eq 7 and maximum domains equations eq 6 eq 8 are determined similarly the partial domains obtained by this method in individually examined scenarios do not cover all relative bearings to obtain a complete full image of domains partial values were aggregated in one file containing partial data from all scenarios in this way aggregated domains were obtained for the non manoeuvring ship fig 7 a and a manoeuvring ship fig 7 b the aggregated minimum domain d spmin determined from partial domains is defined by a set of n points 9 b d s p m i n p d p 1 m i n p d p 2 m i n p d p i m i n p d p n m i n the size of aggregated minimum domain d spmin on each relative bearing is described as follows 10 d

shown in fig 8 the principle of combining partial domains from specific scenarios is shown in fig 9 fig 9 a depicts two selected partial mean domains of manoeuvring ship in the scenarios crossing 045 black asterisks and line and head on blue diamonds and line for simplification only points on the port side and ahead of the ship blue contour at point x 0 y 0 are shown the section representing the smallest distances from the ship on each relative bearing was selected from each scenario from thus correlated data two sections were selected and joined red line in diagram b this operation was conducted for all scenarios in each group a simplified sketch of a selected aggregated domain of a ship blue contour in the centre in fig 10 presents partial domains in black green blue purple and yellow for different scenarios while the red line marks the selected aggregated domain to sum up the partial domains were combined into aggregated domains as described above by equations eq 10 eq 13 eq 14 separately for manoeuvring and non manoeuvring ships the domains of manoeuvring and non manoeuvring ships were integrated to obtain a final integrated domain of the ship under examination the whole process of integrating the domains is shown in fig 11 a complete image of aggregated domains of ships of examined sizes and speed variants was obtained by integrating the domains of non manoeuvring and manoeuvring ships the symbol placed in the centre of the diagram marks a medium ship obtained from manoeuvring and non manoeuvring ships fig 12 aggregated minimum mean and maximum domains were integrated independently during data integration the corresponding distances on the same relative bearings were analysed the following algorithm of integration was used 1 maximum domain for each relative bearing the greatest value is selected 2 mean domain mean arithmetic value is calculated for each relative bearing fig 12 3 minimum domain for each relative bearing the smaller value is selected ship domain boundaries b i d s p m i n b i d s p m e a n b i d s p m a x for the integrated minimum mean and maximum domains d ispmin d ispmean d ispmax of manoeuvring and non manoeuvring

of maximum domain to the ship s centre on a relative bearing r b i for a non manoeuvring ship thus obtained data shown in the diagrams as sets of points with coordinates x i y i used for further determination of domain shape and size are roughly elliptical with visible deviations from a regular ellipse this is due to the adopted method of data collection based on predefined scenarios in which ships are initially in the same position and only after a given scenario begins to be executed ships follow a track preferred by the navigator appropriate course and or speed alteration this leads to an increased density of recorded positions near the initial position of the target ship in reality ships relative bearings and distances would be similar not the same which would result in a more regular elliptical shape of the domain as known from other sources therefore the data so compiled had to be approximated as discussed in section 2 3 distances obtained on each relative bearing are expressed in metres for absolute domains dividing each distance by the length of a ship in the given group of scenarios we get relative distances expressed in ship lengths enabling us to introduce the concept of relative domain 2 3 approximation process the absolute and relative domains obtained by the method of partial domains were approximated one advantage of this approach is that a solution can be found very fast because the search for solution is performed using a population of candidate possible solutions a group of points instead of starting from a single point classical optimisation methods commonly used conditions for termination of the algorithm are a minimum of the fitness function or fixed number of generations in our study the criterion for termination of the algorithm was the number of generations 100 iterations additionally the algorithm was performed ten times for each domain approximation the final solution was determined from those ten solutions using the minimum fitness function criterion the approximation was aimed at smoothing the data and obtaining four parameters of ellipses representing the domains of ships of the examined sizes and speed combinations in all cases the maximum mean and minimum domains were approximated it follows from our research and other available publications that a ship domain is elliptical the overall parametric equation of the ellipse is this 21 x t x 0 a c o s t cos α b sin t sin α 22 y t y 0 a cos t sin α b sin t cos α where a semi major axis b semi minor axis x 0 offset of the ellipse centre along x axis y 0 offset of the ellipse centre along y axis α angle of rotation of the major axis t angle 0 t 2π with no rotation or inclination of the ellipse α 0 the equation assumes this form 23 x t x 0 a cos t 24 y t y 0 b sin t the block diagram of the approximation process is presented in fig 14 chromosomes forming a genotype are the four ellipse parameters x 0 y 0 a b the total distance between the boundaries of the real domain and that ellipse estimated on preset relative bearings was adopted as the measure of fitness the best fitted domain was considered to be one with the minimum value of fitness function equations eq 25 eq 26 the relative bearings taken for analysis had 10 discretization the fitness function takes this form 25 d min i 0 n d i 26 d i x i x 0 2 y i y 0 2 where d sum of distances on all examined relative bearings d i difference of the i th distance on a relative bearing x i coordinate x of the i th point of the approximated ellipse x 0 coordinate x of a point recorded on a specific relative bearing y i coordinate y of the i th point of the approximated ellipse y 0 coordinate y of a point recorded on a specific relative bearing when fitting ellipses i e domains for each ship boundaries for the chromosomes were inserted i e limit values that based on preliminary analysis the particular parameters could assume the limits were chosen from an analysis of the data presented in the previous section 3 results impact of ship size and speed on the effective domain shape and size 3 1 effective domains of different size ships presented below are selected domains of a medium size ship approximated using genetic algorithms fig 8 displays three domains before approximation one can see a roughly elliptical shape and shifted domain centres relative to the own ship position in the centre after approximation groups of four parameters of ellipses x 0 y 0 a b were obtained for each domain table 2 the result of approximation is presented in fig 15 a showing original data and superimposed approximated ellipses the approximation looks highly accurate which confirms that the method has been chosen correctly the same approximation process was used for all variants of ship size and speeds separately for absolute and relative values input relative values were obtained by dividing absolute distances on all relative bearings by the length of the ship concerned approximated ellipses of relative domains of a medium ship are presented in fig 15 b 3 2 effective ship domains for different speed variants the procedures described in the previous section were also used for three speed variants of two ships with calculations of absolute and relative values some results for absolute and relative domains are presented in table 3 ship domains for the high low speed variant before approximation are presented in fig 16 the visible offset of the centre of minimum and mean domains difficult to be unequivocally identified by other methods justifies the application of advanced methods of approximation by genetic algorithms fig 17 combines original data with the approximated ellipses of ship integrated domains a and relative domains b 3 3 impact of ship size and speed on ship domain the further analysis focuses on mean domains as they correspond to the safety level ρ 0 5 this level is generally interpreted as a boundary between safe and dangerous situations in navigation this relates to a distance most navigators will choose to pass a ship of specific size and speed other levels of safety can be determined by using the maximum and minimum domains the maximum domain can be an equivalent of the safety level ρ 1 and interpreted as the maximum acceptable passing distance chosen by a careful navigator the minimum domain herein determined reflects the safety level ρ 0 whose limit was not crossed in the tests although accidental or intentional breach of that boundary by other ships is possible 3 3 1 impact of ship size on the effective domain it is natural for a human to change safety limits as object parameters change regarding ships this means that safety areas increase along with the size of the ship the mean absolute domains of ships of three different sizes are given in fig 18 one can notice that the bigger the ship the bigger the domain becomes fig 18 shows absolute domains whose parameters are expressed in metres to get relative domains we should convert the units of measure that is to rescale the chart to relative units l ship s length by dividing the distances by ship s length based on the tests and analyses it was found that relationships between relative domains are opposite to those between absolute domains in other words the smaller the ship the bigger its relative domain is figs 19 and 20 fig 19 compares ellipses of mean absolute domains of ships of different size the diagram illustrates the head up orientation the green circle represents the reference value r 1 rescaled for the chart a mean effective absolute domain of a large ship the blue and red ellipses represent the coefficient value of distances on each relative bearing for two ships respectively large medium and large small the assumed values do not exceed 1 the relative domains are shown similarly in fig 20 the reference domain is a mean domain of a large ship after rescaling depicted as the green circle with a radius r 1 the blue and red ellipses represent values of the coefficient of distance on different relative bearings of two ships medium large and small large the values exceed 1 which means that relative domains of ships get larger as the ship size decreases although an analysis of such data presentation could be one of the approaches in examining the impact of ship size it would be very difficult to find a relatively simple mathematical formula therefore further investigation of the ship size and speed is restricted to the length of domain semiaxes and position of the centre as the impact of ship size on absolute and relative domains varies as found in this study the impact of ship size on two types of domain is presented below mean absolute domains of ships of three different sizes are given in fig 18 it shows that the ship domain increases along with ship length the domain is shifted relative to the position of the navigator located in the centre of the coordinate system and that the ellipse centre changes as the ship size changes the parameters of these ellipses as well as the ellipses for relative domains are shown in table 4 27 y a i x b i c i where a i b i c i are function coefficients the

equal speed are specified in table 5 see fig 22 for a larger amount of data size of ships the fitness could have slightly different values of coefficients but this would not change the nature of the curves and relationships found the relationship between ship size and the relative domain was examined similarly to the above tests approximated parameters of mean relative domains were used for the plot table 6 the function coefficients for the major and minor semiaxes of the domain are given in table 7 3 3 2 impact of ship speed on the effective domain a medium size ship was used in all scenarios and passages in tests of ship speed impact on domain shape and size and absolute and relative domains were analysed separately only mean domains were examined the estimated parameters of mean absolute domains of ships proceeding in three speed variants are given in table 6 the impact of speed on absolute and relative domain size was examined similarly to tests of ship size impact table 5 and the coefficients of the function for the semi major axis a ia b ia c ia and semi minor axis a ib b ib c ib i 3 i 4 of the domain are given in table 7 3 3 3 impact of the size and speed on

obtained using eq 27 they are presented in table 8 coefficients describing relative domain semiaxes for different speed variants can be estimated in the same way the lengths of semiaxes of domains for ships of three sizes and for three different speed variants all cases are presented in figs 24 and 25 the lengths of semi major axis a plotted in fig 24 refer to the domains of ships of three sizes and for three different speed variants the calculations used the coefficients given therein the obtained sets of points are marked in the chart by diamonds and different colours green blue and red respectively for speed variants high low equal low high similar operations were performed for the semi minor axis fig 25 from a bunch of curves thus obtained it is possible to determine lengths of the domain semi major and semi minor axes for a given ship size and speed variant figs 24 and 25 show how the ship size and speed affect the lengths of semi major and semi minor axes for the ship domain herein the mean absolute domain the data represented by a bunch of curves allow determining the lengths of the semi major and semi minor axes for a set ship length and speed variant by interpolation between the curves and value readout on the y axis an example of finding the length of the domain semi major axis of a ship 220 m long is shown by purple arrows in fig 24 based on the previous separate mathematical descriptions of ship size and speed impact on the lengths of semi major and semi minor axes under consideration and after an analysis of the bunches of curves shown in figs 24

the initial values a eq v b eq v are the lengths of the semi major and semi minor axes for the equal speed variant terms δf av v δf bv v can be called semiaxes length allowances for speed alteration

discussion we have determined mathematical relationships between the ship domain size lengths of ellipse major and semi minor axes and ship size and speed the same relations apply to absolute and relative domains the only difference is in coefficients used in the said relationships taking into account the scope of the tests including ship size and speed we can assume that the relationships hold true for ship length ranging from 95 to 261 3 m and speed from slow ahead to full ahead if a 10 15 extrapolation of length and speed is accepted domains could be determined for small ships of the coaster type 80 m in length to panamax ships 294 m long this scope represents a vast majority of cargo and passenger ships trading internationally the presented method of ship domain determination based on simulation tests have advantages and limitations one advantage of the method of partial domains is its straightforward and unambiguous determination of the minimum mean and maximum domains this method of domain determination allows us to account for ship contours and position of ship s antennas consequently the analysis can be based on the shortest actual passing distances as expected we found an explicit dependence of domain size and shape on the ship size examining the impact of ship speed on the shape and size of ship domain we predicted it would be greater the observed impact however was less considerable than we expected this calls for more accurate analysis because in domains determined by analytical methods described in available publications this dependence is stronger research has shown that a ship proceeding at a relatively slow speed tries to maintain longer distances to other ships i e greater domain which is contrary to common belief that the domain increases along with ship s speed regardless of the speed the ratio of domain length to width is approximately 2 1 an interesting relationship has observed between absolute and relative domains as expected the larger ship has a greater absolute domain than the smaller of two ships involved for relative domains expressed in ship lengths the relationship is opposite the smaller ship has a greater domain than the larger ship fig 20 this may occur because navigators tend to strictly stick to customarily adopted distances for passing another ship e g 2 nm 1 nm 0 5 nm or because assessing a situation they use the minimum turning circle diameter stated in ship lengths 5 conclusions this study examines the impact of ship size and speed on domain shape and size in a restricted area based on simulation tests these allow us to investigate how certain factors affect the ship domain parameters three methods of ship domain determination are presented partial domains ship traces and trace density to determine domains of various size ships proceeding at various speeds we chose to use the method of partial domains minimum mean and maximum domains were determined we consider absolute domains with parameters expressed in metres and relative domains expressed as ship lengths each domain was approximated to an ellipse with the ship s centre offset out of the ellipse axis a considerable impact of the ship size on domain shape and size was found while ship speed turns out to have a smaller impact on the domain shape and size mathematical relations between domain shape and size and ship size and speed were formulated these relationships allow us to determine domains of cargo and passenger ships operating internationally it was ascertained that the changes in relative domain shape and size depending on ship size and speed variants are not the same as changes in absolute domains the research will be continued to examine other factors affecting ship domain shape and size and to implement the

21206,high pressure water jet propulsion is a new type of propulsion which has the characteristics of simple system structure small energy loss in the water inlet duct easy vectored control without additional drag force and so on underwater jet noise radiation of high pressure waterjet propulsion is an important factor that would directly determine the stealth performance of underwater vehicles a co simulation method combining the cfd computational fluid dynamics and caa computational aeroacoustics was used in this paper to study and analyze the underwater jet noise radiation characteristics of high pressure water jet propulsion the realizable k ε turbulence model was used to numerically simulate the flow field of waterjet and the fft processing of the flow field results were implemented by use of the actran icfd module in order to obtain the sound source of the waterjet radiation then the lighthill acoustic analogy theory was utilized to achieve the underwater jet noise radiation characteristic consequently the effects of inlet velocity on the underwater jet noise radiation characteristics of high pressure waterjet propulsion were researched the results indicated that the underwater jet noise radiation of high pressure water jet propulsion mainly comes from the mixing area where is the 8 10 times diameter away from the nozzle outlet and the increase of the inlet flow velocity would enlarge the sound pressure level of the underwater jet noise radiation in addition the underwater noise jet radiation is directional and mainly propagates in the axial direction however the inlet velocity has little influence on the frequency domain characteristics of underwater jet noise radiation and the underwater jet noise radiation has high energy below the frequency 200 hz the research provides theoretical guidance for reducing the underwater jet noise radiation of high pressure waterjet propulsion and improving the stealth performance of underwater vehicles keywords high

researched to reduce the flow and pressure pulsation of piston pump through absorbing the pulsation by use of integrating accumulate group zu et al 2019 investigated to control the vibration of high pressure water hydraulic piston pump in order to reduce the vibration and noise of high pressure waterjet propulsion however due to its special propulsion principle which utilizes the high pressure water hydraulic piston pump to pressurize the low pressure propulsion medium absorbing through the inlet and spray from the nozzle with high speed to form reverse thrust the jet noise would generate accompanying with the high pressure water jet leaving away from the nozzle furthermore the noise level of the water jet propulsion would directly determine the stealth performance of underwater vehicles as for the importance of acoustic signature management for the stealth performance of underwater vehicles vrijdag and schuttevaer 2019 reducing the sound level of high pressure water jet propulsion has become an important development trend and it is an inevitable requirement to reduce the underwater jet noise radiation in the application and development of high pressure water jet

the flow there has also been the simulation using des simulation and fw h equation on a normal pumpjet propulsor pjp model and a pjp model with the sawtooth duct denghui et al 2019 wang et al 2011 calculated the flow field and radiated noise of the jet using the smagorinsky eddy viscosity model and fw h ffowcs williams hawkings equation in summary the high pressure water jet propulsion driven by water hydraulic piston pump is a ramjet propulsion thruster it is the supplement of low pressure and high flow water jet propulsion technology predecessors have studied the basic principle reverse thrust characteristics of high pressure water jet propulsion and flow pressure pulsation control of piston pumps etc however there are few researches on the underwater jet noise of the high pressure water jet propulsion a calculation method that combines realizable k ε turbulence model and lighthill acoustic analogy theory is used in this paper to simulate the underwater jet noise of high pressure water jet propulsion fluent software is used to simulate the flow field model and the simulation results of flow field are processed by icfd the lighthill acoustic analogy theory is adopted to simulate and analyze the underwater jet noise characteristics of high pressure water jet propulsion by using actran software the distribution laws of the flow field and sound field are summarized which provides some valuable reference for the research of underwater jet noise radiation characteristics of high pressure water jet propulsion 2 working principle of high pressure water jet propulsion high pressure water jet propulsion is a kind of novel navigator thruster as shown in fig 1 it mainly comprises inlet port electric motor water positive displacement piston pump thrust chamber nozzle and hose and it takes water as the medium the water positive displacement piston pump suctions in low pressure water from surroundings through the inlet port and pressurize the water as high pressure propulsion medium then the high pressure water is delivered into the nozzle through the high pressure hose high speed water jet is formed and reverse thrust is generated and driving navigator move forward zhang et al 2019 due to the large diameter of the water inlet the flow velocity and dynamic pressure of the water medium here are low and the reverse thrust of the device is less affected by the generated momentum therefore the influence of the water inlet on the reverse thrust is ignored and it is simplified to the static pressure state the water hydraulic piston pump is simplified into a constant pressure and constant current source the total force acting on the axial direction of the thrust chamber is equivalent to the reverse thrust of the water jet thruster and the reverse thrust is studied based on the force characteristics of the thrust chamber zhang et al 2019 the injection principle is shown in fig 2 and its thrust force can be derived as 1 f p a m v where m is the gross mass flow rate of the propulsion medium in the nozzle outlet cross section a represents the outlet cross section area of nozzle ρ is the density of the propulsion medium p is the jet pressure according to eq 1 the relationship between thrust and nozzle inlet flow rate nozzle inlet pressure and nozzle diameter can be obtained the flow rate pressure and nozzle diameter are mutually coupled and affected each other reasonably determining the parameters among the three can make the water jet propulsion obtain good reverse thrust characteristics there is jet noise in high pressure water jet propulsion and the jet noise is also affected by the system flow rate pressure and nozzle diameter by studying the relationship between the water jet noise of the high pressure water jet propulsion and the system flow rate the reverse thrust and the water jet noise are combined to improve the performance of the ships and the concealment of the ships 3 acoustic model of high pressure waterjet the numerical calculation process of underwater jet noise characteristic analysis is shown in fig 3 the flow field is calculated first the realizable k ε turbulence model is used in fluent software to calculate the flow field grid then the flow field results are imported into the icfd module of actran to perform sound source extraction and interpolation icfd is the only tool for interfacing cfd codes with actran it reads cfd mesh and results from various cfd solvers and projects relevant information on the acoustic mesh in a format readable by actran icfd can be used to plot the average flow cfd fields velocity density pressure temperature to be considered in convective acoustic analysis it can extract calculate and map noise sources from unstable cfd results for acoustic analysis and convert time domain data to frequency domain data fourier transform finally the lighthill acoustic analogy theory is used to simulate the underwater jet noise characteristics cfd is used in this paper to establish a nozzle water jet model and simulate the internal flow field characteristics the flow field calculation domain model is shown in fig 4 a icem is used to build a three dimensional model of the nozzle and the structured mesh is gridded the nozzle is conical axisymmetric structure the inlet diameter is d and its value is 300 mm the model outlet diameter is d and its value is 50 mm the cross sectional size of the fluid domain is 800 mm 300 mm the fluid domain is a cylinder in order to perform the calculation more accurately and save the calculation time under the premise of ensuring the calculation accuracy an appropriate mesh is divided in other words smaller grid spacing is used in the nozzle while larger in the rest finally the total number of cells is approximately 409 584 the number of nodes is 401 118 and the minimum orthogonal mass of the mesh is 0 66 after the grid independence analysis and reliability analysis of calculation model the grid quality meets the requirements icem is used again to build a three dimensional model of the sound field of the nozzle water jet and divide the mesh the sound field calculation grid is shown in fig 4 b firstly the structure grid of the sound source domain is meshed and the sound source domain is the flow field calculation domain smaller grid spacing is used in the nozzle while larger in the rest secondly the acoustic propagation domain and the infinite element boundary are meshed to ensure that the grids of the contact part of the acoustic propagation domain and the acoustic source domain coincide finally the nodes are merged because there are overlapping nodes on the contact part of the sound source domain and the sound propagation domain the nodes are merged between which distance is less than 0 001 m the calculation domain of sound field is shown in fig 5 it includes acoustic source domain acoustic propagation domain and infinite element boundary and the acoustic source domain is the flow field calculation domain it can be known from the above that the lighthill acoustic analogy theory is needed during the simulation of the underwater jet noise of the high pressure water jet propulsion the flow field and sound field can be combined perfectly by it the lighthill acoustic analogy equation is derived from the continuity equation and the n s equation continuity equation of flow field 2 ρ t ρ ν i x i 0 n s equation of flow field 3 ρ ν i t ρ ν i ν j x j p i j x j and 4 p i j p δ i j τ i j where ρ is fluid density v is velocity t is time x is space coordinate i j represent coordinate axis p is fluid pressure δ ij is kronecker function when i j δ ij 1 when i j δ ij 0 τ ij is viscous stress from equations eq 3 and eq 4 we can get 5 ρ ν i t c 0 2 ρ x j t i j x j where c 0 is the propagation speed of sound in the fluid and t ij is the lighthill stress tensor and 6 t i j ρ ν i ν j δ i j p p 0 δ i j c 0 2 ρ ρ 0 τ i j where ρ is the fluid density ρ 0 is the fluid density when undisturbed p is the pressure to which the fluid is subjected p 0 is the pressure to which the fluid is subjected when it is not disturbed assuming the working medium is an ideal fluid and combining eq 2 and eq 5 the following equation can be get 7 2 ρ ρ 0 t 2 c 0 2 2 ρ ρ 0 x i x j 2 t i j x i x j where ρ and p are the instantaneous value which are the sum of the pulsation component and the steady state value ρ 0 and p 0 are the steady state value ρ and p are the acoustic value of the pulsation ρ ρ ρ 0 p p p 0 and relative to the reynolds stress the viscous stress τ ij is a negligible amount and ρ ρ 1 p p 1 so we get 8 2 ρ t 2 c 0 2 2 ρ x i x j 2 t i j x i x j where t i j ρ ν i ν j eq 8 is the basic equation of sound produced by water jet fluid the left side of lighthill acoustic analogy equation is the propagation process of sound waves and the right side of the equation is the influence of sound source terms such as external factors and flow changes on sound this equation separates the acoustic terms in the continuity equation and the n s equation from the flow field and the flow field information is used as a known term to solve the acoustic wave equation on the left side of the equation 4 cfd strategy and mesh the simulation model of high pressure water jet propulsion system was built and the fluid computational domain mainly consists two zones that is the nozzle domain and the waterjet domain the nozzle domain is the generation area of high speed waterjet converting from high pressure water stream the waterjet zone is the free development area of high speed waterjet and the waterjet zone is an axial symmetric cylinder with the dimension of ϕ300 800 mm the boundary condition is as shown in fig 4 the k ε turbulence model can be used to calculate turbulence with high reynolds number and its calculation time is shorter than that of large eddy simulation in rotating homogeneous shear flows free flows including jets and mixing layers channel and boundary layer flows flows with complex secondary flow features and complex turbulent flows involving strong pressure gradients separation crossflow and shocks the realizable k ε model is more in line with the real situation the realizable k ε model is able to predict the spreading rate for axisymmetric jets as well as that for planar jets and the realizable k ε model is considered to be the best turbulence model to predicate the flow field characteristics of a round jet fluent and realizable k ε turbulence model are used to calculate the flow field characteristics of high pressure water jet the material is water and its parameters is set according to the physic properties of water at the temperature of 20 c and the parametric setting is as shown in table 1 the pressure based solver simple is used as the pressure velocity coupling algorithm the pressure velocity direct coupling algorithm was used to solve the flow in the present calculation the gradient is discretized using least squares cell based scheme the momentum equations and turbulent kinetic equations were discretized by a first order upwind scheme and standard scheme was used for the pressure equations the other items remained as default setting the time step in this simulation was 5 10 5 s 2500 time steps are calculated and the result was auto saved at each time step the commercial cfd code ansys fluent was utilized to solve the governing equations during calculating the relative total pressure and the velocity at each inlet and outlet were monitored if those parameters were hovering and fluctuating at a constant value and all residuals were lower than 1 0 10 5 the calculation was considered as convergent and the iteration was terminated as shown in fig 6 the grids were constructed by ansys icem cfd in this work the mesh size was initially set as 340 000 coarse and then increased to 400 000 medium and480 000 fine by 1 2 times of the cell number in axial direction the maximum velocity and maximum turbulent kinematic energy was utilized to confirm the independence and reliability of the grid table 2 presents the result of the maximum velocity and maximum turbulent kinematic energy against mesh number apparently there is a slight deviation between the results of coarse mesh and others the medium one and the fine one gave few differences and the error is within 0 5 thus the mesh with 400 000 elements was adopted in the following simulation considering the calculation accuracy and time 5 result and discussion fig 7 a is the cloud diagram of flow field velocity at different nozzle inlet flow velocities at different nozzle inlet flow velocities the length of the core area of the jet is about 8 times the nozzle diameter regardless of the nozzle inlet flow velocities as the distance from the nozzle outlet increases the jet area continuously exchanges energy with the surrounding waters and the jet velocity gradually decreases but the radial influence range is getting larger and larger fig 7 b is the axial velocity distribution of the flow field at different nozzle inlet flow velocities when the flow velocity at the nozzle inlet is 5 1 m s within about 8 times the outlet diameter distance from the nozzle the axis velocity is constant about 32 82 m s then the axis velocity decreases rapidly when the distance from the nozzle is more than 10 times the outlet diameter the velocity gradient at the axis is small and the velocity changes slowly and at different nozzle inlet flow velocities the shapes of axis velocity curve are the same and the changes are consistent the velocity in the jet core is constant and the velocity is the largest in the transition region the velocity changes greatly and decreases rapidly the velocity of the fully developed area changes slowly fig 8 is the turbulent energy distribution diagram of the flow field at different nozzle inlet flow velocities it can be seen from the figure that under different nozzle inlet flow velocities the distribution of turbulent energy is roughly the same it is mainly concentrated in the edge of the core area and near the transition region because the turbulent flow energy is mainly generated by the velocity changes the velocity gradient in this area is large and the turbulent energy is also large here in addition in the process of fluid ejecting from the nozzle the kinetic energy of the fluid is consumed to drive the movement of the static water area so the farther away from the nozzle outlet the smaller the turbulence energy the maximum velocity and turbulent energy of the jet area under different nozzle inlet flow velocities are shown in table 3 the maximum velocity and turbulent kinetic energy with the nozzle inlet velocity in fig 9 it can be seen from fig 9 a that the maximum velocity in the jet region is positively correlated with the nozzle inlet flow velocity and it can be seen from fig 9 b that the maximum turbulent energy in the jet region is also positively correlated with the nozzle inlet flow velocity therefore the greater the nozzle inlet flow velocity the greater the maximum velocity and turbulent energy in the jet zone after the simulation results of the flow field are obtained the sound field is calculated actran software is used to simulate the sound field of the nozzle model lighthill acoustic analogy is used to calculate the acoustic characteristics icfd module is used to process the simulation results of flow field the caa source is set and import flow field calculation results into actran the dft is defined and convert time domain sound source files into frequency domain sound source files then the sound field grid is imported material is set to water the speed of sound in water v 1 1448 9 m s density ρ 998 kg m3 field point and virtual microphones are created at different points to capture the corresponding spl as shown in fig 10 the frequency analysis the finite fluid components and the infinite fluid component are created and the lighthill volume boundary condition solver frf post processing parameters and maps post processing parameters are set then we can get the sound field results fig 11 shows the sound field characteristics of water jet at different nozzle inlet flow velocities the sound pressure in the red part is higher at different inlet flow velocities the red part is mainly concentrated at 8 10d from the nozzle outlet that is to say the jet noise of the nozzle mainly comes from the mixing region from 8 to 10d away from the nozzle outlet this is because the turbulent flow energy here is large which is the main cause of jet noise it can be seen from fig 11 that when the nozzle inlet flow velocity is 5 1 m s the maximum sound pressure level at low frequency is the highest which is 119 db the low frequency sound pressure level of all five sets of velocities is higher so the nozzle water jet radiation noise at low frequency is larger it can also be seen from fig 11 that the noise of the water jet is concentrated in the axial direction so the noise mainly propagates along the axial direction and has directivity the sound pressure level curve of nozzle jet radiation at different nozzle inlet flow velocities is shown in fig 12 when the nozzle inlet flow velocity is 5 1 m s the radiated sound pressure level in the low frequency band is high then the radiated sound pressure level curve drops rapidly when the frequency is greater than 200 hz the radiated sound pressure level curve declines more gently and finally tends to be stable the radiated sound pressure level curves at five groups of flow velocity have similar shapes and the same change trend the sound pressure level curves of the nozzle water jet radiation are larger at low frequencies and then the sound pressure level curves drop rapidly and tend to be stable this is because water jet noise is caused by changes in fluid velocity and turbulent motion in the flow field jet radiation noise increases with increasing turbulent flow energy the turbulent energy of the flow field is different at different frequencies and the jet noise is also different at low frequency the turbulent flow energy is large and the jet noise is high the overall sound pressure levels at different flow velocities are shown in fig 12 when the nozzle inlet flow velocity is 5 1 m s the overall sound pressure level is 155 3 db and the radiated sound pressure level curve is at the bottom when the nozzle inlet flow velocities is 7 6 m s 10 2 m s 12 7 m s 15 3 m s the overall sound pressure level is 160 8 db 165 7 db 168 3 db 170 5 db so the nozzle inlet flow velocity increases the overall sound pressure level increases and the jet radiation noise increases this is because the maximum velocity and turbulent energy in the jet area are positively related to the nozzle inlet flow velocity as shown in table 2 and figs 8 fig 9 the greater the flow velocity of the nozzle inlet the greater the turbulent energy in the flow field and the higher the sound pressure level of the jet radiation it can be concluded that at different nozzle inlet flow velocities the radiated sound pressure level curves of the nozzle water jet noise are larger at low frequencies that is to say the water jet noise is mainly concentrated in the low frequency band and gradually stabilizes after the frequency is greater than 200 hz and the larger the nozzle inlet flow velocities the higher the radiated sound pressure level of the nozzle water jet noise the sound pressure level curve of nozzle water jet radiation at different distances from the nozzle outlet on the same axis is shown in fig 13 a at different nozzle inlet flow velocities the sound pressure level value at the nozzle outlet is higher the sound pressure level value at 1 0 m away from the nozzle outlet is the lower because it is far away from the nozzle outlet due to energy dissipation the turbulent flow energy is reduced resulting in a lower sound pressure level here in the stable stage of the sound pressure level curve radiated by the nozzle jet when the nozzle inlet flow velocity is 5 1 m s the difference in sound pressure level between different distance points is large when the nozzle inlet flow velocity is 15 3 m s the difference in sound pressure level values between different distance points on the same axis is small therefore the larger the nozzle inlet flow velocity the smaller the change in sound pressure level between different points on the same axis this is because the greater the nozzle inlet flow velocity the higher the radiated sound pressure level of the nozzle water jet noise and the smaller the energy dissipation during the jet process the smaller the change in sound pressure level between different points the polar coordinate radiation sound pressure level curve of the nozzle water jet at a radius of 22 mm from the nozzle outlet is shown in fig 13 b where the sound pressure level is the sound pressure level monitored by a virtual microphone with a radius of 22 mm in the figure 0 represents the injection direction the shapes of the radiated sound pressure level curve are similar at different flow velocities the sound pressure level value is larger in the direction of 0 180 and smaller in the direction of 90 270 that is to say the sound pressure level in the axial direction of the nozzle is larger and the sound pressure level in the radial direction of the nozzle is smaller therefore nozzle water jet radiation noise mainly propagates in the axial direction and has directivity fig 14 shows the sound pressure level curve of nozzle water jet radiation at different nozzle inlet flow velocities on the same axis point at the same point the change trend of sound pressure level curve is the same under different flow velocities and the greater the nozzle inlet flow velocity the higher the radiated sound pressure level of waterjet noise 6 conclusion this paper studied the underwater jet noise radiation characteristic of a novel high pressure water jet propulsion system which utilizes the high pressure water hydraulic piston pump instead of traditional turbomachinery to be as the energy conversion component a co simulation method combining the computational fluid dynamics cfd and computational acoustics ca was utilized to analyze the underwater jet radiation noise of the high pressure water jet propulsion the realizable k ε turbulence model and lighthill acoustic analogy were combined the waterjet model of the high pressure waterjet propulsion was established and the flow field was simulated by use of the realizable k ε model embedded in the fluent software and the flow field results were imported into actran to obtain the acoustic source through fft analysis by use of actran icfd then the underwater jet radiation noise characteristic was analyzed by solving the lighthill equation the results indicated that the underwater jet radiation noise source of the high pressure waterjet propulsion mainly comes from the mixing area where is 8 10 times nozzle diameter away from the nozzle outlet and the sound pressure level is positively correlated to the waterjet velocity the larger the inlet flow velocity in the high pressure water jet propulsion the higher the sound pressure level of the waterjet noise radiation in addition the underwater noise radiation is directional and mainly propagates in the axial direction however the waterjet velocity has little influence on the frequency domain characteristic of underwater jet noise radiation because the inlet velocity has limited influence on the fluid pressure pulsation which is the determined factor of the noise radiation frequency in addition the underwater jet noise radiation has high energy in low frequency regions with the frequency band of 0 200 hz and the jet noise radiation amplitude is relatively smooth above 200 hz through the investigation on the formation mechanism of the underwater jet noise radiation of high pressure water jet propulsion and the influence of inlet velocity it would help to deeply cognize the underwater jet noise radiation characteristic of high pressure waterjet propulsion furthermore it is of beneficial to guiding to obtain high pressure waterjet propulsion with low underwater jet noise radiation characteristic and contributing to promote the engineering

21206,high pressure water jet propulsion is a new type of propulsion which has the characteristics of simple system structure small energy loss in the water inlet duct easy vectored control without additional drag force and so on underwater jet noise radiation of high pressure waterjet propulsion is an important factor that would directly determine the stealth performance of underwater vehicles a co simulation method combining the cfd computational fluid dynamics and caa computational aeroacoustics was used in this paper to study and analyze the underwater jet noise radiation characteristics of high pressure water jet propulsion the realizable k ε turbulence model was used to numerically simulate the flow field of waterjet and the fft processing of the flow field results were implemented by use of the actran icfd module in order to obtain the sound source of the waterjet radiation then the lighthill acoustic analogy theory was utilized to achieve the underwater jet noise radiation characteristic consequently the effects of inlet velocity on the underwater jet noise radiation characteristics of high pressure waterjet propulsion were researched the results indicated that the underwater jet noise radiation of high pressure water jet propulsion mainly comes from the mixing area where is the 8 10 times diameter away from the nozzle outlet and the increase of the inlet flow velocity would enlarge the sound pressure level of the underwater jet noise radiation in addition the underwater noise jet radiation is directional and mainly propagates in the axial direction however the inlet velocity has little influence on the frequency domain characteristics of underwater jet noise radiation and the underwater jet noise radiation has high energy below the frequency 200 hz the research provides theoretical guidance for reducing the underwater jet noise radiation of high pressure waterjet propulsion and improving the stealth performance of underwater vehicles keywords high pressure water jet propulsion water jet noise radiation cfd caa 1 introduction with the depletion of land resources countries all over the world have set their sights on the vast ocean the development and utilization of marine resources has become one of the most important factors determining the boom or decay of a country in view of the importance of the ocean all countries are actively carrying out researches on underwater vehicles and propulsion methods liu et al 2015 gu et al 2020 at present the propeller propulsion technology is most widely used in ships it has always dominated the application of ships but it has the disadvantages of high noise and low resistance to cavitation huang et al 2020 park et al 2020 with the rapid development and continuous improvement of water jet

huang et al 2020 high pressure waterjet propulsion is a novel type of propulsion technology whose propulsion principle is totally different from the axis mixed pump waterjet propulsion and its

vibration and noise performance of high pressure waterjet propulsion has mainly focused on the high pressure water hydraulic piston pump wu et al 2017 wang et al 2018 2019 luo et al 2011 2015 researched to reduce the flow and pressure pulsation of piston pump through absorbing the pulsation by use of integrating accumulate group zu et al 2019 investigated to control the vibration of high pressure water hydraulic piston pump in order to reduce the vibration and noise of high pressure waterjet propulsion however due to its special propulsion principle which utilizes the high pressure water hydraulic piston pump to pressurize the low pressure propulsion medium absorbing through the inlet and spray from the nozzle with high speed to form reverse thrust the jet noise would generate accompanying with the high pressure water jet leaving away from the nozzle furthermore the noise level of the water jet propulsion would directly determine the stealth performance of underwater vehicles as for the importance of acoustic signature management for the stealth performance of underwater vehicles vrijdag and schuttevaer 2019 reducing the sound level of high pressure water jet propulsion has become an important development trend and it is an inevitable requirement to reduce the underwater jet noise radiation in the application and development of high pressure water jet propulsion technology the research on hydrodynamic noise has been slow to develop and there are few researches on underwater jet noise currently liu et al 2014 even the extensive research about the numerical method for aeroacoustics simulation has been made available sassanis et al 2017 venkatesh 2019 kim and yoon 2020 the small amount of researches about underwater jet noise also referred to the theory of aerodynamics in the field of noise prediction lighthill s acoustic analogy which was originally developed by lighthill in 1952 has been widely applied karabasov et at 2010 tautz et al 2018 and the lighthill equation was proceeded by ffowcs williams and hawkings to develop the ffowcs williams hawkings fw h equation which considers moving boundary influence in the flow field and extends it to hydroacoustic problems lighthill acoustic analogy is the theoretical fundaments for studying water jet noise radiation hao et al 2016 and the use of hybrid computational aero acoustics caa methods which make use of reynolds averaged navier stokes rans calculations to compute the mean flow field together with acoustic analogies has been proven advantageous as an engineering tool yu et al 2020 qin et al 2019 liu y 2016 liu 2014 qin et al 2019 presented a hybrid method combining large eddy simulation with acoustic analogy to predict three dimensional far field noise induced by

transient flow field is numerically solved by les the flow field simulation results are used to compute the flow induced noise with the fw h integral equation method and bem method based on lighthill acoustic analogy equation in actran christopher et al 2018 used ansys cfx 17 0 for determining the flow induced noise in all components of vertical inline pump using lighthill analogy and analyzed the relation between dipole quadrupole sources of noise as well as the proudman sound power for inlet pipe for various flow conditions using lighthill analogy the hybrid method of noise prediction was adopted to enable the numerical prediction of radiated underwater noise from the auv yu et al 2020 a hybrid method of combining large eddy simulation les and lighthill s acoustic analogy theory is established to compute the hydrodynamic noise of underwater jet noise the solutions obtained by the hybrid method are compared with the experimental data available in open research the trend of the sound pressure level versus the frequency at the observation point agrees consistently with the experimental data the results indicated les lighthill hybrid method is able to predict the underwater jet noise or hydrodynamic noise liu et al 2014 liu et al 2016 numerically investigated underwater flow noise characteristic based on the combination of large eddy simulation theory and lighthill s acoustic analogy equation and find out that the total level of flow noise from the nozzle of uniform type is decided by the pressure of flow noise source vekteris et al 2020 dealt with the changes in the density of pulsating water and air flow generated in pulsating flow ejector by transforming the fluid motion equation to lighthill s equation describing density change and acoustic radiation of the flow there has also been the simulation using des simulation and fw h equation on a normal pumpjet propulsor pjp model and a pjp model with the sawtooth duct denghui et al 2019 wang et al 2011 calculated the flow field and radiated noise of the jet using the smagorinsky eddy viscosity model and fw h ffowcs williams hawkings equation in summary the high pressure water jet propulsion driven by water hydraulic piston pump is a ramjet propulsion thruster it is the supplement of low pressure and high flow water jet propulsion technology predecessors have studied the basic principle reverse thrust characteristics of high pressure water jet propulsion and flow pressure pulsation control of piston pumps etc however there are few researches on the underwater jet noise of the high pressure

to simulate and analyze the underwater jet noise characteristics of high pressure water jet propulsion by using actran software the distribution laws of the flow field and sound field are summarized which provides some valuable reference for the research of underwater jet noise radiation characteristics of high pressure water jet propulsion 2 working principle of high pressure water jet propulsion high pressure water jet propulsion is a kind of novel navigator thruster as shown in fig 1 it mainly comprises inlet port electric motor water positive displacement piston pump thrust chamber nozzle and hose and it takes water as the medium the water positive displacement piston pump suctions in low pressure water from surroundings through the inlet port and pressurize the water as high pressure propulsion medium then the high pressure water is delivered into the nozzle through the high pressure hose high speed water jet is formed and reverse thrust is generated and driving navigator move forward zhang et al 2019 due to the large diameter of the water inlet the flow velocity and dynamic pressure of the water medium here are low and the reverse thrust of the device is less affected by the generated momentum therefore the influence of the water inlet on the reverse thrust is ignored and it is simplified to the static pressure state the water hydraulic piston pump is simplified into a constant pressure and constant current source the total force acting on the axial direction of the thrust chamber is equivalent to the reverse thrust of the water jet thruster and the reverse thrust is studied based on the force characteristics of the thrust chamber zhang et al 2019 the injection principle is shown in fig 2 and its thrust force can be derived as 1 f p a m v where m is the gross mass flow rate of the propulsion medium in the nozzle outlet cross section a represents the outlet cross section area of nozzle ρ is the density of the propulsion medium p is the jet pressure according to eq 1 the relationship between thrust and nozzle inlet flow rate nozzle inlet pressure and nozzle diameter can be obtained the flow rate pressure and nozzle diameter are mutually coupled and affected each other reasonably determining the parameters among the three can make the water jet propulsion obtain good reverse thrust characteristics there is jet noise in high pressure water jet propulsion and the jet noise is also affected by the system flow rate pressure and nozzle diameter by studying the relationship between the water jet noise of the high pressure water jet propulsion and the system flow rate the reverse thrust and the water jet noise are combined to improve the performance of the ships and the concealment of the ships 3 acoustic model of high pressure waterjet the numerical calculation process of underwater jet noise characteristic analysis is shown in fig 3 the flow field is calculated first the realizable k ε turbulence model is used in fluent software to calculate the flow field grid then the flow field results are imported into the icfd module of actran to perform sound source extraction and interpolation icfd is the only tool for interfacing cfd codes with actran it reads cfd mesh and results from various cfd solvers and projects relevant information on the acoustic mesh in a format readable by actran icfd can be used to plot the average flow cfd fields velocity density pressure temperature to be considered in convective acoustic analysis it can extract calculate and map noise sources from unstable cfd results for acoustic analysis and convert time domain data to frequency domain data fourier transform finally the lighthill acoustic analogy theory is used to simulate the underwater jet noise characteristics cfd is used in this paper to establish a nozzle water jet model and simulate the internal flow field characteristics the flow field calculation domain model is shown in fig 4 a icem is used to build a three

premise of ensuring the calculation accuracy an appropriate mesh is divided in other words smaller grid spacing is used in the nozzle while larger in the rest finally the total number of cells is approximately 409 584 the number of nodes is 401 118 and the minimum orthogonal mass of the mesh is 0 66 after the grid independence analysis and reliability analysis of calculation model the grid quality meets the requirements icem is used again to build a three dimensional model of the sound field of the nozzle water jet and divide the mesh the sound field calculation grid is shown in fig 4 b firstly the structure grid of the sound source domain is meshed and the sound source domain is the flow field calculation domain smaller grid spacing is used in the nozzle while larger in the rest secondly the acoustic propagation domain and the infinite element boundary are meshed to ensure that the grids of the contact part of the acoustic propagation domain and the acoustic source domain coincide finally the nodes are merged because there are overlapping nodes on the contact part of the sound source domain and the sound propagation domain the nodes are merged between which distance is less than 0 001 m the calculation domain of sound field is shown in fig 5 it includes acoustic source domain acoustic propagation domain and infinite element boundary and the acoustic source domain is the flow field calculation domain it can be known from the above that the lighthill acoustic analogy theory is needed during the simulation of the underwater jet noise of the high pressure water jet propulsion the flow field and sound field can be combined perfectly by it the lighthill acoustic analogy equation is derived from the continuity equation and the n s equation continuity equation of flow field 2 ρ t ρ ν i x i 0 n s equation of flow field 3 ρ ν i t ρ ν i ν j x j p i j x j and 4 p i j p δ i j τ i j where ρ is fluid density v is velocity t is time x is space coordinate i j represent coordinate axis p is fluid pressure δ ij is kronecker function when i j δ ij 1 when i j δ ij 0 τ ij is viscous stress from equations eq 3 and eq 4 we can get 5 ρ ν i t c 0 2 ρ x j t i j x j where c 0 is the propagation speed of sound in the fluid and t ij is the lighthill stress tensor and 6 t i j ρ ν i ν j δ i j p p 0 δ i j c 0 2 ρ ρ 0 τ i j where ρ is the fluid density ρ 0 is the fluid density when undisturbed p is the pressure to which the fluid is subjected p 0 is the pressure to which the fluid is subjected when it is not disturbed assuming the working medium is an ideal fluid and combining eq 2 and eq 5 the following equation can be get 7 2 ρ ρ 0 t 2 c 0 2 2 ρ ρ 0 x i x j 2 t i j x i x j where ρ and p are the instantaneous value which are the sum of the pulsation component and the steady state value ρ 0 and p 0 are the steady state value ρ and p are the acoustic value of the pulsation ρ ρ ρ 0 p p p 0 and relative to the reynolds stress the viscous stress τ ij is a negligible amount and ρ ρ 1 p p 1 so we get 8 2 ρ t 2 c 0 2 2 ρ x i x j 2 t i j x i x j where t i j ρ ν i ν j eq 8 is the basic equation of sound produced by water jet fluid the left side of lighthill acoustic analogy equation is the propagation process of sound waves and the right side of the equation is the influence of sound source terms such as external factors and flow changes on sound this equation separates the acoustic terms in the continuity equation and the n s equation from the flow field and the flow field information is used as a known term to solve the acoustic wave equation on the left side of the equation 4 cfd strategy and mesh the simulation model of high pressure water jet propulsion system was built and the fluid computational domain mainly consists two zones that is the nozzle domain and the waterjet domain the nozzle domain is the generation area of high speed waterjet converting from high pressure water stream the waterjet zone is the free development area of high speed waterjet and the waterjet zone is an axial symmetric cylinder with the dimension of ϕ300 800 mm the boundary condition is as shown in fig 4 the k ε turbulence model can be used to calculate turbulence with high reynolds number and its calculation time is shorter than that of large eddy simulation in rotating homogeneous shear flows free flows including jets and mixing layers channel and boundary layer flows flows with complex secondary flow features and complex turbulent flows involving strong pressure gradients separation crossflow and shocks the realizable k ε model is more in line with the real situation the realizable k ε model is able to predict the spreading rate for axisymmetric jets as well as that for planar jets and the realizable k ε model is considered to be the best turbulence model to predicate the flow field characteristics of a round jet fluent and realizable k ε turbulence model are used to calculate the flow field characteristics of high pressure water jet the material is water and its parameters is set according to the physic properties of water at the temperature of 20 c and the parametric setting is as shown in table 1 the pressure based solver simple is used as the pressure velocity coupling algorithm the pressure velocity direct coupling algorithm was used to solve the flow in the present calculation the gradient is discretized using least squares cell based scheme the momentum equations and turbulent kinetic equations were discretized by a first order upwind scheme and standard scheme was used for the pressure equations the other items remained as default setting the time step in this simulation was 5 10 5 s 2500 time steps are calculated and the result was auto saved at each time step the commercial cfd code ansys fluent was utilized to solve the governing equations during calculating the relative total pressure and the velocity at each inlet and outlet were monitored if those parameters were hovering and fluctuating at a constant value and all residuals were lower than 1 0 10 5 the calculation was considered as convergent and the iteration was terminated as shown in fig 6 the grids were constructed by ansys icem cfd in this work the mesh size was initially set as 340 000 coarse and then increased to 400 000 medium and480 000 fine by 1 2 times of the cell number in axial direction the maximum velocity and maximum turbulent kinematic energy was utilized to confirm the independence and reliability of the grid table 2 presents the result of the maximum velocity and maximum turbulent kinematic energy against mesh number apparently there is a slight deviation between the results of coarse mesh and others the medium one and the fine one gave few differences and the error is within 0 5 thus the mesh with 400 000 elements was adopted in the following simulation considering the calculation accuracy and time 5 result and discussion fig 7 a is the cloud diagram of flow field velocity at different nozzle inlet flow velocities at different nozzle inlet flow velocities the length of the core area of the jet is about 8 times the nozzle diameter regardless of the nozzle inlet flow velocities as the distance from the nozzle outlet increases the jet area continuously exchanges energy with the surrounding waters and the jet velocity gradually decreases but the radial influence range is getting larger and larger fig 7 b is the axial velocity distribution of the flow field at different nozzle inlet flow velocities when the flow velocity at the nozzle inlet is 5 1 m s within about 8 times the outlet diameter distance from the nozzle the axis velocity is constant about 32 82 m s then the axis velocity decreases rapidly when the distance from the nozzle is more than 10 times the outlet diameter the velocity gradient at the axis is small and the velocity changes slowly and at different nozzle inlet flow velocities the shapes of axis velocity curve are the same and the changes are consistent the velocity in the jet core is constant and the velocity is the largest in the transition region the velocity changes greatly and decreases rapidly the velocity of the fully developed area changes slowly fig 8 is the turbulent energy distribution diagram of the flow field at different nozzle inlet flow velocities it can be seen from the figure that under different nozzle inlet flow velocities the distribution of turbulent energy is roughly the same it is mainly concentrated in the edge of the core area and near the transition region because the turbulent flow energy is mainly generated by the velocity changes the velocity gradient in this area is large and the turbulent energy is also large here in addition in the process of fluid ejecting from the nozzle the kinetic energy of the fluid is consumed to drive the movement of the static water area so the farther away from the nozzle outlet the smaller the turbulence energy the maximum velocity and turbulent energy of the jet area under different nozzle inlet flow velocities are shown in table 3 the maximum velocity and turbulent kinetic energy with the nozzle inlet velocity in fig 9 it can be seen from fig 9 a that the maximum velocity in the jet region is positively correlated with the nozzle inlet flow velocity and it can be seen from fig 9 b that the maximum turbulent energy in the jet region is also positively correlated with the nozzle inlet flow velocity therefore the greater the nozzle inlet flow velocity the greater the maximum velocity and turbulent energy in the jet zone after the simulation results of the flow field are obtained the sound field is calculated actran software is used to simulate the sound field of the nozzle model lighthill acoustic analogy is used to calculate the acoustic characteristics icfd module is used to process the simulation results of flow field the caa source is set and import flow field calculation results into actran the dft is defined and convert time domain sound source files into frequency domain sound source files then the sound field grid is imported material is set to water the speed of sound in water v 1 1448 9 m s density ρ 998 kg m3 field point and virtual microphones are created at different points to capture the corresponding spl as shown in fig 10 the frequency analysis the finite fluid components and the infinite fluid component are created and the lighthill volume boundary condition solver frf post processing parameters and maps post processing parameters are set then we can get the sound field results fig 11 shows the sound field characteristics of water jet at different nozzle inlet flow velocities the sound pressure in the red part is higher at different inlet flow velocities the red part is mainly concentrated at 8 10d from the nozzle outlet that is to say the jet noise of the nozzle mainly comes from the mixing region from 8 to 10d away from the nozzle outlet this is because the turbulent flow energy here is large which is the main cause of jet noise it can be seen from fig 11 that when the nozzle inlet flow velocity is 5 1 m s the maximum sound pressure level at low frequency is the highest which is 119 db the low frequency sound pressure level of all five sets of velocities is higher so the nozzle water jet radiation noise at low frequency is larger it can also be seen from fig 11 that the noise of the water jet is concentrated in the axial direction so the noise mainly propagates along the axial direction and has directivity the sound pressure level curve of nozzle jet radiation at different nozzle inlet flow velocities is shown in fig 12 when the nozzle inlet flow velocity is 5 1 m s the radiated sound pressure level in the low frequency band is high then the radiated sound pressure level curve drops rapidly when the frequency is greater than 200 hz the radiated sound pressure level curve declines more gently and finally tends to be stable the radiated sound pressure level curves at five groups of flow velocity have similar shapes and the same change trend the sound pressure level curves of the nozzle water jet radiation are larger at low frequencies and then the sound pressure level curves drop rapidly and tend to be stable this is because water jet noise is caused by changes in fluid velocity and turbulent motion in the flow field jet radiation noise increases with increasing turbulent flow energy the turbulent energy of the flow field is different at different frequencies and the jet noise is also different at low frequency the turbulent flow energy is large and the jet noise is high the overall sound pressure levels at different flow velocities are shown in fig 12 when the nozzle inlet flow velocity is 5 1 m s the overall sound pressure level is 155 3 db and the radiated sound pressure level curve is at the bottom when the nozzle inlet flow velocities is 7 6 m s 10 2 m s 12 7 m s 15 3 m s the overall sound pressure level is 160 8 db 165 7 db 168 3 db 170 5 db so the nozzle inlet flow velocity increases the overall sound pressure level increases and the jet radiation noise increases this is because the maximum velocity and turbulent energy in the jet area are positively related to the nozzle inlet flow velocity as shown in table 2 and figs 8 fig 9 the greater the flow velocity of the nozzle inlet the greater the turbulent energy in the flow field and the higher the sound pressure level of the jet radiation it can be concluded that at different nozzle inlet flow velocities the radiated sound pressure level curves of the nozzle water jet noise are larger at low frequencies that is to say the water jet noise is mainly concentrated in the low frequency band and gradually stabilizes after the frequency is greater than 200 hz and the larger the nozzle inlet flow velocities the higher the radiated sound pressure level of the nozzle water jet noise the sound pressure level curve of nozzle water jet radiation at different distances from the nozzle outlet on the same axis is shown in fig 13 a at different nozzle inlet flow velocities the sound pressure level value at the nozzle outlet is higher the sound pressure level value at 1 0 m away from the nozzle outlet is the lower because it is far away from the nozzle outlet due to energy dissipation the turbulent flow energy is reduced resulting in a lower sound pressure level here in the stable stage of the sound pressure level curve radiated by the nozzle jet when the nozzle inlet flow velocity is 5 1 m s the difference in sound pressure level between different distance points is large when the nozzle inlet flow velocity is 15 3 m s the difference in sound pressure level values between different distance points on the same axis is small therefore the larger the nozzle inlet flow velocity the smaller the change in sound pressure level between different points on the same axis this is because the greater the nozzle inlet flow velocity the higher the radiated sound pressure level of the nozzle water jet noise and the smaller the energy dissipation during the jet process the smaller the change in sound pressure level between different points the polar coordinate radiation sound pressure level curve of the nozzle water jet at a radius of 22 mm from the nozzle outlet is shown in fig 13 b where the sound pressure level is the sound pressure level monitored by a virtual microphone with a radius of 22 mm in the figure 0 represents the injection direction the shapes of the radiated sound pressure level curve are similar at different flow velocities the sound pressure level value is larger in the direction of 0 180 and smaller in the direction of 90 270 that is to say the sound pressure level in the axial direction of the nozzle is larger and the sound pressure level in the radial direction of the nozzle is smaller therefore nozzle water jet radiation noise mainly propagates in the axial direction and has directivity fig 14 shows the sound pressure level curve of nozzle water jet radiation at different nozzle inlet flow velocities on the same axis point at the same point the change trend of sound pressure level curve is the same under different flow velocities and the greater the nozzle inlet flow velocity the higher the radiated sound pressure level of waterjet noise 6 conclusion this paper studied the underwater jet noise radiation characteristic of a novel high pressure water jet propulsion system which utilizes the high pressure water hydraulic piston pump instead of traditional turbomachinery to be as the energy conversion component a co simulation method combining the computational fluid dynamics cfd and computational acoustics ca was utilized to analyze the underwater jet radiation noise of the high pressure water jet propulsion the realizable k ε turbulence model and lighthill acoustic analogy were combined the waterjet model of the high pressure waterjet propulsion was established and the flow field was simulated by use of the realizable k ε model embedded in the fluent software and the flow field results were imported into actran to obtain the acoustic source through fft analysis by use of actran icfd then the underwater jet radiation noise characteristic was analyzed by solving the lighthill equation the results indicated that the underwater jet radiation noise source of the high pressure waterjet propulsion mainly comes from the mixing area where is 8 10 times nozzle diameter away from the nozzle outlet and the sound pressure level is positively correlated to the waterjet velocity the larger the inlet flow velocity in the high pressure water jet propulsion the higher the sound pressure level of the waterjet noise radiation in addition the underwater noise radiation is directional and mainly propagates in the axial direction however the waterjet velocity has little influence on the frequency domain characteristic of underwater jet noise radiation because the inlet velocity has limited influence on the fluid pressure pulsation which is the determined factor of the noise radiation frequency in addition the underwater jet noise radiation has high energy in low frequency regions with the frequency band of 0 200 hz and the jet noise radiation amplitude is relatively smooth above 200 hz through the investigation on the formation mechanism of the underwater jet noise radiation of high pressure water jet propulsion and the influence of inlet velocity it would help to deeply cognize the underwater jet noise radiation characteristic of high pressure waterjet propulsion furthermore it is of beneficial to guiding to obtain high pressure waterjet propulsion with low underwater jet noise radiation characteristic and contributing to promote the engineering

21207,the wind energy input and whitecap dissipation terms in the third generation wave models have been improved over the time in this research the well known wam cycle4 known as st3 and the newest st6 package in wavewatch iii model were employed combined with era5 wind data over the persian gulf and gulf of oman in order to model the wave height appropriately over the study area in comparison with both in situ and satellite observations new combined error parameters were introduced leading to two major calibration values 1 the local calibration values relating to either persian gulf pgc or gulf of oman goc 2 the global calibration values over the entire computational domain pggoc considerably different model performance was appeared in the persian gulf pg compared to either the gulf of oman go or entire computational domain pggo when st3 package was employed while obtained results using st6 package showed negligible sensitivity to the domain both st3 and st6 packages with default tuning values significantly underestimated the wave height and peak period in pg however slight underestimation 0 03 m for wave height and overestimation 0 1 s for mean wave period were obtained in go during the time period the cyclone phet has traversed across the study area the model overestimated the wave height in comparison with altimeter dataset mean bias distribution over the study area indicates that calibrated st6 outperforms calibrated st3 over go however both packages provide similar results over pg considering different methods for nonlinear interaction term led to similar directional wave spectrums over the study area and negligible changes in bulk wave parameters keywords wavewatch iii persian gulf gulf of oman st3 st6 phet cyclone era5 1 introduction wavewatch iii herein after wwiii model is a phase averaged wave model based on the conservation of wave action eq 1 1 d n d t s t o t ω where t is time n is wave action density and it is equal to e ω e is energy density spectrum and ω is angular frequency s t o t is the contribution of all sink and source terms and can be expressed as follows 2 s t o t s l n s i n s n l s d s s d b s b o t s t r s s c s i c e s r e f eq 2 includes linear input term s l n the exponential wind wave growth s i n nonlinear quadruplet wave wave interaction s n l dissipation due to white capping s d s depth induced wave breaking s d b wave bottom interaction s b o t that includes dissipation due to bottom friction and wave mud interaction triad wave wave interaction s t r scattering by bottom features s s c wave ice interaction s i c e and wave reflection due to shorelines and floating objects s r e f eq 1 and eq 2 are the same fundamental equations as implemented in other third generation wave models such as swan tomawac and wam numerous study focused on improving the terms s i n and s d s which are playing important roles in controlling the wave spectrum therefore diverse packages for these terms have been applied in the wwiii model the simplest formulation package is st1 also known as wam cycle3 which is presented by komen et al 1984 it includes two tuning parameters c i n c d s for s i n and s d s respectively a more complex formulation which considers air stability by the temperature difference between air and water is st2 this package is successful in oceanic scales but underestimates the wave height in regional domains tolman and chalikov 1996 janssen 1991 proposed wind input term as a function of u c in which c and u were the wave phase and friction velocity respectively unlike st1 package in which u was computed as u u 10 0 001 0 8 0 065 u 10 where u 10 was the wind velocity at 10 m height the friction velocity was computed with an iterative process in this formulation this method was implemented in wwiii model as st3 package the whitecap dissipation term in st3 is the summation of a linear and a nonlinear function of wave number k with weighting coefficients δ 1 and δ 2 as presented in eq 3 the c d s is a constant parameter k is wave number and n k θ is two dimensional wave action density function 3 s d s k θ c d s α 2 σ δ 1 k k δ 2 k k 2 n k θ also k σ α are mean wave number mean angular frequency and mean steepness respectively they are determined in the model as follows 4 k k p n k θ d k d θ n k θ 1 p σ σ p n k θ d k d θ n k θ 1 p α e k 2 note that δ 1 δ 2 c d s and p are the tuning parameters in st3 three sets of values are presented for tuning parameters in wwiii model the first set is related to the original wam cycle4 in which δ 1 0 5 δ 2 0 5 c d s 4 5 and p 0 5 the second set denoted by bja proposed by bidlot et al 2005 is δ 1 0 4 δ 2 0 6 c d s 2 1 and p 0 5 and the last set denoted by bid is proposed by bidlot 2012 in which δ 1 0 5 δ 2 0 5 c d s 1 33 and p 0 5 in st4 package the wind input term of st3 is used but s w c involves three parts a saturation based term a cumulative breaking term and a dissipation term to incorporate wave and turbulence interaction the saturation based term itself includes two parts that are weighted by δ and 1 δ and known as isotropic and direction dependent parts in cumulative breaking item the maximum frequency ratio that wipes out the short waves was considered this parameter was a function of the saturation spectrum and also a constant tuning value c c u since the third term due to wave and turbulence interaction was of secondary importance it was neglected by ardhuin et al 2010 however specific relations were presented in wwiii model to include it for the first time a new sink term for swell dissipation s s w e l l was proposed in st4 package it included the viscous and the turbulence contributions they were added in the model with weights of r v i s and r t u r which were functions of reynolds number st6 is the most recent package implemented in wwiii model by zieger et al 2015 wind input term in this package was proposed by donelan et al 2006 it includes a directional dependent wind input term w as a function of wave direction θ wind direction θ w phase speed velocity c and scaled wind velocity u 5 w 1 m a x 2 0 u c cos θ θ w 1 w 2 m i n 2 0 u c cos θ θ w 1 6 w w 1 a 0 w 2 in eq 5 scaled wind velocity was used instead of u 10 the scaling factor of 28 u was originally selected in earlier versions of wwiii model group 2016 komen et al 1984 tolman 2014 however this scale factor was tunable as 28 u or 32 u according to rogers et al 2012 in the swan model liu et al 2019 reported that the overestimation of wave energy in high frequency tail of the spectrum could be alleviated when 32 u was used their suggestion for the scale factor is now the default value in the wwiii model version 6 07 in this study 32 u will be used in all simulations drag coefficient c d is required to obtain u in st6 package the drag coefficient for u 10 50 m s is determined according to eq 7 hwang 2011 7 c d 10 4 8 058 0 967 u 10 0 016 u 10 2 when wind and wave are aligned u c cos θ θ w 0 w 1 will be dominant item in eq 6 however during opposing wind direction u c cos θ θ w 0 the term a 0 w 2 called as negative wind input s n e g is important the value of a 0 0 09 was used in this study according to liu et al 2017 all described procedure for wind input term in st6 package is valid only when the contributions of wave induced stress and viscous stress were lower than ρ c d u 2 violation of this condition means wave induced stress which is a function of wind input term was inappropriately estimated therefore modification of wind input term is needed as eq 8 the reduction term l k in eq 9 is a function of wave age u c and a constant value μ which is determined through an iterative procedure until the mentioned condition is met rogers et al 2012 zieger et al 2015 8 s i n k l k s i n k 9 l k min 1 exp μ 1 u c the dissipation term in st6 package is as follows 10 s d s k θ t 1 k θ t 2 k θ n k θ the term t 1 includes inherent breaking and the term t 2 includes cumulative effects of short wave breaking due to longer waves at each frequency rogers et al 2012 zieger et al 2015 both t 1 and t 2 in their relations need a threshold action function n t then the term δ k n k n t k is calculated to check whether n k is greater than n t k to activate the whitecap dissipation or not threshold action function is calculated by eq 11 in which ε t 0 035 2 according to babanin et al 2007 11 n t k ε t a k k 3 the energy content of the spectrum falls below the threshold level in decaying wind sea condition and as a consequence the dissipation due to whitecap will be inactive therefore positive bias for significant wave height would be observed similar to st4 package the swell dissipation in st6 overcomes this problem ardhuin et al 2010 rogers et al 2012 zieger et al 2015 the terms t 1 and t 2 are determined in the model using eqs 12 and 13 in which c g is wave group velocity ω is angular frequency a 1 and a 2 are tuning parameters n k is wave generic action density function and a k is directional narrowness spectrum set as a k 1 rogers et al 2012 zieger et al 2015 rogers et al 2012 concluded that whitecap dissipation increases with increasing wave action and p 1 when n k n t k however the whitecap dissipation is not so sensitive to p 1 when n k n k rogers et al 2012 analyzed the performance of st6 package with three different values of 1 2 and 4 for p 1 and p 2 they found that model using p 1 p 2 1 underestimates the mean period implying unrealistically high energy content at high frequency part of the spectrum in this study default values were

approximation gmd method tolman 2009 2013 tolman and grumbine 2013 were main scenarios for their research three conditions were considered for the calibration of a 1 and a 2 1 simulated dimensionless wave energy and peak frequency should reasonably matched with proposed growth relation by kahma and calkoen 1992 2 in a fully developed wave growth condition 75 t 2 d f t 1 t 2 d f 80 should be met 3 the error of bulk wave parameters in the lake michigan should be minimized the obtained a 1 and a 2 from three mentioned conditions were one order of magnitude greater than the values proposed by zieger et al 2015 and recently were imposed in wwiii model version 6 07 the importance of commercial navigation and the extraction of fossil fuels in the pg and go was a great stimulation for studying their hydrodynamics moeini et al 2010 assessed the quality of ecmwf european center for medium range weather forecast and measured wind data for wave modelling over the pg in the swan model wam cycle3 were applied for wind input and whitecap dissipation ecmwf underestimated wind velocity against measured data as a consequence the model underestimated the wave height moeini et al 2012 developed efficient framework with data assimilation to improve the simulated wave parameters over the pg vieira et al 2020 applied cfsr climate forecast system reanalysis wind data in swan to study waves dynamics in pg they found that waves are strong in winter and spring and are moderate in autumn moreover the wave energy in the southern part of pg is relatively higher than other parts of the gulf liao and kaihatu 2016 evaluated sensitivity of swan for breaking and refraction terms over pg presented results proved that the deactivation of breaking term could led to 2 percent of the total energy deviation over the strait of hormuz behind large islands and coastal areas in contrast the deactivation of refraction term could result in 20 percent of total energy deviation kamranzad et al 2013 applied ecmwf era interim wind in combination with wam cycle3 in swan to evaluate the potential of wave energy for 25 years in the western central and eastern points in the pg it was proved that small variation in the wind speed would result in a large variation in the wave power kamranzad 2018 assessed the wave regime of pg with applying ecmwf era interim wind data in swan from 1980 to 2010 the large wave height in the northwestern and middle part of pg in summer and winter was attributed to specific wind regime known as shamal which is a common event in summer and winter seasons kazeminezhad and siadatmousavi 2017 evaluated three different wind dataset era interim ccmp cross calibrated multi platform and gfs a global forecast system with available packages st2 st3 and st4 in wwiii model the gfs a in combination with default values for st3 st4 packages resulted in better simulated wave parameters the underestimation of wave in february was observed which was attributed to rotating wind condition amarouche et al 2019 implemented high resolution swan wave hindcast forced by cfsr wind data over the mediterranean basin the calculation of wind wave growth by wam cycle3 and the whitecap dissipation of wam cycle4 formulations with c d s 1 was recommended moreover new package st6 using 32 u for wind scaling 2 8 10 6 for a 1 and 3 5 10 5 for a 2 was suggested over the mediterranean sea alizadeh et al 2020 used weibull distribution to investigate wave climate over pg simulation was performed by wam cycle3 input and dissipation terms in swan for historical 1981 2000 and future 2081 2100 periods comparing averaged historical and future wave parameters indicates that wave height and peak periods will decrease in future also high waves would appear in the middle of pg which is consistent with spatial distribution of wind velocity in future umesh and behera 2020 assessed the performance of wwiii model with five available wind input and whitecap dissipation packages namely st1 st2 st3 st4 and st6 in combination with 6 hourly era interim wind data over the bay of bengal and arabian sea simulated wave bulk parameters compared with numerous moored buoys they showed that during the tropical cyclone st2 was successful in reproducing strong waves while st1 underestimated the wave parameters st3 provided moderate results and the best performance was obtained by st4 and st6 van vledder et al 2016 used cfsr wind data in combination with wam cycle3 formulation the saturation based white capping by van der westhuysen et al 2007 and st6 in swan to hindcast a storm in december 2013 in north sea spectral wave boundary conditions at the atlantic ocean were obtained by wwiii model the most accurate estimation of one dimensional wave spectrum was obtained by st6 stopa et al 2016 simulated global wave height using cfsr wind data in combination with st2 st3 st4 and st6 in wwiii model wave heights were overestimated up to 20 by st2 in comparison with altimeter data and st3 overestimated the wave height by less than 5 both st4 and st6 overestimated wave height in extra tropic regions and underestimated it in low latitudes 25s 25n although pg and go are connected through the strait of hormuz almost no wave transfers from go to pg or vice versa therefore these two regions have their own distinct wave features pg is a semi enclosed water body with fetch limited wave field condition in which local winds might veer within few hours in contrast go experiences southerly winds and long swells which travels from southern part of the indian ocean to go model assessment and calibration for these two distinct environmental conditions were the main motivations of this study in this study st3 and st6 packages with new era5 wind data were used for first time in wwiii model version 5 16 to simulate waves over pg and go in 2010 2013 and 2015 adcp measurements and altimeter data are two valuable sources of data to evaluate the performance of the wwiii model in previous studies model calibration was performed with some buoy adcp measurements and then altimeter wave height or other buoy adcp measurements were used for validation in fact the obtained values for tuning parameters based on limited stations might not be general representatives for the entire domain in this study this shortage was addressed by introducing a new error parameter for calibration procedure which includes both altimeter and adcp measurements simultaneously section 2 describes the study area and available measurements as well as input data for model section 3 contains details of the methodology for model calibration with new introduced error parameter and wave model setup evaluation of the model and its sensitivity to the source terms are presented in section 4 section 5 includes a more detailed assessment of the model performance followed by a summary in section 6 2 study area and input datasets 2 1 model domain instrumentations and available data the model domain in this study covers pg and go from 47 e to 67 e in longitude and from 21 n to 31 n in latitude the pg is the crescent shaped semi enclosed water body which is connected to open oceans through the strait of hormuz and it is surrounded by iran kuwait saudi arabia bahrain qatar and united arab emirates water depth in pg is less than 100 m with mean depth of 30 m however the depth increases on the eastern side of the strait of hormuz in the go and reaches over 2000 m the pg is one of the most important energy spots in the world where numerous infrastructures are constructed to exploit oil and gas resources there are two dominant wind regimes prevailing over the persian gulf 1 strong northwesterly wind known as shamal wind which is common in summer and winter 2 strong south southeasterly winds known as kaus wind it is usually followed by shamal wind in winter alizadeh et al 2020 kamranzad 2018 kazeminezhad and siadatmousavi 2017 due to limited fetch only windseas or young swells exist in pg and there is no old swell there in contrast wave regime in go is composed of local northerly windseas as well as southerly swells chaichitehrani and allahdadi 2018 in this study directional wave spectrum and bulk wave parameters were provided at four stations as presented in fig 1 at all stations 2048 samples with 2 hz sampling frequency were recorded hourly study area and locations of adcps were depicted in fig 1 all lavan farur and pasabandar stations equipped with a 1000 khz nortek awac adcps providing two dimensional wave spectrum time periods in which hourly data is available are presented in table 1 the raw data were not available for entire measurement period for some stations and only significant wave height hs and peak period tp were recorded a 600 khz rdi workhorse adcp was used to measure data at farsi station over three separate intervals in 2013 the exact position of the instrumentations as well as mean water depth at each station is presented in table 1 in addition to adcps in the study area numerous synoptic facilities were deployed to collect meteorological data along coastal line these synoptic stations chiefly located in land side of coastal areas which recorded data were not properly recovered by models due to friction effect moreover the low time resolution and sporadic measurement during 24 h in a day are the other disadvantages among the available stations farur and farsi stations also provided valuable offshore meteorological data data from farur station covers wind speed from september 2009 to october 2010 while recorded data at farsi station was limited to time period from january to november 2013 since in situ measurements are limited in this area remotely sensed data were also used to evaluate the quality of available wind data as well as model assessment in this study the altimeter data provided by ifremer ftp ftp ifremer fr ifremer cersat products swath altimeters waves data were used the dataset includes wind velocity and significant wave height along satellite tracks which do not coincide with model grids the simple filter used by beyramzade et al 2019 were employed to choose independent data from remotely sensed data and resulted dataset was also used for model assessments the model data were interpolated spatially and temporally over the tracks of satellites to provide corresponding simulation results to be compared with remotely sensed data 2 2 input data a wave model requires bathymetry data boundary condition and time series of wind vectors the bathymetry data were obtained from gebco the general bathymetric chart of the oceans which were released in 2019 with spatial resolution of 0 004 the data is available from https www gebco net data and products gridded bathymetry data the isobaths in pg and go were presented in fig 1 in this study the era5 wind data were used for three different modelling periods 2010 2013 and 2015 in which in situ measurements were available this dataset is the most recent product of ecmwf which provides hourly reanalysis wind vectors with 0 3 spatial resolution it is available to download from https cds climate copernicus eu skill assessment of era5 over pg and go is presented in this study for the first time in fig 2 the bias of era5 against altimeter wind velocity are illustrated for the years of 2010 2013 and 2015 it can be seen that era5 overestimates wind velocity up to 2 m s over the northwest part of pg in contrast it underestimates wind velocity up to 2 m s close to the strait of hormuz the negligible bias over most part of the go indicates that the wind quality in go is reasonable fig 3 shows measured wind data at farur and farsi stations in comparison with era5 dataset although the trends of wind speed are well captured by era5 data at both stations underestimation during high wind speed periods is obvious at farur station swells from the indian ocean and lower latitudes propagate toward go hence implementing an accurate boundary condition is necessary to have accurate results in go due to absence of field measurement close to the southeast of go hourly boundary conditions were extracted in the form of directional wave spectra from a global wave modelling and those data were implemented along the southern 21 n 59 67 e and eastern 67 e 21 24 8 n open boundaries of the computational domain for the global wave modelling a regular rectangular grid with 1 25 1 resolution was employed in wwiii model this model setup was applied in numerous researches for global wave modelling and boundary extraction e g siadatmousavi et al 2016 zieger et al 2015 the model setup as well as required input data were downloaded from noaa https polar ncep noaa gov waves implementations shtml the maximum global time step the maximum cfl time step for x y and k theta and the time step for source terms were selected as 450 450 450 and 60 s respectively the model assessment over the globe has been performed mainly based on ndbc buoys e g tolman 2002 tolman 1998 while there is no measurement available close to study area therefore it is not clear which formulation provided the best performance close to go st1 st2 st3 st4 and st6 were all available packages to include wind and white capping terms all formulation with their default values were used to simulate wave height additionally new sets of values for tuning coefficients of st6 suggested by liu et al 2019 were also applied the results are compared with altimeter data available in the range of 18 24 n and 57 73 e in 2015 mean bias of wave height is illustrated in fig 4 for each scenario introduced as can be seen st2 and st6 liu 2019 resulted in severe underestimation of wave height in contrast st3 overestimated the wave height the st4 outperformed other packages in 2015 also in 2010 and 2013 but not shown here and selected to provide wave data at open boundaries in 2010 2013 and 2015 for local model shown in fig 1 3 method 3 1 model setup and error indices the computational grid in wwiii model covers 47 67 e and 21 31 n using a rectangular grid with 0 04 0 04 resolution following siadatmousavi et al 2012 the spectral space composed of 30 frequencies geometrically distributed from 0 04 hz to 0 63 hz also 36 directions with 10 resolution were used nonlinear quadruplet wave wave interaction s n l is an important term for wave spectrum evolution in the third generation wave models although accurate methods for s n l term has been implemented in wwiii model the fastest method known as dia hasselmann et al 1985 was used the maximum global time step the maximum cfl time step for x y and k theta and the time step for source terms were selected as 360 180 360 and 30 s respectively all outputs were extracted with step of 1 h from the model the depth induced wave breaking s d b was incorporated according to the method proposed by battjes and janssen 1978 due to depth of stations this sink term could not be dominant term close to in situ observations because wave breaking plays an important role in shallow waters the bottom friction s b o t is included in the model using jonswap formulation hasselmann et al 1973 the tuning parameter in the jonswap formulation was set to 0 038 m 2 s 2 according to zijlema et al 2012 moeini et al 2012 neglected the effect of bottom friction and wave breaking in model calibration procedure when the wave measurement used in their research was from 27 m water depth regarding the depth of the study area and its geographical extensions the wind input and whitecap dissipation terms are the most important terms in eqs 1 and 2 hence tuning of whitecap dissipation with st3 and st6 will be discussed in this study bulk wave parameters such as h s t p and mean wave period t m can be used to evaluate the performance of the wave model three statistical indices were used to evaluate the results of model normalized mean bias nmb scatter index si and normalized root mean square error hh proposed by hanna and heinold 1985 the formula for these statistical indices are presented below 14 n m b m i o i o i 15 s i 1 n m i o i 2 o 16 h h m i o i 2 m i o i where m i and o i are modeled and observed data respectively and n is the total number of data note that nmb alone is not appropriate representative index to evaluate the model performance because severe underestimation of model in some part of the domain could be alleviated with overestimation in other parts kazeminezhad and siadatmousavi 2017 applied si and hh as more accurate indices to evaluate the performance of wwiii model over pg 3 2 model calibration to avoid frictional effects the farur and pasabandar stations located in deeper waters were used for model calibration availability of directional wave spectra from january to march 2010 in farur and from june to august 2015 in pasabandar provides opportunity to compare h s and t m obtained from spectra generated by models and from adcp applied relations to extract h s and t m from directional spectra are as below in which f f θ is wave spectrum and f m a x 0 6 hz is considered 17 h s 0 2 π 0 f m a x f f θ d f d θ 18 t m 0 2 π 0 f m a x t f f θ d f d θ 0 2 π 0 f m a x f f θ d f d θ in st3 package c d s and δ 1 are considered as tuning parameters note that δ 2 1 δ 1 to find the best configuration c d s was varied from 5 5 to 1 5 with increment step of 1 while 0 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 1 were used for δ 1 siadatmousavi et al 2011 and beyramzade et al 2019 previously applied similar ranges for c d s and δ 1 in swan to determine optimum tuning values in other field of studies the default values in wam cycle4 for st3 package c d s 4 5 δ 1 0 5 were also considered for st6 package several values in the range of 3 74 10 8 4 75 10 6 were selected for a 1 the a 2 parameter varied in the range of 1 24 10 6 7 10 5 upper limits for a 1 and a 2 were selected according to liu et al 2019 applying data from limited adcps for calibration procedure may result in values for tuning parameters which are not necessarily appropriate for entire domain therefore h s values along altimeters were also extracted over pg and go the objective function for optimization was selected as the summation of hh and the absolute value of n m b for both adcp and altimeter data it is noteworthy that eq 19 was used only for h s 19 ε n m b a d c p n m b a l t i m e t e r h h a d c p h h a l t i m e t e r set of values for tuning parameters was employed to find the minimum value of ε when either st3 or st6 was selected in the model as mentioned before data from farur station and altimeter tracks in pg were used in eq 19 to determine the optimum values in pg hence measured data in lavan and farsi stations could be used for validation of ww3 model with selected calibration values the data from pasabandar station and altimeter tracks in go were used to determine best values for tuning coefficients in go in the third try both adcps and all altimeter data were used in eq 19 the optimized values for tuning coefficients in the first and second cases are the best for corresponding area but not necessarily optimized for entire computational domain the third case is a trade off between accuracies in pg and go the obtained values for ε using st3 package are illustrated as a function of tuning parameters δ 1 and c d s in fig 5 a and c for pg and go respectively it is obvious that ε in pg decreases with decreasing δ 1 for c d s 1 5 while ε slightly increases with decreasing δ 1 for c d s 2 5 these trends were not valid for c d s 3 5 and 5 5 though in go resulted ε was not sensitive to δ 1 variation except when c d s 1 5 although the modeled t m by c d s 1 5 δ 1 0 3 and c d s 1 5 δ 1 0 resulted in almost zero nmb and lower hh and si in fig 5b the obtained ε by c d s 1 5 δ 1 0 was the lowest values in fig 5a therefore c d s 1 5 δ 1 0 was selected as the most optimum setup for st3 package in pg the use of δ 1 0 δ 2 1 in the wam cycle4 package was also recommended previously in other wave models such as swan model to improve prediction of mean wave period rogers et al 2003 similar value for c d s was also suggested for the mediterranean sea by amarouche et al 2019 in go the st3 formulation with c d s 3 5 δ 1 1 outperformed other cases in reproducing t m parameter solid left pointing triangle in fig 5d however c d s 3 5 δ 1 0 7 resulted in minimum ε error with slight overestimation in t m sold pentagram in fig 5d as a consequence st3 package with c d s 3 5 δ 1 0 7 was selected as the optimum scenario in go the summary of st3 calibration for pg and go is as follows 1 pg is more sensitive to c d s and δ 1 variation than go 2 c d s 1 5 and δ 1 0 provides better estimation of t m and h s over the pg 3 c d s 3 5 and δ 1 0 7 is selected as optimum set of values for st3 package over the go the performance of st6 package within considered range for a 1 and a 2 is presented in fig 6 the preliminary results showed that decreasing a 1 and a 2 improves ε in pg since the minimum ε was appeared for the lowest selected a 1 and a 2 several other values were selected close to a 1 3 74 10 8 and a 2 1 24 10 6 the optimum values for tuning parameters in pg were found as a 1 1 05 10 7 a 2 1 74 10 6 which was shown by solid pentagram in fig 6a and b although ε was minimized using the selected values of a 1 and a 2 t m parameter was underestimated in the order of 0 1 s as shown in fig 6b unlike model performance in pg ε in go was not so sensitive to a 1 and a 2 values see in fig 6c the default values for a 1 and a 2 which were suggested by zieger et al 2015 led to the minimum value for ε and 0 05 s overestimation for t m see fig 6d hence a 1 3 74 10 7 a 2 5 24 10 6 was the most appropriate values for st6 package in go modeled h s with the largest values for a 1 and a 2 proposed by liu et al 2019 led to severe underestimation in comparison with both in situ observations and altimeter drived h s data in pg although not shown here but severe underestimation also occurred in comparison with altimeter derived h s in go the summary of st6 calibration for pg and go is as follows 1 pg is more sensitive to a 1 and a 2 variation than go 2 a 1 1 05 10 7 a 2 1 74 10 6 are selected as calibrated values for pg 3 a 1 3 74 10 7 a 2 5 24 10 6 which are defaults values in wwiii model version 5 16 are the suitable tuning values for go although tuning values were specified for st3 and st6 packages to provide the best performance in either pg or go it is also valuable to present unified calibration values for entire computational domain to provide the optimum tuning values for entire computational domain ε t o t was applied as eq 20 for calibration procedure 20 ε t o t ε p g ε g o where ε p g and ε g o were the ε values according to eq 19 only for pg and go as explained before note that it is expected to find turning values between values found for pg and go the results showed that model performance was the best when c d s 2 5 δ 1 0 3 were selected for st3 package or a 1 1 74 10 7 a 2 3 24 10 6 for st6 package hereafter the obtained optimum tuning values for the persian gulf the gulf of oman and the entire computational domain for both st3 and st6 packages will be known as pgc goc and pggoc respectively 4 simulation results 4 1 comparison against adcps the obtained calibration values in previous section were divided in two major categories 1 set up of tuning parameters specified for either the persian gulf or the gulf of oman pgc and goc 2 suggested calibration values for the entire computational domain pggoc the simulated h s and t p at farur station using the pgc and pggoc for both st3 and st6 packages are designated in fig 7 a and b for the time period from january to october 2010 the simulated h s using pggoc and pgc was close for either st3 or st6 package most of the time the simulated t p was in good agreement with measured data however severe underestimations was obvious when measured wave height was lower than 0 5 m gray stars in fig 7a and b the data corresponding to h s 0 5 m were eliminated for skill assessment of wwiii model following kazeminezhad and siadatmousavi 2017 simulated h s and t m by pggoc and goc for st3 and st6 packages from june to august 2015 at pasabandar station were presented in fig 8 comparison between measured and simulated h s indicates that resulted h s by both st3 and st6 packages were in fair agreement with in situ data however a period with severe overestimations in june was marked with an ellipse as it occurred for both st3 and st6 packages it is inferred that either inaccurate wind data or malfunction of adcp might be responsible for such discrepancy in fact the data recorded by adcp showed an intense unusual barotropic current speed of 1 m s directed northwest during this time period the water level was also elevated by 1 m the instrument might had problem in recording the wave height using three top layers due to bubbles in the surface water level or detecting high fluctuating surface except that period both st3 and st6 packages were successful in reproducing bulk wave parameters the nmb hh and si indices for h s t p and t m only for pasabandar using all adcps data during in situ measurements are presented in fig 9 although the performance of pggoc using st3 is better than pgc for reproducing t p at lavan farsi and farur stations severe underestimation of h s by pggoc using st3 at lavan and farsi stations was improved by using pgc the pggoc outperforms the pgc in simulating h s at farur station unlike st3 pggoc and pgc values for st6 package were close at lavan farur and farsi however pgc further underestimated h s at lavan and farsi stations using st6 package than using st3 package furthermore the better estimation of h s by pgc for st6 package in comparison with pggoc at farur station is remarkable similar to h s t p was predicted analogously by pggoc and pgc using st6 package at all stations in spite of the diverse performance of pggoc and pgc using st3 and st6 packages at adcps located in pg the similar performance of pggoc and goc using both packages were remarkable for both h s and t m at pasabandar station 4 2 comparison against remote sensing data as elaborated in section 2 1 altimeters provide h s data along their tracks and such data over the study area would be applicable for more evaluation of model results as presented in fig 10 for year 2010 simulated h s in this assessment was obtained by pggoc for both st3 and st6 packages hence c d s 2 5 δ 1 0 3 was considered for st3 package and a 1 1 74 10 7 a 2 3 24 10 6 were applied for st6 package as shown in fig 10a and b model overestimated high h s in the range between 5 and 8 m using both st3 and st6 packages this problem only occurred in 2010 data and both packages were in good agreement with altimeter data in 2015 as shown in fig 11 a and b precise investigation on the time and locations of altimeter data in which discrepancy between model and altimeter data occurred in year 2010 indicated that all data occurred in the period from 2nd to 5th june in 2010 over go era5 wind vectors shown in fig 12 designates that those points were close to track of a cyclone which has originated from the lower latitudes of the indian ocean in 31st may 2010 it moved to upper latitudes in go until 7th june 2010 this severe cyclonic storm named as phet was classified as category 4 tropical cyclone in saffir simpson hurricane scale and made catastrophic damages in oman pakistan and india panda et al 2015 the altimeter data during this time period are overlaid on era5 wind vectors in fig 12 note that exceptional rainfall was reported when the cyclone phet was active panda et al 2015 in fact heavy rain might affect the altimeter data e g quartly et al 1996 and mitigate the wave height e g chen et al 1998 and quartly 1997 since these effects were not fully addressed in both model input and its physics as well as products of altimetry it justifies the discrepancy between model and remote sensing data during that period of time mean bias of h s using altimeter data for st3 and st6 packages were presented over pg and go for 2010 in fig 10c and d respectively the st6 package outperformed st3 over go in 2010 but both packages underestimated wave in pg as shown in fig 11c the overestimation of h s by st3 over go and good results of st6 over this region were also occurred in 2015 similar to what happened for 2010 data the underestimation of waves up to 0 5 m over the strait of hormuz and the northern part of pg occurred for both st3 and st6 packages in 2015 the underestimation of h s over the strait of hormuz might be related to the underestimation of wind speed by era5 database depicted in fig 2 the summary of statistical indices presented in table 2 shows that nmb and hh indices were better when st6 package was used for 2010 and 2015 simulations the different performance of pggoc and pgc for st3 package indicates that the physical characters of waves in pg which is an enclosed water body and go could be different and they are not fully included in st3 physics hence it is difficult to well capture these differences by a uniform c d s and δ 1 over the entire computational domain similar pattern was reported before siadatmousavi et al 2016 recommended c d s 4 5 and δ 1 0 5 for the brazil coast which is connected to the open ocean similar go in this study while c d s 2 and δ 1 0 7 were shown to be the optimum values in the gulf of mexico siadatmousavi et al 2011 which is a semi enclosed water body similar to pg is this study unlike st3 a uniform set of values for a 1 and a 2 could be used for entire computational domain when st6 was employed as presented in table 2 the pggoc using st6 package outperformed pggoc using st3 in 2010 therefore pggoc with identified a 1 and a 2 for st6 was used in later simulations for year 2010 despite the fact that the performance of pggoc and goc using either st3 or st6 package was fairly identical at pasabandar station see fig 9 and in comparison with altimeter data in 2015 see table 2 better prediction of h s over go by st6 than st3 was apparent see fig 11d therefore pggoc using st6 with determined tuning values for a 1 and a 2 was suggested for wave modeling in year 2015 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of wwiii results with era5 wave data era5 database provides wave data along with atmospheric parameters the spatial and temporal resolution for wave data in era5 database are the same as wind data which were presented in section 2 2 only significant wave height wave peak period and wave mean period downloaded from https cds climate copernicus eu were used here the summary of assessments of wwiii results employing pggoc values for st6 formulation and era5 wave data at all adcps were presented in table 3 it is obvious that era5 severely underestimated the wave height at lavan farsi and pasabandar however it seems that estimated wave height by wwiii model and era5 were similar at farur station similarly peak wave period was underestimated more by era5 than by wwiii in lavan also mean wave period was more overestimated at pasabandar by era5 than by wwiii the statistical indices for peak wave period were similar for wwiii model and era5 moreover obtained si for wave height from era5 is slightly better than si from wwiii at farur and farsi stations 5 2 wave direction time series of measured and predicted mean wave direction are presented in fig 13 it is clear that wave direction at farur station veers from the west to the north in some period of time and model was successful in reproducing such variation in wave direction the southerly waves 135 225 occurred from april to june in 2010 were not captured properly since the waves in pg is mainly windsea the problem might be generated from era5 wind data the measured mean wave direction in pasabandar mainly varied in range of 135 225 which indicated dominant southerly waves in go it indicated presence of swells generated at lower latitudes the sudden changes in wave direction occurred in both measured and modeled data at early and late june 2015 at early june the wave direction decreased from 180 to 120 and then reached to 180 again while in late june the mean wave direction increased from 180 to 240 and then decreased to 180 again 5 3 spectrum evolution the bias of model in reproducing spectrum evolution was presented for farur and pasabandar stations in fig 14 the simulated one dimensional spectrum at farur station was in well agreement with measured one for frequencies either lower than 0 1 hz or greater than 0 25 hz during storm events under overestimations of wave energy occurred in the vicinity of the peak frequency at both stations note that intense positive bias up to 9 m 2 sec in june is attributed to severely overestimated wave heights marked by vertical ellipses in fig 8a 5 4 sensitivity to nonlinear wave interaction term comparing directional wave spectrum from model with measurements provides evaluation of the wave model in reproducing wave energy distribution over the frequencies and directions it is not practical to compare them for entire measurement period but the skill assessment of the model is possible during special events as shown in fig 15 three snapshots were selected from farur station data in which wind speed was greater than 7 m s and h s 0 5 m the wind and wave directions are the same in the first and second moments but they are different at the third times the wind was from south southeast in the third moment called kaus wind but it was from northwest called shamal wind in other moments the role of the nonlinear quadruplet wave wave interaction term is crucial in directional distribution of energy in the wave spectrum in addition to dia method which is practical and fast the gmd method which is the extended form of dia and includes more representatives for quadruplet wave wave interactions is available in wwiii model tolman 2009 2013 tolman and grumbine 2013 the exact wrt webb resio tracy method is another formulation which has been implemented in wwiii but requires intense computational cost van vledder 2006 therefore it is practically infeasible to apply it for a long time simulation but it can be used to determine the exact solution in fig 16 simulated directional wave spectrum produced by dia gmd and wrt were compared with measured spectra at three representative times at farur station although the energy content of measured wave spectrum on 28 january 2010 was concentrated in frequencies lower than 0 25 hz broader distribution of energy was observed in model results using all methods the peak frequency and wave direction from model results were in fair agreement with measured spectrum using all applied methods the wave system was broader on 30 january 2010 than on 28 january and model was successful in reproducing the wave spectrum in this condition it is noteworthy to mention that model produced superior results with gmd method than with dia method the wind rotation from northwest to south southeast in the third representative moment on 5 february resulted in bimodal wave spectrum in which stronger wave comes from the east in the presence of another southerly wave however the southerly wave was stronger than easterly wave in model results using all methods in other words the young easterly swell was unrealistically weakened in the model and forced to change its direction to southeast furthermore there were some low energy waves from west and from northeast in the measured wave spectrum while they were absent in the model results most likely the model was too sluggish to produce windsea from northwest despite the mentioned discrepancies between the measured and modeled wave spectra the quality of modeled spectrum was in fair agreement with measurement the response of young swell peak from east to wind rotation is faster than the old swell peak from south in both measurements and model results which is in agreement with young et al 1987 both gmd and dia methods provide broader directional spreading of wave energy than wrt method in addition the peaks of wave spectrum using gmd method were sharper than corresponding results using other methods three representative times were also selected for pasabandar station in which u 10 7 m s and h s 2 m wind direction was between 240 and 290 close to the first and second moments the wind veers to south to west close to the third moment with the rate of 50 day and the wave direction followed the wind rotation the details of selected times at pasabandar were presented in fig 17 measured and simulated directional wave spectra at pasabandar station at these three selected times were presented in fig 17 peak wave comes from the west in measured wave spectra at the first and second moments while weak swells exists from the south however model using all methods for snl shows stronger swell and weaker windsea than reality model reproduced southerly waves at the third moment directional spreading is overestimated using gmd and dia as it is clear neither accurate method for s n l wrt nor faster methods dia and gmd could accurately simulate low energy windsea from southwest therefore s n l is not responsible for the deficiency of modeled directional wave spectrum in comparison with measured one since s i n s d s and s n l terms are in equilibrium in deep waters it is inferable that either s i n or s d s was not realistic during third moment and further modification of wind input and whitecap dissipation in st6 package would be necessary for future studies 6 summary and conclusions era5 wind data in combination with st3 and st6 packages applied in wwiii model have never been used before over the persian gulf and gulf of oman farur and pasabandar stations were selected for model calibration in the persian gulf and gulf of oman respectively furthermore farsi and lavan stations were used for further validation of model results the tuning values which obtained by calibration at single adcp location could not be an appropriate representative for entire study area therefore a new error parameter was introduced for wave height as a function of error indices nmb and hh based on adcps data as well as wave height data inferred from altimeters in this study calibration values were divided into two major categories 1 optimum calibration values for only the persian gulf and the gulf of oman pgc and goc 2 suggested calibration values over the computational domain pggoc results proved that obtained calibration parameters for go using st3 and st6 are different from pg the performance of model was evaluated by pgc goc and pggoc using st3 and st6 packages the performances of pggoc and pgc were very different using st3 package which indicates that considering a uniform c d s and δ 1 values in st3 package does not provide appropriate wave characteristics over the entire computational domain in contrast model results with st6 package presented close performances using pggoc and pgc the same results between pggoc and goc were found therefore it is concluded that the st6 package includes general formulations which can be used in different domains with similar tuning parameters some discrepancy was found between wave height from model and altimeter data in 2010 it was found that the remote sensing data belong to tracks in lower latitudes which temporally occurred in the time period from 2nd to 5th june in 2010 during this time period the cyclone phet traversed across the study area and led to erroneous recorded altimeter h s mean bias between model and altimeter h s by pggoc for both st3 and st6 in 2010 and 2015 was evaluated over pg and go although the lowest mean bias was obtained by st6 over go the accuracy of st3 and st6 were similar over pg wave height and period extracted from era5 wave data were compared with measured data statistical indices indicate the superior performance of wwiii model using pggoc with st6 formulation era5 underestimated hs at lavan farsi and pasabandar station mean wave direction which predicted by pggoc using st6 package is in reasonable agreement with measured data at both farur and pasabandar stations more investigation on measured wind data reveals that some southerly winds are not well captured by era5 wind data hence inconsistency in reproducing measured southerly waves could be attributed to the wind data the bias of spectrum evolution using pggoc with st6 formulation showed that inaccuracies usually occurred in the vicinity of the peak frequency during storms the model results were accurate in frequencies lower than 0 1 and higher than 0 25 hz dia gmd and wrt methods were evaluated to calculate s n l in wwiii model to assess their impacts on the model results the qualities of obtained wave spectrum by all methods were similar and general characters of measured wave spectrum were captured by all methods at both farur and pasabandar stations however the peaks of spectrum were sharper when gmd was employed both gmd and dia methods led to wider

21207,the wind energy input and whitecap dissipation terms in the third generation wave models have been improved over the time in this research the well known wam cycle4 known as st3 and the newest st6 package in wavewatch iii model were employed combined with era5 wind data over the persian gulf and gulf of oman in order to model the wave height appropriately over the study area in comparison with both in situ and satellite observations new combined error parameters were introduced leading to two major calibration values 1 the local calibration values relating to either persian gulf pgc or gulf of oman goc 2 the global calibration values over the entire computational domain pggoc considerably different model performance was appeared in the persian gulf pg compared to either the gulf of oman go or entire computational domain pggo when st3 package was employed while obtained results using st6 package showed negligible sensitivity to the domain both st3 and st6 packages with default tuning values significantly underestimated the wave height and peak period in pg however slight underestimation 0 03 m for wave height and overestimation 0 1 s for mean wave period were obtained in go during the time period the cyclone phet has traversed across the study area the model overestimated the wave height in comparison with altimeter dataset mean bias distribution over the study area indicates that calibrated st6 outperforms calibrated st3 over go however both packages provide similar results over pg considering different methods for nonlinear interaction term led to similar directional wave spectrums over the study area and negligible changes in bulk wave parameters keywords wavewatch iii persian gulf gulf of oman st3 st6 phet cyclone era5 1 introduction wavewatch iii herein after wwiii model is a phase averaged wave model based on the conservation of wave action eq 1 1 d n d t s t o t ω where t is time n is wave action density and it is equal to e ω e is energy density spectrum and ω is angular frequency s t o t is the contribution of all sink and source terms and can be expressed as follows 2 s t o t s l n s i n s n l s d s s d b s b o t s t r s s c s i c e s r e f eq 2 includes linear input term s l n the exponential wind wave growth s i n nonlinear quadruplet wave wave interaction s n l dissipation due to white capping s d s depth induced wave breaking s d b wave bottom interaction s b o t that includes dissipation due to bottom friction and wave mud interaction triad wave wave interaction s t r scattering by bottom features s s c wave ice interaction s i c e and wave reflection due to shorelines and floating objects s r e f eq 1 and eq 2 are the same fundamental equations as implemented in other third generation wave models such as swan tomawac and wam numerous study focused on improving the terms s i n and s d s which are playing important roles in controlling the wave spectrum therefore diverse packages for these terms have been applied in the wwiii model the simplest formulation package is st1 also known as wam cycle3 which is presented by komen et al 1984 it includes two tuning parameters c i n c d s for s i n and s d s respectively a more complex formulation which considers air stability by the temperature difference between air and water is st2 this package is successful in oceanic scales but underestimates the wave height in regional domains tolman and chalikov 1996 janssen 1991 proposed wind input term as a function of u c in which c and u were the wave phase and friction velocity respectively unlike st1 package in which u was computed as u u 10 0 001 0 8 0 065 u 10 where u 10 was the wind velocity at 10 m height the friction velocity was computed with an iterative process in this formulation this method was implemented in wwiii model as st3 package the whitecap dissipation term in st3 is the summation of a linear and a nonlinear function of wave number k with weighting coefficients δ 1 and δ 2 as presented in eq 3 the c d s is a constant parameter k is wave number and n k θ is two dimensional wave action density function 3 s d s k θ c d s α 2 σ δ 1 k k δ 2 k k 2 n k θ also k σ α are mean wave number mean angular frequency and mean steepness respectively they are determined in the model as follows 4 k k p n k θ d k d θ n k θ 1 p σ σ p n k θ d k d θ n k θ 1 p α e k 2 note that δ 1 δ 2 c d s and p are the tuning parameters in st3 three sets of values are presented for tuning parameters in wwiii model the first set is related to the original wam cycle4 in which δ 1 0 5 δ 2 0 5 c d s 4 5 and p 0 5 the second set denoted by bja proposed by bidlot et al 2005 is δ 1 0 4 δ 2 0 6 c d s 2 1 and p 0 5 and the last set denoted by bid is proposed by bidlot 2012 in which δ 1 0 5 δ 2 0 5 c d s 1 33 and p 0 5 in st4 package the wind input term of st3 is used but s w c involves three parts a saturation based term a cumulative breaking term and a dissipation term to incorporate wave and turbulence interaction the saturation based term itself includes two parts that are weighted by δ and 1 δ and known as isotropic and direction dependent parts in cumulative breaking item the maximum frequency ratio that wipes out the short waves was considered this parameter was a function of the saturation spectrum and also a constant tuning value c c u since the third term due to wave and turbulence interaction was of secondary importance it was neglected by ardhuin et al 2010 however specific relations were presented in wwiii model to include it for the first time a new sink term for swell dissipation s s w e l l was proposed in st4 package it included the viscous and the turbulence contributions they were added in the model with weights of r v i s and r t u r which were functions of reynolds number st6 is the most recent package implemented in wwiii model by zieger et al 2015 wind input term in this package was proposed by donelan et al 2006 it includes a directional dependent wind input term w as a function of wave direction θ wind direction θ w phase speed velocity c and scaled wind velocity u 5 w 1 m a x 2 0 u c cos θ θ w 1 w 2 m i n 2 0 u c cos θ θ w 1 6 w w 1 a 0 w 2 in eq 5 scaled wind velocity was used instead of u 10 the scaling factor of 28 u was originally selected in earlier versions of wwiii model group 2016 komen et al 1984 tolman 2014 however this scale factor was tunable as 28 u or 32 u according to rogers et al 2012 in the swan model liu et al 2019 reported that the overestimation of wave energy in high frequency tail of the spectrum could be alleviated when 32 u was used their suggestion for the scale factor is now the default value in the wwiii model version 6 07 in this study 32 u will be used in all simulations drag coefficient c d is required to obtain u in st6 package the drag coefficient for u 10 50 m s is determined according to eq 7 hwang 2011 7 c d 10 4 8 058 0 967 u 10 0 016 u 10 2 when wind and wave are aligned u c cos θ θ w 0 w 1 will be dominant item in eq 6 however during opposing wind direction u c cos θ θ w 0 the term a 0 w 2 called as negative wind input s n e g is important the value of a 0 0 09 was used in this study according to liu et al 2017 all described procedure for wind input term in st6 package is valid only when the contributions of wave induced stress and viscous stress were lower than ρ c d u 2 violation of this condition means wave induced stress which is a function of wind input term was inappropriately estimated therefore modification of wind input term is needed as eq 8 the reduction term l k in eq 9 is a function of wave age u c and a constant value μ which is determined through an iterative procedure until the mentioned condition is met rogers et al 2012 zieger et al 2015 8 s i n k l k s i n k 9 l k min 1 exp μ 1 u c the dissipation term in st6 package is as follows 10 s d s k θ t 1 k θ t 2 k θ n k θ the term t 1 includes inherent breaking and the term t 2 includes cumulative effects of short wave breaking due to longer waves at each frequency rogers et al 2012 zieger et al 2015 both t 1 and t 2 in their relations need a threshold action function n t then the term δ k n k n t k is calculated to check whether n k is greater than n t k to activate the whitecap dissipation or not threshold action function is calculated by eq 11 in which ε t 0 035 2 according to babanin et al 2007 11 n t k ε t a k k 3 the energy content of the spectrum falls below the threshold level in decaying wind sea condition and as a consequence the dissipation due to whitecap will be inactive therefore positive bias for significant wave height would be observed similar to st4 package the swell dissipation in st6 overcomes this problem ardhuin et al 2010 rogers et al 2012 zieger et al 2015 the terms t 1 and t 2 are determined in the model using eqs 12 and 13 in which c g is wave group velocity ω is angular frequency a 1 and a 2 are tuning parameters n k is wave generic action density function and a k is directional narrowness spectrum set as a k 1 rogers et al 2012 zieger et al 2015 rogers et al 2012 concluded that whitecap dissipation increases with increasing wave action and p 1 when n k n t k however the whitecap dissipation is not so sensitive to p 1 when n k n k rogers et al 2012 analyzed the performance of st6 package with three different values of 1 2 and 4 for p 1 and p 2 they found that model using p 1 p 2 1 underestimates the mean period implying unrealistically high energy content at high frequency part of the spectrum in this study default values were used for these coefficients p 1 p 2 4 12 t 1 k a 1 a k ω 2 π δ k n k p 1 13 t 2 k a 2 0 k a k c g 2 π δ k n k p 2 d k liu et al 2019 has calibrated st6 package in combination with different available methods for s n l in wwiii model calibration of st6 in combination with either discrete interaction approximation dia method hasselmann et al 1985 or with generalized multiple discrete interaction approximation gmd method tolman 2009 2013 tolman and grumbine 2013 were main scenarios for their research three conditions were considered for the calibration of a 1 and a 2 1 simulated dimensionless wave energy and peak frequency should reasonably matched with proposed growth relation by kahma and calkoen 1992 2 in a fully developed wave growth condition 75 t 2 d f t 1 t 2 d f 80 should be met 3 the error of bulk wave parameters in the lake michigan should be minimized the obtained a 1 and a 2 from three mentioned conditions were one order of magnitude greater than the values proposed by zieger et al 2015 and recently were imposed in wwiii model version 6 07 the importance of commercial navigation and the extraction of fossil fuels in the pg and go was a great stimulation for studying their hydrodynamics moeini et al 2010 assessed the quality of ecmwf european center for medium range weather forecast and measured wind data for wave modelling over the pg in the swan model wam cycle3 were applied for wind input and whitecap dissipation ecmwf underestimated wind velocity against measured data as a consequence the model underestimated the wave height moeini et al 2012 developed efficient framework with data assimilation to improve the simulated wave parameters over the pg vieira et al 2020 applied cfsr climate forecast system reanalysis wind data in swan to study waves dynamics in pg they found that waves are strong in winter and spring and are moderate in autumn moreover the wave energy in the southern part of pg is relatively higher than other parts of the gulf liao and kaihatu 2016 evaluated sensitivity of swan for breaking and refraction terms over pg presented results proved that the deactivation of breaking term could led to 2 percent of the total energy deviation over the strait of hormuz behind large islands and coastal areas in contrast the deactivation of refraction term could result in 20 percent of total energy deviation kamranzad et al 2013 applied ecmwf era interim wind in combination with wam cycle3 in swan to evaluate the potential of wave energy for 25 years in the western central and eastern points in the pg it was proved that small variation in the wind speed would result in a large variation in the wave power kamranzad 2018 assessed the wave regime of pg with applying ecmwf era interim wind data in swan from 1980 to 2010 the large wave height in the northwestern and middle part of pg in summer and winter was attributed to specific wind regime known as shamal which is a common event in summer and winter seasons kazeminezhad and siadatmousavi 2017 evaluated three different wind dataset era interim ccmp cross calibrated multi platform and gfs a global forecast system with available packages st2 st3 and st4 in wwiii model the gfs a in combination with default values for st3 st4 packages resulted in better simulated wave parameters the underestimation of wave in february was observed which was attributed to rotating wind condition amarouche et al 2019 implemented high resolution swan wave hindcast forced by cfsr wind data over the mediterranean basin the calculation of wind wave growth by wam cycle3 and the whitecap dissipation of wam cycle4 formulations with c d s 1 was recommended moreover new package st6 using 32 u for wind scaling 2 8 10 6 for a 1 and 3 5 10 5 for a 2 was suggested over the mediterranean sea alizadeh et al 2020 used weibull distribution to investigate wave climate over pg simulation was performed by wam cycle3 input and dissipation terms in swan for historical 1981 2000 and future 2081 2100 periods comparing averaged historical and future wave parameters indicates that wave height and peak periods will decrease in future also high waves would appear in the middle of pg which is consistent with spatial distribution of wind velocity in future umesh and behera 2020 assessed the performance of wwiii model with five available wind input and whitecap dissipation packages namely st1 st2 st3 st4 and st6 in combination with 6 hourly era interim wind data over the bay of bengal and arabian sea simulated wave bulk parameters compared with numerous moored buoys they showed that during the tropical cyclone st2 was successful in reproducing strong waves while st1 underestimated the wave parameters st3 provided moderate results and the best performance was obtained by st4 and st6 van vledder et al 2016 used cfsr wind data in combination with wam cycle3 formulation the saturation based white capping by van der westhuysen et al 2007 and st6 in swan to hindcast a storm in december 2013 in north sea spectral wave boundary conditions at the atlantic ocean were obtained by wwiii model the most accurate estimation of one dimensional wave spectrum was obtained by st6 stopa et al 2016 simulated global wave height using cfsr wind data in combination with st2 st3 st4 and st6 in wwiii model wave heights were overestimated up to 20 by st2 in comparison with altimeter data and st3 overestimated the wave height by less than 5 both st4 and st6 overestimated wave height in extra tropic regions and underestimated it in low latitudes 25s 25n although pg and go are connected through the strait of hormuz almost no wave transfers from go to pg or vice versa therefore these two regions have their own distinct wave features pg is a semi enclosed water body with fetch limited wave field condition in which local winds might veer within few hours in contrast go experiences southerly winds and long swells which travels from southern part of the indian ocean to go model assessment and calibration for these two distinct environmental conditions were the main motivations of this study in this study st3 and st6 packages with new era5 wind data were used for first time in wwiii model version 5 16 to simulate waves over pg and go in 2010 2013 and 2015 adcp measurements and altimeter data are two valuable sources of data to evaluate the performance of the wwiii model in previous studies model calibration was performed with some buoy adcp measurements and then altimeter wave height or other buoy adcp measurements were used for validation in fact the obtained values for tuning parameters based on limited stations might not be general representatives for the entire domain in this study this shortage was addressed by introducing a new error parameter for calibration procedure which includes both altimeter and adcp measurements simultaneously section 2 describes the study area and available measurements as well as input data for model section 3 contains details of the methodology for model calibration with new introduced error parameter and wave model setup evaluation of the model and its sensitivity to the source terms are presented in section 4 section 5 includes a more detailed assessment of the model performance followed by a summary in section 6 2 study area and input datasets 2 1 model domain instrumentations and available data the model domain in this study covers pg and go from 47 e to 67 e in longitude and from 21 n to 31 n in latitude the pg is the crescent shaped semi enclosed water body which is connected to open oceans through the strait of hormuz and it is surrounded by iran kuwait saudi arabia bahrain qatar and united arab emirates water depth in pg is less than 100 m with mean depth of 30 m however the depth increases on the eastern side of the strait of hormuz in the go and reaches over 2000 m the pg is one of the most important energy spots in the world where numerous infrastructures are constructed to exploit oil and gas resources there are two dominant wind regimes prevailing over the persian gulf 1 strong northwesterly wind known as shamal wind which is common in summer and winter 2 strong south southeasterly winds known as kaus wind it is usually followed by shamal wind in winter alizadeh et al 2020 kamranzad 2018 kazeminezhad and siadatmousavi 2017 due to limited fetch only windseas or young swells exist in pg and there is no old swell there in contrast wave regime in go is composed of local northerly windseas as well as southerly swells chaichitehrani and allahdadi 2018 in this study directional wave spectrum and bulk wave parameters were provided at four stations as presented in fig 1 at all stations 2048 samples with 2 hz sampling frequency were recorded hourly study area and locations of adcps were depicted in fig 1 all lavan farur and pasabandar stations equipped with a 1000 khz nortek awac adcps providing two dimensional wave spectrum time periods in which hourly data is available are presented in table 1 the raw data were not available for entire measurement period for some stations and only significant wave height hs and peak period tp were recorded a 600 khz rdi workhorse adcp was used to measure data at farsi station over three separate intervals in 2013 the exact position of the instrumentations as well as mean water depth at each station is presented in table 1 in addition to adcps in the study area numerous synoptic facilities were deployed to collect meteorological data along coastal line these synoptic stations chiefly located in land side of coastal areas which recorded data were not properly recovered by models due to friction effect moreover the low time resolution and sporadic measurement during 24 h in a day are the other disadvantages among the available stations farur and farsi stations also provided valuable offshore meteorological data data from farur station covers wind speed from september 2009 to october 2010 while recorded data at farsi station was limited to time period from january to november 2013 since in situ measurements are limited in this area remotely sensed data were also used to evaluate the quality of available wind data as well as model assessment in this study the altimeter data provided by ifremer ftp ftp ifremer fr ifremer cersat products swath altimeters waves data were used the dataset includes wind velocity and significant wave height along satellite tracks which do not coincide with model grids the simple filter used by beyramzade et al 2019 were employed to choose independent data from remotely sensed data and resulted dataset was also used for model assessments the model data were interpolated spatially and temporally over the tracks of satellites to provide corresponding simulation results to be compared with remotely sensed data 2 2 input data a wave model requires bathymetry data boundary condition and time series of wind vectors the bathymetry data were obtained from gebco the general bathymetric chart of the oceans which were released in 2019 with spatial resolution of 0 004 the data is available from https www gebco net data and products gridded bathymetry data the isobaths in pg and go were presented in fig 1 in this study the era5 wind data were used for three different modelling periods 2010 2013 and 2015 in which in situ measurements were available this dataset is the most recent product of ecmwf which provides hourly reanalysis wind vectors with 0 3 spatial resolution it is available to download from https cds climate copernicus eu skill assessment of era5 over pg and go is presented in this study for the first time in fig 2 the bias of era5 against altimeter wind velocity are illustrated for the years of 2010 2013 and 2015 it can be seen that era5 overestimates wind velocity up to 2 m s over the northwest part of pg in contrast it underestimates wind velocity up to 2 m s close to the strait of hormuz the negligible bias over most part of the go indicates that the wind quality in go is reasonable fig 3 shows measured wind data at farur and farsi stations in comparison with era5 dataset although the trends of wind speed are well captured by era5 data at both stations underestimation during high wind speed periods is obvious at farur station swells from the indian ocean and lower latitudes propagate toward go hence implementing an accurate boundary condition is necessary to have accurate results in go due to absence of field measurement close to the southeast of go hourly boundary conditions were extracted in the form of directional wave spectra from a global wave modelling and those data were implemented along the southern 21 n 59 67 e and eastern 67 e 21 24 8 n open boundaries of the computational domain for the global wave modelling a regular rectangular grid with 1 25 1 resolution was employed in wwiii model this model setup was applied in numerous researches for global wave modelling and boundary extraction e g siadatmousavi et al 2016 zieger et al 2015 the model setup as well as required input data were downloaded from noaa https polar ncep noaa gov waves implementations shtml the maximum global time step the maximum cfl time step for x y and k theta and the time step for source terms were selected as 450 450 450 and 60 s respectively the model assessment over the globe has been performed mainly based on ndbc buoys e g tolman 2002 tolman 1998 while there is no measurement available close to study area therefore it is not clear which formulation provided the best performance close to go st1 st2 st3 st4 and st6 were all available packages to include wind and white capping terms all formulation with their default values were used to simulate wave height additionally new sets of values for tuning coefficients of st6 suggested by liu et al 2019 were also applied the results are compared with altimeter data available in the range of 18 24 n and 57 73 e in 2015 mean bias of wave height is illustrated in fig 4 for each scenario introduced as can be seen st2 and st6 liu 2019 resulted in severe underestimation of wave height in contrast st3 overestimated the wave height the st4 outperformed other packages in 2015 also in 2010 and 2013 but not shown here and selected to provide wave data at open boundaries in 2010 2013 and 2015 for local model shown in fig 1 3 method 3 1 model setup and error indices the computational grid in wwiii model covers 47 67 e and 21 31 n using a rectangular grid with 0 04 0 04 resolution following siadatmousavi et al 2012 the spectral space composed of 30 frequencies geometrically distributed from 0 04 hz to 0 63 hz also 36 directions with 10 resolution were used nonlinear quadruplet wave wave interaction s n l is an important term for wave spectrum evolution in the third generation wave models although accurate methods for s n l term has been implemented in wwiii model the fastest method known as dia hasselmann et al 1985 was used the maximum global time step the maximum cfl time step for x y and k theta and the time step for source terms were selected as 360 180 360 and 30 s respectively all outputs were extracted with step of 1 h from the model the depth induced wave breaking s d b was incorporated according to the method proposed by battjes and janssen 1978 due to depth of stations this sink term could not be dominant term close to in situ observations because wave breaking plays an important role in shallow waters the bottom friction s b o t is included in the model using jonswap formulation hasselmann et al 1973 the tuning parameter in the jonswap formulation was set to 0 038 m 2 s 2 according to zijlema et al 2012 moeini et al 2012 neglected the effect of bottom friction and wave breaking in model calibration procedure when the wave measurement used in their research was from 27 m water depth regarding the depth of the study area and its geographical extensions the wind input and whitecap dissipation terms are the most important terms in eqs 1 and 2 hence tuning of whitecap dissipation with st3 and st6 will be discussed in this study bulk wave parameters such as h s t p and mean wave period t m can be used to evaluate the performance of the wave model three statistical indices were used to evaluate the results of model normalized mean bias nmb scatter index si and normalized root mean square error hh proposed by hanna and heinold 1985 the formula for these statistical indices are presented below 14 n m b m i o i o i 15 s i 1 n m i o i 2 o 16 h h m i o i 2 m i o i where m i and o i are modeled and observed data respectively and n is the total number of data note that nmb alone is not appropriate representative index to evaluate the model performance because severe underestimation of model in some part of the domain could be alleviated with overestimation in other parts kazeminezhad and siadatmousavi 2017 applied si and hh as more accurate indices to evaluate the performance of wwiii model over pg 3 2 model calibration to avoid frictional effects the farur and pasabandar stations located in deeper waters were used for model calibration availability of directional wave spectra from january to march 2010 in farur and from june to august 2015 in pasabandar provides opportunity to compare h s and t m obtained from spectra generated by models and from adcp applied relations to extract h s and t m from directional spectra are as below in which f f θ is wave spectrum and f m a x 0 6 hz is considered 17 h s 0 2 π 0 f m a x f f θ d f d θ 18 t m 0 2 π 0 f m a x t f f θ d f d θ 0 2 π 0 f m a x f f θ d f d θ in st3 package c d s and δ 1 are considered as tuning parameters note that δ 2 1 δ 1 to find the best configuration c d s was varied from 5 5 to 1 5 with increment step of 1 while 0 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 1 were used for δ 1 siadatmousavi et al 2011 and beyramzade et al 2019 previously applied similar ranges for c d s and δ 1 in swan to determine optimum tuning values in other field of studies the default values in wam cycle4 for st3 package c d s 4 5 δ 1 0 5 were also considered for st6 package several values in the range of 3 74 10 8 4 75 10 6 were selected for a 1 the a 2 parameter varied in the range of 1 24 10 6 7 10 5 upper limits for a 1 and a 2 were selected according to liu et al 2019 applying data from limited adcps for calibration procedure may result in values for tuning parameters which are not necessarily appropriate for entire domain therefore h s values along altimeters were also extracted over pg and go the objective function for optimization was selected as the summation of hh and the absolute value of n m b for both adcp and altimeter data it is noteworthy that eq 19 was used only for h s 19 ε n m b a d c p n m b a l t i m e t e r h h a d c p h h a l t i m e t e r set of values for tuning parameters was employed to find the minimum value of ε when either st3 or st6 was selected in the model as mentioned before data from farur station and altimeter tracks in pg were used in eq 19 to determine the optimum values in pg hence measured data in lavan and farsi stations could be used for validation of ww3 model with selected calibration values the data from pasabandar station and altimeter tracks in go were used to determine best values for tuning coefficients in go in the third try both adcps and all altimeter data were used in eq 19 the optimized values for tuning coefficients in the first and second cases are the best for corresponding area but not necessarily optimized for entire computational domain the third case is a trade off between accuracies in pg and go the obtained values for ε using st3 package are illustrated as a function of tuning parameters δ 1 and c d s in fig 5 a and c for pg and go respectively it is obvious that ε in pg decreases with decreasing δ 1 for c d s 1 5 while ε slightly increases with decreasing δ 1 for c d s 2 5 these trends were not valid for c d s 3 5 and 5 5 though in go resulted ε was not sensitive to δ 1 variation except when c d s 1 5 although the modeled t m by c d s 1 5 δ 1 0 3 and c d s 1 5 δ 1 0 resulted in almost zero nmb and lower hh and si in fig 5b the obtained ε by c d s 1 5 δ 1 0 was the lowest values in fig 5a therefore c d s 1 5 δ 1 0 was selected as the most optimum setup for st3 package in pg the use of δ 1 0 δ 2 1 in the wam cycle4 package was also recommended previously in other wave models such as swan model to improve prediction of mean wave period rogers et al 2003 similar value for c d s was also suggested for the mediterranean sea by amarouche et al 2019 in go the st3 formulation with c d s 3 5 δ 1 1 outperformed other cases in reproducing t m parameter solid left pointing triangle in fig 5d however c d s 3 5 δ 1 0 7 resulted in minimum ε error with slight overestimation in t m sold pentagram in fig 5d as a consequence st3 package with c d s 3 5 δ 1 0 7 was selected as the optimum scenario in go the summary of st3 calibration for pg and go is as follows 1 pg is more sensitive to c d s and δ 1 variation than go 2 c d s 1 5 and δ 1 0 provides better estimation of t m and h s over the pg 3 c d s 3 5 and δ 1 0 7 is selected as optimum set of values for st3 package over the go the performance of st6 package within considered range for a 1 and a 2 is presented in fig 6 the preliminary results showed that decreasing a 1 and a 2 improves ε in pg since the minimum ε was appeared for the lowest selected a 1 and a 2 several other values were selected close to a 1 3 74 10 8 and a 2 1 24 10 6 the optimum values for tuning parameters in pg were found as a 1 1 05 10 7 a 2 1 74 10 6 which was shown by solid pentagram in fig 6a and b although ε was minimized using the selected values of a 1 and a 2 t m parameter was underestimated in the order of 0 1 s as shown in fig 6b unlike model performance in pg ε in go was not so sensitive to a 1 and a 2 values see in fig 6c the default values for a 1 and a 2 which were suggested by zieger et al 2015 led to the minimum value for ε and 0 05 s overestimation for t m see fig 6d hence a 1 3 74 10 7 a 2 5 24 10 6 was the most appropriate values for st6 package in go modeled h s with the largest values for a 1 and a 2 proposed by liu et al 2019 led to severe underestimation in comparison with both in situ observations and altimeter drived h s data in pg although not shown here but severe underestimation also occurred in comparison with altimeter derived h s in go the summary of st6 calibration for pg and go is as follows 1 pg is more sensitive to a 1 and a 2 variation than go 2 a 1 1 05 10 7 a 2 1 74 10 6 are selected as calibrated values for pg 3 a 1 3 74 10 7 a 2 5 24 10 6 which are defaults values in wwiii model version 5 16 are the suitable tuning values for go although tuning values were specified for st3 and st6 packages to provide the best performance in either pg or go it is also valuable to present unified calibration values for entire computational domain to provide the optimum tuning values for entire computational domain ε t o t was applied as eq 20 for calibration procedure 20 ε t o t ε p g ε g o where ε p g and ε g o were the ε values according to eq 19 only for pg and go as explained before note that it is expected to find turning values between values found for pg and go the results showed that model performance was the best when c d s 2 5 δ 1 0 3 were selected for st3 package or a 1 1 74 10 7 a 2 3 24 10 6 for st6 package hereafter the obtained optimum tuning values for the persian gulf the gulf of oman and the entire computational domain for both st3 and st6 packages will be known as pgc goc and pggoc respectively 4 simulation results 4 1 comparison against adcps the obtained calibration values in previous section were divided in two major categories 1 set up of tuning parameters specified for either the persian gulf or the gulf of oman pgc and goc 2 suggested calibration values for the entire computational domain pggoc the simulated h s and t p at farur station using the pgc and pggoc for both st3 and st6 packages are designated in fig 7 a and b for the time period from january to october 2010 the simulated h s using pggoc and pgc was close for either st3 or st6 package most of the time the simulated t p was in good agreement with measured data however severe underestimations was obvious when measured wave height was lower than 0 5 m gray stars in fig 7a and b the data corresponding to h s 0 5 m were eliminated for skill assessment of wwiii model following kazeminezhad and siadatmousavi 2017 simulated h s and t m by pggoc and goc for st3 and st6 packages from june to august 2015 at pasabandar station were presented in fig 8 comparison between measured and simulated h s indicates that resulted h s by both st3 and st6 packages were in fair agreement with in situ data however a period with severe overestimations in june was marked with an ellipse as it occurred for both st3 and st6 packages it is inferred that either inaccurate wind data or malfunction of adcp might be responsible for such discrepancy in fact the data recorded by adcp showed an intense unusual barotropic current speed of 1 m s directed northwest during this time period the water level was also elevated by 1 m the instrument might had problem in recording the wave height using three top layers due to bubbles in the surface water level or detecting high fluctuating surface except that period both st3 and st6 packages were successful in reproducing bulk wave parameters the nmb hh and si indices for h s t p and t m only for pasabandar using all adcps data during in situ measurements are presented in fig 9 although the performance of pggoc using st3 is better than pgc for reproducing t p at lavan farsi and farur stations severe underestimation of h s by pggoc using st3 at lavan and farsi stations was improved by using pgc the pggoc outperforms the pgc in simulating h s at farur station unlike st3 pggoc and pgc values for st6 package were close at lavan farur and farsi however pgc further underestimated h s at lavan and farsi stations using st6 package than using st3 package furthermore the better estimation of h s by pgc for st6 package in comparison with pggoc at farur station is remarkable similar to h s t p was predicted analogously by pggoc and pgc using st6 package at all stations in spite of the diverse performance of pggoc and pgc using st3 and st6 packages at adcps located in pg the similar performance of pggoc and goc using both packages were remarkable for both h s and t m at pasabandar station 4 2 comparison against remote sensing data as elaborated in section 2 1 altimeters provide h s data along their tracks and such data over the study area would be applicable for more evaluation of model results as presented in fig 10 for year 2010 simulated h s in this assessment was obtained by pggoc for both st3 and st6 packages hence c d s 2 5 δ 1 0 3 was considered for st3 package and a 1 1 74 10 7 a 2 3 24 10 6 were applied for st6 package as shown in fig 10a and b model overestimated high h s in the range between 5 and 8 m using both st3 and st6 packages this problem only occurred in 2010 data and both packages were in good agreement with altimeter data in 2015 as shown in fig 11 a and b precise investigation on the time and locations of altimeter data in which discrepancy between model and altimeter data occurred in year 2010 indicated that all data occurred in the period from 2nd to 5th june in 2010 over go era5 wind vectors shown in fig 12 designates that those points were close to track of a cyclone which has originated from the lower latitudes of the indian ocean in 31st may 2010 it moved to upper latitudes in go until 7th june 2010 this severe cyclonic storm named as phet was classified as category 4 tropical cyclone in saffir simpson hurricane scale and made catastrophic damages in oman pakistan and india panda et al 2015 the altimeter data during this time period are overlaid on era5 wind vectors in fig 12 note that exceptional rainfall was reported when the cyclone phet was active panda et al 2015 in fact heavy rain might affect the altimeter data e g quartly et al 1996 and mitigate the wave height e g chen et al 1998 and quartly 1997 since these effects were not fully addressed in both model input and its physics as well as products of altimetry it justifies the discrepancy between model and remote sensing data during that period of time mean bias of h s using altimeter data for st3 and st6 packages were presented over pg and go for 2010 in fig 10c and d respectively the st6 package outperformed st3 over go in 2010 but both packages underestimated wave in pg as shown in fig 11c the overestimation of h s by st3 over go and good results of st6 over this region were also occurred in 2015 similar to what happened for 2010 data the underestimation of waves up to 0 5 m over the strait of hormuz and the northern part of pg occurred for both st3 and st6 packages in 2015 the underestimation of h s over the strait of hormuz might be related to the underestimation of wind speed by era5 database depicted in fig 2 the summary of statistical indices presented in table 2 shows that nmb and hh indices were better when st6 package was used for 2010 and 2015 simulations the different performance of pggoc and pgc for st3 package indicates that the physical characters of waves in pg which is an enclosed water body and go could be different and they are not fully included in st3 physics hence it is difficult to well capture these differences by a uniform c d s and δ 1 over the entire computational domain similar pattern was reported before siadatmousavi et al 2016 recommended c d s 4 5 and δ 1 0 5 for the brazil coast which is connected to the open ocean similar go in this study while c d s 2 and δ 1 0 7 were shown to be the optimum values in the gulf of mexico siadatmousavi et al 2011 which is a semi enclosed water body similar to pg is this study unlike st3 a uniform set of values for a 1 and a 2 could be used for entire computational domain when st6 was employed as presented in table 2 the pggoc using st6 package outperformed pggoc using st3 in 2010 therefore pggoc with identified a 1 and a 2 for st6 was used in later simulations for year 2010 despite the fact that the performance of pggoc and goc using either st3 or st6 package was fairly identical at pasabandar station see fig 9 and in comparison with altimeter data in 2015 see table 2 better prediction of h s over go by st6 than st3 was apparent see fig 11d therefore pggoc using st6 with determined tuning values for a 1 and a 2 was suggested for wave modeling in year 2015 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of wwiii results with era5 wave data era5 database provides wave data along with atmospheric parameters the spatial and temporal resolution for wave data in era5 database are the same as wind data which were presented in section 2 2 only significant wave height wave peak period and wave mean period downloaded from https cds climate copernicus eu were used here the summary of assessments of wwiii results employing pggoc values for st6 formulation and era5 wave data at all adcps were presented in table 3 it is obvious that era5 severely underestimated the wave height at lavan farsi and pasabandar however it seems that estimated wave height by wwiii model and era5 were similar at farur station similarly peak wave period was underestimated more by era5 than by wwiii in lavan also mean wave period was more overestimated at pasabandar by era5 than by wwiii the statistical indices for peak wave period were similar for wwiii model and era5 moreover obtained si for wave height from era5 is slightly better than si from wwiii at farur and farsi stations 5 2 wave direction time series of measured and predicted mean wave direction are presented in fig 13 it is clear that wave direction at farur station veers from the west to the north in some period of time and model was successful in reproducing such variation in wave direction the southerly waves 135 225 occurred from april to june in 2010 were not captured properly since the waves in pg is mainly windsea the problem might be generated from era5 wind data the measured mean wave direction in pasabandar mainly varied in range of 135 225 which indicated dominant southerly waves in go it indicated presence of swells generated at lower latitudes the sudden changes in wave direction occurred in both measured and modeled data at early and late june 2015 at early june the wave direction decreased from 180 to 120 and then reached to 180 again while in late june the mean wave direction increased from 180 to 240 and then decreased to 180 again 5 3 spectrum evolution the bias of model in reproducing spectrum evolution was presented for farur and pasabandar stations in fig 14 the simulated one dimensional spectrum at farur station was in well agreement with measured one for frequencies either lower than 0 1 hz or greater than 0 25 hz during storm events under overestimations of wave energy occurred in the vicinity of the peak frequency at both stations note that intense positive bias up to 9 m 2 sec in june is attributed to severely overestimated wave heights marked by vertical ellipses in fig 8a 5 4 sensitivity to nonlinear wave interaction term comparing directional wave spectrum from model with measurements provides evaluation of the wave model in reproducing wave energy distribution over the frequencies and directions it is not practical to compare them for entire measurement period but the skill assessment of the model is possible during special events as shown in fig 15 three snapshots were selected from farur station data in which wind speed was greater than 7 m s and h s 0 5 m the wind and wave directions are the same in the first and second moments but they are different at the third times the wind was from south southeast in the third moment called kaus wind but it was from northwest called shamal wind in other moments the role of the nonlinear quadruplet wave wave interaction term is crucial in directional distribution of energy in the wave spectrum in addition to dia method which is practical and fast the gmd method which is the extended form of dia and includes more representatives for quadruplet wave wave interactions is available in wwiii model tolman 2009 2013 tolman and grumbine 2013 the exact wrt webb resio tracy method is another formulation which has been implemented in wwiii but requires intense computational cost van vledder 2006 therefore it is practically infeasible to apply it for a long time simulation but it can be used to determine the exact solution in fig 16 simulated directional wave spectrum produced by dia gmd and wrt were compared with measured spectra at three representative times at farur station although the energy content of measured wave spectrum on 28 january 2010 was concentrated in frequencies lower than 0 25 hz broader distribution of energy was observed in model results using all methods the peak frequency and wave direction from model results were in fair agreement with measured spectrum using all applied methods the wave system was broader on 30 january 2010 than on 28 january and model was successful in reproducing the wave spectrum in this condition it is noteworthy to mention that model produced superior results with gmd method than with dia method the wind rotation from northwest to south southeast in the third representative moment on 5 february resulted in bimodal wave spectrum in which stronger wave comes from the east in the presence of another southerly wave however the southerly wave was stronger than easterly wave in model results using all methods in other words the young easterly swell was unrealistically weakened in the model and forced to change its direction to southeast furthermore there were some low energy waves from west and from northeast in the measured wave spectrum while they were absent in the model results most likely the model was too sluggish to produce windsea from northwest despite the mentioned discrepancies between the measured and modeled wave spectra the quality of modeled spectrum was in fair agreement with measurement the response of young swell peak from east to wind rotation is faster than the old swell peak from south in both measurements and model results which is in agreement with young et al 1987 both gmd and dia methods provide broader directional spreading of wave energy than wrt method in addition the peaks of wave spectrum using gmd method were sharper than corresponding results using other methods three representative times were also selected for pasabandar station in which u 10 7 m s and h s 2 m wind direction was between 240 and 290 close to the first and second moments the wind veers to south to west close to the third moment with the rate of 50 day and the wave direction followed the wind rotation the details of selected times at pasabandar were presented in fig 17 measured and simulated directional wave spectra at pasabandar station at these three selected times were presented in fig 17 peak wave comes from the west in measured wave spectra at the first and second moments while weak swells exists from the south however model using all methods for snl shows stronger swell and weaker windsea than reality model reproduced southerly waves at the third moment directional spreading is overestimated using gmd and dia as it is clear neither accurate method for s n l wrt nor faster methods dia and gmd could accurately simulate low energy windsea from southwest therefore s n l is not responsible for the deficiency of modeled directional wave spectrum in comparison with measured one since s i n s d s and s n l terms are in equilibrium in deep waters it is inferable that either s i n or s d s was not realistic during third moment and further modification of wind input and whitecap dissipation in st6 package would be necessary for future studies 6 summary and conclusions era5 wind data in combination with st3 and st6 packages applied in wwiii model have never been used before over the persian gulf and gulf of oman farur and pasabandar stations were selected for model calibration in the persian gulf and gulf of oman respectively furthermore farsi and lavan stations were used for further validation of model results the tuning values which obtained by calibration at single adcp location could not be an appropriate representative for entire study area therefore a new error parameter was introduced for wave height as a function of error indices nmb and hh based on adcps data as well as wave height data inferred from altimeters in this study calibration values were divided into two major categories 1 optimum calibration values for only the persian gulf and the gulf of oman pgc and goc 2 suggested calibration values over the computational domain pggoc results proved that obtained calibration parameters for go using st3 and st6 are different from pg the performance of model was evaluated by pgc goc and pggoc using st3 and st6 packages the performances of pggoc and pgc were very different using st3 package which indicates that considering a uniform c d s and δ 1 values in st3 package does not provide appropriate wave characteristics over the entire computational domain in contrast model results with st6 package presented close performances using pggoc and pgc the same results between pggoc and goc were found therefore it is concluded that the st6 package includes general formulations which can be used in different domains with similar tuning parameters some discrepancy was found between wave height from model and altimeter data in 2010 it was found that the remote sensing data belong to tracks in lower latitudes which temporally occurred in the time period from 2nd to 5th june in 2010 during this time period the cyclone phet traversed across the study area and led to erroneous recorded altimeter h s mean bias between model and altimeter h s by pggoc for both st3 and st6 in 2010 and 2015 was evaluated over pg and go although the lowest mean bias was obtained by st6 over go the accuracy of st3 and st6 were similar over pg wave height and period extracted from era5 wave data were compared with measured data statistical indices indicate the superior performance of wwiii model using pggoc with st6 formulation era5 underestimated hs at lavan farsi and pasabandar station mean wave direction which predicted by pggoc using st6 package is in reasonable agreement with measured data at both farur and pasabandar stations more investigation on measured wind data reveals that some southerly winds are not well captured by era5 wind data hence inconsistency in reproducing measured southerly waves could be attributed to the wind data the bias of spectrum evolution using pggoc with st6 formulation showed that inaccuracies usually occurred in the vicinity of the peak frequency during storms the model results were accurate in frequencies lower than 0 1 and higher than 0 25 hz dia gmd and wrt methods were evaluated to calculate s n l in wwiii model to assess their impacts on the model results the qualities of obtained wave spectrum by all methods were similar and general characters of measured wave spectrum were captured by all methods at both farur and pasabandar stations however the peaks of spectrum were sharper when gmd was employed both gmd and dia methods led to wider distribution of energy in direction and frequency than wrt method credit authorship contribution statement mostafa beyramzadeh visualization methodology software formal analysis writing original draft

21208,this paper presents a simple model of the turbulent wave boundary layer for the case where the orbital motion formed by the waves just outside the boundary layer is circular the analysis is based on the integral momentum method it turns out that the wall friction under such a flow is larger than the similar 2d case it is demonstrated that even though the motion is quite different the wall friction predictions are not significantly different from the 2d case where the orbital motion follows a straight line the bed friction increases by 15 40 for the circular orbit case depending on roughness and orbital radius the analysis includes the case of a weak current superposed the waves for this case the flow resistance for the current increases by around 30 55 for a circular orbit compared to a straight motion back and forth keywords hydrodynamics wave roughness drift forces ship resistance 1 introduction the bottom wave boundary layer formed at the seabed due to combined waves and current has been investigated by a large number of researchers e g lundgren 1972 grant and madsen 1979 fredsoe 1984 and soulsby et al 1993 all these models consider 2d plane waves in combination with a current forming an arbitrary angle with the direction of wave propagation this boundary layer is characterized by unsteadiness in the boundary layer thickness in a phase resolved flow description in this note the special case of a circular orbit of the wave induced flow is considered no investigations on the bottom wbl under three dimensional waves have been performed to the author s knowledge the problem has its similarity to geostrophic flow like the ekman layer where the coriolis force acts perpendicular to the flow velocity e g madsen 1977 however in these kind of flows the total flow depth is taken to be the boundary layer thickness while in the present the boundary layer thickness as the wall shear stress are calculated as function of the orbital motion and wall roughness the general case of an elliptical orbit is complex to calculate because the wall friction changes size as well as direction at all times in the 2d case where the near wall motion is a straight line back and forth the wall friction changes with time but do not change direction in the present note the opposite case is studied in which the orbit parallel to the wall is fully circular in this case the wall friction changes direction all times while the magnitude is time invariant this is called the 3d case in this note the calculated values are compared with the 2d values both obtained by applying the momentum integral method the solution by fredsoe 1984 for the 2d case is applied for the comparison these two extreme cases provide an estimate of the impact on wave friction factors friction and flow resistance to a co existing current due to an open orbit as compared to the plane wave case 2 where exist circular orbital boundary layers this and the following section gives some examples on where such a flow may exist 2 1 seabed 2 1 1 directional waves when two identical regular wave trains cross each other perpendicularly the near bed orbital motion in a plane view above the seabed will generally be open elliptical shaped ranging from a straight motion back and forth to a fully circular orbit this special case is seldom in nature where directional waves are confined to much smaller spreading so the orbital motion in a plane parallel to the bed will rather be narrow elliptical than circular shaped 2 1 2 vertical reflective walls in front of reflective walls exposed to obliquely incoming waves you may observe orbital patterns which for 45 approaching angle occasionally will lead to circular fluid trajectories here the bed friction is of importance in relation to bed scour in front of the wall and flow resistance for a co existent current 2 2 wave flumes the wave boundary layer with a free stream circular orbit does also exist elsewhere like along the side walls of a wave flume if experimentally the flow resistance to the current in the combined wave current motion is considered many researchers neglect the impact of wall friction because they assume the bottom to be much rougher than the sidewalls however as demonstrated in this note the flow resistance from the walls may be higher than expected due to the different behavior of the flow 2 3 importance of skin friction to moored offshore structures structures like moored ships tension leg platforms semi submersibles floating wind turbines are exposed to long period waves from wave groups partly due to slowly varying excitation force from each regular wave part hsu and blenkarn 1972 faltinsen and løken 1979 corresponding to temporal changes in the radiation stresses from the small waves and the high waves in the wave group longuet higgins and stewart 1964 this contributes with long period motion of the structure due to second order force terms by the waves next to that the co existence of current and wind also expose the structures the forces acting on the structure are usually split up into drift forces agitating and damping forces and the description of each of these can again be divided into potential flow i e non viscous flow modelling and viscous flow modelling the viscous terms include pressure drag due to flow separation and vortex shedding and further skin friction for a review see lundgren et al 1982 the viscous forces have not achieved the same attention as the potential forces because their relatively small magnitude compared to the potential wave forces however viscous forces also play an important role as a drift force as well as a damping force see for instance lundgren et al 1982 the viscous forces can be divided into two parts a form drag due to downstream flow separation in the downstream wake the pressure is low and close to the pressure at the separation points and this create a pressure contribution the pressure drag term to the total viscous force next to this the skin friction contributes with a frictional term and the significance of this force depends very much on the shape of the structure 2 3 1 circular vertical cylinder if exposed to a current only the relative contribution of the friction force to the total drag force only constitutes 1 2 achenbach 1968 in oscillatory flow the relative contribution depends on the keulegan carpenter number k c 2 π a d here d is the diameter and a is the orbital amplitude for small kc numbers the downstream flow separation do not have sufficient time to develop fredsoe and justesen 1986 so the pressure contribution decreases and the friction term and pressure term becomes about the same for kc 2 see fig 4 12 sumer and fredsoe 2006 for smaller kc values the frictional term dominates when deep water waves meet a vertical circular cylinder the fluid particle orbital trajectory at the front will be a straight vertical line at 45 an ellipse and at 90 a circular path as sketched by lundgren et al 1982 their fig 9 2 3 2 horizontal large cylinder e g submerged pontoon on a semi sub this is relative to a parallel current flow a much more elongated structure and for this case the skin friction will dominate on such elements like the vertical cylinder in deep water waves the orbital trajectories will be a straight horizontal line on the top and at the bottom and circular at its vertical side 2 3 3 ship hulls a third example is the flow around the hull of a large ship meeting deep water waves in head sea conditions in this case we actually get a circular orbit from the waves in combination with a current where the latter is due to the drift speed of the ship because of its elongated shape the skin friction on ships might reach the same size as that due to downstream flow separation even without presence of waves with waves the skin friction may even dominate depending on the width to length ratio of the ship cf numerical example later in this note 3 examples on potential and viscous flow models the literature on loads on offshore structures are voluminous and standard books on the subjects are e g chakrabarti 1984b faltinsen 1990 and newman 2018 several researchers have considered the influence of the drift velocity on the forces that causes the drift e g faltinsen 1988 and aranha 1994 these papers investigate radiation of waves from the moving body and the induced damping aranha claims viscous dissipation is very small since it is proportional to drift velocity squared this statement is not always true as already pointed out by lundgren et al 1982 who demonstrated that the viscous resistance term from skin friction is proportional to the wave orbital flow velocity u 0 multiplied by the drift velocity for large waves in conjunction with a weak drift velocity this leads to an at least one order of magnitude larger skin friction contribution and is one motivation for this note in the lundgren et al paper the wave orbital trajectories were assumed to be inline 2d in lack of a 3d solution 3 1 viscous flow models the viscous forces act as drift as well as dampening forces the surrounding fluid creates a friction drag on the floating structure when a relative motion exists between the structure and the fluid thus if the surrounding fluid velocity is larger than that of the structure the viscous forces will contribute to enhance the structure motion and similarly for a smaller fluid velocity than that of the structure the structure motion will be dampened a number of papers modelling the behavior of structures in the marine environment includes the viscous terms mainly as a pressure force with the hydrodynamics contained in the drag coefficient c d used in the morison equation accounting for the relative velocity between wave current and structure examples are chakrabarti 1984a vertical cylinder donley and spanos 1991 tlp bertelsen et al 2009 tlp dev and pinkster 1995 semi sub ma et al 2020 semi sub from the modelling work it is not possible to extract the sensitivity to the selected value of c d which usually is taken to be about 1 0 1 1 sometimes adjusted to make the best fit with experimental data for instance fonseca and stansberg 2018 dev and pinkster 1994 1995 provides a review of viscous effects on semi subs and tlp the aim of this note is to go a little more into the details of the hydrodynamics of the viscous drag forces namely the boundary layers and the resulting skin friction on the vertical parts of structure exposed to waves parallel to the structure the coexistence of a current or a drift of the structure is discussed one reason for the study is that such boundary layers in model tests are laminar while turbulent in prototype to evaluate scale effects the prototype solution is needed 4 basic equations in this section the circular wave boundary layer is investigated a circular motion outside the boundary layer can be written by 1 u e u 0 cos ω t j u 0 sin ω t where ω is cyclic frequency t is time u 0 is the amplitude of the velocity and e and j are the unit vectors in an x y coordinate system parallel to the wall in the boundary layer the flow velocity u u x u y must accordingly vary sinusoidal in time but with a phase shift ϕ and different amplitude a than outside the boundary layer 2 u e u x j u y e a z cos ω t ϕ z j a z sin ω t ϕ z where z is the distance from the wall u and ϕ are shown in the definition fig 1 the equation of motion for the x and y direction inside the boundary layer reads 3 ρ u x t τ x z p x τ x z ρ t u 0 cos ω t and 4 ρ u y t τ y z p y τ y z ρ t u 0 sin ω t where the indices x and y refer to the components of shear τ and velocity in the two directions p is the pressure which penetrates unchanged from the outer potential flow through the boundary layer 5 laminar and turbulent flow the laminar flow case the laminar case is easy to solve because laminar flow is linear for flows without convective terms because the bed skin friction is proportional to the velocity gradient τ b ν ρ u z ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid about 10 6 m2 s for water at 10 c the flow given by eqs 3 and 4 can be obtained by superposition of a sinusoidal flow in the x direction combined with the same with a phase shift in ω t π 2 in the y direction the 2d case is well known see e g fredsoe and deigaard 1992 p 19 and can be solved exact the bed friction factor is f l a m defined by 5 τ b 1 2 ρ f l a m u 0 2 and is found to be 6 f l a m 2 r e in which the amplitude reynolds number re is defined by 7 r e u 0 a ν a is the orbital amplitude given by 8 a u 0 ω the transition from laminar to turbulent boundary layer for the 2d case occurs for re values smaller than about 5 105 jonsson 1980 p117 5 1 the turbulent case in turbulent flow the 2d flow cases cannot be superposed similarly to the laminar case this is because the bed friction increases nonlinear usually squared with the flow velocity by looking at the laminar case described above the bed shear stress acting on the flow in the y direction will therefore be affected by the strength of the flow in the x direction as well and a larger friction to the flow must be anticipated the aim of this note is to evaluate this increase no analytical solution are available for this flow and the tool applied here to investigate the flow is an integrated approach rather than a detailed turbulence approach which must be solved numerically 6 the integral momentum equation the idea behind the integral momentum equation is to integrate the equations of motion over the entire boundary layer and next to insert a reasonable estimate of the velocity profile into this integrated equation this provide results which are very similar and very close to more sophisticated turbulence models see e g fig 2 22 fredsoe and deigaard 1992 eqs 3 and 4 are integrated from the wall at z z 0 z 0 being the roughness height to the outer edge of the boundary layer at z δ where δ is the boundary layer thickness 9 ρ z 0 δ ω a z sin ϕ z d z τ 0 τ b cos ϕ b ρ u f 2 cos ϕ b and 10 ρ z 0 δ ω a z cos ϕ z d z τ b sin ϕ z 0 ρ δ ω u 0 ρ u f 2 sin ϕ b ρ δ ω u 0 the velocity amplitude a is defined in eq 2 in eq 9 τ 0 stands for the shear stress at the top of the boundary layer and is therefore zero τ b is the wall shear stress which is related to the skin friction velocity u f as given in eq 9 finally ϕ b ϕ z 0 is the angle at the bed in eqs 9 and 10 the time t has been put equal zero which doesn t restrict the validity of the equations as only the direction of the velocity not the size changes with time 6 1 velocity profiles in the turbulent boundary layer the next step in the momentum integral method is to prescribe the velocity profile in the boundary layer in a turbulent flow the most common is to adapt a logarithmic shaped velocity profile 11 a z u f 1 κ ln z z 0 where κ is the von kármán s constant set equal 0 40 and z 0 the roughness parameter at the top of the boundary layer the velocity must be equal to the outer potential flow velocity given by eq 1 so 12 a δ u 0 by introducing the dimensionless parameter 13 ς κ u 0 u f eqs 11 and 12 give 14 δ z 0 exp ς which relates the boundary layer to the ς parameter to be found later the turn ϕ in the velocity through the boundary layer is assumed to be linear so 15 cos ϕ cos ϕ b 1 z δ

parameters ς and ϕ b are found input parameter is the dimensionless parameter κ 2 a z 0 7 1 case a the hydraulic rough wall the wall is hydraulic rough if the roughness k is larger than the thickness δ v of the viscous sublayer which is given by 22 δ v 11 7 ν u f here k is the nikuradse roughness of the wall see schlicting 1979 p 619 in the rough wall case z 0 k 30 applying this as input parameter in eqs 19 and 21 ς and ϕ b are found by iteration the results are given in table 1 usually the friction is described by the wave friction factor f defined similarly to eq 5 by 23 τ b ρ 1 2 f u 0 2 or

also compares the present 3d result with the 2d solution also based on the integrated momentum approach by fredsoe 1984 in the 2d case the boundary layer thickness and wall friction is time dependent and the friction factor is in that case still defined by eq 23 but based on maximum values 26 τ b max ρ 1 2 f u 0 max 2 in which there is a phase shift in between maximum shear stress and maximum outer orbital velocity the shear stress is slightly ahead of the flow velocity the boundary layer tthickness in the 2d case is defined as the thickness at the time where the outer flow velocity is maximum table 1 shows that the 3d solution predicts a 15 45 larger friction factor as that predicted by applying the momentum integral method for the corresponding 2d case fredsoe 1984 27 f 2 d 0 042 a k 0 253 7 2 case b the hydraulic smooth wall in the smooth wall case the roughness parameter z 0 appearing in eq 11 is given by z 0 ν 9 8 u f see schlichting 1979 p 619 the further analysis proceeds as for the rough wall case the results are listed in table 2 instead of the parameter a k the input parameter is now the reynolds number re defined by eq 7 which easily gives ς and thereby the friction factor and boundary layer thickness as function of the reynolds number the friction factor given in table 2 can for re larger than 10 6 be approximated by 28 f 3 d 0 0405 r e 0 155 while for the 2d case the similar expression is 29 f 2 d 0 030 r e 0 148 as expected for both the rough and the smooth wall the increase is largest for large curvature flow small orbital radius a and the inwards turn in near bed shear stress is similarly largest for small values of a 8 the combined wave plus current case in this section the implication of an open circular orbit on the time averaged flow resistance for a current is outlined the current velocity u c at the top of the boundary layer is assumed to be weak as compared to the orbital velocity u 0 so the friction factor for the combined flow case can be taken equal the one obtained above for the wave alone case the flow situation is sketched in fig 2 during one wave period t a fluid particle at the edge of the boundary layer will move the distance u c t in the current direction left while the instantaneous velocity vector is the vectorial sum of the current velocity vector and the instantaneous wave induced flow velocity u given by eq 1 applying eq 23 for the combined flow the instantaneous bed shear stress in the mean current direction is given by 30 τ c 1 2 ρ f u 0 cos ω t u c 2 u 0 2 sin 2 ω t cos α where α is the instantaneous angle between the current direction and the wave current velocity direction this angle is determined by cf fig 2 right 31 cos α u 0 cos ω t u c u 0 cos ω t u c 2 u 0 2 sin 2 ω t the time averaged value of the bed shear stress can now be found from eqs 30 and 31 to be τ c 1 t 0 t τ d t c 1 2 ρ f 0 t u 0 cos ω t u c 2 u 0 2 sin 2 ω t cos α d t 1 2 ρ f 0 t u 0 cos ω t u c u 0 cos ω t u c

1982 for the detailed calculations see fredsoe and deigaard 1992 p 59 here f 2 d is the friction factor for the fully 2d flow by comparison of eqs 32 and 33 it is observed that the flow resistance to the current increases due to two different causes a based on the results from tables 1 and 2 the friction factor is larger in the 3d case than in the 2d case about 20 40 for the rough wall case and about 20 in the smooth wall case and b the time averaging provides a 17 increase for the 3d case compared to 2d the increase from 1 28 in eq 33 to 1 50 in eq 32 the two effects combined suggest an increase in flow resistance by nearly 40 50 with a circular orbit as compared to the simple back and forth 2d case 9 elliptical orbital motion in general the orbital path has an elliptical shape with an amplitude a 1 in the direction of wave propagation and a 2 perpendicular to this the expression eq 33 is valid for 2d orbital motion back and forth so a 1 a 2 0 while eq 32 is valid for a 1 a 2 a assuming a linear variation from the one expression to the other the general expression with a 2 being different from a 1 reads 34 f c w 1 28 f 2 d 1 28 f 2 d 1 5 f 3 d a 2 a 1 f c w being defined by 35 τ c w 1 2 ρ f c w u 0 u c both values f 2 d and f 3 d in eq 34 are based on a 1 from eqs 25 and 27 for the rough wall case and eqs 28 and 29 for the smooth wall case 10 numerical example in this section the findings is illustrated by a simple numerical example the drag exerted by a square meter on the vertical part of the hull near the water surface on a ship met by head waves on deep water the waves are assumed to be regular 5 m high and a wave period t equal 10 s the ship exposed to a parallel current or the ship is moving relatively to the water with a velocity u c 10 1 deep water here linear wave theory gives u 0 1 57 m s and a u 0 t 2 π 2 50 m if the hull has a roughness k equal 1 mm a k is 2 51 103 corresponding to a wave friction factor eq 25 f 0 0075 and a friction velocity equal u f f 2 u 0 0 0961 m s the thickness of the viscous sublayer eq 22 becomes with ν 10 6 m 2 s for water δ 0 122 m m this means the surface with a roughness equal 1 mm is in the fully rough regime the time averaged wall shear stress due to a current u c is found from eq 32 to be 36 τ c ρ 3 4 f u 0 u c 3 4 0 0075 1 57 u c 0 0056 1 57 u c 0 00883 u c m 2 s 2 was the wall instead smooth i e roughness smaller than 0 1 mm then the re number is r e 1 57 2 50 10 6 3 92 10 6 according to eq 28 this gives a friction factor equal f 0 00385 or just half the skin friction flow resistance of that from the rough wall case above 10 2 intermediate depth if instead the water depth is only 15 m and the wave height and period kept the same as above the maximum horizontal flow velocity becomes 2 25 m s while the maximum vertical flow velocity remains 1 575 m s the corresponding orbital amplitudes are 3 61 m and 2 5 m respectively eq 34 now gives the following friction factor the values adapted from eqs 25 and 27 rough wall a k 3610 for k 1 mm f c w 1 28 f 2 d 1 28 f 2 d 1 5 f 3 d a 2 a 1 1 28 0 0053 1 28 0 0053 1 5 0 0068 2 50 3 61 0 0091 the resulting drag per unit area becomes τ c ρ 1 2 f c w u 0 u c 1 2 0 0091 1 57 u s h i p 0 00714 u s h i p m 2 s 2 this is less than in deep water because the flow is more 2d elliptical orbits due to the restricted flow depth 10 3 impact of waves on skin friction along a slender structure met by head waves for the current alone case the friction is differently distributed as it is in combined waves plus current a boundary layer develops along the hull with a linear increase in thickness along the hull about 1 10 the friction is therefore largest at the front thin boundary layer and decay in the downstream direction half downstream along the hull of a 50 m long ship the boundary layer thickness δ is about 2 5 m and the corresponding friction factor can be found by 37 2 f c 3 2 1 κ ln δ u f ν this is the colebrook white 1937 flow resistance formula for a hydraulic smooth wall alternatively see newman 2018 ch 3 8 eq 37 needs to be solved by iteration because u f appears on both sides of the equation for a current velocity 0 15 m s f c 0 0022 and the thickness of the viscous sublayer is 2 9 mm cf eq 22 this is larger than k 1 mm so the wall is smooth for this flow the wall shear stress is therefore 38 τ c ρ 1 2 0 0034 u c 2 the ratio between wall shear stress in current alone eq 38 and in combined waves plus current eq 36 is 39 τ c τ c w 0 0034 u c 2 0 0056 u c u 0 0 61 u c u 0 if the current is only 10 of the orbital velocity the wall shear stress is increased by a factor 16 due to presence of waves in this numerical example thus the impact of waves on skin friction is significant and will be one reason why skin friction may be important for elongated structures met by head waves as illustrated in the following numerical example a ship is assumed to be a box with rectangular cross section with a streamlined bow length l draught d and width w the skin friction on this on the two vertical sides of the hull is 40 t 1 2 ρ f 1 5 u 0 u c 2 l d the pressure contribution due to the wake downstream the stern without any impact from waves is 41 p 1 2 ρ c d u c 2 w d eq 41 is only a rough estimate because the impact of waves on this contribution is not included the ratio between the two quantities t and p is t p f 1 5 u 0 u c 2 l d p c d u c 2 w d 3 f c d u 0 u c l w for the following values f 0 0075 c d 1 and u 0 u c 10 the skin friction loss will be equal to the pressure contribution in the downstream wake for a ship longer than about 4 5 its width also skin friction is acting beneath the box the keel here the wave impact will be less partly because the larger distance to the water surface and also because the oscillatory motion beneath the box will be less because its only driven by the pressure variations at the two boundaries at the edges of the box nevertheless also this drag contribution will have an impact increasing with the ratio w d because this drag acts on an area equal wl 11 other remarks scale effects one motivation for this study is to be able to quantify scale effects when modelling movements of moored ships exposed to wave groups and current while waves can be correctly modelled using the froude model law in the laboratory and the scale effects originate from the viscous terms the model scale often is 1 25 or 1 50 and it is almost impossible to reach the same turbulent conditions as in prototype even with artificial roughness implemented on the hull so a scale effect is introduced one contribution to the force is the drag due to downstream flow separation which also is re dependent because the separation point may move with re dependent on the exact design of the ship hull because of its elongated shape the skin friction on ships might reach the same size as that due to downstream flow separation the viscous pressure contribution in this note the laminar and the turbulent solution are both given so the scale effects originating from the part of forces due to skin friction can be evaluated experiments no comparison with experiments have been done due to lack of such data for the 3d case for the 2d case the experimental support is rich because very large re number can be achieved in closed u tunnels it is difficult to see how a similar set up can be achieved for the 3d case because there are limitations for how high waves you can produce in the laboratory almost all wave boundary layers formed by real waves in the laboratory are laminar but turbulent in nature one way to perform experiments is to make a setup where a plate is moved in its own plane with a circular trajectory in a chamber with resting water the dimensions must be quite large to get sufficient high orbital amplitude a and to be in the turbulent regime one problem with such a setup is that the limited dimension of the chamber introduces some secondary flow at the edges the best way is probably to perform a few numerical dns experiments which should be possible due to the simplicity of the problem with no time and space variations except in the z direction 12 conclusion it is demonstrated theoretically that the wall friction increases when waves are present if the orbital motion changes from a straight line to an open orbit at the edge of the boundary layer only the special case of a circular orbit has been considered and the increase in the wall friction factor is about 15 40 largest for the smooth wall case by adding a small current the friction factor for this current motion is evaluated and it is demonstrated that this friction is increased by 30 55 compared to the 2d case credit

21208,this paper presents a simple model of the turbulent wave boundary layer for the case where the orbital motion formed by the waves just outside the boundary layer is circular the analysis is based on the integral momentum method it turns out that the wall friction under such a flow is larger than the similar 2d case it is demonstrated that even though the motion is quite different the wall friction predictions are not significantly different from the 2d case where the orbital motion follows a straight line the bed friction increases by 15 40 for the circular orbit case depending on roughness and orbital radius the analysis includes the case of a weak current superposed the waves for this case the flow resistance for the current increases by around 30 55 for a circular orbit compared to a straight motion back and forth keywords hydrodynamics wave roughness drift forces ship resistance 1 introduction the bottom wave boundary layer formed at the seabed due to combined waves and current has been investigated by a large number of researchers e g lundgren 1972 grant and madsen 1979 fredsoe 1984 and soulsby et al 1993 all these models consider 2d plane waves in combination with a current forming an arbitrary angle with the direction of wave propagation this boundary layer is characterized by unsteadiness in the boundary layer thickness in a phase resolved flow description in this note the special case of a circular orbit of the wave induced flow is considered no investigations on the bottom wbl under three dimensional waves have been performed to the author s knowledge the problem has its similarity to geostrophic flow like the ekman layer where the coriolis force acts perpendicular to the flow velocity e g madsen 1977 however in these kind of flows the total flow depth is taken to be the boundary layer thickness while in the present the boundary layer thickness as the wall shear stress are calculated as function of the orbital motion and wall roughness the general case of an elliptical orbit is complex to calculate because the wall friction changes size as well as direction at all times in the 2d case where the near wall motion is a straight line back and forth the wall friction changes with time but do not change direction in the present note the opposite case is studied in which the orbit parallel to the wall is fully circular in this case the wall friction changes direction all times while the magnitude is time invariant this is called the 3d case in this note the calculated values are compared with the 2d values both obtained by applying the momentum integral method the solution by fredsoe 1984 for the 2d case is applied for the comparison these two extreme cases provide an estimate of the impact on wave friction factors friction and flow resistance to a co existing current due to an open orbit as compared to the plane wave case 2 where exist circular orbital boundary layers this and the following section gives some examples on where such a flow may exist 2 1 seabed 2 1 1 directional waves when two identical regular wave trains cross each other perpendicularly the near bed orbital motion in a plane view above the seabed will generally be open elliptical shaped ranging from a straight motion back and forth to a fully circular orbit this special case is seldom in nature where directional waves are confined to much smaller spreading so the orbital motion in a plane parallel to the bed will rather be narrow elliptical than circular shaped 2 1 2 vertical reflective walls in front of reflective walls exposed to obliquely incoming waves you may observe orbital patterns which for 45 approaching angle occasionally will lead to circular fluid trajectories here the bed friction is of importance in relation to bed scour in front of the wall and flow resistance for a co existent current 2 2 wave flumes the wave boundary layer with a free stream circular orbit does also exist elsewhere like along the side walls of a wave flume if experimentally the flow resistance to the current in the combined wave current motion is considered many researchers neglect the impact of wall friction because they assume the bottom to be much rougher than the sidewalls however as demonstrated in this note the flow resistance from the walls may be higher than expected due to the different behavior of the flow 2 3 importance of skin friction to moored offshore structures structures like moored ships tension leg platforms semi submersibles floating wind turbines are exposed to long period waves from wave groups partly due to slowly varying excitation force from each regular wave part hsu and blenkarn 1972 faltinsen and løken 1979 corresponding to temporal changes in the radiation stresses from the small waves and the high waves in the wave group longuet higgins and stewart 1964 this contributes with long period motion of the structure due to second order force terms by the waves next to that the co existence of current and wind also expose the structures the forces acting on the structure are usually split up into drift forces agitating and damping forces and the description of each of these can again be divided into potential flow i e non viscous flow modelling and viscous flow modelling the viscous terms include pressure drag due to flow separation and vortex shedding and further skin friction for a review see lundgren et al 1982 the viscous forces have not achieved the same attention as the potential forces because their relatively small magnitude compared to the potential wave forces however viscous forces also play an important role as a drift force as well as a damping force see for instance lundgren et al 1982 the viscous forces can be divided into two parts a form drag due to downstream flow separation in the downstream wake the pressure is low and close to the pressure at the separation points and this create a pressure contribution the pressure drag term to the total viscous force next to this the skin friction contributes with a frictional term and the significance of this force depends very much on the shape of the structure 2 3 1 circular vertical cylinder if exposed to a current only the relative contribution of the friction force to the total drag force only constitutes 1 2 achenbach 1968 in oscillatory flow the relative contribution depends on the keulegan carpenter number k c 2 π a d here d is the diameter and a is the orbital amplitude for small kc numbers the downstream flow separation do not have sufficient time to develop fredsoe and justesen 1986 so the pressure contribution decreases and the friction term and pressure term becomes about the same for kc 2 see fig 4 12 sumer and fredsoe 2006 for smaller kc values the frictional term dominates when deep water waves meet a vertical circular cylinder the fluid particle orbital trajectory at the front will be a straight vertical line at 45 an ellipse and at 90 a circular path as sketched by lundgren et al 1982 their fig 9 2 3 2 horizontal large cylinder e g submerged pontoon on a semi sub this is relative to a parallel current flow a much more elongated structure and for this case the skin friction will dominate on such elements like the vertical cylinder in deep water waves the orbital trajectories will be a straight horizontal line on the top and at the bottom and circular at its vertical side 2 3 3 ship hulls a third example is the flow around the hull of a large ship meeting deep water waves in head sea conditions in this case we actually get a circular orbit from the waves in combination with a current where the latter is due to the drift speed of the ship because of its elongated shape the skin friction on ships might reach the same size as that due to downstream flow separation even without presence of waves with waves the skin friction may even dominate depending on the width to length ratio of the ship cf numerical example later in this note 3 examples on potential and viscous flow models the literature on loads on offshore structures are voluminous and standard books on the subjects are e g chakrabarti 1984b faltinsen 1990 and newman 2018 several researchers have considered the influence of the drift velocity on the forces that causes the drift e g faltinsen 1988 and aranha 1994 these papers investigate radiation of waves from the moving body and the induced damping aranha claims viscous dissipation is very small since it is proportional to drift velocity squared this statement is not always true as already pointed out by lundgren et al 1982 who demonstrated that the viscous resistance term from skin friction is proportional to the wave orbital flow velocity u 0 multiplied by the drift velocity for large waves in conjunction with a weak drift velocity this leads to an at least one order of magnitude larger skin friction contribution and is one motivation for this note in the lundgren et al paper the wave orbital trajectories were assumed to be inline 2d in lack of a 3d solution 3 1 viscous flow models the viscous forces act as drift as well as dampening forces the surrounding fluid creates a friction drag on the floating structure when a relative motion exists between the structure and the fluid thus if the surrounding fluid velocity is larger than that of the structure the viscous forces will contribute to enhance the structure motion and similarly for a smaller fluid velocity than that of the structure the structure motion will be dampened a number of papers modelling the behavior of structures in the marine environment includes the viscous terms mainly as a pressure force with the hydrodynamics contained in the drag coefficient c d used in the morison equation accounting for the relative velocity between wave current and structure examples are chakrabarti 1984a vertical cylinder donley and spanos 1991 tlp bertelsen et al 2009 tlp dev and pinkster 1995 semi sub ma et al 2020 semi sub from the modelling work it is not possible to extract the sensitivity to the selected value of c d which usually is taken to be about 1 0 1 1 sometimes adjusted to make the best fit with experimental data for instance fonseca and stansberg 2018 dev and pinkster 1994 1995 provides a review of viscous effects on semi subs and tlp the aim of this note is to go a little more into the details of the hydrodynamics of the viscous drag forces namely the boundary layers and the resulting skin friction on the vertical parts of structure exposed to waves parallel to the structure the coexistence of a current or a drift of the structure is discussed one reason for the study is that such boundary layers in model tests are laminar while turbulent in prototype to evaluate scale effects the prototype solution is needed 4 basic equations in this section the circular wave boundary layer is investigated a circular motion outside the boundary layer can be written by 1 u e u 0 cos ω t j u 0 sin ω t where ω is cyclic frequency t is time u 0 is the amplitude of the velocity and e and j are the unit vectors in an x y coordinate system parallel to the wall in the boundary layer the flow velocity u u x u y must accordingly vary sinusoidal in time but with a phase shift ϕ and different amplitude a than outside the boundary layer 2 u e u x j u y e a z cos ω t ϕ z j a z sin ω t ϕ z where z is the distance from the wall u and ϕ are shown in the definition fig 1 the equation of motion for the x and y direction inside the boundary layer reads 3 ρ u x t τ x z p x τ x z ρ t u 0 cos ω t and 4 ρ u y t τ y z p y τ y z ρ t u 0 sin ω t where the indices x and y refer to the components of shear τ and velocity in the two directions p is the pressure which penetrates unchanged from the outer potential flow through the boundary layer 5 laminar and turbulent flow the laminar flow case the laminar case is easy to solve because laminar flow is linear for flows without convective terms because the bed skin friction is proportional to the velocity gradient τ b ν ρ u z ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid about 10 6 m2 s for water at 10 c the flow given by eqs 3 and 4 can be obtained by superposition of a sinusoidal flow in the x direction combined with the same with a phase shift in ω t π 2 in the y direction the 2d case is well known see e g fredsoe and deigaard 1992 p 19 and can be solved exact the bed friction factor is f l a m defined by 5 τ b 1 2 ρ f l a m u 0 2 and is found to be 6 f l a m 2 r e in which the amplitude reynolds number re is defined by 7 r e u 0 a ν a is the orbital amplitude given by 8 a u 0 ω the transition from laminar to turbulent boundary layer for the 2d case occurs for re values smaller than about 5 105 jonsson 1980 p117 5 1 the turbulent case in turbulent flow the 2d flow cases cannot be superposed similarly to the laminar case this is because the bed friction increases nonlinear usually squared with the flow velocity by looking at the laminar case described above the bed shear stress acting on the flow in the y direction will therefore be affected by the strength of the flow in the x direction as well and a larger friction to the flow must be anticipated the aim of this note is to evaluate this increase no analytical solution are available for this flow and the tool applied here to investigate the flow is an integrated approach rather than a detailed turbulence approach which must be solved numerically 6 the integral momentum equation the idea behind the integral momentum equation is to integrate the equations of motion over the entire boundary layer and next to insert a reasonable estimate of the velocity profile into this integrated equation this provide results which are very similar and very close to more sophisticated turbulence models see e g fig 2 22 fredsoe and deigaard 1992 eqs 3 and 4 are integrated from the wall at z z 0 z 0 being the roughness height to the outer edge of the boundary layer at z δ where δ is the boundary layer thickness 9 ρ z 0 δ ω a z sin ϕ z d z τ 0 τ b cos ϕ b ρ u f 2 cos ϕ b and 10 ρ z 0 δ ω a z cos ϕ z d z τ b sin ϕ z 0 ρ δ ω u 0 ρ u f 2 sin ϕ b ρ δ ω u 0 the velocity amplitude a is defined in eq 2 in eq 9 τ 0 stands for the shear stress at the top of the boundary layer and is therefore zero τ b is the wall shear stress which is related to the skin friction velocity u f as given in eq 9 finally ϕ b ϕ z 0 is the angle at the bed in eqs 9 and 10 the time t has been put equal zero which doesn t restrict the validity of the equations as only the direction of the velocity not the size changes with time 6 1 velocity profiles in the turbulent boundary layer the next step in the momentum integral method is to prescribe the velocity profile in the boundary layer in a turbulent flow the most common is to adapt a logarithmic shaped velocity profile 11 a z u f 1 κ ln z z 0 where κ is the von kármán s constant set equal 0 40 and z 0 the roughness parameter at the top of the boundary layer the velocity must be equal to the outer potential flow velocity given by eq 1 so 12 a δ u 0 by introducing the dimensionless parameter 13 ς κ u 0 u f eqs 11 and 12 give 14 δ z 0 exp ς which relates the boundary layer to the ς parameter to be found later the turn ϕ in the velocity through the boundary layer is assumed to be linear so 15 cos ϕ cos ϕ b 1 z δ

parameters ς and ϕ b are found input parameter is the dimensionless parameter κ 2 a z 0 7 1 case a the hydraulic rough wall the wall is hydraulic rough if the roughness k is larger than the thickness δ v of the viscous sublayer which is given by 22 δ v 11 7 ν u f here k is the nikuradse roughness of the wall see schlicting 1979 p 619 in the rough wall case z 0 k 30 applying this as input parameter in eqs 19 and 21 ς and ϕ b are found by iteration the results are given in table 1 usually the friction is described by the wave friction factor f defined similarly to eq 5 by 23 τ b ρ 1 2 f u 0 2 or 24 f 2 u f u 0 2 2 κ 2 ς 2 0 32 ς 2 here eq 13 is applied in the realistic interval 10 3 a k 10 5 the friction factor listed in table 1 can be approximated within 2 by 25 f 3 d 0 064 a k 0 274 table 1 also compares the present 3d result with the 2d solution also based on the integrated momentum approach by fredsoe 1984 in the 2d case the boundary layer thickness and wall friction is time dependent and the friction factor is in that case still defined by eq 23 but based on maximum values 26 τ b max ρ 1 2 f u 0 max 2 in which there is a phase shift in between maximum shear stress and maximum outer orbital velocity the shear stress is slightly ahead of the flow velocity the boundary layer tthickness in the 2d case is defined as the thickness at the time where the outer flow velocity is maximum table 1 shows that the 3d solution predicts a 15 45 larger friction factor as that predicted by applying the momentum integral method for the corresponding 2d case fredsoe 1984 27 f 2 d 0 042 a k 0 253 7 2 case b the hydraulic smooth wall in the smooth wall case the roughness parameter z 0 appearing in eq 11 is given by z 0 ν 9 8 u f see schlichting 1979 p 619 the further analysis proceeds as for the rough wall case the results are listed in table 2 instead of the parameter a k the input parameter is now the reynolds number re defined by eq 7 which easily gives ς and thereby the friction factor and boundary layer thickness as function of the reynolds number the friction factor given in table 2 can for re larger than 10 6 be approximated by 28 f 3 d 0 0405 r e 0 155 while for the 2d case the similar expression is 29 f 2 d 0 030 r e 0 148 as expected for both the rough and the smooth wall the increase is largest for large curvature flow small orbital radius a and the inwards turn in near bed shear stress is similarly largest for small values of a 8 the combined wave plus current case in this section the implication of an open circular orbit on the time averaged flow resistance for a current is outlined the current velocity u c at the top of the boundary layer is assumed to be weak as compared to the orbital velocity u 0 so the friction factor for the combined flow case can be taken equal the one obtained above for the wave alone case the flow situation is sketched in fig 2 during one wave period t a fluid particle at the edge of the boundary layer will move the distance u c t in the current direction left while the instantaneous velocity vector is the vectorial sum of the current velocity vector and the instantaneous wave induced flow velocity u given by eq 1 applying eq 23 for the combined flow the instantaneous bed shear stress in the mean current direction is given by 30 τ c 1 2 ρ f u 0 cos ω t u c 2 u 0 2 sin 2 ω t cos α where α is the instantaneous angle between the current direction and the wave current velocity direction this angle is determined by cf fig 2 right 31 cos α u 0 cos ω t u c u 0 cos ω t u c 2 u 0 2 sin 2 ω t the time averaged value of the bed shear stress can now be found from eqs 30 and 31 to be τ c 1 t 0 t τ d t c 1 2 ρ f 0 t u 0 cos ω t u c 2 u 0 2 sin 2 ω t cos α d t 1 2 ρ f 0 t u 0 cos ω t u c u 0 cos ω t u c

constant in time in the 2d case the same calculation of the flow resistance for the 2d case 33 τ c 1 2 ρ f 2 d 0 t u 0 cos ω t u c 2 d t 2 π ρ f 2 d u 0 u c 1 2 ρ 1 28 f 2 d u 0 u c cf lundgren et al 1982 for the detailed calculations see fredsoe and deigaard 1992 p 59 here f 2 d is the friction factor for the fully 2d flow by comparison of eqs 32 and 33 it is observed that the flow resistance to the current increases due to two different causes a based on the results from tables 1 and 2 the friction factor is larger in the 3d case than in the 2d case about 20 40 for the rough wall case and about 20 in the smooth wall case and b the time averaging provides a 17 increase for the 3d case compared to 2d the increase from 1 28 in eq 33 to 1 50 in eq 32 the two effects combined suggest an increase in flow resistance by nearly 40 50 with a circular orbit as compared to the simple back and forth 2d case 9 elliptical orbital motion in general the orbital path has an elliptical shape with an amplitude a 1 in the direction of wave propagation and a 2 perpendicular to this the expression eq 33 is valid for 2d orbital motion back and forth so a 1 a 2 0 while eq 32 is valid for a 1 a 2 a assuming a linear variation from the one expression to the other the general expression with a 2 being different from a 1 reads 34 f c w 1 28 f 2 d 1 28 f 2 d 1 5 f 3 d a 2 a 1 f c w being defined by 35 τ c w 1 2 ρ f c w u 0 u c both values f 2 d and f 3 d in eq 34 are based on a 1 from eqs 25 and 27 for the rough wall case and eqs 28 and 29 for the smooth wall case 10 numerical example in this section the findings is illustrated by a simple numerical example the drag exerted by a square meter on the vertical part of the hull near the water surface on a ship met by head waves on deep water the waves are assumed to be regular 5 m high and a wave period t equal 10 s the ship exposed to a parallel current or the ship is moving relatively to the water with a velocity u c 10 1 deep water here linear wave theory gives u 0 1 57 m s and a u 0 t 2 π 2 50 m if the hull has a roughness k equal 1 mm a k is 2 51 103 corresponding to a wave friction factor eq 25 f 0 0075 and a friction velocity equal u f f 2 u 0 0 0961 m s the thickness of the viscous sublayer eq 22 becomes with ν 10 6 m 2 s for water δ 0 122 m m this means the surface with a roughness equal 1 mm is in the fully rough regime the time averaged wall shear stress due to a current u c is found from eq 32 to be 36 τ c ρ 3 4 f u 0 u c 3 4 0 0075 1 57 u c 0 0056 1 57 u c 0 00883 u c m 2 s 2 was the wall instead smooth i e roughness smaller than 0 1 mm then the re number is r e 1 57 2 50 10 6 3 92 10 6 according to eq 28 this gives a friction factor equal f 0 00385 or just half the skin friction flow resistance of that from the rough wall case above 10 2 intermediate depth if instead the water depth is only 15 m and the wave height and period kept the same as above the maximum horizontal flow velocity becomes 2 25 m s while the maximum vertical flow velocity remains 1 575 m s the corresponding orbital amplitudes are 3 61 m and 2 5 m respectively eq 34 now gives the following friction factor the values adapted from eqs 25 and 27 rough wall a k 3610 for k 1 mm f c w 1 28 f 2 d 1 28 f 2 d 1 5 f 3 d a 2 a 1 1 28 0 0053 1 28 0 0053 1 5 0 0068 2 50 3 61 0 0091 the resulting drag per unit area becomes τ c ρ 1 2 f c w u 0 u c 1 2 0 0091 1 57 u s h i p 0 00714 u s h i p m 2 s 2 this is less than in deep water because the flow is more 2d elliptical orbits due to the restricted flow depth 10 3 impact of waves on skin friction along a slender structure met by head waves for the current alone case the friction is differently distributed as it is in combined waves plus current a boundary layer develops along the hull with a linear increase in thickness along the hull about 1 10 the friction is therefore largest at the front thin boundary layer and decay in the downstream direction half downstream along the hull of a 50 m long ship the boundary layer thickness δ is about 2 5 m and the corresponding friction factor can be found by 37 2 f c 3 2 1 κ ln δ u f ν this is the colebrook white 1937 flow resistance formula for a hydraulic smooth wall alternatively see newman 2018 ch 3 8 eq 37 needs to be solved by iteration because u f appears on both sides of the equation for a current velocity 0 15 m s f c 0 0022 and the thickness of the viscous sublayer is 2 9 mm cf eq 22 this is larger than k 1 mm so the wall is smooth for this flow the wall shear stress is therefore 38 τ c ρ 1 2 0 0034 u c 2 the ratio between wall shear stress in current alone eq 38 and in combined waves plus current eq 36 is 39 τ c τ c w 0 0034 u c 2 0 0056 u c u 0 0 61 u c u 0 if the current is only 10 of the orbital velocity the wall shear stress is increased by a factor 16 due to presence of waves in this numerical example thus the impact of waves on skin friction is significant and will be one reason why skin friction may be important for elongated structures met by head waves as illustrated in the following numerical example a ship is assumed to be a box with rectangular cross section with a streamlined bow length l draught d and width w the skin friction on this on the two vertical sides of the hull is 40 t 1 2 ρ f 1 5 u 0 u c 2 l d the pressure contribution due to the wake downstream the stern without any impact from waves is 41 p 1 2 ρ c d u c 2 w d eq 41 is only a rough estimate because the impact of waves on this contribution is not included the ratio between the two quantities t and p is t p f 1 5 u 0 u c 2 l d p c d u c 2 w d 3 f c d u 0 u c l w for the following values f 0 0075 c d 1 and u 0 u c 10 the skin friction loss will be equal to the pressure contribution in the downstream wake for a ship longer than about 4 5 its width also skin friction is acting beneath the box the keel here the wave impact will be less partly because the larger distance to the water surface and also because the oscillatory motion beneath the box will be less because its only driven by the pressure variations at the two boundaries at the edges of the box nevertheless also this drag contribution will have an impact increasing with the ratio w d because this drag acts on an area equal wl 11 other remarks scale effects one motivation for this study is to be able to quantify scale effects when modelling movements of moored ships exposed to wave groups and current while waves can be correctly modelled using the froude model law in the laboratory and the scale effects originate from the viscous terms the model scale often is 1 25 or 1 50 and it is almost impossible to reach the same turbulent conditions as in prototype even with artificial roughness implemented on the hull so a scale effect is introduced one contribution to the force is the drag due to downstream flow separation which also is re dependent because the separation point may move with re dependent on the exact design of the ship hull because of its elongated shape the skin friction on ships might reach the same size as that due to downstream flow separation the viscous pressure contribution in this note the laminar and the turbulent solution are both given so the scale effects originating from the part of forces due to skin friction can be evaluated experiments no comparison with experiments have been done due to lack of such data for the 3d case for the 2d case the experimental support is rich because very large re number can be achieved in closed u tunnels it is difficult to see how a similar set up can be achieved for the 3d case because there are limitations for how high waves you can produce in the laboratory almost all wave boundary layers formed by real waves in the laboratory are laminar but turbulent in nature one way to perform experiments is to make a setup where a plate is moved in its own plane with a circular trajectory in a chamber with resting water the dimensions must be quite large to get sufficient high orbital amplitude a and to be in the turbulent regime one problem with such a setup is that the limited dimension of the chamber introduces some secondary flow at the edges the best way is probably to perform a few numerical dns experiments which should be possible due to the simplicity of the problem with no time and space variations except in the z direction 12 conclusion it is demonstrated theoretically that the wall friction increases when waves are present if the orbital motion changes from a straight line to an open orbit at the edge of the boundary layer only the special case of a circular orbit has been considered and the increase in the wall friction factor is about 15 40 largest for the smooth wall case by adding a small current the friction factor for this current motion is evaluated and it is demonstrated that this friction is increased by 30 55 compared to the 2d case credit

21209,for the vibration of long served offshore platforms induced by working equipment it is very difficult to determine the relevant parameters such as structural stiffness mass and exciting loads accurately in order to determine the parameters reasonably a comprehensive vibration testing was carried out to learn the general vibrating features on the offshore platform by a total of 51 measured points distributed on different decks of a 15 year platform the measurement showed that the induced vibration covers multiple modes with a range of frequencies because of the complexity of the platform structure therefore we introduced average amplitude of vibrating displacement at each measurement point to define its vibrating strength with the measured results of the vibration a finite element model of the platform with explicit solution was set up to simulate the vibration of the platform the natural frequencies and average amplitudes at different locations were set as the target values to determine the unknown mass and exciting load in an updating procedure the results of the modified model have a good agreement with the target values which indicated that the modified model is reliable and the updating method for determining unknown parameters in a complex structure is feasible keywords offshore platform vibration natural frequency model updating load identification 1 introduction with the development of the world economy the exploitation of marine resources has been paid more and more attention the offshore platform is the main facility for the exploitation of marine resources and its safety and comfort are more and more important vibration is one of the most important factors that affect the platform s safety and comfort the early research on the vibration of offshore platforms mainly focuses on the influence of environment loads mainly including wave mazaheri and downie 2005 moan et al 2007 wind ngash 1979 gomathinayagam et al 2000 earthquake el din and kim 2015 park et al 2011 wu et al 2011 ice wu et al 2011 ou et al 2007 wang et al 2013 et al in addition there were also some scholars and experts studying the vibration problem caused by the equipments vandiver and mitome 1979 took a research on the vibration characteristics of offshore platform under the liquid sloshing in the storage tanks lou et al 2012 described the structure design of the platform and put forward the control method of vibration caused by equipment for the vibration caused by the working equipment the vibration energy is part of the equipment s working energy it is hard to estimate whether the vibration energy has been put into the structure to excite the vibration the methods of load identification are mainly divided into the time domain and frequency domain analysis zou et al 2019 obtained the nonlinear vibration and acoustic radiation of ship structure mainly relying on frequency domain analysis yang et al 2018 combined time domain and frequency domain analysis to determine the bending stiffness of bridge structures for damage detection joh et al 2018 obtain the dynamic response of railway sleeper through time domain and frequency domain analysis barlett and flannelly 1979 used frequency domain method to identify the dynamic load of helicopter desangher and snoeys 1985 first introduced the modal coordinates into load identification in recent years methods of load identification have made a lot of progress but because of offshore platform s structural complexity the research on the load identification of offshore platform is relatively few which mainly focused on the identification of load induced by the wind earthquake and ice kareem 1983 and haddara et al 1999 identified the wind load on offshore platform elshafey et al 2009 studied the random excitation force on the offshore platform ou et al 2007 yue et al 2009 analyzed the description of ice load and the response of the offshore platform moreover for a long served offshore platform the structural stiffness is degraded and the equipment parameters including mass and load get changed which make the structure different from the original design as a result the vibration characteristics of the offshore platform are difficult to determine accurately however most of the past researches focus on the vibration analysis of structures with known structural and external load parameters scholars nowadays pay more and more attention to the updating method to solve the problem wu et al 2004 2006 launched a series of research on the vibration of nanjing tv tower they compared a variety of model updating method and used two stage model updating method to establish the reasonable structure model and checked the structural damage in conjunction with weight in motion technology and interferometric radar sensors kafle et al 2017 established a 3d finite element model to obtain real time dynamic response of the bridge for further research arrez et al 2018 performed indentation test and finite element analysis to characterize viscoelastic parameters of soft biological materials liu et al 2005 and liu et al 2007 put forward some new methods to generalize model updating and dynamic force identification on the updating of offshore platform structure model tawekal et al 1992 and mojtahedi et al 2011 updated the model by setting the target value with the modal parameters for the regularity structure obviously the modal parameters are more difficult to obtain in the analysis for a long served large structure therefore a more suitable model updating method should be proposed to solve the problem this paper focused on the measurement and modelling of the vibration of a long served offshore platform named w12 1 which has been in service for 15 years in order to analyze the vibration characteristic and accurately simulate the response of offshore platform a comprehensive vibration test on the offshore platform was carried out through laying out a total of 51 measured points the test scenario considered the vibration of the key points on the offshore platform such as the points on the compressor and its peripheral components the points on platform deck near and far from the compressor the column between deck based on the measured signal a new updating model method for the deck equipment mass and the excitation load is proposed the average amplitudes and natural frequencies of local structures and excitation amplitudes of the controlled points were used to update the equivalent quality parameters and load parameters for each layer deck of the model through the updating model method the simulation results of the modified model have a good agreement with the measured displacement time curve and the fft frequency curve which indicates the modified structural model for the platform is accurate and the updating method for determining unknown parameters in a complex structure is feasible 2 data collection and analysis 2 1 introduction of w12 1 offshore platform and the vibration problem w12 1 is an 8 leg offshore platform fig 1 a which has served for 15 years the platform has 3 decks the upper deck is the living areas the middle and lower decks are the production areas the main structure of the platform including the legs and decks was made of steel there are many different systems on the platform deck including production system water system fire protection system public system natural gas treatment system and sewage treatment system which make the analysis more difficult and uncertain the investigation on the site shows though there are obvious vibration and noise in the living areas the upper deck and working areas the middle deck the vibration in production areas the lower deck is the severest the vibration on the platform is probably induced by the two natural gas compressors on the lower deck the natural gas compressors are located in the central of the lower deck fig 1 b each compressor is about 100t and the working frequency of compressors is about 16 5 hz 2 2 layout of measuring points in order to analyze the vibration characteristics of the platform more precisely vibration tests were carried out seven cases were taken into account and the locations of measured points were shown in table 1 the layout and the in situ photos of measuring points were shown in fig 2 and fig 3 during the vibration tests the average wave height of the sea was less than 0 5 m during the data collection whose effect on the vibration of the platform was neglected 2 3 vibration signal acquisition the measurement device used for real time acquisition of vibration signal is sdy2400a fig 4 a a data collector with 8 channels and wide band response of frequency the ca yd 108 acceleration sensors fig 4 b were placed at the measuring points in addition the 3 d vibration signals from sensors at the measuring points on compressor and column were measured and only the vertical vibration signals of the points on deck were captured 2 4 method of data processing according to the acceleration data collected in the site test the structure s natural frequencies were lower than 10 hz and the induced frequency was about 16 hz therefore the butterworth filter was firstly used to filter the higher frequencies in each signal additionally the cutoff frequency was set to 150 hz and the cutoff frequency of stop band was set to 220 hz as we know the acceleration signal may couple many periodic noise signals even after filtering but the displacement signals obtained through integrating the acceleration signal two times may eliminate those noise signals well therefore the displacement signals are used to analyze the measurement signals and simulation signals in all cases for the vibrations were mainly in the vertical direction the acceleration signals collected in the vertical direction were analyzed precisely finally the fft was used to analyze displacement time signals to investigate the characteristics of frequency the diagram of data processing is shown in fig 5 2 5 data analysis by processing the acquired data we can get the displacement time curve of each measured point the displacement time curves are integrated with the measured acceleration 1 v t v 0 t 1 t a τ d τ 2 w t w 0 t 1 t v τ d τ where v 0 w 0 are the initial velocity and initial displacement at the beginning time of the monitoring w 0 is chosen as the reference displacement and is set to zero a proper value of v 0 is set to ensure the average value of displacement obtained from equation 2 namely the trend line of the vibration is zero the typical displacement s signals of points at different cases are shown in fig 6 the red lines represent the average amplitude of the displacements the average amplitudes of the vibrating displacement at each point are summarized in table 2 form table 2 and fig 6 it can be seen that the maximum average amplitude appears at the measured points near the compressor case1 7 the greater the distance away from the compressor the smaller the average amplitude and the average amplitudes of the measured points on two decks are larger than that of the measured points in column meanwhile the vibrations at the slab column connections near the compressor are more strongly as a result the vibrations of the offshore platform are mainly caused by the working equipment on the lower deck defining the displacements as functions of time d t i the displacements can be analyzed in frequency domain using fft method 3 d ˆ ω d t e j ω t d t by using fft on displacement signal the frequency domain information can be obtained the fft results of all selected curves in fig 6 are shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 the vibration is composed of some low frequency signals and a main frequency signal of 16 5 hz according to the theory of induced vibration structure s responses are mostly caused by the vibration source with main frequency and the rest parts of the response signals are the vibrations with natural frequencies thomson 1998 due to the complexity of the environment and structure the natural frequencies of the offshore platform appear as a range of frequencies but not several discrete frequencies as we can see in fig 7 the structure s natural frequency ranges between 2 0 and 3 5 hz and the natural vibrations of local parts have a nonnegligible contribution to the displacement signals and all signals of the measured points have a main frequency of 16 5 hz so the working frequency of the compressor is also 16 5 hz it can be confirmed that the running compressor is the source of induced vibration and the displacement amplitude at the 16 5 hz indicated the excitation response of the measured points the vibration characteristics of the measured points are shown in table 3 2 6 feasibility analysis since offshore platform is mainly composed of multilayer plates and their supports their overall vibration characteristics should be similar to those of plates in order to verify the feasibility that the boundary conditions and load parameters of the offshore platform s components can be effectively obtained from displacement time information of the known certain points consider a plate to reveal the vibrating mechanism of the entire structural system as shown in fig 8 as the horizontal thickness of the deck is much smaller than the characteristic size of the longitudinal plane h a b the deck is simplified as a thin plate in this work the external load f x y t is assumed to be a simple harmonic load which is expressed as f 0 x y sin ω t the boundary constraint is between simply supported and clamped support on four sides constant α is introduced as a scale factor so the deflection distribution of the thin plate w x y t is 4 w x y t α w s x y t 1 α w c x y t according to d alambert principle the differential equilibrium equation of the thin plate is 5 d ρ 4 w 2 w t 2 f x y t ρ where d eh 3 12 1 v 2 refers to bending stiffness of the plate ρ is the mass per unit area of the longitudinal plane under the conditions of simply support on four sides the instantaneous deflection w s x y t and instantaneous load f x y t of the thin plate equivalent system can be written as 6 w s x y t m 1 n 1 w m n t sin m π x a sin n π y b 7 f x y t m 1 n 1 c m n sin

0 a f 0 x y sin m π x a sin n π y b d x d y substituting equations 6 8 into equation 5 we get 9 m 1 n 1 ω m n 2 w t w m n t c m n ρ sin ω t sin m π x a sin n π y b 0 where ω mn d ρ π 4 m 2 a 2 n 2 b 2 is the m n order natural frequency of the thin plate since the differential equation 5 must be satisfied for any x and y then equation 9 becomes 10 ω m n 2 w t w m n t c m n ρ sin ω t 0 combining the initial conditions w 0 0 and v 0 0 the bending deflection of the plate can be expressed as 11 w s x y t m 1 n 1 1 ω ω m n c m n ρ ω m n 2 ω 2 sin ω t sin m π x a sin n π y b in the case of clamped support on four sides it can be equivalent to a simple support system while continuous bending moments acting on the four sides as shown in fig 9 m 1 x sin ω t m 3 x sin ω t are acting on edges y 0 y

vibration acceleration response when the offshore platform system is put into use theoretically as long as the basic material and size parameters of the offshore platform the frequency and distribution of the initial applied load are known the deflection distribution of the offshore platform s deck can be obtained as we know if the boundary conditions and load parameters including amplitude and frequency are known the displacement results at different points of the plate can be obtained but from the above theoretical derivation if the displacement time curve of certain points of the plate is known the mathematical expression of boundary conditions and load parameters can also be inversely calculated therefore combined with the hypothesis that the vibration characteristics of plate and offshore platform are similar that means we can obtain the actual load parameters of the offshore platform through the displacement time curve of a specific point under the compressor load 3 finite element model the displacements at the measured points are influenced by the structure parameters and load parameters which has been changed greatly during the running and maintenance of the equipment in order to study the response and vibration characteristic of the w12 1 offshore platform more precisely a finite element fe model of the platform was built and vibration analysis were carried out due to the complexity of the structure and a variety of working equipment on the platform the mass of the platform is quite different from that of initial design therefore it is necessary to modify the mass of the platform in the fe model what s more the excitation load of compressors on the platform is also needed to estimate as a result a new simulation method shall be worked out to simulate the vibration response of the platform 3 1 geometric model of structure and calculation method in finite element analysis geometric model of the platform was in accordance with the original design but without considering the equipment installed later the structural material was defined as steel and the material parameters are listed in table 4 explicit analysis of abaqus was used to solve the vibration response of the fe model the main structures of the platform included the decks beams and columns the decks were simulated by shell elements s4r the beams and columns were simulated by the beam elements b31 3 2 boundary conditions considering the 8 main columns of the platform were inserted into the sea bed deeply the boundary conditions of the 8 columns are set to be fixed shown in fig 10 3 3 mass parameters considering the effects of the unknown mass equipment on the vibration response many mass points at the junction of the beams and columns were set to simulate the unknown mass equipment the masses on the same deck have the same value but different on three decks the layout of mass points is shown in fig 11 however the w12 1 platform has served for 15 years various equipment has been installed at different stages the mass acting on the mass points is not clear therefore the values of masses are parameters need to be determined in following fe analysis on the basis of site investigation the w12 1 platform is well maintained therefore the effects of stiffness decay such as loss of cross section on the vibrating properties are not considered in the model analysis we can build the stiffness matrix k according to the initial design 3 4 load setting according to the analysis in chapter 2 5 the vibration is mainly caused by the working compressors within which a piston plays a high speed back and forth motion therefore in the fe simulation such excitation was simplified as a sinusoidal load applied on a rigid body with same mass of the compressor shown in fig 12 the sinusoidal load f t will be applied on the foundation of the compressor which is expressed as f 0 sin ω t in which ω 2 π f 0 f 0 16 5 h z is the angular frequency and f 0 is the amplitude of the load however the amplitude f 0 of the load is also an undetermined parameter in fe analysis 4 model updating 4 1 basic process of updating in the fe analysis there are two undetermined parameters the masses of points and the amplitude of the load f 0 therefore how to determine the two parameters is the key for obtaining the correct result for the vibration response at each measured point the natural frequency is mainly affected by the mass whereas the vibration amplitude of the induced frequency is mainly affected by the amplitude of the load f 0 therefore the natural frequencies and the vibration amplitudes of the induced frequency at measured points are set as target values to update the two undetermined parameters the updating process is shown in fig 13 4 2 control points and the target function during the updating some representative measured points were selected as control points and their tested results were used as target values to judge the rationality of mass and load parameters firstly the mass and load parameters were set to an initial value and the displacement responses and natural frequency range were calculated secondly if the simulation results of displacement and natural frequency were consistent with the test data at the control points then a reasonable model with correct mass parameters was obtained if the simulation results were not matched with the ones of vibration test change the mass parameters and repeat the first step thirdly when if the model of offshore platform with the updated mass parameters were obtained keep the mass parameters unchanged alter the load parameter and carry out the simulation last if the displacement responses of the control points and amplitudes of the excited frequency match the measured results a reasonable updated model of offshore platform were finally achieved in the simulation the compressor was simplified as a uniform rigid and connected to the deck by a foundation which may affect the displacement response seriously of the points near the compressor as a result the measured points on compressor case1 and decks under the compressors case2 were not selected as controlled points six representative control points shown in table 5 were selected to verify the simulation results 4 3 initial value of the load at the beginning of updating the reasonable initial load should be given to reduce the looping of updating naturally the site measurement signal is a good chose for the initial load as a result the measured signals of sensors set on the running compressor case1 are considered fig 14 shows the fft result of the measured signal of sensor case1 1 the acceleration amplitudes of all measured points in case1 are shown in table 6 here the average value of acceleration amplitudes is 0 554 m s2 considering the mass of the compressor is about 100t the initial amplitude of vibration load f 0 is set to 55 4 kn and the initial estimate load f t is given by 55 4sin 33 π t 4 4 mass correction as mentioned above the masses of equipment on the decks have significant influence over the vibration response of the platform here the mass of equipment at low deck middle deck and upper deck are defined as m 1 m 2 m 3 by considering the equipment installed on the decks m 1 m 2 m 3 are all probably one of 50t 100t and 150t as a matter of fact mass updating was carried out under 16 conditions with different m 1 m 2 and m 3 in which the initial load all set to the same definition f t 55 4sin 33 π t the simulation results of the maximum amplitude of displacement at main frequency 16 5 hz and the natural frequencies are shown in tables 7 and 8 and the proportional errors of the simulation result to the measured maximum amplitude of displacement are shown in table 9 it can be found that the mass of equipment has little effect on the natural frequency but has a greater impact on the displacement distribution of the entire structural system of the offshore platform by investigating the proportional errors of the simulation result to the measured maximum amplitude of acceleration in table 9 the simulation results are closer to the measured data when m 1 150t m 2 50t m 3 150t and the calculated natural frequencies are also in the range of the test results the displacement error of the measuring points can be effectively reduced to 16 6 that means by updating the instrument mass distribution a more reliable offshore platform calculation model can be obtained considering the real condition on the platform in which the main working equipment locates on the lower deck the facilities for inhabitant mainly locate on the upper deck and there is nearly no heavy equipment on the middle deck the mass of equipment on 3 decks are set to m 1 150t m 2 50t m 3 150t in the following load modification 4 5 load modification as the simulated natural frequencies changed little under various mass options and the masses were determined by the comparison of the simulation results to the measured maximum displacement the load identification only concerns the amplitude of induced load f 0 the updating procedure of the load identification is as below 1 set the updating values of f 0 as 80 100 and 120 of the initial amplitude of load 55 4 kn simulate the response of the platform and fetch the data of acceleration at the control points and then calculate the maximum displacement at the induced frequency 16 5 hz 2 calculate the proportional error of the maximum displacement under 3 load conditions and identify the two loads of the conditions with less errors 3 interpolate three values linearly between two loads as the new 3 values of f 0 do the simulation and calculation again 4 repeat step 2 and 3 until the error of the maximum displacement are acceptable after two repetitions we found that the simulated value of f 0 52 3 kn is closer to the measured value fig 15 shows the error of each measuring point when f 0 55 4 kn and f 0 52 3 kn we can clearly see that after the load is modified the simulated displacement results are closer to the measured results and the average error is reduced by 5 5 approximately 5 model verification as mentioned above the reasonable masses of the equipment on 3 decks and the induced load were determined then we chose more measured points to verify the model considering the comprehensiveness of the verification at least one measured point in different case among case3 to case7 in total 10 measured points such as case3 1 case3 4 case4 1 case4 6 case5 1 case5 4 case6 1 case6 4 case7 1 and case7 4 are selected all fem results and measured data of displacement time curves are obtained and compared fig 16 shows the specific displacement time curve of simulation and measured signal of case3 1 we can see that though the displacement signal has strong randomness due to the noise of environmental effect the simulated results of specific case3 1 still have a high consistency with the measured results which further highlights the reliability of our finite element model and update method in order to reflect the error between simulated and measured results more effectively and directly the average amplitude of the displacement at all 10 measured points were extracted after running the fem simulation and compared with the measured data the comparison between simulated results and the measured results are shown in fig 17 as we can see except for the slightly larger deviation between the simulated results and the measured results at the verification point case7 4 the coincidence of other points is good the average proportional error of the average amplitude of displacement is 18 8 the simulation results of the natural frequencies at the verification points were presented in fig 18 the simulated natural frequencies were all among 2 0 3 5 hz so the model with the selected masses and proposed load function are reasonable however in general they seem to be slightly smaller than the measured results this may be due to the assumption that the unknown equipment on the same deck has the same mass for the sake of simplification resulting in the distribution of mass and stiffness being different from the actual structure the comparison of the vibration displacement amplitude at main frequency 16 5 hz obtained from fem simulation and site measurement was shown in fig 19 the simulated values of each verification point are in good agreement with the measured values the maximum proportional error reached 43 5 the minimum proportional error is 1 6 with the average value 13 4 as mentioned in chapter 2 1 the w12 1 is a long served offshore platform with numbers of heavy equipments and complicated components considering the complexity of the structure the simulation results and the proportional error shown in figs 17 19 are acceptable therefore the updating method for mass and load determination is feasible and the final fe model reflects the true situation to some extent based on the model more research can be carried out to investigate the mechanical response of the platform under some complex loading conditions 6 conclusion vibration response induced by working equipment on a long served offshore platform were studied comprehensively by site measurement and simulation vibration test were carried out on the decks and column of the platform an effective updating method were proposed to derive the reasonable masses of equipment and the excited loads of the compressor the following conclusions can be drawn 1 an analyzing method with site test data is explored and successfully used to determine the vibration source of a complicated structure in a complex environment for the offshore platform the fft s results of all measured displacement signals show that the vibration captured in site tests mainly include two parts one relates to the natural frequency band 2 0 3 5 hz another is at 16 5 hz which matches the working frequency of the gas compressor it is confirmed that the major vibration source is the compressor 2 a new updating method for fe model is proposed to derive the unknown structural parameters and the excited load for the long serviced offshore platforms by using the measured signals and data of vibration acceleration and displacement to revise the model constantly it can effectively avoid the wrong judgment of the structural parameters of the offshore platform a more reliable finite element model of such a complicated structure as an offshore platform is then obtained 3 with the new model the simulation s results of the average and maximum vibration displacement natural frequencies at the control points match the measurement results well which testifies the final fe model reflects the true situation and more research can be carried out to investigate the characteristic of the mechanical response of the long served offshore platform credit authorship

21209,for the vibration of long served offshore platforms induced by working equipment it is very difficult to determine the relevant parameters such as structural stiffness mass and exciting loads accurately in order to determine the parameters reasonably a comprehensive vibration testing was carried out to learn the general vibrating features on the offshore platform by a total of 51 measured points distributed on different decks of a 15 year platform the measurement showed that the induced vibration covers multiple modes with a range of frequencies because of the complexity of the platform structure therefore we introduced average amplitude of vibrating displacement at each measurement point to define its vibrating strength with the measured results of the vibration a finite element model of the platform with explicit solution was set up to simulate the vibration of the platform the natural frequencies and average amplitudes at different locations were set as the target values to determine the unknown mass and exciting load in an updating procedure the results of the modified model have a good agreement with the target values which indicated that the modified model is reliable and the updating method for determining unknown parameters in a complex structure is feasible keywords offshore platform vibration natural frequency model updating load identification 1 introduction with the development of the world economy the exploitation of marine resources has been paid more and more attention the offshore platform is the main facility for the exploitation of marine resources and its safety and comfort are more and more important vibration is one of the most important factors that affect the platform s safety and comfort the early research on the vibration of offshore platforms mainly focuses on the influence of environment loads mainly including wave mazaheri and downie 2005 moan et al 2007 wind ngash 1979 gomathinayagam et al 2000 earthquake el din and kim 2015 park et al 2011 wu et al 2011 ice wu et al 2011 ou et al 2007 wang et al 2013 et al in addition there were also some scholars and experts studying the vibration problem caused by the equipments vandiver and mitome 1979 took a research on the vibration characteristics of offshore platform under the liquid sloshing in the storage tanks lou et al 2012 described the structure design of the platform and put forward the control method of vibration caused by equipment for the vibration caused by the working equipment the vibration energy is part of the equipment s working energy it is hard to estimate whether the vibration energy has been put into the structure to excite the vibration the methods of load identification are mainly divided into the time domain and frequency domain analysis zou et al 2019 obtained the nonlinear vibration and acoustic radiation of ship structure mainly relying on frequency domain analysis yang et al 2018 combined time domain and frequency domain analysis to determine the bending stiffness of bridge structures for damage detection joh et al 2018 obtain the dynamic response of railway sleeper through time domain and frequency domain analysis barlett and flannelly 1979 used frequency domain method to identify the dynamic load of helicopter desangher and snoeys 1985 first introduced the modal coordinates into load identification in recent years methods of load identification have made a lot of progress but because of offshore platform s structural complexity the research on the load identification of offshore platform is relatively few which mainly focused on the identification of load induced by the wind earthquake and ice kareem 1983 and haddara et al 1999 identified the wind load on offshore platform elshafey et al 2009 studied the random excitation force on the offshore platform ou et al 2007 yue et al 2009 analyzed the description of ice load and the response of the offshore platform moreover for a long served offshore platform the structural stiffness is degraded and the equipment parameters including mass and load get changed which make the structure different from the original design as a result the vibration characteristics of the offshore platform are difficult to determine accurately however most of the past researches focus on the vibration analysis of structures with known structural and external load parameters scholars nowadays pay more and more attention to the updating method to solve the problem wu et al 2004 2006 launched a series of research on the vibration of nanjing tv tower they compared a variety of model updating method and used two stage model updating method to establish the reasonable structure model and checked the structural damage in conjunction with weight in motion technology and interferometric radar sensors kafle et al 2017 established a 3d finite element model to obtain real time dynamic response of the bridge for further research arrez et al 2018 performed indentation test and finite element analysis to characterize viscoelastic parameters of soft biological materials liu et al 2005 and liu et al 2007 put forward some new methods to generalize model updating and dynamic force identification on the updating of offshore platform structure model tawekal et al 1992 and mojtahedi et al 2011 updated the model by setting the target value with the modal parameters for the regularity structure obviously the modal parameters are more difficult to obtain in the analysis for a long served large structure therefore a more suitable model updating method should be proposed to solve the problem this paper focused on the measurement and modelling of the vibration of a long served offshore platform named w12 1 which has been in service for 15 years in order to analyze the vibration characteristic and accurately simulate the response of offshore platform a comprehensive vibration test on the offshore platform was carried out through laying out a total of 51 measured points the test scenario considered the vibration of the key points on the offshore platform such as the points on the compressor and its peripheral components the points on platform deck near and far from the compressor the column between deck based on the measured signal a new updating model method for the deck equipment mass and the excitation load is proposed the average amplitudes and natural frequencies of local structures and excitation amplitudes of the controlled points were used to update the equivalent quality parameters and load parameters for each layer deck of the model through the updating model method the simulation results of the modified model have a good agreement with the measured displacement time curve and the fft frequency curve which indicates the modified structural model for the platform is accurate and the updating method for determining unknown parameters in a complex structure is feasible 2 data collection and analysis 2 1 introduction of w12 1 offshore platform and the vibration problem w12 1 is an 8 leg offshore platform fig 1 a which has served for 15 years the platform has 3 decks the upper deck is the living areas the middle and lower decks are the production areas the main structure of the platform including the legs and decks was made of steel there are many different systems on the platform deck including production system water system fire protection system public system natural gas treatment system and sewage treatment system which make the analysis more difficult and uncertain the investigation on the site shows though there are obvious vibration and noise in the living areas the upper deck and working areas the middle deck the vibration in production areas the lower deck is the severest the vibration on the platform is probably induced by the two natural gas compressors on the lower deck the natural gas compressors are located in the central of the lower deck fig 1 b each compressor is about 100t and the working frequency of compressors is about 16 5 hz 2 2 layout of measuring points in order to analyze the vibration characteristics of the platform more precisely vibration tests were carried out seven cases were taken into account and the locations of measured points were shown in table 1 the layout and the in situ photos of measuring points were shown in fig 2 and fig 3 during the vibration tests the average wave height of the sea was less than 0 5 m during the data collection whose effect on the vibration of the platform was neglected 2 3 vibration signal acquisition the measurement device used for real time acquisition of vibration signal is sdy2400a fig 4 a a data collector with 8 channels and wide band response of frequency the ca yd 108 acceleration sensors fig 4 b were placed at the measuring points in addition the 3 d vibration signals from sensors at the measuring points on compressor and column were measured and only the vertical vibration signals of the points on deck were captured 2 4 method of data processing according to the acceleration data collected in the site test the structure s natural frequencies were lower than 10 hz and the induced frequency was about 16 hz therefore the butterworth filter was firstly used to filter the higher frequencies in each signal additionally the cutoff frequency was set to 150 hz and the cutoff frequency of stop band was set to 220 hz as we know the acceleration signal may couple many periodic noise signals even after filtering but the displacement signals obtained through integrating the acceleration signal two times may eliminate those noise signals well therefore the displacement signals are used to analyze the measurement signals and simulation signals in all cases for the vibrations were mainly in the vertical direction the acceleration signals collected in the vertical direction were analyzed precisely finally the fft was used to analyze displacement time signals to investigate the characteristics of frequency the diagram of data processing is shown in fig 5 2 5 data analysis by processing the acquired data we can get the displacement time curve of each measured point the displacement time curves are integrated with the measured acceleration 1 v t v 0 t 1 t a τ d τ 2 w t w 0 t 1 t v τ d τ where v 0 w 0 are the initial velocity and initial displacement at the beginning time of the monitoring w 0 is chosen as the reference displacement and is set to zero a proper value of v 0 is set to ensure the average value of displacement obtained from equation 2 namely the trend line of the vibration is zero the typical displacement s signals of points at different cases are shown in fig 6 the red lines represent the average amplitude of the displacements the average amplitudes of the vibrating displacement at each point are summarized in table 2 form table 2 and fig 6 it can be seen that the maximum average amplitude appears at the measured points near the compressor case1 7 the greater the distance away from the compressor the smaller the average amplitude and the average amplitudes of the measured points on two decks are larger than that of the measured points in column meanwhile the vibrations at the slab column connections near the compressor are more strongly as a result the vibrations of the offshore platform are mainly caused by the working equipment on the lower deck defining the displacements as functions of time d t i the displacements can be analyzed in frequency domain using fft method 3 d ˆ ω d t e j ω t d t by using fft on displacement signal the frequency domain information can be obtained the fft results of all selected curves in fig 6 are shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 the vibration is composed of some low frequency signals and a main frequency signal of 16 5 hz according to the theory of induced vibration structure s responses are mostly caused by the vibration source with main frequency and the rest parts of the response signals are the vibrations with natural frequencies thomson 1998 due to the complexity of the environment and structure the natural frequencies of the offshore platform appear as a range of frequencies but not several discrete frequencies as we can see in fig 7 the structure s natural frequency ranges between 2 0 and 3 5 hz and the natural vibrations of local parts have a nonnegligible contribution to the displacement signals and all signals of the measured points have a main frequency of 16 5 hz so the working frequency of the compressor is also 16 5 hz it can be confirmed that the running compressor is the source of induced vibration and the displacement amplitude at the 16 5 hz indicated the excitation response of the measured points the vibration characteristics of the measured points are shown in table 3 2 6 feasibility analysis since offshore platform is mainly composed of multilayer plates and their supports their overall vibration characteristics should be similar to those of plates in order to verify the feasibility that the boundary conditions and load parameters of the offshore platform s components can be effectively obtained from displacement time information of the known certain points consider a plate to reveal the vibrating mechanism of the entire structural system as shown in fig 8 as the horizontal thickness of the deck is much smaller than the characteristic size of the longitudinal plane h a b the deck is simplified as a thin plate in this work the external load f x y t is assumed to be a simple harmonic load which is expressed as f 0 x y sin ω t the boundary constraint is between simply supported and clamped support on four sides constant α is introduced as a scale factor so the deflection distribution of the thin plate w x y t is 4 w x y t α w s x y t 1 α w c x y t according to d alambert principle the differential equilibrium equation of the thin plate is 5 d ρ 4 w 2 w t 2 f x y t ρ where d eh 3 12 1 v 2 refers to bending stiffness of the plate ρ is the mass per unit area of the longitudinal plane under the conditions of simply support on four sides the instantaneous deflection w s x y t and instantaneous load f x y t of the thin plate equivalent system can be written as 6 w s x y t m 1 n 1 w m n t sin m π x a sin n π y b 7 f x y t m 1 n 1 c m n sin

is the m n order natural frequency of the thin plate since the differential equation 5 must be satisfied for any x and y then equation 9 becomes 10 ω m n 2 w t w m n t c m n ρ sin ω t 0 combining the initial conditions w 0 0 and v 0 0 the bending deflection of the plate can be expressed as 11 w s x y t m 1 n 1 1 ω ω m n c m n ρ ω m n 2 ω 2 sin ω t sin m π x a sin n π y b in the case of clamped support on four sides it can be equivalent to a simple support system while continuous bending moments acting on the four sides as shown in fig 9 m 1 x sin ω t m 3 x sin ω t are acting on edges y 0 y

vibration acceleration response when the offshore platform system is put into use theoretically as long as the basic material and size parameters of the offshore platform the frequency and distribution of the initial applied load are known the deflection distribution of the offshore platform s deck can be obtained as we know if the boundary conditions and load parameters including amplitude and frequency are known the displacement results at different points of the plate can be obtained but from the above theoretical derivation if the displacement time curve of certain points of the plate is known the mathematical expression of boundary conditions and load parameters can also be inversely calculated therefore combined with the hypothesis that the vibration characteristics of plate and offshore platform are similar that means we can obtain the actual load parameters of the offshore platform through the displacement time curve of a specific point under the compressor load 3 finite element model the displacements at the measured points are influenced by the structure parameters and load parameters which has been changed greatly during the running and maintenance of the equipment in order to study the response and vibration characteristic of the w12 1 offshore platform more precisely a finite element fe model of the platform was built and vibration analysis were carried out due to the complexity of the structure and a variety of working equipment on the platform the mass of the platform is quite different from that of initial design therefore it is necessary to modify the mass of the platform in the fe model what s more the excitation load of compressors on the platform is also needed to estimate as a result a new simulation method shall be worked out to simulate the vibration response of the platform 3 1 geometric model of structure and calculation method in finite element analysis geometric model of the platform was in accordance with the original design but without considering the equipment installed later the structural material was defined as steel and the material parameters are listed in table 4 explicit analysis of abaqus was used to solve the vibration response of the fe model the main structures of the platform included the decks beams and columns the decks were simulated by shell elements s4r the beams and columns were simulated by the beam elements b31 3 2 boundary conditions considering the 8 main columns of the platform were inserted into the sea bed deeply the boundary conditions of the 8 columns are set to be fixed shown in fig 10 3 3 mass parameters considering the effects of the unknown mass equipment on the vibration response many mass points at the junction of the beams and columns were set to simulate the unknown mass equipment the masses on the same deck have the same value but different on three decks the layout of mass points is shown in fig 11 however the w12 1 platform has served for 15 years various equipment has been installed at different stages the mass acting on the mass points is not clear therefore the values of masses are parameters need to be determined in following fe analysis on the basis of site investigation the w12 1 platform is well maintained therefore the effects of stiffness decay such as loss of cross section on the vibrating properties are not considered in the model analysis we can build the stiffness matrix k according to the initial design 3 4 load setting according to the analysis in chapter 2 5 the vibration is mainly caused by the working compressors within which a piston plays a high speed back and forth motion therefore in the fe simulation such excitation was simplified as a sinusoidal load applied on a rigid body with same mass of the compressor shown in fig 12 the sinusoidal load f t will be applied on the foundation of the compressor which is expressed as f 0 sin ω t in which ω 2 π f 0 f 0 16 5 h z is the angular frequency and f 0 is the amplitude of the load however the amplitude f 0 of the load is also an undetermined parameter in fe analysis 4 model updating 4 1 basic process of updating in the fe analysis there are two undetermined parameters the masses of points and the amplitude of the load f 0 therefore how to determine the two parameters is the key for obtaining the correct result for the vibration response at each measured point the natural frequency is mainly affected by the mass whereas the vibration amplitude of the induced frequency is mainly affected by the amplitude of the load f 0 therefore the natural frequencies and the vibration amplitudes of the induced frequency at measured points are set as target values to update the two undetermined parameters the updating process is shown in fig 13 4 2 control points and the target function during the updating some representative measured points were selected as control points and their tested results were used as target values to judge the rationality of mass and load parameters firstly the mass and load parameters were set to an initial value and the displacement responses and natural frequency range were calculated secondly if the simulation results of displacement and natural frequency were consistent with the test data at the control points then a reasonable model with correct mass parameters was obtained if the simulation results were not matched with the ones of vibration test change the mass parameters and repeat the first step thirdly when if the model of offshore platform with the updated mass parameters were obtained keep the mass parameters unchanged alter the load parameter and carry out the simulation last if the displacement responses of the control points and amplitudes of the excited frequency match the measured results a reasonable updated model of offshore platform were finally achieved in the simulation the compressor was simplified as a uniform rigid and connected to the deck by a foundation which may affect the displacement response seriously of the points near the compressor as a result the measured points on compressor case1 and decks under the compressors case2 were not selected as controlled points six representative control points shown in table 5 were selected to verify the simulation results 4 3 initial value of the load at the beginning of updating the reasonable initial load should be given to reduce the looping of updating naturally the site measurement signal is a good chose for the initial load as a result the measured signals of sensors set on the running compressor case1 are considered fig 14 shows the fft result of the measured signal of sensor case1 1 the acceleration amplitudes of all measured points in case1 are shown in table 6 here the average value of acceleration amplitudes is 0 554 m s2 considering the mass of the compressor is about 100t the initial amplitude of vibration load f 0 is set to 55 4 kn and the initial estimate load f t is given by 55 4sin 33 π t 4 4 mass correction as mentioned above the masses of equipment on the decks have significant influence over the vibration response of the platform here the mass of equipment at low deck middle deck and upper deck are defined as m 1 m 2 m 3 by considering the equipment installed on the decks m 1 m 2 m 3 are all probably one of 50t 100t and 150t as a matter of fact mass updating was carried out under 16 conditions with different m 1 m 2 and m 3 in which the initial load all set to the same definition f t 55 4sin 33 π t the simulation results of the maximum amplitude of displacement at main frequency 16 5 hz and the natural frequencies are shown in tables 7 and 8 and the proportional errors of the simulation result to the measured maximum amplitude of displacement are shown in table 9 it can be found that the mass of equipment has little effect on the natural frequency but has a greater impact on the displacement distribution of the entire structural system of the offshore platform by investigating the proportional errors of the simulation result to the measured maximum amplitude of acceleration in table 9 the simulation results are closer to the measured data when m 1 150t m 2 50t m 3 150t and the calculated natural frequencies are also in the range of the test results the displacement error of the measuring points can be effectively reduced to 16 6 that means by updating the instrument mass distribution a more reliable offshore platform calculation model can be obtained considering the real condition on the platform in which the main working equipment locates on the lower deck the facilities for inhabitant mainly locate on the upper deck and there is nearly no heavy equipment on the middle deck the mass of equipment on 3 decks are set to m 1 150t m 2 50t m 3 150t in the following load modification 4 5 load modification as the simulated natural frequencies changed little under various mass options and the masses were determined by the comparison of the simulation results to the measured maximum displacement the load identification only concerns the amplitude of induced load f 0 the updating procedure of the load identification is as below 1 set the updating values of f 0 as 80 100 and 120 of the initial amplitude of load 55 4 kn simulate the response of the platform and fetch the data of acceleration at the control points and then calculate the maximum displacement at the induced frequency 16 5 hz 2 calculate the proportional error of the maximum displacement under 3 load conditions and identify the two loads of the conditions with less errors 3 interpolate three values linearly between two loads as the new 3 values of f 0 do the simulation and calculation again 4 repeat step 2 and 3 until the error of the maximum displacement are acceptable after two repetitions we found that the simulated value of f 0 52 3 kn is closer to the measured value fig 15 shows the error of each measuring point when f 0 55 4 kn and f 0 52 3 kn we can clearly see that after the load is modified the simulated displacement results are closer to the measured results and the average error is reduced by 5 5 approximately 5 model verification as mentioned above the reasonable masses of the equipment on 3 decks and the induced load were determined then we chose more measured points to verify the model considering the comprehensiveness of the verification at least one measured point in different case among case3 to case7 in total 10 measured points such as case3 1 case3 4 case4 1 case4 6 case5 1 case5 4 case6 1 case6 4 case7 1 and case7 4 are selected all fem results and measured data of displacement time curves are obtained and compared fig 16 shows the specific displacement time curve of simulation and measured signal of case3 1 we can see that though the displacement signal has strong randomness due to the noise of environmental effect the simulated results of specific case3 1 still have a high consistency with the measured results which further highlights the reliability of our finite element model and update method in order to reflect the error between simulated and measured results more effectively and directly the average amplitude of the displacement at all 10 measured points were extracted after running the fem simulation and compared with the measured data the comparison between simulated results and the measured results are shown in fig 17 as we can see except for the slightly larger deviation between the simulated results and the measured results at the verification point case7 4 the coincidence of other points is good the average proportional error of the average amplitude of displacement is 18 8 the simulation results of the natural frequencies at the verification points were presented in fig 18 the simulated natural frequencies were all among 2 0 3 5 hz so the model with the selected masses and proposed load function are reasonable however in general they seem to be slightly smaller than the measured results this may be due to the assumption that the unknown equipment on the same deck has the same mass for the sake of simplification resulting in the distribution of mass and stiffness being different from the actual structure the comparison of the vibration displacement amplitude at main frequency 16 5 hz obtained from fem simulation and site measurement was shown in fig 19 the simulated values of each verification point are in good agreement with the measured values the maximum proportional error reached 43 5 the minimum proportional error is 1 6 with the average value 13 4 as mentioned in chapter 2 1 the w12 1 is a long served offshore platform with numbers of heavy equipments and complicated components considering the complexity of the structure the simulation results and the proportional error shown in figs 17 19 are acceptable therefore the updating method for mass and load determination is feasible and the final fe model reflects the true situation to some extent based on the model more research can be carried out to investigate the mechanical response of the platform under some complex loading conditions 6 conclusion vibration response induced by working equipment on a long served offshore platform were studied comprehensively by site measurement and simulation vibration test were carried out on the decks and column of the platform an effective updating method were proposed to derive the reasonable masses of equipment and the excited loads of the compressor the following conclusions can be drawn 1 an analyzing method with site test data is explored and successfully used to determine the vibration source of a complicated structure in a complex environment for the offshore platform the fft s results of all measured displacement signals show that the vibration captured in site tests mainly include two parts one relates to the natural frequency band 2 0 3 5 hz another is at 16 5 hz which matches the working frequency of the gas compressor it is confirmed that the major vibration source is the compressor 2 a new updating method for fe model is proposed to derive the unknown structural parameters and the excited load for the long serviced offshore platforms by using the measured signals and data of vibration acceleration and displacement to revise the model constantly it can effectively avoid the wrong judgment of the structural parameters of the offshore platform a more reliable finite element model of such a complicated structure as an offshore platform is then obtained 3 with the new model the simulation s results of the average and maximum vibration displacement natural frequencies at the control points match the measurement results well which testifies the final fe model reflects the true situation and more research can be carried out to investigate the characteristic of the mechanical response of the long served offshore platform credit authorship
