1140,a systematic literature review was undertaken to understand the state and relationship between habitat types and biodiversity in the open coastal lake nokoué and to analyse the research gaps towards an efficient management of this ecosystem habitat types in lake nokoué have been profoundly impacted by the urbanisation around the lake kilometres of riparian habitat including mangrove vegetation were destroyed on the south and western shoreline of the lake removing the natural protection of the ecosystem to the increasing sewage nutrient load in addition to this anthropogenic pressure the solid wastes from the villages on stilts ganvié s villages increased the nutrient enrichment of the lake consequently the lake experience a seasonal bloom of water hyacinth which dies and sinks to its bottom each year when the salinity rises above 6ppt note that the salinity dynamics of the lake is governed by its hydrological regime which was highly affected by the widening of the sea entrance into the lake around 1960 in addition to these changes the intensification of the acadja fishing practice has led to the exportation of tonnes of dry woods into the lake the decay of these woods combined with the accumulation of hyacinth detritus has disturbed the habitats of macroinvertebrates and fish there is a progressive shift in the system from freshwater species to marine water species and from insectivorous fish to detritivorous fish management solutions required reduction of both detritus accumulation and external nutrient load keywords shallow coastal lakes nokoué habitats biodiversity interactions management 1 introduction the geomorphology of shallow coastal lakes generally located in intertidal zones make them naturally more productive ecosystems when compared to inland deeper lakes on a volume basis drake et al 2011 in fact many of these lakes have a trophic zone usually extend to the sediment surface experience a high degree of wind mixing and sediment resuspension and are exposed to natural variability in nutrient concentrations due to seasonal inflows from large tributary rivers and or seawater de jonge et al 2002 in addition shallow coastal lakes usually have an intense reserve of organic matter and a natural high habitat diversity that offer optimal niches for numerous aquatic species which utilise these areas as refuge and or breeding grounds drake et al 2011 villanueva et al 2006 consequently to this high productivity massive human development took place around coastal lakes worldwide with intensive use of the different services provided by these ecosystems as a result of these anthropogenic pressures most of the shallow coastal lakes water quality flora and fauna have been degraded mitchell et al 2015 the type of habitats encountered inside and around a lake is highly essential to understand the path of energy flow in the system schindler and scheuerell 2002 in addition habitat variability and connectivity determine the carrying capacity and influence both the community structure and the productivity in lakes cloern 2006 for open coastal lakes the amplitude and frequency of the saline water intrusion combined with the amplitude of freshwater input from tributaries when they exist influence habitat conditions through the variation in salinity concentration in the water column thus in these systems both freshwater fauna and sea fauna might occur simultaneously or alternatively and various phytoplankton and macrophytes might appear seasonally according to the tolerance to salinity it appears that habitats conditions and community structure in open coastal lakes are already naturally influenced by hydrological processes in addition the strong human interference with these systems could promote or demote particular species and affect the processes that sustain community biodiversity in the system the linkage between habitat types and the biodiversity they support represents the basis to understand what makes coastal lakes vulnerable to human activities and environmental change and therefore the starting point of an efficient management planning of these systems there is a growing interest in the adaptive management of coastal lakes since most of the management planning of these ecosystems have failed to produce useful models which could be largely applied schallenberg et al 2010 walters 1997 challenges in the management and ecological modelling of coastal lakes included difficulties in the representation of long term ecological response related to rapid hydrologic change lack of data on key processes which are usually difficult to study and confusion in the identification of factor in data validation this situation is even more worrying for tropical shallow coastal lakes where there is little historical management experience relatively no data collection and very little knowledge of key processes of these ecosystems for many lakes on the west africa coastline such as lake nokoué benin ebrié lagoon ivory coast it is urgent to adopt new policy option of management for habitat restoration biodiversity conservation and use of ecosystem services in order to provide long term measures for the sustainability of shallow coastal lakes villanueva et al 2006 this review explores all the published research on habitat and biodiversity of lake nokoué to understand the link between these two components in open coastal lakes towards efficient management of these ecosystems against the increasing anthropogenic stress it brought out the significant changes that have affected the habitats of the lake nokoué and reviewed the consequences of these changes on its biodiversity the review also highlights the orientation for further research to fill the current gaps of knowledge for efficient management of lake nokoué 1 1 description of lake nokoué lake nokoué fig 1 is a shallow eutrophic coastal lake located in the south of benin republic it covers around 150km2 at low water and measures 20km long east west and 11km wide north south le barbé et al 1993 mama et al 2011a prior 1960 the lake connection to the atlantic ocean the channel of cotonou was subjected to silting leading to its complete periodical isolation texier et al 1979 this isolation of the system occurred for several years until the runoff water from ouémé catchment was strong enough to pierce the sand barrier and therefore reconnect the lake to the ocean de kimpe 1967 the construction of the port of cotonou in 1960 cut off the sandy transit and caused a significant deepening of the channel of cotonou lake nokoué was therefore permanently exchanging water with the sea which consequently led to an abrupt and unprecedented rise of salinity a reduction in the duration of the freshwater phase and a decrease in the retention time to about 40 days leite et al 2004 zandagba et al 2016b lake nokoué has been reported to be the major contributor to inland water fish production in benin mainly because of acadja fishing practice this fishing method consists of attracting fish and crustaceans into an artificially planted brushwood in the open water of lakes and then surround the brushwood park with a net to easily catch the fish acadja is designed to mimic the natural habitat associated with the shores of lakes that many fish species used for reproduction refuge and food in dry season note that the brushwood is not removed after fish harvest and therefore their decay might highly influence the water quality of the lake another peculiarity of lake nokoué is the presence of human habitations built on stilts at the surface of the water in the north western part known as ganvié villages fig 3 these agglomerations host about 40 000 people and its nutrient load was estimated at 108tons year of total nitrogen and 18tons year of total phosphorous djihouessi and aina 2018 currently the hydrological regime of lake nokoué is characterised by three major hydrologic periods there is a high water period from september to november due to rains in the north of benin which supply water to the ouémé river and sô river texier et al 1979 gnohossou 2006 this contrasts with a low water period from december to mid may in which tidal inputs dominate as long as the channel of cotonou is open to the ocean le barbé et al 1993 in june august there is a slight rise in water level caused by the local heavy rains in southern benin which supply the sô and djonou rivers le barbé et al 1993 gnohossou 2006 lake nokoué also receives freshwater from the djonou river and exchanges freshwater with the porto novo lagoon through the channel of totchè the water exchange between the lake and the atlantic ocean has a great influence on its salinity regime fig 6 sea water intrusion at low water was slightly higher than freshwater input le barbé et al 1993 consequently the entire lake remains brackish during the low water period avg salinity 16ppt mama 2010 during high water periods the residence time of the lake was estimated to 30 days on average amplitude tide while during low water periods it was estimated to 40 days on average tide amplitude zandagba et al 2016b the influence of the tidal range on the water renewal time was estimated at 4 days during the high water period and 10 days during the low water period the annual total nutrient load from lake nokoué tributaries was estimated at 7020tons of total nitrogen and 1510tons of total phosphorous djihouessi and aina 2018 ebrié lagoon in ivory coast west africa has also been open to the sea since 1950 through the vridi canal bird 2011 leading to seasonal changes in its salinity regime and hydrodynamics as the ones observed in lake nokoué djihouessi and aina 2018 similarly the salinity of waituna lagoon in new zeeland raised up to 33 2ppt when the lagoon was opened to the sea and its water level considerably decreased schallenberg et al 2010 the closure of the sea entrance into the lagoon resulted in a decrease of its salinity down to 0 7ppt and a rapid rise in its water level therefore the mechanically opening and closure of coastal lakes and lagoons to the sea could have many applications in ecohydrology such as controlling the dynamics of saline water species in the system or preventing the flooding of surrounding urban and agricultural lands however it is important to remark that the water levels and the morphological characteristics of coastal lakes and lagoons dictate the degree of the influence of barrier openings and closures 1 2 papers selection approach a systematic approach was adopted in this paper to review and consolidate existing research on habitat types biodiversity and water quality of nokoué lake a peer reviewed literature search was conducted between april 2015 and february 2017 a rigorous and repeatable method has been developed to find peer reviewed papers about lake nokoué using academic databases and search engines including scopus and web of knowledge the method consisted of three stages i keyword generation ii search and iii selection of relevant papers keywords specific to the location habitat types biodiversity and water quality were chosen and these are presented in table 1 using these keywords the search was undertaken the selection of relevant papers was based on a fixed set of inclusion criteria i the paper must be related to lake nokoué ii the paper should address water quality or habitat types or biodiversity as primary or secondary subject iii at least one of the generated keywords should exist in the abstract of the paper many research studies on lake nokoué are related to phd theses msc theses conference proceedings and governmental research institute reports and dissertations which were not reviewed by a scientific journal the methodology set out above has been applied with google scholar to search this literature known as grey literature additional intelligent search approaches were utilised these included searching in the reference list of relevant publications and searching for papers that cited other relevant publications 2 habitat types the biota diversity its abundance production and spatial distribution in coastal lake ecosystems have shown high responses to hydrological variations furthermore the kinds and number of species encountered in these ecosystems are related to their habitat complexity covich 2009 different type of habitats has been reported in lake nokoué including riparian pelagic and benthic habitat 2 1 riparian habitats riparian habitats of lakes host an ecologically diverse type of components including marshes forest wetlands and mountains vegetation depending on the geomorphology of the system texier et al 1980 classified riparian habitat of lake nokoué in two groups the plants periodically flooded and the plants present in the non flooded zone but which are still affected by the lake hydrology both groups considerably deteriorated between 1970 and 2000 fig 2 from 1980 to 2000 the riparian habitat of the non flooded zone about 5 species has almost disappeared entirely while the species encountered in the periodically flooded zone have decreased from 16 species to 4 species gnohossou 2006 the dominant species of lake nokoué riparian habitat since 2000s was paspalum vaginatum present in both flooded and non flooded zone mama 2010 gnohossou 2006 it occurred mainly in the north of the lake and had promoted the establishment of cattle farms near the lake shore echinochloa pyramidalis which was abundant on the eastern shoreline was progressively replaced by increasing agriculture activities gnohossou 2006 cyperus papyrus on the west of the lake has completely disappeared and typha australis appeared instead it is still difficult to quantify the amplitude and the impacts of the destruction of riparian habitats in lake nokoué because of the lack of historical data and absence of reference area however the recent development of remote sensing techniques offers the potentiality of derived reference condition from historical satellite images of the 1970s where human activities were still far from the riparian area of the lake fig 2 a comparison with recent images could allow to quantify the amplitude of the destruction of the lake riparian habitats notable riparian flora found in other west african lagoons lagos lagoon ebrié lagoon and not found around lake nokoué includes acrotiscum aureum rhizophora racemosa drepoanocarpus lunatus avicennia nitida paspalum orbiculare and cyperus articulates emmanuel and onyema 2007 nicole 1994 all these species were also inundated at high tide and partially exposed at low tide and could be added to the set of riparian flora for reference conditions of lake nokoué several studies related the disappearance of riparian habitat around lake nokoué has been linked to a variety of ecological problems such as reduction of nursery habitat adite and winemiller 1997 reduction of macroinvertebrate gnohossou 2006 increase of the lake shoreline pollution by solid wastewater mama 2010 however it is not straightforward to establish the cause effect analysis of the removal of riparian habitat for instance the loss of mangrove vegetation mainly r racemose and avicennia germinans in the south west shoreline resulted in a decrease of juvenile fish in the lake which subsequently decreases commercial fish harvest and progressively led to the intensification of the use of acadja adite and winemiller 1997 villanueva et al 2006 niyonkuru and lalèyè 2010 this suggested that the removal of mangrove was the main cause of acadja development in the lake disregarding that it was the introduction of acadja fishing which accelerates the degradation of mangrove vegetation consequently the mangrove restoration programme implemented by decision makers in the lake failed because most of the plants were removed by the population for making acadja another consequence of the disappearance of riparian vegetation in lake nokoué was the proliferation of garbage dumps on the lake shores which increase nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment of the lake hounsinou et al 2015 currently this excess nutrient enrichment amplified water hyacinth eichhornia crassipes development which occurred mainly in the riparian zone where mangrove vegetation used to occur 2 2 pelagic habitats pelagic habitats in this review are used for the components of the open water that could be occupied and or provide a useful resource for lake nokoué biota development this including the water column itself floating aquatic macrophytes and one peculiar humanmade habitat that appears as a brush park and known as acadja fig 3 the water quality of lake nokoué is under the double influence of its tributaries water inputs and seawater intrusion during high water from september to november high nutrient concentration water from the ouémé and sô rivers invade the lake and keep out the saline water from the atlantic ocean as the inflows from the tributaries decreased tidal influence and salinity increased gradually and the lake water shift from freshwater with salinity nearly 0ppt to brackish with average salinity around 13ppt in late january fig 6 mama et al 2011a zandagba et al 2016a the same observation has been made for several open coastal lakes in west africa ebrié lagoon lagos lagoon and in new zealand waituna lagoon where salinity and transparency values were significantly higher in the low water period schallenberg et al 2010 mitchell et al 2017 nutrient no3 n nh4 n and po4 p concentrations in contrast were higher during the high water period and decrease progressively as salinity increase suggesting that the lake water was flushed out by tributaries water djihouessi and aina 2018 these rapid changes in salinity and nutrient concentrations of the water column will inevitably influence in short and long term the development of the lake biota the temperature of the water column varied between 25 c and 34 c and is significantly influenced by the air temperature mama et al 2011a zandagba et al 2016a while dissolved oxygen concentration fluctuate between 11ml g and 0 5mg l through the year mama et al 2011a and is significantly higher during high water periods floating aquatic macrophytes in lake nokoué are dominated by water hyacinth which appears each high water period when the salinity of lake nokoué decreases beyond 6ppt fig 6 and outcompetes other pelagic plants djihouessi and aina 2018 only some pistia stratiotes can be observed close to the entrance of the djonou river in the lake texier et al 1980 gnohossou 2006 after salinity increase above 6ppt water hyacinth plants die and sink to the bottom of the lake and become a potential source of internal nutrient loading from the sediment recent studies indicate that the presence of acadja influenced the spatial distribution of water hyacinth since it provides to water hyacinth an environment where wind and water currents cannot move them towards the riparian zone zandagba et al 2016a acadja in lake nokoué has rapidly increased in the last two decades in 1994 it was found only in the western part of the lake adite and winemiller 1997 while studies after 2010 reported that almost 60 of the lake has been in use by acadja mama et al 2011a zandagba et al 2016a acadja habitat appeared to present the ecology of both floating vegetation and flooded brush or forest it provides fish with periphyton including bacteria fungi diatoms and filamentous algae together with rotifers nematodes and crustacea welcomme et al 2005 in addition to providing supplementary food the acadja encountered in lake nokoué are constructed in such a way to provide an adequate area that serves as a breeding area for the tilapine cichlids the high fish production of lake nokoué compared to other coastal lakes in west africa may be explained by the presence of acadjas which increase the abundance of juveniles villanueva et al 2006 and subsequently improve the commercial fish harvest thus acadja practice has shown a positive impact on fishermen income but in reverse contributed to the reduction in the diversity of the fish population niyonkuru and lalèyè 2010 and increase water turbidity mama 2010 besides that acadja practice might impact the hydrodynamics and the nutrient circulation in the lake although no proof has been provided in the literature negusse and bowen 2010 estimated a contribution of 100kg day of total nitrogen and 25kg day of total phosphorus from acadja 2 3 benthic habitats there is no map of the benthic habitat of lake nokoué in the literature the simplest mapping attempts should associate the structure of the physical substrate and their chemical composition while more sophisticated mapping attempts should additionally include the fauna and flora occurring at the bottom surface of the substrate diaz et al 2004 the information on the benthic fauna of lake nokoué is presented in section 3 3 of this review regarding the benthic flora there was no available information neither on lake nokoué nor on the other west african coastal lakes and lagoon an hypothesis to explain this lack of information could be that most of the benthic flora in these ecosystems were destroyed before scientific interest started very few studies have investigated the bottom substrate composition and dynamic of lake nokoué texier et al 1980 presented a map of the sediment distribution in the lake and this remains the only studies which characterised the bottom substrate of the whole lake the west of the lake was mainly muddy and shallow with an average depth of 0 5m at low water period this could explain the high presence of acadja in these parts of the lake since the branches of acadja have to be fixed to the sediments the middle and the east of lake were sandy and more profound with an average depth of 1 5m at lower water period from northwest to southeast sandy muddy bands alternated with sandy bands adounvo 2001 recent studies carried out on the locations dominated by acadja gnohossou 2006 mama et al 2011b indicate that the bottom substrate has progressively changed from mud dominated to a composite of 50 of mud and 50 of detritus this change was explained by the yearly deposits of wood debris from acadjas since the brushwood are not removed after the fish harvest an analysis of the sediment composition indicated that the organic matter content ranged from 1 to 15 mama et al 2011b with the locations where both water hyacinth and acadja occurred having the higher organic matter content the mineralisation of this organic matter is suspected to increase p release that occurred in summer mama et al 2011b however there is no estimate of the contribution of sediment nutrient release to the internal nutrient load such study will allow for comparison between the contribution of the different nutrient source external and internal and the eutrophication process of the lake 2 4 habitat coupling in lake nokoué inter habitat omnivory habitat heterogeneity of lake nokoué is controlled by different and interconnected factors including saline water intrusion from the atlantic ocean sediment and freshwater inputs from tributaries ouémé sô and djonou rivers intensive use of acadja artificial fishing practice and anthropogenic disturbances from nearest cities cotonou abomey calavi and ganvié the village on stilts the concept of habitat coupling developed in this section allow to discuss how the presence of one particular habitat affected the condition in the other habitats and what are the effects single or combined of these habitats on the ecology of lake nokoué including its water quality and availability of nutrient and food for predators to its biota in lakes the dominant taxa in pelagic habitats are algae and fish schindler and scheuerell 2002 the presence of large water hyacinth mat in the pelagic zone compete with algae for nutrient and light villamagna and murphy 2010 consequently local dissolved oxygen concentration and water transparency might significantly decrease making therefore part of the water column difficult for the survival of some fish species such as piscivorous fish while perfect for other species such as prey fish it is therefore expected that in lake nokoué the phytoplankton community is highly affected by the seasonal appearance of water hyacinth competition for light and that the seasonal appearance of the weed might have reduced the acadja fish production oxygen depletion the observations made in lake naivasha kenya showed that in addition to reduced phytoplankton productivity water hyacinth significant change phytoplankton species composition and biodiversity mironga et al 2011 this suggests that more than affecting the carrying capacity of the pelagic habitats of lake nokoué water hyacinth infestation can alter the ecology of the lake further studies should be done to investigate the competition between water hyacinth and algae and the effects of this completion on the food web structure of lake nokoué one of the effects of pelagic habitats on benthic habitats in lake nokoué involves the deposition of dead water hyacinth and acadja material at the sediment surface in fact about 9000 tonnes dry weight of water hyacinth sink and join the sediments each year between january and march this might have imposed an atypical seasonal dynamic to taxa in benthic habitat and even might locally change the dominant taxa in benthic habitat section 3 3 in addition acadja fishing method has been blamed for accelerating siltation mama 2010 and to have locally changed benthic habitat structure in lake nokoué gnohossou 2006 however some authors welcomme et al 2005 defend the idea that the geographical position of acadja which are often located near the mouth of tributaries rivers allow branches deposits to be swept away to the outlet the atlantic ocean during high water period the real impact of acadja on benthic habitats remain to be investigated it is therefore important that future studies characterise the processes happening at the sediment water interface in the lake and how water hyacinth detritus and acadja deposits affect these processes the middle of the lake where no hyacinth and acadja occurred can serve as reference condition for such studies one of the well known roles of riparian habitat is to buffer the effect of catchment pollution on pelagic and benthic habitat hoffmann et al 2009 this function has been nearly lost in lake nokoué it is proved that municipal wastes from cotonou and abomey calavi have been polluting the lake and increasing eutrophication hounsinou et al 2015 few studies negusse and bowen 2010 mama et al 2011a djihouessi and aina 2018 have approximately quantified the wastes discharged by the municipalities in the lake however more accurate methods have to be used to be able to determine the effect of nearest cities on the pelagic and benthic habitats of lake nokoué 3 biodiversity of lake nokoué in this chapter the biodiversity of lake nokoué is reviewed and the links between this biodiversity and both the hydrology and the habitat in presence in the lake have been established the review mainly focuses on phytoplankton macroinvertebrate fish and bird diversity 3 1 phytoplankton and primary production 3 1 1 primary production very few studies have focused on the primary production and distribution of phytoplankton in lake nokoué the first assessment of the primary productivity of the lake was made by de kimpe 1967 and it was the first study conducted on lake s primary production in west africa the mean value of phytoplankton production in lake nokoué was estimated to 2220mgcm 2 day 1 which was significantly greater than the average primary production of tropical and sub tropical coastal lakes and lagoons estimated at 970mgcm 2 day 1 knoppers 1994 in 2001 the average primary production in the lake was estimated at 1680mgcm 2 day 1 adounvo 2001 indicating a decrease of 25 in the average primary productivity although the average dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations in the water have significantly increased since 1980 gnohossou 2006 the significant decrease in the lake transparency due to increase in sediment input from ouémé catchment djihouessi and aina 2018 could explain the decrease in the primary production in fact several studies showed that terrestrial runoff reduction the productivity in tropical and sub tropical coastal lakes knoppers 1994 liess et al 2015 the introduction of water hyacinth the early 1990s could have also affected the primary production in lake nokoué as observed in lake naivasha kenya and lake chivero zimbabwe mironga et al 2011 theuri 2013 in addition the impact of the changes in hydrological regime due to the intensification of the water exchanges between the lake and the atlantic ocean might have favoured the decrease of primary production in lake nokoué 3 1 2 taxonomic diversity of phytoplankton phytoplankton community of lake nokoué has a strong spatio temporal variation however it is important to note that no study has thoroughly monitored the annual distribution of this taxon in the lake the available studies cover the water recession period goussanou 2012 and part of the low water period adjahouinou et al 2012 for these periods four 4 main classes of algae have been identified the most represented class was diatomophyceae 26 species followed by chlorophyceae 20 species euglenophyceae 15 species and cyanophyceae 11 species goussanou 2012 adjahouinou et al 2012 in total 77 species of phytoplankton have been identified in lake nokoué between 2001 and 2012 which was close to the phytoplankton richness in lagos lagoon 82 species emmanuel and onyema 2007 and higher than the richness in ebrié lagoon seu anoï et al 2017 the list of the species recorded is presented in goussanou 2012 and adjahouinou et al 2012 there was a significant spatial and temporal difference in the species distribution goussanou 2012 the west of the lake near ganvié and the djonou river presents the highest taxonomic diversity of 36 species followed by the centre of the lake about 29 species the most numerous species were navicula bacillum synedra ulna oscillatoria granulate all found almost everywhere in the lake and euglena spirogyra mostly found in the west of the lake goussanou 2012 adjahouinou et al 2012 3 1 3 linkage between phytoplankton abundance and water quality diatomophyceae and euglenophyceae were respectively the most abundant classes followed by cyanophyceae and chlorophyceae goussanou 2012 adjahouinou et al 2012 diatomophyceae were observed mainly during high water period goussanou 2012 similar observation was made in ebrié and grand lahou lagoons ivory coast where the abundance in diatom during high water period was 3 times greater than the abundance during the other period of the year seu anoï et al 2017 etilé et al 2009 this could be related to the high din and drp in the water column mama et al 2011a etilé et al 2009 and to the n p molar ratio which is close to redfield ratio at many locations during high water period knoppers 1994 also the high abundance of diatomophyceae could also indicate a high silica concentration in the water column probably brought by the tributaries as a result of surface runoff from the upper mountainous ouémé catchment yet no study has measured the silica content in lake nokoué and its tributaries such study could be very relevant regarding the fact the lake water it entirely flushed out to the sea during water recession which might mean that amount all the silica in the water column would be lost to the atlantic ocean the high abundance of diatomophyceae might also indicate a high internal nutrient load due to probable decomposition of organic matter at the sediment water interface reddy and debusk 1991 gupta et al 1996 a high abundance of euglenophyceae in aquatic ecosystems is a characteristic of high organic pollution from wastewater discharge cavalier smith 2003 this could be related to the critical discharge of municipal wastewater in the lake adjahouinou et al 2014 hounsinou et al 2015 the presence of cyanophyceae was very seasonal goussanou 2012 their concentration increases progressively in low water period from december and they become the most abundant taxon in the lake in february their concentration decrease when the rains start and the water from the tributaries invade the lake goussanou 2012 this indicates that conditions in low water period were more favourable for the development of cyanobacteria among this conditions the low water flow during this period zandagba et al 2016b might be an important factor these observations also suggest that at this period the water column is deficient in nitrate and silica consolidate the hypothesis that all the silica which probably reach the lake in high water period are lost to the atlantic ocean 3 2 zooplankton no papers focused on zooplankton community in lake nokoué the information on the zooplankton community in lake nokoué was derived from the studies on fish diet composition several zooplankton groups have been identified by gnohossou 2002 including ostracods copepods cladocerans rotifers nauplii nematodes and protozoa notably tintinnidae the zooplankton of the lake was dominated by rotifera which represent 96 of the individuals nauplii and copepoda represent 2 and 1 respectively the proportion of other groups is very low in grand lahou lagoon a west african tropical coastal lagoon with similar physico chemical characteristics to lake nokoué and relatively less anthropogenic pressure the zooplankton communities were composed of 65 taxa including copepoda rotifera and cladocera with copepoda the most abundant group 81 etilé et al 2009 the highest zooplankton abundance in this ecosystem ranged between 171 and 175ind l and was recorded during the low water period while the lowest abundance ranged between 40 and 45ind l and occurred during the rainy season the comparison of the dynamic of zooplankton and phytoplankton in grand lahou lagoon consolidates the well known predator prey relationship between these two mccauley and kalff 1981 therefore it is expected that the zooplankton dynamics are correlated to phytoplankton dynamics in lake nokoué regarding biomass rotifera in lake nokoué constitutes nearly 60 of the total zooplankton community gnohossou 2002 some species have been identified by d almeida 1992 including the foraminifera jadammina polystoma ammonia beccarii the ostracod neomonoceratina sp and the copepod acartia clausi a planktonic mollusc creseis acicula a thaliaceae of the doliolidae family dolioletta spp and a chaetognathe sagitta inflata were also found 3 3 macroinvertebrates few research studies have been done on the macroinvertebrate distribution and dynamic in lake nokoué the first studies carried out by rabier et al 1979 and texier et al 1980 focused only on invertebrates in sediments the other types of substrates had not been investigated moreover the sampling methods used berthois cone or dumpster showed the weakness of not catching the highly mobile macroinvertebrates it was gnohossou 2006 who presented a detailed study on macroinvertebrates thus paving the way for more specific studies on the benthic community of the lake such as gnohossou et al 2009 2015 and odountan and abou 2015 2016 3 3 1 general classification and zoological groups based on the types of substrate two macroinvertebrate groups were distinguished in lake nokoué the bottom fauna and the epibenthic invertebrates for each of the two groups 4 subgroups of macroinvertebrates were identified the strictly freshwater species the strictly saltwater species the freshwater tolerant species and the salt tolerant species the bottom fauna invertebrates are favoured by the increasing sedimentation and the permanent deposit of the wood debris from acadjas while the epibenthic invertebrates are found in the pelagic zone on acadjas woods and within the roots of floating macrophytes such as water hyacinth and p stratiotes gnohossou 2006 in total 86 taxa orders families or genera of aquatic invertebrates were recorded between 2004 and 2014 gnohossou 2006 odountan and abou 2015 insects constituted the most represented group with more than 50 of all species molluscs and crustaceans contained about 40 of all species whereas annelids arachnids and nematodes account for less than 10 of the species gnohossou 2006 odountan and abou 2016 the lists of macroinvertebrate species encountered in lake nokoué are presented in gnohossou 2006 and odountan and abou 2015 as in ebrié and lagos lagoons insect richness has significantly decreased in lake nokoué compared to the years 1980 welcomme 1972 adite and winemiller 1997 the loss of the nearly all the riparian habitats may have probably contributed to the decrease of insect availability since aquatic insects are frequently associated with submerged and shoreline vegetation 3 3 2 spatio temporal distribution of macroinvertebrate the diversity of macroinvertebrates community in open coastal lakes increases when salinity decreases brucet et al 2012 similar observations were made in lake nokoué gnohossou 2006 a significant temporal difference was observed between high water low salinity and low water high salinity periods due to the arrival of new species mainly insects and the departure of other species terebellidae parguridae during high water period less than 35 of the identified taxa are observed over all the year gnohossou 2006 the species that remain most frequent over time are brackish water species that more or less tolerate overloading of organic matter and change in salinity the temporal difference in the macroinvertebrate dynamic is governed by to the variation of the hydrological regime of the lake gnohossou 2006 there was no significant spatial difference in the macroinvertebrates distribution in the lake crustaceans mollusks and annelids were found in the south at the junction of the lake with the sea in high water period while later in low water period they were found all along the south north axis gnohossou 2006 this suggests a migration of these species along the vertical profile of the lake as the salinity of the water increases and decreases in a particular way ganvié a village on stilts sheltered the less number of species despite the high contribution of continental species by the sô river gnohossou 2006 the low abundance of macroinvertebrate at ganvié could be related to the high anthropogenic pressure occurring at this site more than 2500 house built on stilts 3 3 3 abundance and biomass of macroinvertebrate the amphipods are the largest macroinvertebrate in lake nokoué gnohossou 2006 they were found everywhere in the lake with amphilochidae being the most abundant in the saline water phase and melitidae more the most abundant in the non saline water phase the molluscs had the highest biomass they are dominated by potamididae which are mainly found in the area with less organic pollution such as the centre and the east locations of the lake potamididae appeared to be very little consumed by fish gnohossou et al 2009 which could explain why they were the dominant taxon regarding biomass in general the biomass of the macroinvertebrate in the lake increased rapidly at low water periods although the species richness at this period was very low compared to high water period gnohossou 2006 this could be explained by the fact that biomass value raised at low water period by saltwater macroinvertebrates which were large in size and weight during high water periods these species retreat and give way to freshwater species that are more diversified but smaller in size and weight 3 4 ichthyofauna fish fauna has been extensively studied in lake nokoué 60 of papers collected various topics have been investigated including standard topics such as fish assemblage patterns spatio temporal distribution and length frequency distribution welcomme 1972 adite and winemiller 1997 lalèyè et al 2003 but also more specific topics such as particular eco morphological relationships population parameters dietary patterns anatomical features and fish parasites niyonkuru et al 2007 niyonkuru and lalèyè 2012 dougnon et al 2012 gnohossou et al 2013 this review focused on the information which helped to understand the interaction between fish species and the other ecological components of the lake 3 4 1 diversity and species richness the fish diversity of lake nokoué eroded about 42 from the 1960s to 2000s table 2 this situation has been explained by various causes including the increasing pressure of acadja practices niyonkuru and lalèyè 2010 the changes in the water exchanges with the sea since the 1960s and the degradation of nursery area and mangrove riparian habitat adite and winemiller 1997 the lowest value of species richness was observed by adite and winemiller 1997 however this could be explained by the period of this study which was short when compared to the other studies table 2 even though adite and winemiller 1997 covered a shorter period this study appeared to have 19 and 03 dissimilarities in fish species with respectively lalèyè et al 2003 and van thielen et al 1987 these observations suggested a rapid temporal variability in the species composition of the lake this could be explained by the alternation between freshwater brackish water and saline water the current species richness of lake nokoué based on the latest studies adite and winemiller 1997 gnohossou 2006 lalèyè et al 2003 could be estimated at 45 species from 23 families an analysis of the fish assemblage patterns based on the studies enumerated in table 2 showed a significant temporal and spatial variation of species richness with spatial variation stronger than temporal variation these spatial and temporal variations in assemblage structure have been associated primarily to the spatial temporal variation of the water quality especially salinity variation fig 6 three types of fish species have been distinguished estuarine species marine species and freshwater species welcomme 1972 van thielen et al 1987 adite and winemiller 1997 the latest classification proposed five major categories lalèyè et al 2003 category 1 species found in the lake throughout the year 8 species category 2 exclusively estuarine and lagoon species 5 species category 3 euryhaline freshwater species whose appearance determined by salinity tolerance 5 10 species they appeared in the lake in november and december category 4 occasional marine species 11 species most species from this category appeared between february and august in the north of the lake where the salinity remained high 20 category 5 species which are very rare or absent during the high water period between september and november but which appear when salinity is 10 14 species 3 4 2 fish abundance despite the relatively important fish fauna diversity of lake nokoué very few species contribute substantially to the catch considering the last three decades ethmalosa fimbriata was the most abundant species representing about 40 of annual catches followed by sarotherodon melanotheron and gerres melanopterus which comprised between 25 and 10 of annual catches adite and winemiller 1997 lalèyè et al 2003 almost 90 of the total fish production in lake nokoué came from less than 20 of the fauna niyonkuru et al 2007 the spatial distribution of fish abundance in lake nokoué was not uniform the west and the north of the lake were more productive than the other locations however this is probably related to the acadjas spatial distribution which is mostly located in the west and northwest niyonkuru and lalèyè 2010 e fimbriata was more likely to be found in the south of the lake while s melanotheron was likely to be found in the northwest near sô river g melanopterus mainly populated the north and northeast locations 3 4 3 habitat preference and biomass most fish in lake nokoué were captured in shallow areas and with a high preference for the acadja habitat adite and winemiller 1997 lalèyè et al 2003 since the years 1990s almost 85 the fishes captured have been from acadja niyonkuru and lalèyè 2010 it appeared that some species such as polydactilus quadrifilis had even shifted their habitat from the open water to acadja to avoid their natural predator adite and winemiller 1997 similar observations were made in ebrié lagoon where acadja was experimentally introduced in early 1990 to increase fish productivity guiral et al 1993 this high productivity of acadja has been linked to an important spatial concentration of the periphyton on the brushwood and to a productivity per biomass unit and a photosynthetic efficiency significantly higher for fixed communities than for pelagic communities guiral et al 1993 welcomme et al 2005 villanueva et al 2006 it has been reported by many studies that fish catches at around ganvié villages on stilts were very low and only a few species 8 species were found at that location adite and winemiller 1997 lalèyè et al 2003 this observation also included acadja habitat at this location niyonkuru and lalèyè 2010 the high turbidity and high organic matter concentration could explain the low fish species richness and abundance at ganvié furthermore it is important to note there was a constant motorised boat traffic around ganvié due to the villages on stilts which could make this environment too distributed for fish development lake nokoué is recognised to be the most productive coastal lake in west africa lalèyè 1995 welcomme et al 2005 villanueva et al 2006 fish catches in lake nokoué have been estimated at 102tkm 2 year 1 which is 10 times greater than catches in lake ebrié a coastal lake in ivory coast and far higher than the catches in lagos lagoons in nigeria villanueva et al 2006 abundance and occurrence of fish in lake nokoué seem to be highly influenced by i acadja distribution which increases food availability and possibilities to hide from predator by ii the water quality parameters mainly salinity but also water turbidity and concentration of organic matter in the water which governed the spatio temporal variation of the species and by iii intensive catching pressure which limit the recovery of the fish population 3 4 4 dietary analysis regarding food resource use by fish species in lake nokoué three major groups were detected i species that fed mostly on detritus with niche overlaps ranging from 0 92 to 1 00 chrysichthys nigrodigitatus e fimbriata liza falcipinnis s melanotheron synaptura lusitanica and tilapia guineensis ii piscivorous species with overlaps between 0 88 and 0 95 eleotris senegalensis hemichromis fasciatus and lutjanus goriensis and elops lacerta and iii species that fed on zooplankton and macroinvertebrates g melanopterus pomadasys jubelini and citharichthys stampflii with low overlap 0 4 adite and winemiller 1997 gnohossou 2006 diet analysis revealed that an important proportion of fish species 24 32 used a single resource adite and winemiller 1997 gnohossou 2006 most of these species were piscivores or invertebrate feeders and were mainly present in high water period with low abundance the most abundant species in the lake were species with large diet plasticity such as s melanotheron and c nigrodigitatus which passed from detritivores in high water to zooplantkivorous during low water periods in fact the high development of acadja fishing practices has considerably increased the availability of detritus in the lake and reduce the availability of invertebrate this situation might have also conducted to feeding adaptation of some species such as e fimbriata which has been characterised as zooplanktivorous feeder in early 1980s albaret and legendre 1985 but which was considerably feeding on decaying materials in the 2000s gnohossou 2006 3 5 piscivorous birds and fishery interaction in lake nokoué two main species of piscivorous birds occur on lake nokoué namely malachite kingfisher alcedo cristata and the pied kingfisher ceryle rudis libois and laudelout 2004 they were mostly found in the delta of the sô river just at the north of ganvié fig 1 the feeding ecology of the kingfisher covered 18 prey categories over the 45 fish species enumerated in the lake laudelout and libois 2003 the main prey were cichlids s melanotheron and h fasciatus followed by clupeids e fimbriata and eleotrids kribia sp although most of these species are demersal and should not be available for birds analysis of prey size indicated that they are taken by birds at an early age while they are still small probably just after the reproductive season this could explain they availability to piscivorous birds since most of the eggs of the prey fish species are usually attached to submerged macrophytes collette and parin 1990 which are highly found in the arms of sô river before its entrance to lake nokoué a comparison between fish taken by kingfisher and fish caught by fishery on lake nokoué suggested that the negative economic impact of the piscivorous birds was restricted to s melanotheron laudelout and libois 2003 since the other species consumed have no or low market value in addition the consumed s melanotheron were small individuals under the market size and therefore the economic loss for fishermen resides on the hypothesis that these small tilapias might grow to marketable size if piscivorous birds did not take them however this negative economic impact is probably counterbalanced by the high amount of h fasciatus a voracious predator of s melanotheron captured by the birds 4 trophic structure and interactions in lake nokoué research on the ecology of the aquatic communities of lake nokoué remains limited compared to the other coastal lakes of west africa such as lake ebrié ivory coast and lagos lagoon nigeria 4 1 temporal and seasonal evolution of the trophic groups before the widening of the sea entrance into the lake nokoué and the subsequent modification of its hydrodynamics there was almost no seasonal difference within the species richness of the trophic groups observations made in 2004 showed that the species richness had highly changed from the high to the low water indicating a strong seasonal difference in the structuration of the trophic groups in general the richness of detritivores and piscivores groups has increased between 1960 and 2004 for the disadvantage of benthivores and the group of zooplanktivores fig 4 gras 1961 gnohossou 2006 the zooplanktivores group which was the smallest group in 1960 was entirely absent in 2004 at the low water period fig 4 between the 1960s and 2000s the majority of the extinct fish species in the lake are zooplanktivorous and benthivorous species lalèyè et al 2003 this suggests a decrease in the zooplankton and benthic communities since 1960 another probable cause could be a perturbation of the benthic habitat by the deposits of acadja debris and dead water hyacinth which sink to the bottom of the lake mama et al 2011b at the low water period detritivores group dominates in fish biomass while at the high water period zooplanktivores group invaded the lake fig 4 in fact during the high water period freshwater fish migrate from tributaries into lake nokoué in addition the plastic diet of e fimbriata which can shift from detritivores to zooplanktivores increase zooplanktivores biomass at the same period the marine fish migrate back to the atlantic ocean they will come back to the lake when salinity increase at the low water period and most of the freshwater fish will migrate back to tributaries fig 4 this fish migration cycle has been promoted on one hand by the intensification of the water exchange between the lake and the atlantic ocean due to the widening of the sea entrance into the lake around 1960 and on the other hand by the intensification of acadja and water hyacinth detritus which seem to have promoted detritivorous fish development 4 2 system s maturity lake nokoué appeared to be a more mature and stable ecosystem compared to the other coastal lakes in west africa villanueva et al 2006 despite its lower primary production from pelagic phytoplankton and riparian vegetation the primary production is governed by the high photosynthetic yield of the fixed communities periphyton which grow on acadja woods and constitutes a surplus autotrophic production the increased availability of detritus due to high use of acadja seemed to have increased re mineralization of organic materials and mitigated resource limitations in this ecosystem acadja in lake nokoué seemed to have played a significant role in resource compensation and has influenced the energy flow in the system for instance some carnivorous species such as the c nigrodigitatus e fimbriata trachinotus ovatus and l falcipinnis periodically shift to detritus feeding when other resources are limited adite and winemiller 1997 competing with true detritivores of the system such as s melanotheron and t guineensis lake nokoué is a detritus driven ecosystem with only a small use of phytoplankton zooplankton and even s melanotheron by the higher trophic level villanueva et al 2006 4 3 simplified model of lake nokoué based on the different interactions described in the previous sections between the hydrology the water quality the habitat and the biodiversity of lake nokoué we have established a simplified model structure of the lake s ecology fig 5 the model indicates that the ecohydrology of lake nokoué includes five main components towards which management actions can be directed 1 the hydrological processes 2 the anthropogenic pressure 3 the water quality processes 4 the biological components and 5 the detritus the hydrological processes in lake nokoué directly influence it water quality through the regulation of the salinity regime and loads of riverine nutrients the anthropogenic pressure on the system is mainly the acadja fishing practices and the nutrient load from the surrounding cities and the villages on stilts these pressures affect the water quality and the accumulation of detritus in the ecosystem the biological components influence each other and react to water quality anthropogenic pressure and detritus detritus is the main driver of lake nokoué s ecosystem followed by salinity regime and acadja practice detritus based ecosystems are recognised to be more stable both regarding energy fluxes and consumer population dynamics with dissolved nutrients detritus support the pelagic food web of the coastal zone and estuaries bonthu et al 2016 however an excess of detritus can alter energy path and affect nutrient transfer efficiencies across trophic levels villanueva et al 2006 moore et al 2004 and therefore lead to a reduction of species richness as observed in lake nokoué fig 4 note that the direct factors which promote detritus accumulation in lake nokoué are the decay of acadja woods and the seasonal deposition of dead water hyacinth due to increase in salinity concentration above 6ppt therefore the reduction of detritus accumulation in lake nokoué should include the management actions towards reduction of acadja practice and removal of water hyacinth before they died this approach requires mapping and monitoring of both acadja and water hyacinth to understand their dynamic and the processes affecting them 5 perspectives for further research on lake nokoué ecology strategies for the conservation and restoration of coastal lakes and lagoons need to take two elements into account 1 elimination of threats and 2 amplification of opportunities to guarantee that they reach their goals wagner et al 2009 zalewski 2014 skłodowski et al 2014 it is also important that ecosystem conservation and restoration strategies are designed together with a strategy of economic growth since the goal of conservation shouldn t be to remove humans from the ecosystem but to ensure that they make sustainable use of the ecosystem zalewski 2014 stated that the strategy of economic growth around aquatic ecosystem should therefore be shifted from competition for resources to competition in their efficient use further research around lake nokoué needs to integrate these new paradigms for the design of sustainable conservation restoration and economic growth solutions it is clear that habitats and biodiversity in lake nokoué have been highly modified because of human activities however efforts to bring back the global biodiversity and bio productivity of this lake should not obstruct its services to the society further research should focus on strengthening the overall resilience of the landscape to the environmental and human induced stress environmental stability there is a need to assess the trade offs inherent in managing humans embedded in lake nokoué system this requires i a quantification and valuation of the important ecosystem services ii an analysis of the magnitudes of changes in these ecosystem services that result from anthropogenic actions and iii the economic impact of these changes filling this gap will allow harmonisation of societal needs with the enhanced ecosystem potential and constitute the first step in elaborating the trade offs for the management strategies of lake nokoué to preserve both biodiversity and human welfare unfortunately because of the lack of historical data and it is still difficult to quantify the amplitude and the impacts of the changes in the hydrological regime and the water quality of lake nokoué on its biota also this lack of historical data makes difficult the definition of reference conditions considering that the entire lake ecosystem is already highly modified in this review the information provided on the lagoons similar to lake nokoué constitutes an insight into the definition of it reference conditions considering the similarities observed in climate geomorphology and anthropogenic pressure of west african open coastal lakes one can think about defining unique reference conditions for these ecosystems however specific conservation and restoration targets for each ecosystem have to be set based on the services it provides to the society for instance it appears that reference conditions for the riparian habitat of west african coastal lakes and lagoons should be characterised by dominant mangrove vegetation mainly r racemose and avicennia germinans therefore restoration of riparian habitat on the west african coastline must logically include planting mangrove however for lake nokoué where mangrove have been destroyed to make acadja a crucial question would be whether planting mangrove is sustainable if not can mangrove restoration be achieved by the removal of pressures and it is even possible to remove the pressure targets for riparian habitat restoration in lake nokoué must consider acadja development and should there include a large awareness campaign for maintaining mangrove and alternative measures for the construction of acadja or even insertion of rules for the regulation of acadja development yet the impacts of the abrupt historical changes in the hydrological regime and the water quality of lake nokoué on its biota are not well known the evaluation of these impacts requires i the definition of reference conditions for the biota and ii the quantification of the biomass input output by fish and macroinvertebrate migration seaward landward through the channel of cotonou and from the lake tributaries current knowledge on the spatio temporal variations of these phytoplankton and zooplankton communities does not cover a full hydrological cycle therefore the analysis of the ecological threshold in lake nokoué namely the analysis of salinity and water level changes on the primary producers cannot be performed based on the current knowledge of the system more complete data collection on water quality and biota migration need to be done also research should be made on strategies for the reduction of the detritus accumulation in the system possible joint solutions for the reduction of detritus could be i removal of water hyacinth before they died meaning before salinity rise above 6ppt and ii removal of the woodbrush of acadja after fish harvest this will also contribute to reduction of potential internal nutrient loads in the system this implies that further research on the lake should investigate the components of the nutrient budget including the influence of seasonal water hyacinth death and acadja decays on the internal nutrient loads djihouessi and aina 2018 decision makers should also establish monitoring strategies for the reduction of riverine nutrient loads this implies first the identification of the anthropogenically highly modified parts of river basins and second the elaboration of dual regulation measures focusing on water and biota for these areas examples of regulation measures could be the promotion of drip irrigation to optimise the amount of fertiliser applied the construction of structures for erosion control in agricultural lands and the restoration of rivers riparian vegetation in addition to all these measure decision makers should promote the construction of wastewater treatment plants for the cities of abomey calavi cotonou and the villages on stilts the effective reduction of nutrient loads in the lake 6 conclusion the review of studies on the habitat and the biodiversity of lake nokoué showed the short and long term response of the biota to a constantly and highly impacted habitat from 1980 to 2000 the riparian vegetation of the lake has been destroyed due to the increased urbanisation around the lake one peculiarity of lake nokoué is the massive use of brush parks also known as acadja this habitat present in the pelagic zone enhances fish production with an increase of detritus in the lake acadja practices have shown a positive impact on fish catch but they also contribute to the reduction of diversity of fish fauna with the extinction of many zooplanktivorous and benthivorous species and the proliferation of detritivores further researches are still needed to understand the spatio temporal dynamic of the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in the lake conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was

1140,a systematic literature review was undertaken to understand the state and relationship between habitat types and biodiversity in the open coastal lake nokoué and to analyse the research gaps towards an efficient management of this ecosystem habitat types in lake nokoué have been profoundly impacted by the urbanisation around the lake kilometres of riparian habitat including mangrove vegetation were destroyed on the south and western shoreline of the lake removing the natural protection of the ecosystem to the increasing sewage nutrient load in addition to this anthropogenic pressure the solid wastes from the villages on stilts ganvié s villages increased the nutrient enrichment of the lake consequently the lake experience a seasonal bloom of water hyacinth which dies and sinks to its bottom each year when the salinity rises above 6ppt note that the salinity dynamics of the lake is governed by its hydrological regime which was highly affected by the widening of the sea entrance into the lake around 1960 in addition to these changes the intensification of the acadja fishing practice has led to the exportation of tonnes of dry woods into the lake the decay of these woods combined with the accumulation of hyacinth detritus has disturbed the habitats of macroinvertebrates and fish there is a progressive shift in the system from freshwater species to marine water species and from insectivorous fish to detritivorous fish management solutions required reduction of both detritus accumulation and external nutrient load keywords shallow coastal lakes nokoué habitats biodiversity interactions management 1 introduction the geomorphology of shallow coastal lakes generally located in intertidal zones make them naturally more productive ecosystems when compared to inland deeper lakes on a volume basis drake et al 2011 in fact many of these lakes have a trophic zone usually extend to the sediment surface experience a high degree of wind mixing and sediment resuspension and are exposed to natural variability in nutrient concentrations due to seasonal inflows from large tributary rivers and or seawater de jonge et al 2002 in addition shallow coastal lakes usually have an intense reserve of organic matter and a natural high habitat diversity that offer optimal niches for numerous aquatic species which utilise these areas as refuge and or breeding grounds drake et al 2011 villanueva et al 2006 consequently to this high productivity massive human development took place around coastal lakes worldwide with intensive use of the different services provided by these ecosystems as a result of these anthropogenic pressures most of the shallow coastal lakes water quality flora and fauna have been degraded mitchell et al 2015 the type of habitats encountered inside and around a lake is highly essential to understand the path of energy flow in the system schindler and scheuerell 2002 in addition habitat variability and connectivity determine the carrying capacity and influence both the community structure and the productivity in lakes cloern 2006 for open coastal lakes the amplitude and frequency of the saline water intrusion combined with the amplitude of freshwater input from tributaries when they exist influence habitat conditions through the variation in salinity concentration in the water column thus in these systems both freshwater fauna and sea fauna might occur simultaneously or alternatively and various phytoplankton and macrophytes might appear seasonally according to the tolerance to salinity it appears that habitats conditions and community structure in open coastal lakes are already naturally influenced by hydrological processes in addition the strong human interference with these systems could promote or demote particular species and affect the processes that sustain community biodiversity in the system the linkage between habitat types and the biodiversity they support represents the basis to understand what makes coastal lakes vulnerable to human activities and environmental change and therefore the starting point of an efficient management planning of these systems there is a growing interest in the adaptive management of coastal lakes since most of the management planning of these ecosystems have failed to produce useful models which could be largely applied schallenberg et al 2010 walters 1997 challenges in the management and ecological modelling of coastal lakes included difficulties in the representation of long term ecological response related to rapid hydrologic change lack of data on key processes which are usually difficult to study and confusion in the identification of factor in data validation this situation is even more worrying for tropical shallow coastal lakes where there is little historical management experience relatively no data collection and very little knowledge of key processes of these ecosystems for many lakes on the west africa coastline such as lake nokoué benin ebrié lagoon ivory coast it is urgent to adopt new policy option of management for habitat restoration biodiversity conservation and use of ecosystem services in order to provide long term measures for the sustainability of shallow coastal lakes villanueva et al 2006 this review explores all the published research on habitat and biodiversity of lake nokoué to understand the link between these two components in open coastal lakes towards efficient management of these ecosystems against the increasing anthropogenic stress it brought out the significant changes that have affected the habitats of the lake nokoué and reviewed the consequences of these changes on its biodiversity the review also highlights the orientation for further research to fill the current gaps of knowledge for efficient management of lake nokoué 1 1 description of lake nokoué lake nokoué fig 1 is a shallow eutrophic coastal lake located in the south of benin republic it covers around 150km2 at low water and measures 20km long east west and 11km wide north south le barbé et al 1993 mama et al 2011a prior 1960 the lake connection to the atlantic ocean the channel of cotonou was subjected to silting leading to its complete periodical isolation texier et al 1979 this isolation of the system occurred for several years until the runoff water from ouémé catchment was strong enough to pierce the sand barrier and therefore reconnect the lake to the ocean de kimpe 1967 the construction of the port of cotonou in 1960 cut off the sandy transit and caused a significant deepening of the channel of cotonou lake nokoué was therefore permanently exchanging water with the sea which consequently led to an abrupt and unprecedented rise of salinity a reduction in the duration of the freshwater phase and a decrease in the retention time to about 40 days leite et al 2004 zandagba et al 2016b lake nokoué has been reported to be the major contributor to inland water fish production in benin mainly because of acadja fishing practice this fishing method consists of attracting fish and crustaceans into an artificially planted brushwood in the open water of lakes and then surround the brushwood park with a net to easily catch the fish acadja is designed to mimic the natural habitat associated with the shores of lakes that many fish species used for reproduction refuge and food in dry season note that the brushwood is not removed after fish harvest and therefore their decay might highly influence the water quality of the lake another peculiarity of lake nokoué is the presence of human habitations built on stilts at the surface of the water in the north western part known as ganvié villages fig 3 these agglomerations host about 40 000 people and its nutrient load was estimated at 108tons year of total nitrogen and 18tons year of total phosphorous djihouessi and aina 2018 currently the hydrological regime of lake nokoué is characterised by three major hydrologic periods there is a high water period from september to november due to rains in the north of benin which supply water to the ouémé river and sô river texier et al 1979 gnohossou 2006 this contrasts with a low water period from december to mid may in which tidal inputs dominate as long as the channel of cotonou is open to the ocean le barbé et al 1993 in june august there is a slight rise in water level caused by the local heavy rains in southern benin which supply the sô and djonou rivers le barbé et al 1993 gnohossou 2006 lake nokoué also receives freshwater from the djonou river and exchanges freshwater with the porto novo lagoon through the channel of totchè the water exchange between the lake and the atlantic ocean has a great influence on its salinity regime fig 6 sea water intrusion at low water was slightly higher than freshwater input le barbé et al 1993 consequently the entire lake remains brackish during the low water period avg salinity 16ppt mama 2010 during high water periods the residence time of the lake was estimated to 30 days on average amplitude tide while during low water periods it was estimated to 40 days on average tide amplitude zandagba et al 2016b the influence of the tidal range on the water renewal time was estimated at 4 days during the high water period and 10 days during the low water period the annual total nutrient load from lake nokoué tributaries was estimated at 7020tons of total nitrogen and 1510tons of total phosphorous djihouessi and aina 2018 ebrié lagoon in ivory coast west africa has also been open to the sea since 1950 through the vridi canal bird 2011 leading to seasonal changes in its salinity regime and hydrodynamics as the ones observed in lake nokoué djihouessi and aina 2018 similarly the salinity of waituna lagoon in new zeeland raised up to 33 2ppt when the lagoon was opened to the sea and its water level considerably decreased schallenberg et al 2010 the closure of the sea entrance into the lagoon resulted in a decrease of its salinity down to 0 7ppt and a rapid rise in its water level therefore the mechanically opening and closure of coastal lakes and lagoons to the sea could have many applications in ecohydrology such as controlling the dynamics of saline water species in the system or preventing the flooding of surrounding urban and agricultural lands however it is important to remark that the water levels and the morphological characteristics of coastal lakes and lagoons dictate the degree of the influence of barrier openings and closures 1 2 papers selection approach a systematic approach was adopted in this paper to review and consolidate existing research on habitat types biodiversity and water quality of nokoué lake a peer reviewed literature search was conducted between april 2015 and february 2017 a rigorous and repeatable method has been developed to find peer reviewed papers about lake nokoué using academic databases and search engines including scopus and web of knowledge the method consisted of three stages i keyword generation ii search and iii selection of relevant papers keywords specific to the location habitat types biodiversity and water quality were chosen and these are presented in table 1 using these keywords the search was undertaken the selection of relevant papers was based on a fixed set of inclusion criteria i the paper must be related to lake nokoué ii the paper should address water quality or habitat types or biodiversity as primary or secondary subject iii at least one of the generated keywords should exist in the abstract of the paper many research studies on lake nokoué are related to phd theses msc theses conference proceedings and governmental research institute reports and dissertations which were not reviewed by a scientific journal the methodology set out above has been applied with google scholar to search this literature known as grey literature additional intelligent search approaches were utilised these included searching in the reference list of relevant publications and searching for papers that cited other relevant publications 2 habitat types the biota diversity its abundance production and spatial distribution in coastal lake ecosystems have shown high responses to hydrological variations furthermore the kinds and number of species encountered in these ecosystems are related to their habitat complexity covich 2009 different type of habitats has been reported in lake nokoué including riparian pelagic and benthic habitat 2 1 riparian habitats riparian habitats of lakes host an ecologically diverse type of components including marshes forest wetlands and mountains vegetation depending on the geomorphology of the system texier et al 1980 classified riparian habitat of lake nokoué in two groups the plants periodically flooded and the plants present in the non flooded zone but which are still affected by the lake hydrology both groups considerably deteriorated between 1970 and 2000 fig 2 from 1980 to 2000 the riparian habitat of the non flooded zone about 5 species has almost disappeared entirely while the species encountered in the periodically flooded zone have decreased from 16 species to 4 species gnohossou 2006 the dominant species of lake nokoué riparian habitat since 2000s was paspalum vaginatum present in both flooded and non flooded zone mama 2010 gnohossou 2006 it occurred mainly in the north of the lake and had promoted the establishment of cattle farms near the lake shore echinochloa pyramidalis which was abundant on the eastern shoreline was progressively replaced by increasing agriculture activities gnohossou 2006 cyperus papyrus on the west of the lake has completely disappeared and typha australis appeared instead it is still difficult to quantify the amplitude and the impacts of the destruction of riparian habitats in lake nokoué because of the lack of historical data and absence of reference area however the recent development of remote sensing techniques offers the potentiality of derived reference condition from historical satellite images of the 1970s where human activities were still far from the riparian area of the lake fig 2 a comparison with recent images could allow to quantify the amplitude of the destruction of the lake riparian habitats notable riparian flora found in other west african lagoons lagos lagoon ebrié lagoon and not found around lake nokoué includes acrotiscum aureum rhizophora racemosa drepoanocarpus lunatus avicennia nitida paspalum orbiculare and cyperus articulates emmanuel and onyema 2007 nicole 1994 all these species were also inundated at high tide and partially exposed at low tide and could be added to the set of riparian flora for reference conditions of lake nokoué several studies related the disappearance of riparian habitat around lake nokoué has been linked to a variety of ecological problems such as reduction of nursery habitat adite and winemiller 1997 reduction of macroinvertebrate gnohossou 2006 increase of the lake shoreline pollution by solid wastewater mama 2010 however it is not straightforward to establish the cause effect analysis of the removal of riparian habitat for instance the loss of mangrove vegetation mainly r racemose and avicennia germinans in the south west shoreline resulted in a decrease of juvenile fish in the lake which subsequently decreases commercial fish harvest and progressively led to the intensification of the use of acadja adite and winemiller 1997 villanueva et al 2006 niyonkuru and lalèyè 2010 this suggested that the removal of mangrove was the main cause of acadja development in the lake disregarding that it was the introduction of acadja fishing which accelerates the degradation of mangrove vegetation consequently the mangrove restoration programme implemented by decision makers in the lake failed because most of the plants were removed by the population for making acadja another consequence of the disappearance of riparian vegetation in lake nokoué was the proliferation of garbage dumps on the lake shores which increase nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment of the lake hounsinou et al 2015 currently this excess nutrient enrichment amplified water hyacinth eichhornia crassipes development which occurred mainly in the riparian zone where mangrove vegetation used to occur 2 2 pelagic habitats pelagic habitats in this review are used for the components of the open water that could be occupied and or provide a useful resource for lake nokoué biota development this including the water column itself floating aquatic macrophytes and one peculiar humanmade habitat that appears as a brush park and known as acadja fig 3 the water quality of lake nokoué is under the double influence of its tributaries water inputs and seawater intrusion during high water from september to november high nutrient concentration water from the ouémé and sô rivers invade the lake and keep out the saline water from the atlantic ocean as the inflows from the tributaries decreased tidal influence and salinity increased gradually and the lake water shift from freshwater with salinity nearly 0ppt to brackish with average salinity around 13ppt in late january fig 6 mama et al 2011a zandagba et al 2016a the same observation has been made for several open coastal lakes in west africa ebrié lagoon lagos lagoon and in new zealand waituna lagoon where salinity and transparency values were significantly higher in the low water period schallenberg et al 2010 mitchell et al 2017 nutrient no3 n nh4 n and po4 p concentrations in contrast were higher during the high water period and decrease progressively as salinity increase suggesting that the lake water was flushed out by tributaries water djihouessi and aina 2018 these rapid changes in salinity and nutrient concentrations of the water column will inevitably influence in short and long term the development of the lake biota the temperature of the water column varied between 25 c and 34 c and is significantly influenced by the air temperature mama et al 2011a zandagba et al 2016a while dissolved oxygen concentration fluctuate between 11ml g and 0 5mg l through the year mama et al 2011a and is significantly higher during high water periods floating aquatic macrophytes in lake nokoué are dominated by water hyacinth which appears each high water period when the salinity of lake nokoué decreases beyond 6ppt fig 6 and outcompetes other pelagic plants djihouessi and aina 2018 only some pistia stratiotes can be observed close to the entrance of the djonou river in the lake texier et al 1980 gnohossou 2006 after salinity increase above 6ppt water hyacinth plants die and sink to the bottom of the lake and become a potential source of internal nutrient loading from the sediment recent studies indicate that the presence of acadja influenced the spatial distribution of water hyacinth since it provides to water hyacinth an environment where wind and water currents cannot move them towards the riparian zone zandagba et al 2016a acadja in lake nokoué has rapidly increased in the last two decades in 1994 it was found only in the western part of the lake adite and winemiller 1997 while studies after 2010 reported that almost 60 of the lake has been in use by acadja mama et al 2011a zandagba et al 2016a acadja habitat appeared to present the ecology of both floating vegetation and flooded brush or forest it provides fish with periphyton including bacteria fungi diatoms and filamentous algae together with rotifers nematodes and crustacea welcomme et al 2005 in addition to providing supplementary food the acadja encountered in lake nokoué are constructed in such a way to provide an adequate area that serves as a breeding area for the tilapine cichlids the high fish production of lake nokoué compared to other coastal lakes in west africa may be explained by the presence of acadjas which increase the abundance of juveniles villanueva et al 2006 and subsequently improve the commercial fish harvest thus acadja practice has shown a positive impact on fishermen income but in reverse contributed to the reduction in the diversity of the fish population niyonkuru and lalèyè 2010 and increase water turbidity mama 2010 besides that acadja practice might impact the hydrodynamics and the nutrient circulation in the lake although no proof has been provided in the literature negusse and bowen 2010 estimated a contribution of 100kg day of total nitrogen and 25kg day of total phosphorus from acadja 2 3 benthic habitats there is no map of the benthic habitat of lake nokoué in the literature the simplest mapping attempts should associate the structure of the physical substrate and their chemical composition while more sophisticated mapping attempts should additionally include the fauna and flora occurring at the bottom surface of the substrate diaz et al 2004 the information on the benthic fauna of lake nokoué is presented in section 3 3 of this review regarding the benthic flora there was no available information neither on lake nokoué nor on the other west african coastal lakes and lagoon an hypothesis to explain this lack of information could be that most of the benthic flora in these ecosystems were destroyed before scientific interest started very few studies have investigated the bottom substrate composition and dynamic of lake nokoué texier et al 1980 presented a map of the sediment distribution in the lake and this remains the only studies which characterised the bottom substrate of the whole lake the west of the lake was mainly muddy and shallow with an average depth of 0 5m at low water period this could explain the high presence of acadja in these parts of the lake since the branches of acadja have to be fixed to the sediments the middle and the east of lake were sandy and more profound with an average depth of 1 5m at lower water period from northwest to southeast sandy muddy bands alternated with sandy bands adounvo 2001 recent studies carried out on the locations dominated by acadja gnohossou 2006 mama et al 2011b indicate that the bottom substrate has progressively changed from mud dominated to a composite of 50 of mud and 50 of detritus this change was explained by the yearly deposits of wood debris from acadjas since the brushwood are not removed after the fish harvest an analysis of the sediment composition indicated that the organic matter content ranged from 1 to 15 mama et al 2011b with the locations where both water hyacinth and acadja occurred having the higher organic matter content the mineralisation of this organic matter is suspected to increase p release that occurred in summer mama et al 2011b however there is no estimate of the contribution of sediment nutrient release to the internal nutrient load such study will allow for comparison between the contribution of the different nutrient source external and internal and the eutrophication process of the lake 2 4 habitat coupling in lake nokoué inter habitat omnivory habitat heterogeneity of lake nokoué is controlled by different and interconnected factors including saline water intrusion from the atlantic ocean sediment and freshwater inputs from tributaries ouémé sô and djonou rivers intensive use of acadja artificial fishing practice and anthropogenic disturbances from nearest cities cotonou abomey calavi and ganvié the village on stilts the concept of habitat coupling developed in this section allow to discuss how the presence of one particular habitat affected the condition in the other habitats and what are the effects single or combined of these habitats on the ecology of lake nokoué including its water quality and availability of nutrient and food for predators to its biota in lakes the dominant taxa in pelagic habitats are algae and fish schindler and scheuerell 2002 the presence of large water hyacinth mat in the pelagic zone compete with algae for nutrient and light villamagna and murphy 2010 consequently local dissolved oxygen concentration and water transparency might significantly decrease making therefore part of the water column difficult for the survival of some fish species such as piscivorous fish while perfect for other species such as prey fish it is therefore expected that in lake nokoué the phytoplankton community is highly affected by the seasonal appearance of water hyacinth competition for light and that the seasonal appearance of the weed might have reduced the acadja fish production oxygen depletion the observations made in lake naivasha kenya showed that in addition to reduced phytoplankton productivity water hyacinth significant change phytoplankton species composition and biodiversity mironga et al 2011 this suggests that more than affecting the carrying capacity of the pelagic habitats of lake nokoué water hyacinth infestation can alter the ecology of the lake further studies should be done to investigate the competition between water hyacinth and algae and the effects of this completion on the food web structure of lake nokoué one of the effects of pelagic habitats on benthic habitats in lake nokoué involves the deposition of dead water hyacinth and acadja material at the sediment surface in fact about 9000 tonnes dry weight of water hyacinth sink and join the sediments each year between january and march this might have imposed an atypical seasonal dynamic to taxa in benthic habitat and even might locally change the dominant taxa in benthic habitat section 3 3 in addition acadja fishing method has been blamed for accelerating siltation mama 2010 and to have locally changed benthic habitat structure in lake nokoué gnohossou 2006 however some authors welcomme et al 2005 defend the idea that the geographical position of acadja which are often located near the mouth of tributaries rivers allow branches deposits to be swept away to the outlet the atlantic ocean during high water period the real impact of acadja on benthic habitats remain to be investigated it is therefore important that future studies characterise the processes happening at the sediment water interface in the lake and how water hyacinth detritus and acadja deposits affect these processes the middle of the lake where no hyacinth and acadja occurred can serve as reference condition for such studies one of the well known roles of riparian habitat is to buffer the effect of catchment pollution on pelagic and benthic habitat hoffmann et al 2009 this function has been nearly lost in lake nokoué it is proved that municipal wastes from cotonou and abomey calavi have been polluting the lake and increasing eutrophication hounsinou et al 2015 few studies negusse and bowen 2010 mama et al 2011a djihouessi and aina 2018 have approximately quantified the wastes discharged by the municipalities in the lake however more accurate methods have to be used to be able to determine the effect of nearest cities on the pelagic and benthic habitats of lake nokoué 3 biodiversity of lake nokoué in this chapter the biodiversity of lake nokoué is reviewed and the links between this biodiversity and both the hydrology and the habitat in presence in the lake have been established the review mainly focuses on phytoplankton macroinvertebrate fish and bird diversity 3 1 phytoplankton and primary production 3 1 1 primary production very few studies have focused on the primary production and distribution of phytoplankton in lake nokoué the first assessment of the primary productivity of the lake was made by de kimpe 1967 and it was the first study conducted on lake s primary production in west africa the mean value of phytoplankton production in lake nokoué was estimated to 2220mgcm 2 day 1 which was significantly greater than the average primary production of tropical and sub tropical coastal lakes and lagoons estimated at 970mgcm 2 day 1 knoppers 1994 in 2001 the average primary production in the lake was estimated at 1680mgcm 2 day 1 adounvo 2001 indicating a decrease of 25 in the average primary productivity although the average dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations in the water have significantly increased since 1980 gnohossou 2006 the significant decrease in the lake transparency due to increase in sediment input from ouémé catchment djihouessi and aina 2018 could explain the decrease in the primary production in fact several studies showed that terrestrial runoff reduction the productivity in tropical and sub tropical coastal lakes knoppers 1994 liess et al 2015 the introduction of water hyacinth the early 1990s could have also affected the primary production in lake nokoué as observed in lake naivasha kenya and lake chivero zimbabwe mironga et al 2011 theuri 2013 in addition the impact of the changes in hydrological regime due to the intensification of the water exchanges between the lake and the atlantic ocean might have favoured the decrease of primary production in lake nokoué 3 1 2 taxonomic diversity of phytoplankton phytoplankton community of lake nokoué has a strong spatio temporal variation however it is important to note that no study has thoroughly monitored the annual distribution of this taxon in the lake the available studies cover the water recession period goussanou 2012 and part of the low water period adjahouinou et al 2012 for these periods four 4 main classes of algae have been identified the most represented class was diatomophyceae 26 species followed by chlorophyceae 20 species euglenophyceae 15 species and cyanophyceae 11 species goussanou 2012 adjahouinou et al 2012 in total 77 species of phytoplankton have been identified in lake nokoué between 2001 and 2012 which was close to the phytoplankton richness in lagos lagoon 82 species emmanuel and onyema 2007 and higher than the richness in ebrié lagoon seu anoï et al 2017 the list of the species recorded is presented in goussanou 2012 and adjahouinou et al 2012 there was a significant spatial and temporal difference in the species distribution goussanou 2012 the west of the lake near ganvié and the djonou river presents the highest taxonomic diversity of 36 species followed by the centre of the lake about 29 species the most numerous species were navicula bacillum synedra ulna oscillatoria granulate all found almost everywhere in the lake and euglena spirogyra mostly found in the west of the lake goussanou 2012 adjahouinou et al 2012 3 1 3 linkage between phytoplankton abundance and water quality diatomophyceae and euglenophyceae were respectively the most abundant classes followed by cyanophyceae and chlorophyceae goussanou 2012 adjahouinou et al 2012 diatomophyceae were observed mainly during high water period goussanou 2012 similar observation was made in ebrié and grand lahou lagoons ivory coast where the abundance in diatom during high water period was 3 times greater than the abundance during the other period of the year seu anoï et al 2017 etilé et al 2009 this could be related to the high din and drp in the water column mama et al 2011a etilé et al 2009 and to the n p molar ratio which is close to redfield ratio at many locations during high water period knoppers 1994 also the high abundance of diatomophyceae could also indicate a high silica concentration in the water column probably brought by the tributaries as a result of surface runoff from the upper mountainous ouémé catchment yet no study has measured the silica content in lake nokoué and its tributaries such study could be very relevant regarding the fact the lake water it entirely flushed out to the sea during water recession which might mean that amount all the silica in the water column would be lost to the atlantic ocean the high abundance of diatomophyceae might also indicate a high internal nutrient load due to probable decomposition of organic matter at the sediment water interface reddy and debusk 1991 gupta et al 1996 a high abundance of euglenophyceae in aquatic ecosystems is a characteristic of high organic pollution from wastewater discharge cavalier smith 2003 this could be related to the critical discharge of municipal wastewater in the lake adjahouinou et al 2014 hounsinou et al 2015 the presence of cyanophyceae was very seasonal goussanou 2012 their concentration increases progressively in low water period from december and they become the most abundant taxon in the lake in february their concentration decrease when the rains start and the water from the tributaries invade the lake goussanou 2012 this indicates that conditions in low water period were more favourable for the development of cyanobacteria among this conditions the low water flow during this period zandagba et al 2016b might be an important factor these observations also suggest that at this period the water column is deficient in nitrate and silica consolidate the hypothesis that all the silica which probably reach the lake in high water period are lost to the atlantic ocean 3 2 zooplankton no papers focused on zooplankton community in lake nokoué the information on the zooplankton community in lake nokoué was derived from the studies on fish diet composition several zooplankton groups have been identified by gnohossou 2002 including ostracods copepods cladocerans rotifers nauplii nematodes and protozoa notably tintinnidae the zooplankton of the lake was dominated by rotifera which represent 96 of the individuals nauplii and copepoda represent 2 and 1 respectively the proportion of other groups is very low in grand lahou lagoon a west african tropical coastal lagoon with similar physico chemical characteristics to lake nokoué and relatively less anthropogenic pressure the zooplankton communities were composed of 65 taxa including copepoda rotifera and cladocera with copepoda the most abundant group 81 etilé et al 2009 the highest zooplankton abundance in this ecosystem ranged between 171 and 175ind l and was recorded during the low water period while the lowest abundance ranged between 40 and 45ind l and occurred during the rainy season the comparison of the dynamic of zooplankton and phytoplankton in grand lahou lagoon consolidates the well known predator prey relationship between these two mccauley and kalff 1981 therefore it is expected that the zooplankton dynamics are correlated to phytoplankton dynamics in lake nokoué regarding biomass rotifera in lake nokoué constitutes nearly 60 of the total zooplankton community gnohossou 2002 some species have been identified by d almeida 1992 including the foraminifera jadammina polystoma ammonia beccarii the ostracod neomonoceratina sp and the copepod acartia clausi a planktonic mollusc creseis acicula a thaliaceae of the doliolidae family dolioletta spp and a chaetognathe sagitta inflata were also found 3 3 macroinvertebrates few research studies have been done on the macroinvertebrate distribution and dynamic in lake nokoué the first studies carried out by rabier et al 1979 and texier et al 1980 focused only on invertebrates in sediments the other types of substrates had not been investigated moreover the sampling methods used berthois cone or dumpster showed the weakness of not catching the highly mobile macroinvertebrates it was gnohossou 2006 who presented a detailed study on macroinvertebrates thus paving the way for more specific studies on the benthic community of the lake such as gnohossou et al 2009 2015 and odountan and abou 2015 2016 3 3 1 general classification and zoological groups based on the types of substrate two macroinvertebrate groups were distinguished in lake nokoué the bottom fauna and the epibenthic invertebrates for each of the two groups 4 subgroups of macroinvertebrates were identified the strictly freshwater species the strictly saltwater species the freshwater tolerant species and the salt tolerant species the bottom fauna invertebrates are favoured by the increasing sedimentation and the permanent deposit of the wood debris from acadjas while the epibenthic invertebrates are found in the pelagic zone on acadjas woods and within the roots of floating macrophytes such as water hyacinth and p stratiotes gnohossou 2006 in total 86 taxa orders families or genera of aquatic invertebrates were recorded between 2004 and 2014 gnohossou 2006 odountan and abou 2015 insects constituted the most represented group with more than 50 of all species molluscs and crustaceans contained about 40 of all species whereas annelids arachnids and nematodes account for less than 10 of the species gnohossou 2006 odountan and abou 2016 the lists of macroinvertebrate species encountered in lake nokoué are presented in gnohossou 2006 and odountan and abou 2015 as in ebrié and lagos lagoons insect richness has significantly decreased in lake nokoué compared to the years 1980 welcomme 1972 adite and winemiller 1997 the loss of the nearly all the riparian habitats may have probably contributed to the decrease of insect availability since aquatic insects are frequently associated with submerged and shoreline vegetation 3 3 2 spatio temporal distribution of macroinvertebrate the diversity of macroinvertebrates community in open coastal lakes increases when salinity decreases brucet et al 2012 similar observations were made in lake nokoué gnohossou 2006 a significant temporal difference was observed between high water low salinity and low water high salinity periods due to the arrival of new species mainly insects and the departure of other species terebellidae parguridae during high water period less than 35 of the identified taxa are observed over all the year gnohossou 2006 the species that remain most frequent over time are brackish water species that more or less tolerate overloading of organic matter and change in salinity the temporal difference in the macroinvertebrate dynamic is governed by to the variation of the hydrological regime of the lake gnohossou 2006 there was no significant spatial difference in the macroinvertebrates distribution in the lake crustaceans mollusks and annelids were found in the south at the junction of the lake with the sea in high water period while later in low water period they were found all along the south north axis gnohossou 2006 this suggests a migration of these species along the vertical profile of the lake as the salinity of the water increases and decreases in a particular way ganvié a village on stilts sheltered the less number of species despite the high contribution of continental species by the sô river gnohossou 2006 the low abundance of macroinvertebrate at ganvié could be related to the high anthropogenic pressure occurring at this site more than 2500 house built on stilts 3 3 3 abundance and biomass of macroinvertebrate the amphipods are the largest macroinvertebrate in lake nokoué gnohossou 2006 they were found everywhere in the lake with amphilochidae being the most abundant in the saline water phase and melitidae more the most abundant in the non saline water phase the molluscs had the highest biomass they are dominated by potamididae which are mainly found in the area with less organic pollution such as the centre and the east locations of the lake potamididae appeared to be very little consumed by fish gnohossou et al 2009 which could explain why they were the dominant taxon regarding biomass in general the biomass of the macroinvertebrate in the lake increased rapidly at low water periods although the species richness at this period was very low compared to high water period gnohossou 2006 this could be explained by the fact that biomass value raised at low water period by saltwater macroinvertebrates which were large in size and weight during high water periods these species retreat and give way to freshwater species that are more diversified but smaller in size and weight 3 4 ichthyofauna fish fauna has been extensively studied in lake nokoué 60 of papers collected various topics have been investigated including standard topics such as fish assemblage patterns spatio temporal distribution and length frequency distribution welcomme 1972 adite and winemiller 1997 lalèyè et al 2003 but also more specific topics such as particular eco morphological relationships population parameters dietary patterns anatomical features and fish parasites niyonkuru et al 2007 niyonkuru and lalèyè 2012 dougnon et al 2012 gnohossou et al 2013 this review focused on the information which helped to understand the interaction between fish species and the other ecological components of the lake 3 4 1 diversity and species richness the fish diversity of lake nokoué eroded about 42 from the 1960s to 2000s table 2 this situation has been explained by various causes including the increasing pressure of acadja practices niyonkuru and lalèyè 2010 the changes in the water exchanges with the sea since the 1960s and the degradation of nursery area and mangrove riparian habitat adite and winemiller 1997 the lowest value of species richness was observed by adite and winemiller 1997 however this could be explained by the period of this study which was short when compared to the other studies table 2 even though adite and winemiller 1997 covered a shorter period this study appeared to have 19 and 03 dissimilarities in fish species with respectively lalèyè et al 2003 and van thielen et al 1987 these observations suggested a rapid temporal variability in the species composition of the lake this could be explained by the alternation between freshwater brackish water and saline water the current species richness of lake nokoué based on the latest studies adite and winemiller 1997 gnohossou 2006 lalèyè et al 2003 could be estimated at 45 species from 23 families an analysis of the fish assemblage patterns based on the studies enumerated in table 2 showed a significant temporal and spatial variation of species richness with spatial variation stronger than temporal variation these spatial and temporal variations in assemblage structure have been associated primarily to the spatial temporal variation of the water quality especially salinity variation fig 6 three types of fish species have been distinguished estuarine species marine species and freshwater species welcomme 1972 van thielen et al 1987 adite and winemiller 1997 the latest classification proposed five major categories lalèyè et al 2003 category 1 species found in the lake throughout the year 8 species category 2 exclusively estuarine and lagoon species 5 species category 3 euryhaline freshwater species whose appearance determined by salinity tolerance 5 10 species they appeared in the lake in november and december category 4 occasional marine species 11 species most species from this category appeared between february and august in the north of the lake where the salinity remained high 20 category 5 species which are very rare or absent during the high water period between september and november but which appear when salinity is 10 14 species 3 4 2 fish abundance despite the relatively important fish fauna diversity of lake nokoué very few species contribute substantially to the catch considering the last three decades ethmalosa fimbriata was the most abundant species representing about 40 of annual catches followed by sarotherodon melanotheron and gerres melanopterus which comprised between 25 and 10 of annual catches adite and winemiller 1997 lalèyè et al 2003 almost 90 of the total fish production in lake nokoué came from less than 20 of the fauna niyonkuru et al 2007 the spatial distribution of fish abundance in lake nokoué was not uniform the west and the north of the lake were more productive than the other locations however this is probably related to the acadjas spatial distribution which is mostly located in the west and northwest niyonkuru and lalèyè 2010 e fimbriata was more likely to be found in the south of the lake while s melanotheron was likely to be found in the northwest near sô river g melanopterus mainly populated the north and northeast locations 3 4 3 habitat preference and biomass most fish in lake nokoué were captured in shallow areas and with a high preference for the acadja habitat adite and winemiller 1997 lalèyè et al 2003 since the years 1990s almost 85 the fishes captured have been from acadja niyonkuru and lalèyè 2010 it appeared that some species such as polydactilus quadrifilis had even shifted their habitat from the open water to acadja to avoid their natural predator adite and winemiller 1997 similar observations were made in ebrié lagoon where acadja was experimentally introduced in early 1990 to increase fish productivity guiral et al 1993 this high productivity of acadja has been linked to an important spatial concentration of the periphyton on the brushwood and to a productivity per biomass unit and a photosynthetic efficiency significantly higher for fixed communities than for pelagic communities guiral et al 1993 welcomme et al 2005 villanueva et al 2006 it has been reported by many studies that fish catches at around ganvié villages on stilts were very low and only a few species 8 species were found at that location adite and winemiller 1997 lalèyè et al 2003 this observation also included acadja habitat at this location niyonkuru and lalèyè 2010 the high turbidity and high organic matter concentration could explain the low fish species richness and abundance at ganvié furthermore it is important to note there was a constant motorised boat traffic around ganvié due to the villages on stilts which could make this environment too distributed for fish development lake nokoué is recognised to be the most productive coastal lake in west africa lalèyè 1995 welcomme et al 2005 villanueva et al 2006 fish catches in lake nokoué have been estimated at 102tkm 2 year 1 which is 10 times greater than catches in lake ebrié a coastal lake in ivory coast and far higher than the catches in lagos lagoons in nigeria villanueva et al 2006 abundance and occurrence of fish in lake nokoué seem to be highly influenced by i acadja distribution which increases food availability and possibilities to hide from predator by ii the water quality parameters mainly salinity but also water turbidity and concentration of organic matter in the water which governed the spatio temporal variation of the species and by iii intensive catching pressure which limit the recovery of the fish population 3 4 4 dietary analysis regarding food resource use by fish species in lake nokoué three major groups were detected i species that fed mostly on detritus with niche overlaps ranging from 0 92 to 1 00 chrysichthys nigrodigitatus e fimbriata liza falcipinnis s melanotheron synaptura lusitanica and tilapia guineensis ii piscivorous species with overlaps between 0 88 and 0 95 eleotris senegalensis hemichromis fasciatus and lutjanus goriensis and elops lacerta and iii species that fed on zooplankton and macroinvertebrates g melanopterus pomadasys jubelini and citharichthys stampflii with low overlap 0 4 adite and winemiller 1997 gnohossou 2006 diet analysis revealed that an important proportion of fish species 24 32 used a single resource adite and winemiller 1997 gnohossou 2006 most of these species were piscivores or invertebrate feeders and were mainly present in high water period with low abundance the most abundant species in the lake were species with large diet plasticity such as s melanotheron and c nigrodigitatus which passed from detritivores in high water to zooplantkivorous during low water periods in fact the high development of acadja fishing practices has considerably increased the availability of detritus in the lake and reduce the availability of invertebrate this situation might have also conducted to feeding adaptation of some species such as e fimbriata which has been characterised as zooplanktivorous feeder in early 1980s albaret and legendre 1985 but which was considerably feeding on decaying materials in the 2000s gnohossou 2006 3 5 piscivorous birds and fishery interaction in lake nokoué two main species of piscivorous birds occur on lake nokoué namely malachite kingfisher alcedo cristata and the pied kingfisher ceryle rudis libois and laudelout 2004 they were mostly found in the delta of the sô river just at the north of ganvié fig 1 the feeding ecology of the kingfisher covered 18 prey categories over the 45 fish species enumerated in the lake laudelout and libois 2003 the main prey were cichlids s melanotheron and h fasciatus followed by clupeids e fimbriata and eleotrids kribia sp although most of these species are demersal and should not be available for birds analysis of prey size indicated that they are taken by birds at an early age while they are still small probably just after the reproductive season this could explain they availability to piscivorous birds since most of the eggs of the prey fish species are usually attached to submerged macrophytes collette and parin 1990 which are highly found in the arms of sô river before its entrance to lake nokoué a comparison between fish taken by kingfisher and fish caught by fishery on lake nokoué suggested that the negative economic impact of the piscivorous birds was restricted to s melanotheron laudelout and libois 2003 since the other species consumed have no or low market value in addition the consumed s melanotheron were small individuals under the market size and therefore the economic loss for fishermen resides on the hypothesis that these small tilapias might grow to marketable size if piscivorous birds did not take them however this negative economic impact is probably counterbalanced by the high amount of h fasciatus a voracious predator of s melanotheron captured by the birds 4 trophic structure and interactions in lake nokoué research on the ecology of the aquatic communities of lake nokoué remains limited compared to the other coastal lakes of west africa such as lake ebrié ivory coast and lagos lagoon nigeria 4 1 temporal and seasonal evolution of the trophic groups before the widening of the sea entrance into the lake nokoué and the subsequent modification of its hydrodynamics there was almost no seasonal difference within the species richness of the trophic groups observations made in 2004 showed that the species richness had highly changed from the high to the low water indicating a strong seasonal difference in the structuration of the trophic groups in general the richness of detritivores and piscivores groups has increased between 1960 and 2004 for the disadvantage of benthivores and the group of zooplanktivores fig 4 gras 1961 gnohossou 2006 the zooplanktivores group which was the smallest group in 1960 was entirely absent in 2004 at the low water period fig 4 between the 1960s and 2000s the majority of the extinct fish species in the lake are zooplanktivorous and benthivorous species lalèyè et al 2003 this suggests a decrease in the zooplankton and benthic communities since 1960 another probable cause could be a perturbation of the benthic habitat by the deposits of acadja debris and dead water hyacinth which sink to the bottom of the lake mama et al 2011b at the low water period detritivores group dominates in fish biomass while at the high water period zooplanktivores group invaded the lake fig 4 in fact during the high water period freshwater fish migrate from tributaries into lake nokoué in addition the plastic diet of e fimbriata which can shift from detritivores to zooplanktivores increase zooplanktivores biomass at the same period the marine fish migrate back to the atlantic ocean they will come back to the lake when salinity increase at the low water period and most of the freshwater fish will migrate back to tributaries fig 4 this fish migration cycle has been promoted on one hand by the intensification of the water exchange between the lake and the atlantic ocean due to the widening of the sea entrance into the lake around 1960 and on the other hand by the intensification of acadja and water hyacinth detritus which seem to have promoted detritivorous fish development 4 2 system s maturity lake nokoué appeared to be a more mature and stable ecosystem compared to the other coastal lakes in west africa villanueva et al 2006 despite its lower primary production from pelagic phytoplankton and riparian vegetation the primary production is governed by the high photosynthetic yield of the fixed communities periphyton which grow on acadja woods and constitutes a surplus autotrophic production the increased availability of detritus due to high use of acadja seemed to have increased re mineralization of organic materials and mitigated resource limitations in this ecosystem acadja in lake nokoué seemed to have played a significant role in resource compensation and has influenced the energy flow in the system for instance some carnivorous species such as the c nigrodigitatus e fimbriata trachinotus ovatus and l falcipinnis periodically shift to detritus feeding when other resources are limited adite and winemiller 1997 competing with true detritivores of the system such as s melanotheron and t guineensis lake nokoué is a detritus driven ecosystem with only a small use of phytoplankton zooplankton and even s melanotheron by the higher trophic level villanueva et al 2006 4 3 simplified model of lake nokoué based on the different interactions described in the previous sections between the hydrology the water quality the habitat and the biodiversity of lake nokoué we have established a simplified model structure of the lake s ecology fig 5 the model indicates that the ecohydrology of lake nokoué includes five main components towards which management actions can be directed 1 the hydrological processes 2 the anthropogenic pressure 3 the water quality processes 4 the biological components and 5 the detritus the hydrological processes in lake nokoué directly influence it water quality through the regulation of the salinity regime and loads of riverine nutrients the anthropogenic pressure on the system is mainly the acadja fishing practices and the nutrient load from the surrounding cities and the villages on stilts these pressures affect the water quality and the accumulation of detritus in the ecosystem the biological components influence each other and react to water quality anthropogenic pressure and detritus detritus is the main driver of lake nokoué s ecosystem followed by salinity regime and acadja practice detritus based ecosystems are recognised to be more stable both regarding energy fluxes and consumer population dynamics with dissolved nutrients detritus support the pelagic food web of the coastal zone and estuaries bonthu et al 2016 however an excess of detritus can alter energy path and affect nutrient transfer efficiencies across trophic levels villanueva et al 2006 moore et al 2004 and therefore lead to a reduction of species richness as observed in lake nokoué fig 4 note that the direct factors which promote detritus accumulation in lake nokoué are the decay of acadja woods and the seasonal deposition of dead water hyacinth due to increase in salinity concentration above 6ppt therefore the reduction of detritus accumulation in lake nokoué should include the management actions towards reduction of acadja practice and removal of water hyacinth before they died this approach requires mapping and monitoring of both acadja and water hyacinth to understand their dynamic and the processes affecting them 5 perspectives for further research on lake nokoué ecology strategies for the conservation and restoration of coastal lakes and lagoons need to take two elements into account 1 elimination of threats and 2 amplification of opportunities to guarantee that they reach their goals wagner et al 2009 zalewski 2014 skłodowski et al 2014 it is also important that ecosystem conservation and restoration strategies are designed together with a strategy of economic growth since the goal of conservation shouldn t be to remove humans from the ecosystem but to ensure that they make sustainable use of the ecosystem zalewski 2014 stated that the strategy of economic growth around aquatic ecosystem should therefore be shifted from competition for resources to competition in their efficient use further research around lake nokoué needs to integrate these new paradigms for the design of sustainable conservation restoration and economic growth solutions it is clear that habitats and biodiversity in lake nokoué have been highly modified because of human activities however efforts to bring back the global biodiversity and bio productivity of this lake should not obstruct its services to the society further research should focus on strengthening the overall resilience of the landscape to the environmental and human induced stress environmental stability there is a need to assess the trade offs inherent in managing humans embedded in lake nokoué system this requires i a quantification and valuation of the important ecosystem services ii an analysis of the magnitudes of changes in these ecosystem services that result from anthropogenic actions and iii the economic impact of these changes filling this gap will allow harmonisation of societal needs with the enhanced ecosystem potential and constitute the first step in elaborating the trade offs for the management strategies of lake nokoué to preserve both biodiversity and human welfare unfortunately because of the lack of historical data and it is still difficult to quantify the amplitude and the impacts of the changes in the hydrological regime and the water quality of lake nokoué on its biota also this lack of historical data makes difficult the definition of reference conditions considering that the entire lake ecosystem is already highly modified in this review the information provided on the lagoons similar to lake nokoué constitutes an insight into the definition of it reference conditions considering the similarities observed in climate geomorphology and anthropogenic pressure of west african open coastal lakes one can think about defining unique reference conditions for these ecosystems however specific conservation and restoration targets for each ecosystem have to be set based on the services it provides to the society for instance it appears that reference conditions for the riparian habitat of west african coastal lakes and lagoons should be characterised by dominant mangrove vegetation mainly r racemose and avicennia germinans therefore restoration of riparian habitat on the west african coastline must logically include planting mangrove however for lake nokoué where mangrove have been destroyed to make acadja a crucial question would be whether planting mangrove is sustainable if not can mangrove restoration be achieved by the removal of pressures and it is even possible to remove the pressure targets for riparian habitat restoration in lake nokoué must consider acadja development and should there include a large awareness campaign for maintaining mangrove and alternative measures for the construction of acadja or even insertion of rules for the regulation of acadja development yet the impacts of the abrupt historical changes in the hydrological regime and the water quality of lake nokoué on its biota are not well known the evaluation of these impacts requires i the definition of reference conditions for the biota and ii the quantification of the biomass input output by fish and macroinvertebrate migration seaward landward through the channel of cotonou and from the lake tributaries current knowledge on the spatio temporal variations of these phytoplankton and zooplankton communities does not cover a full hydrological cycle therefore the analysis of the ecological threshold in lake nokoué namely the analysis of salinity and water level changes on the primary producers cannot be performed based on the current knowledge of the system more complete data collection on water quality and biota migration need to be done also research should be made on strategies for the reduction of the detritus accumulation in the system possible joint solutions for the reduction of detritus could be i removal of water hyacinth before they died meaning before salinity rise above 6ppt and ii removal of the woodbrush of acadja after fish harvest this will also contribute to reduction of potential internal nutrient loads in the system this implies that further research on the lake should investigate the components of the nutrient budget including the influence of seasonal water hyacinth death and acadja decays on the internal nutrient loads djihouessi and aina 2018 decision makers should also establish monitoring strategies for the reduction of riverine nutrient loads this implies first the identification of the anthropogenically highly modified parts of river basins and second the elaboration of dual regulation measures focusing on water and biota for these areas examples of regulation measures could be the promotion of drip irrigation to optimise the amount of fertiliser applied the construction of structures for erosion control in agricultural lands and the restoration of rivers riparian vegetation in addition to all these measure decision makers should promote the construction of wastewater treatment plants for the cities of abomey calavi cotonou and the villages on stilts the effective reduction of nutrient loads in the lake 6 conclusion the review of studies on the habitat and the biodiversity of lake nokoué showed the short and long term response of the biota to a constantly and highly impacted habitat from 1980 to 2000 the riparian vegetation of the lake has been destroyed due to the increased urbanisation around the lake one peculiarity of lake nokoué is the massive use of brush parks also known as acadja this habitat present in the pelagic zone enhances fish production with an increase of detritus in the lake acadja practices have shown a positive impact on fish catch but they also contribute to the reduction of diversity of fish fauna with the extinction of many zooplanktivorous and benthivorous species and the proliferation of detritivores further researches are still needed to understand the spatio temporal dynamic of the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in the lake conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was

1141,soil degradation and associated soil erosion is a daunting socio economic challenge for smallholder farmers that cause environmental harm in the developing regions of the world this is especially true in the ethiopian highlands where soil degradation and soil erosion significantly impact the productivity of land and water in this study gis based classic rusle model supported with multi criteria evaluation mce analysis was used to map erosion hotspot areas in the sub humid ethiopian highlands rusle model results indicated that annual average soil loss in the study area reaches up to 288 t ha 1 in the majority 83 of the study area predicted soil loss ranges between 0 and 40 t ha 1 whereas 13 of the study area has soil loss of 40 100 t ha 1 and the remaining 4 is in excess of 100 t ha 1 seventy two percent of upper gilgel abbay watershed was found moderately sensitive to erosion the classic rusle predicted lower erosion rates mainly in the bottomlands because does not consider soil erosion by gullies on the other hand the mce analysis integrated with field survey indicated that the potential location of gullies is the saturated bottomlands the locations of bottomland gullies also coincided with important hydrologic parameters such as higher soil wetness and stream power index values the implication is that in addition to rusle criteria such as gullies topographic wetness index twi and stream power index spi should be considered in erosion risk mapping studies in the sub humid ethiopian highlands where soil saturation plays an important role in the formation and expansion of gullies keywords gilgel abbay rusle gis multi criteria analysis soil loss 1 introduction soil erosion is a major global environmental issue resulting in both on site and off site effects taye et al 2015 haregeweyn et al 2006 tamene vlek 2008 in ethiopia a considerable amount of soil is being lost every year particularly through runoff the ethiopian highlands are severely affected by soil degradation due to a combination of biophysical geological and socio economic factors el swaify and hurni 1996 hurni 1985 gani et al 2007 haregeweyn et al 2015 soil degradation is a major problem for agricultural production assefa et al 2015 worqlul et al 2017 which is the dominant sector for the economic development in the region the most influential anthropogenic factors that accelerate soil erosion in ethiopia include rapid population growth cultivation on steep slopes clearing of vegetation and overgrazing tamene vlek 2008 hurni et al 2005 nyssen et al 2004 hurni 1988 the rates of soil erosion in ethiopia ranges up to 300 t ha 1 yr 1 hurni 1988 hawando 1995 berhe 1996 measured the rate of soil loss from soil conservation research project sites anjenie maybar andit tid dizi gununo hude lafto and afdeyu and his findings range from 18 to 214 8 t ha 1 yr 1 a study by tamene and vlek 2008 in the semi arid region of tigray northern ethiopia also revealed a soil loss rate of 35 42 t ha 1 yr 1 which is translated to a monetary value of 1 2 billion usd yr 1 and grain loss of 1 5 million t yr 1 according to sonneveld et al 2011 the soil loss varies remarkably from 0 t ha 1 yr 1 in the eastern and southeastern parts of ethiopia to more than 100 t ha 1 yr 1 in the north western part of the country a recent study by haregeweyn et al 2017 in the upper blue nile basin indicated that the soil loss rate ranged from zero in water bodies to 200 t ha 1 yr 1 on degraded slopes soil erosion in the form of gully erosion is found to be the most important form of land degradation lamb et al 2005 daba et al 2003 a study by tebebu et al 2010 simon et al 2011 and zegeye et al 2014 indicated that gullies are the most important contributor for the catchment sediment yield which was found to be more than 90 of the total soil loss a report by abyi 2009 tebebu et al 2010 and zegeye et al 2016 also showed that active gullies are found on the saturated bottomlands of the watersheds in the ethiopian highlands understanding the runoff generating mechanisms infiltration or saturation excess is a prerequisite to identify erosion sensitive areas for management priority assefa et al 2015 the two runoff mechanisms may occur in the same watershed while one dominates the other depending on hydrological properties moisture content slope and other factors a study by tilahun et al 2014 in the debremawi watershed of the sub humid ethiopian highlands showed that the infiltration capacity was exceeded by rainfall intensity during only 1 5 and 4 of the time in 2010 and 2011 respectively indicating the dominance of saturation excess runoff mechanism setegn et al 2009 mapped erosion sensitive areas in lake tana basin considering steep slope as the main source of erosion infiltration excess runoff mechanism however the saturated area could be the main source of erosion and the dominant runoff mechanism is uncertain for the wider basin blue nile basin where the study area located is one of the least planned and managed sub basins of the nile sultan et al 2018 haregeweyn et al 2017 tilahun et al 2014 schmidt and zemadim 2013 very few studies have been done to understand the spatial pattern and distribution of soil erosion in the tana basin assefa et al 2015 mekonnen and melesse 2011 assessment of soil erosion vulnerable areas using remote sensing is very important in detecting soil erosion features and soil conservation priority vrieling 2006 since it is not possible to launch watershed management interventions over all the basins at the same time identifying erosion hotspot areas is essential for targeted soil conservation interventions therefore this study is intended to identify erosion prone areas in gilgel abbay watershed located in the sub humid ethiopian highlands soil erosion assessment using remotely sensed data and gis is less time labor and capital intensive and effective in generating essential quantitative information on soil erosion baban and wan yusof 1999 gis based revised universal soil loss equation rusle has been developed to predict sheet and rill erosion rates from agricultural watersheds renard et al 1997 hurni

methods 2 1 description of the study area this study is conducted in the gilgel abbay watershed geographically located 10 56 to 11 51 n and 36 44 to 37 23 e in the north western ethiopia fig 1 the catchment area of gilgel abbay watershed is 1791 km2 the elevation of upper gilgel abbay watershed varies from 1891 to 3531 m a s l fig 1 the main rainy season in the watershed is from june to september and accounts for 70 90 of the annual rainfall abdo et al 2009 mean annual areal rainfall varies from 1624 to 2349 mm most of the study area receives between 1842 and 1986 mm the temperature of the study area is dependent on elevation and ranges from 18 3 to 24 9 wale 2008 typical soils of upper gilgel abbay watershed with their respective area coverage are haplic luvisols 56 haplic alisols 40 eutric vertisols 2 and insignificant coverage of eutric regosols 0 8 and haplic nitisols 0 6 table 1 cultivated land 70 forest land 10 grassland and shrub 9 and bushland 7 are the most dominant land use systems in the watershed table 2 2 2 data sources and method of data collection multi criteria evaluation mce analysis requires spatial data input these data include rainfall gully location land use digital elevation model dem and soil necessary data were collected from both primary and secondary sources table 3 rainfall data of dangla injibara wotet abbay and sekela rainfall stations were obtained from the bahir dar branch of the national meteorological agency nma the soil map was obtained from the ministry of water irrigation and electricity of ethiopia whereas the land use and dem were obtained from the usgs website table 3 landsat 8 image was used for land use classification supported with 108 land use field control points collected from the watershed processed in erdas imagine 2010 software the image has a 30 m spatial resolution and a long time data series from 1972 exist with 16 days of temporal resolution field validation of the classified land use map was done by selection of several known sites for each class throughout each image 2 3 model description the rusle model the rusle model by renard et al 1997 was used in this study for estimation of soil loss use of easily accessible data easy for implementation and relatively accurate result is the advantages of rusle model according to this model soil erosion occurs due to rainfall erosivity factor r soil erodibility factor k topographic factor ls cover factor c and conservation practice factor p table 4 the potential ability of rain to cause erosion r factor is a function of the physical characteristics of rainfall while the vulnerability of the soil to get eroded is the erodibility factor k according to renard et al 1997 erodibility can be defined as the rate of soil loss per unit of erosivity factor on a unit plot the effect of topography on soil erosion was accounted by slope length l and slope steepness s zhang et al 2013 according to renard et al 1997 the effect of cropping and management practices on soil erosion rates is reflected by cover factor c specific cultivation also affects erosion by modifying flow pattern and direction of runoff and represented by supporting conservation practice factor p digital elevation model dem of 30 m resolution was used to extract the potential location of gullies the potential locations of gullies were predicted using the threshold values by lulseged and vlek 2005 hurni 1985 has modified the rusle to fit the ethiopian conditions the modified input parameters used by the rusle model include rainfall erosivity factor r cover factor c and conservation practice factor p for the ethiopian condition which are important inputs to the erosion and soil conservation research in ethiopia since the 1980s mathematically the revised universal soil loss equation wischmeier smith 1965 is written as 1 a r k l s c p where a is mean annual soil loss t ha 1 y 1 r is rainfall erosivity factor mj mm ha 1 h 1 y 1 k is the soil erodibility factor t ha h ha 1 mj 1 mm 1 topographic factors ls c is cover factor and p is conservation practice factor 2 4 identification of potential location of gullies the susceptibility of a particular field to gully formation has been assessed through the adoption of a threshold concept according to valentin et al 2005 gullying is a threshold dependent process controlled by a wide range of factors geological morphological and hydrological a study by jetten et al 2003 indicated that gully incision is expected when contributing area together with local slope exceeds a certain threshold therefore the method proposed by thorne et al 1986 and moore et al 1988 was used to predict the potential location and spatial pattern of gullies in the study area using the threshold concept the gully prone areas were predicted when both of the following two threshold values were satisfied lulseged and vlek 2005 stream power index spi eq 2 greater than 18 and topographic wetness index twi eq 3 greater than 6 8 the stream power index spi is a measure of the erosive power of flowing water spi is estimated based upon slope and contributing area spi indicates locations where gullies might be more likely to form on the landscape eq 2 a higher value of spi indicates a possible source of soil erosion due to concentrated runoff topographic wetness index predicts zones of saturation encountered along drainage paths and in zones of water concentration in landscapes gully occurs where surface water flow has become trapped in a small concentrated stream and begins to erode channels in the ground surface therefore we consider the effect of stream power index in combination with the twi to identify the gully prone area which is included in the pairwise matrix named as gully thus possible locations of gullies were predicted depending on the two criteria spi and twi mathematically the two equations are described below 2 spi ln a s tan β 3 twi ln a s tan β where twi is topographic wetness index spi is stream power index as is a local upslope contributing area m2 from flow accumulation raster and β is local slope angle degree 2 5 actual gully location mapping a field survey was conducted in summer of 2016 in mecha and sekela woredas of the gilgel abbay watershed to map gullies using hand held garmin gps with a horizontal accuracy of 3 m gps tracking was made along the perimeter of the gully starting from a fixed point and finally ending at a similar point to close the loop from the study area 346 gullies were mapped the actual location of gullies was used to validate erosion risk prediction using the mce rusle model and gully vulnerable areas identified by spi and twi analysis in the watershed in actual gully location identification survey 217 ha gully was mapped thus twi above 6 8 has 51 prediction performance to capture the actual gully area and the spi prediction captures 63 of the actual gully area indicating better performance than the wetness index 2 6 identification of erosion hotspot areas multi criteria evaluation mce was used to analyze various alternatives with the help of selected criteria for erosion hotspot areas identification a total of four criteria were used in the studied watershed the most important factors that can potentially affect soil erosion were land cover soil type topographic wetness index twi and stream power index spi land cover controls the detachability and transport of soil particles and infiltration of water into the soil topography determining the saturated excess runoff generation over the land represented with topographic wetness index twi soil type as an important factor for erosion and sediment transport process depending on its physical and chemical properties and stream power index spi which combines watershed area and slope indicating possible source of erosion by concentrated flow detachment risk for mce geographic information system arc gis 10 1 aided analysis was performed to obtain a map of each criterion as discussed above the susceptibility of a particular field to gully formation is predicted using the stream power and wetness indices the spatial data on the surface cover types were used in assessing the resistance of terrain unit to erosion soil erodibility is also one factor to be considered for mce that affect soil erosion maps of soil land cover gully location and twi were classified based on literature findings lulseged vlek 2005 tripathi et al 2003 deore 2005 the weight of each factor table 5 was assigned to the evaluation criteria which indicate its importance relative to other criteria under consideration jankowski 1995 after the complete comparison matrix the weights of the factors were computed by normalizing the respective eigenvector by the cumulative eigenvector the weights of the decision factor were distributed using equal interval ranging technique to the different classes of sensitivity the output map then indicates watershed erosion sensitive area under a relative contribution of the given criteria each criteria layer was obtained from mce factor generation and reclassification and was then multiplied by the respective weight derived from a pairwise comparison of criteria pairwise comparison technique was used to assign the weights of the decision factors since it has less bias than other techniques like ranking techniques in a pairwise comparison technique each factor was matched head to head one to one with each other and a comparison matrix was prepared to express the relative importance table 5 a scale of importance is broken down from a value of 1 9 the highest value 9 corresponds to the absolute importance and reciprocal of all scaled ratios are entered in the transpose position 1 9 shows an absolute triviality saaty 1977 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil loss estimation the result of the rusle model indicated that annual average soil loss in the study area ranges from 0 to 288 t ha 1 fig 2 the soil loss map indicated that there is greater spatial variation in soil loss in the watershed majority of the area 1481 km2 83 has predicted soil loss rate of 0 40 t ha 1 and 236 km2 of the area 13 found to have an erosion rate of 40 100 t ha 1 the remaining 74 km2 4 has a rate of greater than 100 t ha 1 the result of rusle model indicated that the upland part of the watershed is the most sensitive area with higher soil erosion rate table 6 the estimated soil loss in the gilgel abbay watershed is within the range of soil loss estimated for the ethiopian highlands by the soil conservation research program scrp which was in the range of 0 300 t ha 1 yr 1 hurni 1985 however the rusle erosion prediction has a limitation of considering gully erosion which is the main contributor to soil loss in the ethiopian highlands a study by zegeye et al 2014 in the debre mawi watershed of the upper blue nile basin indicated that more than 90 of the sediment measured at the outlet of the gully is contributed from the gully itself a recent study by tamene et al 2017 in tigray indicated that the rusle model predicted higher soil loss rates at steep slopes and middle slope positions as well as along gullies the predicted soil loss in the gilgel abbay watershed was relatively smaller on lower slope positions this is due to the fact that the slope of the watershed is flat and the land use practice is grazing however field gully mapping in mecha and sekela districts of the watershed indicated that several active gully erosion gully head cut retreat and bank collapse were found on the flat bottomlands this observation is in line with what has been reported by tebebu et al 2010 and zegeye et al 2016 in which the rise of perched groundwater table in the saturated bottomland areas of the debre mawi watershed resulted in the formation and expansion of gullies since the aim of this study was to identify the gully susceptible areas the amount of soil loss from the gullies was not assessed 3 2 identifying potential location of gullies according to jetten et al 2003 gully incision is expected when contributing area together with local slope exceeds a certain threshold upslope contributing area or flow accumulation as and local slope β were generated from a digital elevation model dem using as and β as an input stream power index and topographic wetness index were determined with eq 2 and eq 3 the results of stream power index analysis for the gilgel abbay watershed indicated that the stream power index was in the range of 2 16 according to lulseged and vlek 2005 areas in a watershed with a stream power index of greater than 18 are susceptible to gully formation fig 3 however the field gully mapping indicated that gullies are there up to the stream power index value of 7 which can be taken as a threshold value of gully prone area in the study watershed similarly the topographic wetness index twi of the gilgel abbay was found in the range of 4 26 which is also greater than the threshold value of 6 8 lulseged vlek 2005 for susceptibility to gully erosion risk the gully mapping for the validation of gully prone areas in the study watershed indicated that gullies had been found for threshold values of 5 and greater as shown in fig 4 the most saturated areas were located at the bottomlands of the watershed this result can be taken as a good indicator of threshold variability for gully susceptible area identification in the sub humid ethiopian highlands the overlaid map of topographic wetness index and stream power index fig 5 indicated that gullies were found at the saturated bottomlands and along the route of the natural stream our classification also indicated that 2 of the watershed is potentially susceptible to gully erosion risk fig 5 based on the sensitivity classification the bottomland s 1 in fig 5 is sensitive for gully erosion risk whereas the upland area with low sensitivity s 4 in fig 5 is not sensitive to gully erosion risk as it has been discussed above and reported in different research findings in the sub humid ethiopian highlands abiy 2009 tebebu et al 2010 zegeye et al 2016 gullies were found on the saturated bottomlands of the watersheds the location of gullies on the wetted areas is a clear indicator that the saturated bottom lands are critical sources of catchment sediment 3 3 model validation validation of models was performed to capture the uncertainty in the erosion risk prediction process the north eastern part of the gilgel abbay watershed was surveyed for actual gully location and this was compared with mce results the prediction by using twi and spi indicated that the 112 ha and 137 ha of the surveyed areas were twi greater than 5 and spi greater 7 respectively in actual gully location identification survey 217 ha gully was mapped thus twi above 6 8 has 51 prediction performance to capture the actual gully area and the spi prediction captures 63 of the actual gully area indicating better performance than the wetness index in this study the threshold value for twi 6 8 and spi 18 used by assefa et al 2015 lulseged vlek 2005 to identify gully susceptible areas for the sub humid ethiopian highlands was validated against the actual gully location after calculating twi and spi in gis environment the two maps had been clipped by using the input feature map of the actual gully location map for only the sampled area in the study watershed the result indicates that in the gilgel abbay watershed areas with a twi 5 and spi 7 are prone to gully erosion 3 4 identification of erosion hotspot areas eigenvector calculation was done for each row and the weight of each factor was determined table 5 the result of the overlay analysis indicated that the study area falls into three sensitive classes indicating no area is sensitive for soil erosion as it can be seen in fig 6 the most sensitive areas to erosion under the multi criteria evaluation s 1 spatially coincided well with the actual gully locations fig 5 therefore the multi criteria evaluation technique better captures important sediment source areas gullies than the rusle predictions this is consistent with the findings reported by zegeye et al 2016 and poesen et al 2003 in that gullies are critical sediment source areas in the ethiopian highlands and therefore accurate erosion prediction should properly address estimating gully erosion the areal distribution of the erosion sensitivity from the mce indicated that nearly 1 of the total watershed is highly sensitive s 1 72 is moderately sensitive s 2 27 marginally sensitive s 3 table 6 moreover the mce revealed that the upland area is marginally sensitive s 3 for soil erosion and this could be explained by the fact that in the upland areas there are no gullies and sheet and rill erosion could be the dominant erosion types 4 conclusion in this study the rusle model and mce technique were used to identify erosion prone areas in the sub humid ethiopian highlands rusle model prediction indicated that the upslope portion of gilgel abbay watershed is prone to soil erosion whereas the multi criteria evaluation mce indicated that the bottom slope or the saturated bottomland is prone to gully erosion which could not be captured in the rusle model alone topographic wetness index twi and stream power index spi were found to be powerful predictors for the potential areas of gully formation which coincided well with our field gully mapping the results from model prediction in combination with a field validation indicated that the gilgel abbay watershed areas having twi 5 and spi 7 are found to be sensitive to gully erosion the overall implication of this research is that the saturated bottomlands were the most important erosion prone parts of the watershed thus these areas should be given priority in the implementation of integrated watershed management practices

criteria evaluation mce analysis was used to map erosion hotspot areas in the sub humid ethiopian highlands rusle model results indicated that annual average soil loss in the study area reaches up to 288 t ha 1 in the majority 83 of the study area predicted soil loss ranges between 0 and 40 t ha 1 whereas 13 of the study area has soil loss of 40 100 t ha 1 and the remaining 4 is in excess of 100 t ha 1 seventy two percent of upper gilgel abbay watershed was found moderately sensitive to erosion the classic rusle predicted lower erosion rates mainly in the bottomlands because does not consider soil erosion by gullies on the other hand the mce analysis integrated with field survey indicated that the potential location of gullies is the saturated bottomlands the locations of bottomland gullies also coincided with important hydrologic parameters such as higher soil wetness and stream power index values the implication is that in addition to rusle criteria such as gullies topographic wetness index twi and stream power index spi should be considered in erosion risk mapping studies in the sub humid ethiopian highlands where soil saturation plays an important role in the formation and expansion of gullies keywords gilgel abbay rusle gis multi criteria analysis soil loss 1 introduction soil erosion is a major global environmental issue resulting in both on site and off site effects taye et al 2015 haregeweyn et al 2006 tamene vlek 2008 in ethiopia a considerable amount of soil is being lost every year particularly through runoff the ethiopian highlands are severely affected by soil degradation due to a combination of biophysical geological and socio economic factors el swaify and hurni 1996 hurni 1985 gani et al 2007 haregeweyn et al 2015 soil degradation is a major problem for agricultural production assefa et al 2015 worqlul et al 2017 which is the dominant sector for the economic development in the region the most influential anthropogenic factors that accelerate soil erosion in ethiopia include rapid population growth cultivation on steep slopes clearing of vegetation and overgrazing tamene vlek 2008 hurni et al 2005 nyssen et al 2004 hurni 1988 the rates of soil erosion in ethiopia ranges up to 300 t ha 1 yr 1 hurni 1988 hawando 1995 berhe 1996 measured the rate of soil loss from soil conservation research project sites anjenie maybar andit tid dizi gununo hude lafto and afdeyu and his findings range from 18 to 214 8 t ha 1 yr 1 a study by tamene and vlek 2008 in the semi arid region of tigray northern ethiopia also revealed a soil loss rate of 35 42 t ha 1 yr 1 which is translated to a monetary value of 1 2 billion usd yr 1 and grain loss of 1 5 million t yr 1 according to sonneveld et al 2011 the soil loss varies remarkably from 0 t ha 1 yr 1 in the eastern and southeastern parts of ethiopia to more than 100 t ha 1 yr 1 in the north western part of the country a recent study by haregeweyn et al 2017 in the upper blue nile basin indicated that the soil loss rate ranged from zero in water bodies to 200 t ha 1 yr 1 on degraded slopes soil erosion in the form of gully erosion is found to be the most important form of land degradation lamb et al 2005 daba et al 2003 a study by tebebu et al 2010 simon et al 2011 and zegeye et al 2014 indicated that gullies are the most important contributor for the catchment sediment yield which was found to be more than 90 of the total soil loss a report by abyi 2009 tebebu et al 2010 and zegeye et al 2016 also showed that active gullies are found on the saturated bottomlands of the watersheds in the ethiopian highlands understanding the runoff generating mechanisms infiltration or saturation excess is a prerequisite to identify erosion sensitive areas for management priority assefa et al 2015 the two runoff mechanisms may occur in the same watershed while one dominates the other depending on hydrological properties moisture content slope and other factors a study by tilahun et al 2014 in the debremawi watershed of the sub humid ethiopian highlands showed that the infiltration capacity was exceeded by rainfall intensity during only 1 5 and 4 of the time in 2010 and 2011 respectively indicating the dominance of saturation excess runoff mechanism setegn et al 2009 mapped erosion sensitive areas in lake tana basin considering steep slope as the main source of erosion infiltration excess runoff mechanism however the saturated area could be the main source of erosion and the dominant runoff mechanism is uncertain for the wider basin blue nile basin where the study area located is one of the least planned and managed sub basins of the nile sultan et al 2018 haregeweyn et al 2017 tilahun et al 2014 schmidt and zemadim 2013 very few studies have been done to understand the spatial pattern and distribution of soil erosion in the tana basin assefa et al 2015 mekonnen and melesse 2011 assessment of soil erosion vulnerable areas using remote sensing is very important in detecting soil erosion features and soil conservation priority vrieling 2006 since it is not possible to launch watershed management interventions over all the basins at the same time identifying erosion hotspot areas is essential for targeted soil conservation interventions therefore this study is intended to identify erosion prone areas in gilgel abbay watershed located in the sub humid ethiopian highlands soil erosion assessment using remotely sensed data and gis is less time labor and capital intensive and effective in generating essential quantitative information on soil erosion baban and wan yusof 1999 gis based revised universal soil loss equation rusle has been developed to predict sheet and rill erosion rates from agricultural watersheds renard et al 1997 hurni 1985 in this study gis based classic rusle model supported with multi criteria evaluation mce analysis was used to map erosion hotspot areas in the sub humid ethiopian highlands 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area this study is conducted in the gilgel abbay watershed geographically located 10 56 to 11 51 n and 36 44 to 37 23 e in the north western ethiopia fig 1 the catchment area of gilgel abbay watershed is 1791 km2 the elevation of upper gilgel abbay watershed varies from 1891 to 3531 m a s l fig 1 the main rainy season in the watershed is from june to september and accounts for 70 90 of the annual rainfall abdo et al 2009 mean annual areal rainfall varies from 1624 to 2349 mm most of the study area receives between 1842 and 1986 mm the temperature of the study area is dependent on elevation and ranges from 18 3 to 24 9 wale 2008 typical soils of upper gilgel abbay watershed with their respective area coverage are haplic luvisols 56 haplic alisols 40 eutric vertisols 2 and insignificant coverage of eutric regosols 0 8 and haplic nitisols 0 6 table 1 cultivated land 70 forest land 10 grassland and shrub 9 and bushland 7 are the most dominant land use systems in the watershed table 2 2 2 data sources and method of data collection multi criteria evaluation mce analysis requires spatial data input these data include rainfall gully location land use digital elevation model dem and soil necessary data were collected from both primary and secondary sources table 3 rainfall data of dangla injibara wotet abbay and sekela rainfall stations were obtained from the bahir dar branch of the national meteorological agency nma the soil map was obtained from the ministry of water irrigation and electricity of ethiopia whereas the land use and dem were obtained from the usgs website table 3 landsat 8 image was used for land use classification supported with 108 land use field control points collected from the watershed processed in erdas imagine 2010 software the image has a 30 m spatial resolution and a long time data series from 1972 exist with 16 days of temporal resolution field validation of the classified land use map was done by selection of several known sites for each class throughout each image 2 3 model description the rusle model the rusle model by renard et al 1997 was used in this study for estimation of soil loss use of easily accessible data easy for implementation and relatively accurate result is the advantages of rusle model according to this model soil erosion occurs due to rainfall erosivity factor r soil erodibility factor k topographic factor ls cover factor c and conservation practice factor p table 4 the potential ability of rain to cause erosion r factor is a function of the physical characteristics of rainfall while the vulnerability of the soil to get eroded is the erodibility factor k according to renard et al 1997 erodibility can be defined as the rate of soil loss per unit of erosivity factor on a unit plot the effect of topography on soil erosion was accounted by slope length l and slope steepness s zhang et al 2013 according to renard et al 1997 the effect of cropping and management practices on soil erosion rates is reflected by cover factor c specific cultivation also affects erosion by modifying flow pattern and direction of runoff and represented by supporting conservation practice factor p digital elevation model dem of 30 m resolution was used to extract the potential location of gullies the potential locations of gullies were predicted using the threshold values by lulseged and vlek 2005 hurni 1985 has modified the rusle to fit the ethiopian conditions the modified input parameters used by the rusle model include rainfall erosivity factor r cover factor c and conservation practice factor p for the ethiopian condition which are important inputs to the erosion and soil conservation research in ethiopia since the 1980s mathematically the revised universal soil loss equation wischmeier smith 1965 is written as 1 a r k l s c p where a is mean annual soil loss t ha 1 y 1 r is rainfall erosivity factor mj mm ha 1 h 1 y 1 k is the soil erodibility factor t ha h ha 1 mj 1 mm 1 topographic factors ls c is cover factor and p is conservation practice factor 2 4 identification of potential location of gullies the susceptibility of a particular field to gully formation has been assessed through the adoption of a threshold concept according to valentin et al 2005 gullying is a threshold dependent process controlled by a wide range of factors geological morphological and hydrological a study by jetten et al 2003 indicated that gully incision is expected when contributing area together with local slope exceeds a certain threshold therefore the method proposed by thorne et al 1986 and moore et al 1988 was used to predict the potential location and spatial pattern of gullies in the study area using the threshold concept the gully prone areas were predicted when both of the following two threshold values were satisfied lulseged and vlek 2005 stream power index spi eq 2 greater than 18 and topographic wetness index twi eq 3 greater than 6 8 the stream power index spi is a measure of the erosive power of flowing water spi is estimated based upon slope and contributing area spi indicates locations where gullies might be more likely to form on the landscape eq 2 a higher value of spi indicates a possible source of soil erosion due to concentrated runoff topographic wetness index predicts zones of saturation encountered along drainage paths and in zones of water concentration in landscapes gully occurs where surface water flow has become trapped in a small concentrated stream and begins to erode channels in the ground surface therefore we consider the effect of stream power index in combination with the twi to identify the gully prone area which is included in the pairwise matrix named as gully thus possible locations of gullies were predicted depending on the two criteria spi and twi mathematically the two equations are described below 2 spi ln a s tan β 3 twi ln a s tan β where twi is topographic wetness index spi is stream power index as is a local upslope contributing area m2 from flow accumulation raster and β is local slope angle degree 2 5 actual gully location mapping a field survey was conducted in summer of 2016 in mecha and sekela woredas of the gilgel abbay watershed to map gullies using hand held garmin gps with a horizontal accuracy of 3 m gps tracking was made along the perimeter of the gully starting from a fixed point and finally ending at a similar point to close the loop from the study area 346 gullies were mapped the actual location of gullies was used to validate erosion risk prediction using the mce rusle model and gully vulnerable areas identified by spi and twi analysis in the watershed in actual gully location identification survey 217 ha gully was mapped thus twi above 6 8 has 51 prediction performance to capture the actual gully area and the spi prediction captures 63 of the actual gully area indicating better performance than the wetness index 2 6 identification of erosion hotspot areas multi criteria evaluation mce was used to analyze various alternatives with the help of selected criteria for erosion hotspot areas identification a total of four criteria were used in the studied watershed the most important factors that can potentially affect soil erosion were land cover soil type topographic wetness index twi and stream power index spi land cover controls the detachability and transport of soil particles and infiltration of water into the soil topography determining the saturated excess runoff generation over the land represented with topographic wetness index twi soil type as an important factor for erosion and sediment transport process depending on its physical and chemical properties and stream power index spi which combines watershed area and slope indicating possible source of erosion by concentrated flow detachment risk for mce geographic information system arc gis 10 1 aided analysis was performed to obtain a map of each criterion as discussed above the susceptibility of a particular field to gully formation is predicted using the stream power and wetness indices the spatial data on the surface cover types were used in assessing the resistance of terrain unit to erosion soil erodibility is also one factor to be considered for mce that affect soil erosion maps of soil land cover gully location and twi were classified based on literature findings lulseged vlek 2005 tripathi et al 2003 deore 2005 the weight of each factor table 5 was assigned to the evaluation criteria which indicate its importance relative to other criteria under consideration jankowski 1995 after the complete comparison matrix the weights of the factors were computed by normalizing the respective eigenvector by the cumulative eigenvector the weights of the decision factor were distributed using equal interval ranging technique to the different classes of sensitivity the output map then indicates watershed erosion sensitive area under a relative contribution of the given criteria each criteria layer was obtained from mce factor generation and reclassification and was then multiplied by the respective weight derived from a pairwise comparison of criteria pairwise comparison technique was used to assign the weights of the decision factors since it has less bias than other techniques like ranking techniques in a pairwise comparison technique each factor was matched head to head one to one with each other and a comparison matrix was prepared to express the relative importance table 5 a scale of importance is broken down from a value of 1 9 the highest value 9 corresponds to the absolute importance and reciprocal of all scaled ratios are entered in the transpose position 1 9 shows an absolute triviality saaty 1977 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil loss estimation the result of the rusle model indicated that annual average soil loss in the study area ranges from 0 to 288 t ha 1 fig 2 the soil loss map indicated that there is greater spatial variation in soil loss in the watershed majority of the area 1481 km2 83 has predicted soil loss rate of 0 40 t ha 1 and 236 km2 of the area 13 found to have an erosion rate of 40 100 t ha 1 the remaining 74 km2 4 has a rate of greater than 100 t ha 1 the result of rusle model indicated that the upland part of the watershed is the most sensitive area with higher soil erosion rate table 6 the estimated soil loss in the gilgel abbay watershed is within the range of soil loss estimated for the ethiopian highlands by the soil conservation research program scrp which was in the range of 0 300 t ha 1 yr 1 hurni 1985 however the rusle erosion prediction has a limitation of considering gully erosion which is the main contributor to soil loss in the ethiopian highlands a study by zegeye et al 2014 in the debre mawi watershed of the upper blue nile basin indicated that more than 90 of the sediment measured at the outlet of the gully is contributed from the gully itself a recent study by tamene et al 2017 in tigray indicated that the rusle model predicted higher soil loss rates at steep slopes and middle slope positions as well as along gullies the predicted soil loss in the gilgel abbay watershed was relatively smaller on lower slope positions this is due to the fact that the slope of the watershed is flat and the land use practice is grazing however field gully mapping in mecha and sekela districts of the watershed indicated that several active gully erosion gully head cut retreat and bank collapse were found on the flat bottomlands this observation is in line with what has been reported by tebebu et al 2010 and zegeye et al 2016 in which the rise of perched groundwater table in the saturated bottomland areas of the debre mawi watershed resulted in the formation and expansion of gullies since the aim of this study was to identify the gully susceptible areas the amount of soil loss from the gullies was not assessed 3 2 identifying potential location of gullies according to jetten et al 2003 gully incision is expected when contributing area together with local slope exceeds a certain threshold upslope contributing area or flow accumulation as and local slope β were generated from a digital elevation model dem using as and β as an input stream power index and topographic wetness index were determined with eq 2 and eq 3 the results of stream power index analysis for the gilgel abbay watershed indicated that the stream power index was in the range of 2 16 according to lulseged and vlek 2005 areas in a watershed with a stream power index of greater than 18 are susceptible to gully formation fig 3 however the field gully mapping indicated that gullies are there up to the stream power index value of 7 which can be taken as a threshold value of gully prone area in the study watershed similarly the topographic wetness index twi of the gilgel abbay was found in the range of 4 26 which is also greater than the threshold value of 6 8 lulseged vlek 2005 for susceptibility to gully erosion risk the gully mapping for the validation of gully prone areas in the study watershed indicated that gullies had been found for threshold values of 5 and greater as shown in fig 4 the most saturated areas were located at the bottomlands of the watershed this result can be taken as a good indicator of threshold variability for gully susceptible area identification in the sub humid ethiopian highlands the overlaid map of topographic wetness index and stream power index fig 5 indicated that gullies were found at the saturated bottomlands and along the route of the natural stream our classification also indicated that 2 of the watershed is potentially susceptible to gully erosion risk fig 5 based on the sensitivity classification the bottomland s 1 in fig 5 is sensitive for gully erosion risk whereas the upland area with low sensitivity s 4 in fig 5 is not sensitive to gully erosion risk as it has been discussed above and reported in different research findings in the sub humid ethiopian highlands abiy 2009 tebebu et al 2010 zegeye et al 2016 gullies were found on the saturated bottomlands of the watersheds the location of gullies on the wetted areas is a clear indicator that the saturated bottom lands are critical sources of catchment sediment 3 3 model validation validation of models was performed to capture the uncertainty in the erosion risk prediction process the north eastern part of the gilgel abbay watershed was surveyed for actual gully location and this was compared with mce results the prediction by using twi and spi indicated that the 112 ha and 137 ha of the surveyed areas were twi greater than 5 and spi greater 7 respectively in actual gully location identification survey 217 ha gully was mapped thus twi above 6 8 has 51 prediction performance to capture the actual gully area and the spi prediction captures 63 of the actual gully area indicating better performance than the wetness index in this study the threshold value for twi 6 8 and spi 18 used by assefa et al 2015 lulseged vlek 2005 to identify gully susceptible areas for the sub humid ethiopian highlands was validated against the actual gully location after calculating twi and spi in gis environment the two maps had been clipped by using the input feature map of the actual gully location map for only the sampled area in the study watershed the result indicates that in the gilgel abbay watershed areas with a twi 5 and spi 7 are prone to gully erosion 3 4 identification of erosion hotspot areas eigenvector calculation was done for each row and the weight of each factor was determined table 5 the result of the overlay analysis indicated that the study area falls into three sensitive classes indicating no area is sensitive for soil erosion as it can be seen in fig 6 the most sensitive areas to erosion under the multi criteria evaluation s 1 spatially coincided well with the actual gully locations fig 5 therefore the multi criteria evaluation technique better captures important sediment source areas gullies than the rusle predictions this is consistent with the findings reported by zegeye et al 2016 and poesen et al 2003 in that gullies are critical sediment source areas in the ethiopian highlands and therefore accurate erosion prediction should properly address estimating gully erosion the areal distribution of the erosion sensitivity from the mce indicated that nearly 1 of the total watershed is highly sensitive s 1 72 is moderately sensitive s 2 27 marginally sensitive s 3 table 6 moreover the mce revealed that the upland area is marginally sensitive s 3 for soil erosion and this could be explained by the fact that in the upland areas there are no gullies and sheet and rill erosion could be the dominant erosion types 4 conclusion in this study the rusle model and mce technique were used to identify erosion prone areas in the sub humid ethiopian highlands rusle model prediction indicated that the upslope portion of gilgel abbay watershed is prone to soil erosion whereas the multi criteria evaluation mce indicated that the bottom slope or the saturated bottomland is prone to gully erosion which could not be captured in the rusle model alone topographic wetness index twi and stream power index spi were found to be powerful predictors for the potential areas of gully formation which coincided well with our field gully mapping the results from model prediction in combination with a field validation indicated that the gilgel abbay watershed areas having twi 5 and spi 7 are found to be sensitive to gully erosion the overall implication of this research is that the saturated bottomlands were the most important erosion prone parts of the watershed thus these areas should be given priority in the implementation of integrated watershed management practices

1142,lake eutrophication is one of the major ecological concerns over the world in recent times most of the freshwater lakes and wetlands are facing the problem of water quality deterioration and ecological imbalance due to the increasing anthropogenic activities particularly in developing countries the understanding of the mechanism and identification of the sources of eutrophication will be beneficial to mitigate the problem through proper management policy mechanism and effects of eutrophication described within various case studies all over the world and the evolution of modelling approaches for their mitigation has been reviewed in this paper with the advancement of ecosystem modeling it has become feasible for the governmental bodies and policy makers to propose better lake control schemes and restoration programs through their better predictive capacity while prediction and control of eutrophication of lakes now has become easier than before refinements are still going on owing to the ever increased complexity and lake specific problems that require wider experience and more details the current status of knowledge about lake eutrophication and advances in ecological and hydrodynamic modeling will be of great use for future research prospects keywords algal bloom cyanobacteria eutrophication static models dynamic models 1 introduction eutrophication is one of the most challenging environmental problems that the surface water bodies are facing in present time smith and schindler 2009 li kun et al 2017 eutrophication is an ecological process similar to aging in which a water body is increasingly enriched with essential nutrients of the aquatic plants rast and thornton 1996 which results in increase of the primary productivity i e rate of photosynthesis of the aquatic ecosystem qin et al 2013 the most common signs of eutrophication in lakes and rivers involve heavy algal blooms resulting in high turbidity and anoxic conditions in the deeper parts of the waterbody due to the decay of detritus which leads to fish kills oecd 1982 schindler et al 2008 wang and wang 2009 eutrophication may lead to severe health hazards to human and animals through various pathways it is a major health threat if drinking water is collected from an eutrophied waterbody eutrophication also results in serious ecological problems as well as have impact on the esthetic view and economy in general lake eutrophication phenomenon can be classified into two categories natural and cultural natural eutrophication process takes place very slowly in geological time but can be greatly accelerated by anthropogenic activities which is generally referred to as man made or cultural eutrophication rast and thornton 1996 khan and ansari 2005 serrano et al 2017 increases in populations environmental pollution in various forms intensification of land use and application of nutrients as agricultural fertilizers in the developed countries from the 1940s onwards chloupek et al 2004 and use of phosphate compounds in laundry detergents from the 1950s kroes 1980 have accelerated cultural eutrophication of water bodies all over the world in the middle of twentieth century eutrophication was recognized as a water pollution problem in many western european and north american lakes and reservoirs rohde 1969 thereafter it has become more widespread especially in some regions it has caused deterioration in the aquatic environment and serious problems for water use particularly in drinking water treatment it is generally accepted that excessive nutrient input mainly nitrogen n and phosphorus p are the key factors accelerating the process of eutophication in aquatic ecosystems vollenweider 1968 hecky and kilham 1988 lowery 1998 smith 1998 gurkan et al 2006 because nutrients can come from different point and non point sources comprehensive strategies are required to mitigate or reverse eutrophication carpenter et al 1998 smith et al 1999 earlier studies revealed that eutrophication can be managed by limiting the nutrient input n or p to the waterbody schindler 2006 however proper knowledge of physical chemical and biological processes that occur in the waterbody during eutrophication process gives better restoration success lewtas et al 2015 with the advent of mathematical modeling approach to encounter eutrophication problem after the work of vollenweider 1968 schindler 1977 dillon and rigler 1974 etc few decades back new dimension has been achieved in lake restoration programs as these models can give a better insight to the problem and very much accurate in terms of its predictive power bryhn and hakanson 2007 in this paper an attempt has been made to review various lake eutrophication cases all over the world and recent advances in ecological modeling for lake restoration and eutrophication control programs the development of ecological modeling from the late 80s different model types various factors and processes considered in modeling context especially the recent ones has been addressed in this paper which may be useful to encounter new research challenges 2 eutrophication mechanism and assessment nitrogen n and phosphorus p are the key elements for the algae bacteria protozoa and other aquatic organisms that compose the freshwater ecosystem but excessive inflow of these elements may result in eutrophication of water bodies to minimize the organic pollution of water general practice is to reduce the biochemical oxygen demand bod level of household and industrial wastewaters which positively correlates with organic pollution higher concentration of nitrogen and phosphorous in the public water areas may cause negative ecological consequences on aquatic ecosystem structures processes and functions result in fast growth of phytoplankton and deteriorate water quality especially in the summer application of fertilizers and chemicals to crops and their subsequent runoff to the nearby waterbodies may also cause nutrient enrichment runoff especially from urban and agricultural areas carries fertilizers pesticides sediment and or industrial effluent that accelerate eutrophication when discharged into a waterbody smith et al 1999 surface waters may host increased growth of algae or cyanobacteria wherever conditions of temperature light and nutrient status are conducive when such propagation is dominated by a single or a few species the phenomenon is referred to as an algal or cyanobacterial bloom chorus and bartram 1999 eutrophication is a process of nutrient enrichment and is used to characterize the state of aquatic ecosystems the trophic status of the waterbody is used as a description of the waterbody for this purpose to understand the nutrient status of a waterbody the terms oligotrophic mesotrophic eutrophic and hypertrophic are normally used walmsley 2000 oligotrophic is the state of low in nutrient concentration and not productive in terms of aquatic animal and plant life these lakes have very little algal production and suitable for drinking purpose mesotrophic is an intermediate level of nutrients fairly productive in terms of aquatic animal and plant life and showing the initiation of signs of water quality problems eutrophic is the state where waterbody is rich in nutrient concentration very productive in terms of aquatic animal and plant life and shows increasing signs of water quality problems due to the increased algal load water becomes less transparent hypertrophic is the state where excessive nutrient concentrations prevail and plant growth may be determined by physical factors water quality problems are serious and almost continuous water becomes less transparent and aquatic life ceases at lower depths due to loss in dissolved oxygen content to assess the trophic status of a waterbody there is no perfect or fixed evaluation criteria however to assess the trophic stage or eutrophication the general parameters adopted were total nutrient concentration n and p algal chlorophyll water transparency and dissolved oxygen concentration etc although there are numbers of assessment parameters for simplicity it is convenient to associate the trophic status in terms of nutrient concentration as this is the key factor controlling the process yang et al 2008 general guideline for the nutrient concentrations representing different trophic status of a waterbody are summarized in table 1 it was reported by yang et al 2008 that as the total phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations exceed 20μg l and 300μg l respectively this initiates the concern of eutrophication richardson et al 2007 have considered a threshold concentration of total phosphorus at 12 15μg l which creates ecological imbalance of algal macrophytes and other aquatic organisms apart from the mentioned indicators to assess water eutrophication some other parameters also have been developed in recent times cheng and li 2006 have defined total nutrient status index tni as a parameter to measure the trophic state of a waterbody tni is a parameter which relates all other parameters concerned viz total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp chlorophyll a dissolved oxygen do chemical oxygen demand cod and biological oxygen demand bod of water yang et al 2008 have recommended the use of biological indicators for monitoring aquatic ecosystem health as eutrophication results in degradation of the same biological indicators may include aspects considering structural and functional mechanisms structural aspect such as phytoplankton cell size and biomass zooplankton size and biomass phytoplankton to zooplankton ratio etc can be considered functional indicators can be resource use efficiency production to respiration ratio etc according to the widely accepted definition eutrophication is the process by which water ecosystems become enriched in dissolved nutrients mainly phosphates and nitrates this means that the cause of eutrophication is always the excess of biogenic substances however the effect of eutrophication may be deterioration of water quality and blooms of algae and cyanobacteria for these effects to occur the conditions that favor them are necessary like high concentration of tn and tp favorable temperature and environmental conditions slow current velocity and microbial activity and biodiversity in the waterbody li and liao 2002 3 case studies according to the survey of international lake environment committee ilec 1988 1993 in the asia pacific region 54 of lakes are eutrophic the proportions for europe africa north america and south america are 53 28 48 and 41 respectively tremendous increase in human population in the last century have converted eutrophication from local issue to a global concern wassmann and olli 2005 so limnological studies on lakes rivers and streams have been emphasized in recent times due to degradation of water quality due to eutrophication saxena et al 1988 lake erie one of the largest of the great lakes in north america is a best example of eutrophication due to manmade problems the lake 388km long and 92km wide has a maximum depth of 64m and an average depth of 19m since the lake is shallow and warm and it is highly rich in nutrients the lake is biologically the most productive reutter 1989 nutrient enrichment mainly with phosphorus in the lake has resulted in huge blooms of floating blue green algae and the attached green algae the blooms resulted in lesser light penetration in the lake which reduced the photosynthesis and oxygen production by other phytoplankton groups further depletion in the dissolved oxygen was observed as the bloomed algae died reutter 1989 it was observed all forms of phosphorus entering lake erie were not biologically available to phytoplanktons the reduction of bioavailable or soluble phosphorus is more important than reducing total phosphorus tp input to control nutrient overloading welch and cronke 1987 a summary of different cases of eutrophication in major lakes in different parts of the world are summarized in table 2 along with the major causes for eutrophication in the particular lake for most of the cases presented here it has been observed that the major cause of lake eutrophication are human induced ones and so it is the cultural eutrophication which needs to be given utmost attention it is evident that cultural eutrophication cases are ever increasing in all parts of the world in china water eutrophication has been reported in 67 lakes which is about 51 2 of the total number of lakes according to yang et al 2008 approximately 30 billion ton of polluted water would be discharged directly into the lakes therefore by 2030 all the urban lakes and most of the medium sized lakes at the urban rural fringe areas in china may be facing the problem of water eutrophication in india majority of lakes and urban water bodies are also facing the problem of water quality deterioration and decrease in water volume because of rapid urbanization and industrialization in the beginning of 1960s bangalore city had 262 lakes now only 10 hold water similarly in 2001 137 lakes were listed in ahmedabad city and over 65 were reported being already built over excreta matters 2012 there are other examples in india that shows such devastating state of urban water bodies and degradation of water quality garg et al 2002 have conducted a study on three lakes of bhopal viz upper lake lower lake and mansarovar lake in india the potential fertility of lake waters and aquatic flora was examined and it was reported that the highest level of eutrophication was found in mansarovar lake lake mirik in the darjeeling was studied for its hydro biological properties and it was demonstrated that in various portions of the lake nutrient concentration had been very high and potable water quality had been spoiled jha and barat 2003 other cases of lake eutrophication have been reported to fatheh sagar lake in udaipur sagar lake in madhya pradesh pathak and pathak 2012 the reasons for deterioration of water quality for all the cases primarily being high nutrient enrichment through anthropogenic activities 4 eutrophication control and modeling approach for a successful lake restoration and eutrophication mitigation plan the basic aim is to identify the sources of pollution and their subsequent remediation prevention of domestic and industrial wastewater disposal into the water bodies removal of nutrients in wastewater treatment level were used successfully for lake restoration in 1960s in some of the lakes in 1936 lake monona in usa was successfully restored by diverting the sewage to another lake and algal bloom reduced noticeably edmondson 1969 but it was quite obvious that this measure just shifted the problem to the other lake in a joint effort between us and canada in 1972 lake restoration had been implemented to lake erie which mainly focused on reducing the domestic and industrial input to the lake and it was reported that phosphorus loads from municipal discharges reduced by 84 in 1985 makarewicz and bertram 1991 however presence of other species such as microcystis anabaena aphanizomenon etc were observed thereafter and other factors such as increased agricultural runoff climatic factors etc continued to alter the natural ecosystem balance of the great lakes kane et al 2009 hecky et al 2004 similarly water quality improvement in lake washington has been reported by edmondson 1969 by nutrient removal in waste water treatment plants however more detailed and scientific insight to tackle eutrophication came after the work of vollenweider 1968 1976 where algorithms were provided to calculate nutrient retention in lakes he gave the concept of permissible levels of total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp by considering the volume of the waterbody where high volume of nutrient loading is permissible for larger lakes other parameters such as internal phosphorus loading from sediments water retention time gaseous nitrogen fixation etc and their role also has been considered in this work another major scientific knowledge on eutrophication mitigation was obtained from the work of schindler 1977 schindler 1977 conducted study on three experimental lakes in canada for several years and observed that algal biomass is dependent on tp concentration and not on tn as the short term n deficits are compensated by cyanobacterial fixation of atmospheric n in due course of time therefore it was concluded that it is the tp and not the tn that need to be removed in order to prevent eutrophication but generality of this concept has been disputed in the later phase by other researchers elser et al 1990 bergström et al 2005 where mainly n was found responsible for lake eutrophication and considerably low n fixation rate has been observed though the debate was centered mainly on n and p some other micronutrients such as iron sulphate silicon molybdenum and organic micronutrients e g vitamins were also paid attention by rast and thornton 1996 but these components were found to be of more importance in case of marine ecosystem riley and chester 1971 provasoli and carlucci 1974 rast and lee 1978 based on these findings several static vollenweider type models have been developed in the succeeding period which were more or less accurate in terms of its predictive power and were site specific however with the development of dynamic time dependent models in recent times it has been possible to apply them with better accuracy and also has wide range of limnological domain bryhn and hakanson 2007 development of the above mentioned types of ecological models and their applicability has been discussed in the succeeding section and more emphasis has been given to the recent developments in dynamic modeling for lake eutrophication control 4 1 modeling approaches in general all the ecological models are more or less empirical and mechanistic aldenberg et al 1995 and can be classified as static vollenweider type models and dynamic models bryhn and hakanson 2007 static models consider that lake has received a constant nutrient input for a long time that is based on steady state assumption these models calculate nutrient concentration in lake water from lake specific parameters such as nutrient retention time mean depth of a waterbody water flushing rate apart from nutrient input rate etc and are based on comparative studies it has the advantage that it is suitable for non specialists and are easy to use and can give rough estimation of nutrient concentration on the other hand dynamic eutrophication models require more input parameters compared to static models and they show the variations with time while the latter is bound within certain time span a dynamic model generally consists of ordinary or partial differential equations and describes the dynamic mass balance of nutrients in aquatic ecosystem since nutrient fluxes into a waterbody are not constant but vary with time a dynamic model may predict the nutrient concentration more accurately as shown in fig 1 bryhn 2008 however many of the driving variables in dynamic modeling may come with certain uncertainty whose variations and knowledge are generally very poor jensen et al 2006 so getting rid of such uncertainty is a major challenge in dynamic modeling most of the eutrophication models in the early development stage were static types but rapid development in dynamic modeling has been observed in the recent times as these models can give a deeper insight into the eutrophication mechanism with higher predictive power 4 2 early development stage the first eutrophication model was given by vollenweider in 1968 as discussed earlier development of ecological modeling in the succeeding period was based on the scientific insight of this work the work of sakamoto 1966 where the relation of nutrients and chlorophyll a was first established by conducting study in some japanese lakes were used with data of north american lakes by dillon and rigler 1974 to form a statistical model between tp and chlorophyll a in this model correlation coefficient r 2 was 0 95 another model gained popularity in eutrophication control is the oecd model which is an empirical modification of the vollenweider model this model was tested for 87 lakes with varying values of tp concentration and retention time and results yielded correlation coefficient r 2 value as 0 86 many other similar static load models were presented thereafter by kirchner and dillon 1975 larsen and mercier 1976 jones and bachmann 1976 nicholls and dillon 1978 ostrofsky 1978 chapra and reckhow 1979 nurnberg 1984 ahlgren et al 1988 etc all these static models were designed in more or less similar fashion it is considered that the lake is a completely mixed steady state reactor and one or few simple equations were employed to calculate the outflow load of nutrients mainly p with outflow water and the quantity of load retained in sediments the input variables considered in these models are nutrient influx tp concentration water retention time and occasionally water mean depth general output variables are tp in the lake water and tp retention these models are very simple as the input variable for any lake can be measured and by using simple empirical relationships output variable may be found out nutrient concentration in inflow water can be measured directly and by conducting morphometric study mean depth of water and water retention time can be found out for example canfield and bachmann 1981 adopted following empirical equations to predict mean annual tp concentration in lake water t p 0 8 l d m 0 0942 l d m 0 422 k t t p 0 49 l d m 0 0926 l d m 0 510 k t t p 0 603 l d m 0 257 k t where tp is annual mean lake tp concentration in mg m3 l is area tp load in mg m2 year d m is mean water depth kt is lake water retention or sedimentation rate in year 1 due to their simplicity static models gained popularity and frequently used in practical lake mitigation and control plans but these models do not account for factors such as internal nutrient loading from the sediments bioavailable nutrient concentration seasonal variation of nutrient flux etc which lead to uncertainty in predicting nutrient concentration for individual lakes håkanson 1999 especially its nutrient predictive efficiency will seriously hamper in case of recovering lakes having internal nutrient loading where the lakes are not at all in steady state jensen et al 2006 these factors prompt the development and popularity of dynamic models in the recent times and are found to have better accuracy over the static ones 4 3 recent developments in modeling approach from the late 90s to till date ecological modeling has developed tremendously now it has become possible to find a eutrophication model suitable for any kind of lake with better predictive capacity but still new lake models are developing day by day having wider and complex domain for better restoration policy making now a day the dynamic models are quite advanced and tend to consider various aspects of the problem by coupling ecological and hydrodynamic processes adaptation and alteration in species composition in a waterbody etc jørgensen 2010 fig 2 illustrates a typical dynamic eutrophication model with different variables and processes jørgensen 1999 models such as pclake aldenberg et al 1995 janse 2005 lake mab håkanson 2000 håkanson and boulion 2002 leeds håkanson and carlsson 1998 håkanson 1999a b malmaeus and håkanson 2004 etc developed in the late 90s gained popularity and modifications were implemented in the later phases are well documented in the literature hence not repeated in this paper in the present paper a general overview of the new techniques and factors that are being considered in ecological modeling in recent times are discussed as presented below under different sub headings 4 3 1 suspended particulate matter spm malmaeus and håkanson 2003 have given a dynamic model for prediction of suspended particulate matter spm in lake water various pathways of spm have been considered such as tributary inflow indigenous production sedimentation transportation erosion re suspension mixing etc the model has been tested against empirical data set of several european lakes and it was seen that it had close agreement with the empirical data set all the easily accessible variables such as lake area mean depth nutrient inflow and climatic factors had been considered for model input variables from the model uncertainty and sensitivity analysis it was concluded that quantifying allochthonous and autochthonous spm generation were quite uncertain to predict compared to internal processes like sedimentation and mineralization 4 3 2 integration of sophisticated mathematical approaches in ecological modeling yadav et al 2017 have used satellite remote sensing a landsat 8 image to develop a model for shallow eutrophic lake biwa in japan the model was used to evaluate the submerged aquatic vegetation sav coverage area and its biomass for the peak growth period algorithm based on the linear regression approach r 2 0 77 was used to determine the water clarity for the period 2013 2016 which was later used for sav classification and biomass estimation it was found that water clarity is very much essential for the sav detection and biomass estimation using satellite remote sensing in shallow eutrophic lakes and the results demonstrates the successful application of satellite based approach for sav biomass estimation in shallow eutrophic lakes yan et al 2017 have proposed a rough set and multidimensional cloud model rsmcm for prediction of trophic status and nutrient status value of water bodies this model was applied to 24 major lakes and the results were very much consistent and give more accuracy compared to other models 4 3 3 hysteresis response of vegetation and water quality zhang et al 2003a b have developed a structurally dynamic model for lake mogan to show the hysteresis response of vegetation and water quality with increases phosphate concentration the model had in total nine state variables including p in phytoplankton zooplankton the sediment the pore water in the sediment the submerged plants epiphytes the detritus soluble reactive phosphate po4 2 and planktivorous fish in the lake it was found that in between tp concentration 0 16 and 0 25mg l water state changes from fresh to turbid bringing in significant changes in submerged plants the model was able to predict the shifts from submerged vegetation to phytoplankton at about 0 25mg l p concentration and again from phytoplankton at about 0 10mg l p concentration which similar to the observations by scheffer et al 2001 through the model results it was concluded that restoration of shallow lakes is much slower than eutrophication rate and above the threshold concentration of p i e 0 25mg l restoration of submerged plants may not be feasible 4 3 4 multi variable models arhonditsis and brett 2005a b had proposed a complex multi elemental model for restoration of lake washington usa the model takes into account multiple nutrient cycles c n p si o different phytoplankton and zooplankton diversities the model provided a good fit between simulated and observed monthly values with relative error below 20 for major water quality parameters like tp tn do phytoplankton etc the model could successfully simulate the loading scenario of 1962 when the lake received maximum treated sewage effluent and predicted the phytoplankton response nitrogen and phosphorus cycles accurately zhao et al 2008 have proposed consideration of wide range of variables for improvement of eutrophication models they suggested use of multiple nutrients cycles p n si c and o functional groups of phytoplankton diatoms green algae and cyanobacteria and inclusion of two zooplankton groups copepods and cladocerans into account their model results suggest that use of recent advances in stoichiometric nutrient recycling theory is beneficial in examination of the food quality their results indicate significant model improvement but parameterization particularly of the zooplankton processes should be reliable and robust mukherjee et al 2008 have developed a model for analysis of the carbon cycle in a simulated pond for assessment of cultural eutrophication the major processes studied were photosynthesis respiration and decomposition that play an important part in balancing the nutrient content of the system and maintain a dynamic equilibrium in eutrophication models the carbon cycle is usually not considered in detail but this model study shows that the nutrients processes are dependent on proper and detailed description of the carbon cycle insights of this work may have great application in development of eutrophication models perhar et al 2013 have given a zooplankton submodel to study the behavior of zooplankton physiology and behavior by enhancing an existing eutrophication model of arhonditsis and brett 2005a b the model simulates the interplay of n p and highly unsaturated fatty acids hufa through the grazer s digestive tracks the model provided a good epilimnetic and hypolimnetic patterns in lake washington usa 4 3 5 biomanipulation another model was given by gurkan et al 2006 for lake fure in denmark considering three prognosis scenarios for forecasting the restoration effects the model was validated by taking two years data and it was reported that the combined effect of aeration of sediment and biomanipulation by removing the trash fish was more successful for reduction of phytoplankton and tp in the lake compared to individual application of processes however the model had some limitation as the data used were having lower confidence which resulted in large deviations in the validation simulations for zooplankton the peak values of cyanobacteria and the timing of phytoplankton zooplankton and cyanobacteria in the calibration and validation simulations in a study carried out by ofir et al 2017 a food web modeling approach have been used to predict the impact of lake biomanipulation on water quality by taking lake kinneret as a case study in this study a time dynamic model ecosim has been used which is based on ecopath model to study lake s food web ofir et al 2016 the model was used to see the effect of the long term biomanipulation program implemented in the lake from 1996 to 2012 the model includes total 26 groups considering different groups of phytoplankton zooplankton and fish species to represent important components of lake foodweb the simulation results revealed that the biomanipulation program applied in the lake failed to improve the water quality rather it deteriorates the water quality with increase in phytoplankton growth 4 3 6 seasonal variation of nutrient budget and foodweb interactions jensen et al 2006 have developed an empirical model for seasonal fluctuation of tp concentration to external loading in 16 shallow eutrophic lakes in denmark based on 7 8 years mass balance data the model was intended to describe the early recovery phase where external loading is low compared to internal loading model results revealed that estimated mean tp concentration deviated 12 on average compared to the observed values and closely resembled the seasonal dynamics following the external loading reduction however the model was not able to describe the seasonal variations during the shift from turbid to clear water state håkanson and boulion 2002 have developed a model named lake foodweb to quantify all lake foodweb interactions where a sub model lakemab was first presented for tp which is a process based mass balance model thereafter this model has been modified by håkanson and bryhn 2008 for tp applicable to all types of lakes this model is based on ordinary differential equations and mass balance of inflow outflow and internal fluxes model was tested for different 41 numbers of lakes and it was found that that model could successfully predict the tp concentrations in water moreover it can give additional information regarding tp in sediments sedimentation temporal changes surface and deep water volumes etc not only in surface water level but also in deep water level and sediment level zhang et al 2008 has given a two dimensional eutrophication model of lake erie by considering coupling between hydrodynamics and the food web of lower trophic levels this fine scale dynamic model considers air temperature wind conditions and inputs from atmosphere and tributaries this study also considered detailed zooplankton model and how to include impact of zebra and quagga mussels the model has 18 state variables and was acceptably validated results indicated that dreissenid mussels have weak direct grazing impacts on algal biomass but indirect effects of their nutrient excretion have a greater impact on the ecosystem seasonal variation of phytoplankton and nutrient budget in bizerte lagoon tunisia was reproduced in a 3 d coupled biogeochemical model béjaoui et al 2017 model simulation results showed that plankton production is highest in the inner part of the waterbody due to high water retention time and contribution of nutrients from boundary both n and p loading contribute to the production of plankton intensive use of fertilizers in the catchment and contribution of mediterranean sea to the lagoon have impact on the increased plankton growth several other authors have presented three dimensional models to simulate hydrodynamics and nutrient cycling in shallow lakes which are effective in forecasting water quality and algal growth jin et al 2007 li et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 page et al 2017 have conducted a study on the windermere bassenthwaite lake and esthwaite water in north west england they have used model protech elliott et al 2009 elliott 2010 2012 for process representation of algal community using high frequency in lake observations for real time forecasting of algal bloom the model s uncertainty and sensitivity were tested within the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation framework which includes pre defined limits of acceptability for simulations from the model simulations it was observed that differences between underwater light in real lake systems studied and model s representation and the uncertainties associated with nutrient fluxes are of great challenge while forecasting algal bloom li kun et al 2017 have developed a 2 dimensional uncertainty eutrophication model for urban lakes in china the model could simulate the interactions between nutrients phytoplankton and zooplankton and also seasonal and regional water quality changes can be described comparison between model simulation and field data revealed that the model could calculate the hydrodynamic data and eutrophication dynamics reasonably with relative error less than 11 the results showed that the concentration of nitrate phosphate ammonia and chlorophyll a at the vicinity of lake was higher than at the middle indicating that rainwater runoff had a major impact on the algal bloom which needs to be taken care 4 3 7 life cycle of cyanobacteria hense and beckmann 2006 have modeled the life stages of cyanobacteria considering four life stages the investigation indicates that for better prediction of cyanobacterial blooms knowledge of all stages of the life cycle has to be made and it is not sufficient only to consider temperature and p n ratio into account the model study improved the understanding of harmful cyanobacteria bloom and its prediction as it is the major part governing eutrophication mitigation and control 4 3 8 mathematical models to predict dissolved oxygen concentration mishra 2007 has proposed a model for ecosystem dynamics in an eutrophied waterbody by considering concentration of nutrients densities of algal population zooplankton population detritus and the concentration of dissolved oxygen as the variables here the nutrient input was considered from water runoff from agricultural fields unlike the work of voinov and tonkikh 1987 where they have considered detritus as only nutrient source and not any other external the model analysis successfully simulated the eutrophication process and was able to draw relationship between the variables considered results showed that as the supply of nutrients increases the densities of algae and other aquatic species increases a decrease in the concentration of dissolved oxygen is observed when the density of detritus increases shukla et al 2008 gave a mathematical model for an eutrophied waterbody affected by organic pollutants the cumulative concentration of organic pollutants the densities of bacteria nutrients algae detritus and the concentration of do are the variables considered for the model model analysis revealed that the simultaneous effect of both water pollution and eutrophication decreases the do level at a higher rate compared to presence of only one phenomenon alvarez vázquez et al 2009 presented a mathematical model simulating the interactions of nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton organic detritus and dissolved oxygen into the eutrophication processes for the observed five variables unique solution has been achieved for eutrophication with non smooth coefficients 4 3 9 climate change reid and crout 2008 have developed a thermodynamic model of freshwater crooked lake in antarctica from the model simulations it was observed that freshwater lake ice is affected more by air temperature than any other variable and so can serve as a useful indicator of climate changes the model could successfully reproduce earlier data with r 2 value 0 89 and can be used to follow the climate changes and compare different climate change scenarios the impact of global warming on lake water temperature have been addressed by yamashiki et al 2010 sensitivity analysis for climate change scenario on lake water temperature was done by integrating mri gcm with 20km outputs and biwa 3d model for lake biwa in japan a significant temperature increase in surface water during summer have been projected for the very hot year determined form mri gcm output for the year 2099 compared to the temperature in 2002 model results also revealed that the thickness of epilimnion also increases for very hot year owing to higher atmospheric temperature and the accumulated heat in the hypolimnion may result in severe degradation of lake ecosystem 4 3 10 integration of hydrodynamics and ecological processes fragoso et al 2008 have developed a 2 dimensional model that to describe the spatial heterogeneity in a large shallow subtropical lake in brazil the model had three modules hydrodynamic module nutrient module and biological module to describe phytoplankton growth the model depicts the advantages that can be achieved by coupling of the hydrodynamic and ecological components in lake modeling the model was able to identify zones with a higher potential for eutrophication so can be very beneficial tool for eutrophication control to predict trophic status of subtropical lakes and estuaries the hydrodynamic model hydrax oppermann 2010 and the water quality model qsim kirchesch and schöl 1999 were used by lindim et al 2015 to study the effect of nutrient reduction n and p to lake restoration in a german shallow lake the simulation results reveal that for a successful water quality control both internal and external p load should be reduced combined reduction of both n and p was not found to be beneficial as compared with only p whereas reduction of only external n load was not found to have significant impact on ecosystem it has been reported that p loading of only 400g may lead to production of 350 tons of algal bloom sharma 1998 these findings are also in agreement with the findings of wang and wang 2009 from the long term studies in 40 yangtze lakes and the lakes of north america it was generalized that n abatement may not decrease the phytoplankton as it can stimulate nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria and p is the key factor governing total phytoplankton biomass however effect of climate nitrogen and other factors should also be considered for proper lake management program watson et al 2016 rucinski et al 2016 have given a model for forecasting of ecosystem response to altered phosphate loading to lake erie the 1 dimensional model was a linked hydrodynamic and eutrophication model and calibrated with 19 years of observations of the lake in the central basin the results demonstrate that hypoxia can be reduced by controlling nutrient loading however variations will be observed depending on the climate and meteorological conditions the model was quite effective in setting phosphorus loading targets to meet the water quality standards of the great lakes a mass balance model was given by chapra et al 2016 to simulate tp concentrations for lower great lakes based on measured and estimated tp loading in time series for managing long term water quality the model results showed that loading control on lake erie would have measurable effect on offshore phosphate concentration of the lower great lakes 5 discussion and conclusion it is quite evident that dynamic modeling has undergone tremendous refinement in recent times and several new processes have been tested and the results obtained are very much consistent to be used as a predictive tool for lake eutrophication control specially in cases where adaptation and species composition plays a crucial role in the ecosystem coupling of ecological models hydrodynamic models and watershed models are continuously getting evolved factors such as effect of different phytoplankton and zooplankton diversity mussels and biomanipulation studies on eutrophication dynamics have been given more attention use of advanced uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques application of artificial intelligence and remote sensing etc are gaining popularity in lake modeling in recent times impact of climatic factors and effect of global warming on eutrophication dynamics are also gaining popularity in modeling context general developments in recent modeling compared to the earlier ones can be summarized as below i incorporation of multiple nutrient cycles p n c si o gives better insight of the eutrophication mechanism arhonditsis and brett 2005a b zhao et al 2008 ii effect of different phytoplankton and zooplankton diversity zebra and quagga mussels in eutrophication modeling have been tested zhang et al 2008 iii response of aquatic vegetation different phytoplankton and zooplankton and fish species and their alteration and adaptation with respect to nutrient loading in different trophic condition have been checked yadav et al 2017 zhang et al 2003a b iv cyanobacterial bloom often considered as major threat to lake ecosystem has been given special attention in many ecosystem models hense and beckmann 2006 v advances in stoichiometric nutrient recycling theory has been applied in some eutrophication models which helps in examination of the food quality zhao et al 2008 vi eutrophication control through biomanipulation has been paid attention gurkan et al 2006 ofir et al 2017 vii use of 3 dimensional models coupling hydrodynamic models watershed models and lake models are gaining popularity in recent times in terms of better predictive capacity and understanding of the in depth mechanism fragoso et al 2008 lindim et al 2015 rucinski et al 2016 béjaoui et al 2017 viii incorporation of advanced methods of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis like generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation framework have resulted in better accuracy of the models with lesser relative error in simulations page et al 2017 ix seasonal variation of nutrient loading sediment transport and nutrient release suspended particulate matter climatic and temporal variations have been paid attention jensen et al 2006 malmaeus and håkanson 2003 reid and crout 2008 yamashiki et al 2010 x advanced tools like remote sensing rough set and multidimensional cloud model etc have been applied in ecological modeling yadav et al 2017 yan et al 2017 with the advancement of ecosystem modeling it becomes feasible for the government bodies and policy makers to make proper lake control and restoration programs lake restoration done in recent times in some of the lakes like lake washington lake erie etc has been possible mainly due to lake modeling approaches also drawbacks of already implemented programs and their remediation has been possible with the help of modeling studies like the case of lake kinneret recent dynamic models are very useful tool for getting answers to problems such as how trophic state of a lake is going to change if certain amount of nutrient loading is reduced for a certain time period it can be also beneficial for ascertaining sedimentation rate sediment removal time require to regain original natural stage etc however selection of the variable in the model and their validation in different lake condition plays the crucial part for successful prediction of lake eutrophication dynamics in an overall conclusion from the review of eutrophication dynamics and recent advances in ecological modeling to mitigate eutrophication we can summarize that in the last two three decades many freshwater lakes turned into highly eutrophied waterbodies bringing changes in water quality and affecting its natural habitat anthropogenic activities are the major cause of rapid nutrient loadings into most of the water bodies compared with the natural sources such as sediment transportation erosion of parent rock etc with the development of ecological modeling prediction and eutrophication control of lakes now has become easier than before however refinements are still going on owing to the ever increased complexity and lake specific problems that require wider experience and more details conflict of interest none

1142,lake eutrophication is one of the major ecological concerns over the world in recent times most of the freshwater lakes and wetlands are facing the problem of water quality deterioration and ecological imbalance due to the increasing anthropogenic activities particularly in developing countries the understanding of the mechanism and identification of the sources of eutrophication will be beneficial to mitigate the problem through proper management policy mechanism and effects of eutrophication described within various case studies all over the world and the evolution of modelling approaches for their mitigation has been reviewed in this paper with the advancement of ecosystem modeling it has become feasible for the governmental bodies and policy makers to propose better lake control schemes and restoration programs through their better predictive capacity while prediction and control of eutrophication of lakes now has become easier than before refinements are still going on owing to the ever increased complexity and lake specific problems that require wider experience and more details the current status of knowledge about lake eutrophication and advances in ecological and hydrodynamic modeling will be of great use for future research prospects keywords algal bloom cyanobacteria eutrophication static models dynamic models 1 introduction eutrophication is one of the most challenging environmental problems that the surface water bodies are facing in present time smith and schindler 2009 li kun et al 2017 eutrophication is an ecological process similar to aging in which a water body is increasingly enriched with essential nutrients of the aquatic plants rast and thornton 1996 which results in increase of the primary productivity i e rate of photosynthesis of the aquatic ecosystem qin et al 2013 the most common signs of eutrophication in lakes and rivers involve heavy algal blooms resulting in high turbidity and anoxic conditions in the deeper parts of the waterbody due to the decay of detritus which leads to fish kills oecd 1982 schindler et al 2008 wang and wang 2009 eutrophication may lead to severe health hazards to human and animals through various pathways it is a major health threat if drinking water is collected from an eutrophied waterbody eutrophication also results in serious ecological problems as well as have impact on the esthetic view and economy in general lake eutrophication phenomenon can be classified into two categories natural and cultural natural eutrophication process takes place very slowly in geological time but can be greatly accelerated by anthropogenic activities which is generally referred to as man made or cultural eutrophication rast and thornton 1996 khan and ansari 2005 serrano et al 2017 increases in populations environmental pollution in various forms intensification of land use and application of nutrients as agricultural fertilizers in the developed countries from the 1940s onwards chloupek et al 2004 and use of phosphate compounds in laundry detergents from the 1950s kroes 1980 have accelerated cultural eutrophication of water bodies all over the world in the middle of twentieth century eutrophication was recognized as a water pollution problem in many western european and north american lakes and reservoirs rohde 1969 thereafter it has become more widespread especially in some regions it has caused deterioration in the aquatic environment and serious problems for water use particularly in drinking water treatment it is generally accepted that excessive nutrient input mainly nitrogen n and phosphorus p are the key factors accelerating the process of eutophication in aquatic ecosystems vollenweider 1968 hecky and kilham 1988 lowery 1998 smith 1998 gurkan et al 2006 because nutrients can come from different point and non point sources comprehensive strategies are required to mitigate or reverse eutrophication carpenter et al 1998 smith et al 1999 earlier studies revealed that eutrophication can be managed by limiting the nutrient input n or p to the waterbody schindler 2006 however proper knowledge of physical chemical and biological processes that occur in the waterbody during eutrophication process gives better restoration success lewtas et al 2015 with the advent of mathematical modeling approach to encounter eutrophication problem after the work of vollenweider 1968 schindler 1977 dillon and rigler 1974 etc few decades back new dimension has been achieved in lake restoration programs as these models can give a better insight to the problem and very much accurate in terms of its predictive power bryhn and hakanson 2007 in this paper an attempt has been made to review various lake eutrophication cases all over the world and recent advances in ecological modeling for lake restoration and eutrophication control programs the development of ecological modeling from the late 80s different model types various factors and processes considered in modeling context especially the recent ones has been addressed in this paper which may be useful to encounter new research challenges 2 eutrophication mechanism and assessment nitrogen n and phosphorus p are the key elements for the algae bacteria protozoa and other aquatic organisms that compose the freshwater ecosystem but excessive inflow of these elements may result in eutrophication of water bodies to minimize the organic pollution of water general practice is to reduce the biochemical oxygen demand bod level of household and industrial wastewaters which positively correlates with organic pollution higher concentration of nitrogen and phosphorous in the public water areas may cause negative ecological consequences on aquatic ecosystem structures processes and functions result in fast growth of phytoplankton and deteriorate water quality especially in the summer application of fertilizers and chemicals to crops and their subsequent runoff to the nearby waterbodies may also cause nutrient enrichment runoff especially from urban and agricultural areas carries fertilizers pesticides sediment and or industrial effluent that accelerate eutrophication when discharged into a waterbody smith et al 1999 surface waters may host increased growth of algae or cyanobacteria wherever conditions of temperature light and nutrient status are conducive when such propagation is dominated by a single or a few species the phenomenon is referred to as an algal or cyanobacterial bloom chorus and bartram 1999 eutrophication is a process of nutrient enrichment and is used to characterize the state of aquatic ecosystems the trophic status of the waterbody is used as a description of the waterbody for this purpose to understand the nutrient status of a waterbody the terms oligotrophic mesotrophic eutrophic and hypertrophic are normally used walmsley 2000 oligotrophic is the state of low in nutrient concentration and not productive in terms of aquatic animal and plant life these lakes have very little algal production and suitable for drinking purpose mesotrophic is an intermediate level of nutrients fairly productive in terms of aquatic animal and plant life and showing the initiation of signs of water quality problems eutrophic is the state where waterbody is rich in nutrient concentration very productive in terms of aquatic animal and plant life and shows increasing signs of water quality problems due to the increased algal load water becomes less transparent hypertrophic is the state where excessive nutrient concentrations prevail and plant growth may be determined by physical factors water quality problems are serious and almost continuous water becomes less transparent and aquatic life ceases at lower depths due to loss in dissolved oxygen content to assess the trophic status of a waterbody there is no perfect or fixed evaluation criteria however to assess the trophic stage or eutrophication the general parameters adopted were total nutrient concentration n and p algal chlorophyll water transparency and dissolved oxygen concentration etc although there are numbers of assessment parameters for simplicity it is convenient to associate the trophic status in terms of nutrient concentration as this is the key factor controlling the process yang et al 2008 general guideline for the nutrient concentrations representing different trophic status of a waterbody are summarized in table 1 it was reported by yang et al 2008 that as the total phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations exceed 20μg l and 300μg l respectively this initiates the concern of eutrophication richardson et al 2007 have considered a threshold concentration of total phosphorus at 12 15μg l which creates ecological imbalance of algal macrophytes and other aquatic organisms apart from the mentioned indicators to assess water eutrophication some other parameters also have been developed in recent times cheng and li 2006 have defined total nutrient status index tni as a parameter to measure the trophic state of a waterbody tni is a parameter which relates all other parameters concerned viz total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp chlorophyll a dissolved oxygen do chemical oxygen demand cod and biological oxygen demand bod of water yang et al 2008 have recommended the use of biological indicators for monitoring aquatic ecosystem health as eutrophication results in degradation of the same biological indicators may include aspects considering structural and functional mechanisms structural aspect such as phytoplankton cell size and biomass zooplankton size and biomass phytoplankton to zooplankton ratio etc can be considered functional indicators can be resource use efficiency production to respiration ratio etc according to the widely accepted definition eutrophication is the process by which water ecosystems become enriched in dissolved nutrients mainly phosphates and nitrates this means that the cause of eutrophication is always the excess of biogenic substances however the effect of eutrophication may be deterioration of water quality and blooms of algae and cyanobacteria for these effects to occur the conditions that favor them are necessary like high concentration of tn and tp favorable temperature and environmental conditions slow current velocity and microbial activity and biodiversity in the waterbody li and liao 2002 3 case studies according to the survey of international lake environment committee ilec 1988 1993 in the asia pacific region 54 of lakes are eutrophic the proportions for europe africa north america and south america are 53 28 48 and 41 respectively tremendous increase in human population in the last century have converted eutrophication from local issue to a global concern wassmann and olli 2005 so limnological studies on lakes rivers and streams have been emphasized in recent times due to degradation of water quality due to eutrophication saxena et al 1988 lake erie one of the largest of the great lakes in north america is a best example of eutrophication due to manmade problems the lake 388km long and 92km wide has a maximum depth of 64m and an average depth of 19m since the lake is shallow and warm and it is highly rich in nutrients the lake is biologically the most productive reutter 1989 nutrient enrichment mainly with phosphorus in the lake has resulted in huge blooms of floating blue green algae and the attached green algae the blooms resulted in lesser light penetration in the lake which reduced the photosynthesis and oxygen production by other phytoplankton groups further depletion in the dissolved oxygen was observed as the bloomed algae died reutter 1989 it was observed all forms of phosphorus entering lake erie were not biologically available to phytoplanktons the reduction of bioavailable or soluble phosphorus is more important than reducing total phosphorus tp input to control nutrient overloading welch and cronke 1987 a summary of different cases of eutrophication in major lakes in different parts of the world are summarized in table 2 along with the major causes for eutrophication in the particular lake for most of the cases presented here it has been observed that the major cause of lake eutrophication are human induced ones and so it is the cultural eutrophication which needs to be given utmost attention it is evident that cultural eutrophication cases are ever increasing in all parts of the world in china water eutrophication has been reported in 67 lakes which is about 51 2 of the total number of lakes according to yang et al 2008 approximately 30 billion ton of polluted water would be discharged directly into the lakes therefore by 2030 all the urban lakes and most of the medium sized lakes at the urban rural fringe areas in china may be facing the problem of water eutrophication in india majority of lakes and urban water bodies are also facing the problem of water quality deterioration and decrease in water volume because of rapid urbanization and industrialization in the beginning of 1960s bangalore city had 262 lakes now only 10 hold water similarly in 2001 137 lakes were listed in ahmedabad city and over 65 were reported being already built over excreta matters 2012 there are other examples in india that shows such devastating state of urban water bodies and degradation of water quality garg et al 2002 have conducted a study on three lakes of bhopal viz upper lake lower lake and mansarovar lake in india the potential fertility of lake waters and aquatic flora was examined and it was reported that the highest level of eutrophication was found in mansarovar lake lake mirik in the darjeeling was studied for its hydro biological properties and it was demonstrated that in various portions of the lake nutrient concentration had been very high and potable water quality had been spoiled jha and barat 2003 other cases of lake eutrophication have been reported to fatheh sagar lake in udaipur sagar lake in madhya pradesh pathak and pathak 2012 the reasons for deterioration of water quality for all the cases primarily being high nutrient enrichment through anthropogenic activities 4 eutrophication control and modeling approach for a successful lake restoration and eutrophication mitigation plan the basic aim is to identify the sources of pollution and their subsequent remediation prevention of domestic and industrial wastewater disposal into the water bodies removal of nutrients in wastewater treatment level were used successfully for lake restoration in 1960s in some of the lakes in 1936 lake monona in usa was successfully restored by diverting the sewage to another lake and algal bloom reduced noticeably edmondson 1969 but it was quite obvious that this measure just shifted the problem to the other lake in a joint effort between us and canada in 1972 lake restoration had been implemented to lake erie which mainly focused on reducing the domestic and industrial input to the lake and it was reported that phosphorus loads from municipal discharges reduced by 84 in 1985 makarewicz and bertram 1991 however presence of other species such as microcystis anabaena aphanizomenon etc were observed thereafter and other factors such as increased agricultural runoff climatic factors etc continued to alter the natural ecosystem balance of the great lakes kane et al 2009 hecky et al 2004 similarly water quality improvement in lake washington has been reported by edmondson 1969 by nutrient removal in waste water treatment plants however more detailed and scientific insight to tackle eutrophication came after the work of vollenweider 1968 1976 where algorithms were provided to calculate nutrient retention in lakes he gave the concept of permissible levels of total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp by considering the volume of the waterbody where high volume of nutrient loading is permissible for larger lakes other parameters such as internal phosphorus loading from sediments water retention time gaseous nitrogen fixation etc and their role also has been considered in this work another major scientific knowledge on eutrophication mitigation was obtained from the work of schindler 1977 schindler 1977 conducted study on three experimental lakes in canada for several years and observed that algal biomass is dependent on tp concentration and not on tn as the short term n deficits are compensated by cyanobacterial fixation of atmospheric n in due course of time therefore it was concluded that it is the tp and not the tn that need to be removed in order to prevent eutrophication but generality of this concept has been disputed in the later phase by other researchers elser et al 1990 bergström et al 2005 where mainly n was found responsible for lake eutrophication and considerably low n fixation rate has been observed though the debate was centered mainly on n and p some other micronutrients such as iron sulphate silicon molybdenum and organic micronutrients e g vitamins were also paid attention by rast and thornton 1996 but these components were found to be of more importance in case of marine ecosystem riley and chester 1971 provasoli and carlucci 1974 rast and lee 1978 based on these findings several static vollenweider type models have been developed in the succeeding period which were more or less accurate in terms of its predictive power and were site specific however with the development of dynamic time dependent models in recent times it has been possible to apply them with better accuracy and also has wide range of limnological domain bryhn and hakanson 2007 development of the above mentioned types of ecological models and their applicability has been discussed in the succeeding section and more emphasis has been given to the recent developments in dynamic modeling for lake eutrophication control 4 1 modeling approaches in general all the ecological models are more or less empirical and mechanistic aldenberg et al 1995 and can be classified as static vollenweider type models and dynamic models bryhn and hakanson 2007 static models consider that lake has received a constant nutrient input for a long time that is based on steady state assumption these models calculate nutrient concentration in lake water from lake specific parameters such as nutrient retention time mean depth of a waterbody water flushing rate apart from nutrient input rate etc and are based on comparative studies it has the advantage that it is suitable for non specialists and are easy to use and can give rough estimation of nutrient concentration on the other hand dynamic eutrophication models require more input parameters compared to static models and they show the variations with time while the latter is bound within certain time span a dynamic model generally consists of ordinary or partial differential equations and describes the dynamic mass balance of nutrients in aquatic ecosystem since nutrient fluxes into a waterbody are not constant but vary with time a dynamic model may predict the nutrient concentration more accurately as shown in fig 1 bryhn 2008 however many of the driving variables in dynamic modeling may come with certain uncertainty whose variations and knowledge are generally very poor jensen et al 2006 so getting rid of such uncertainty is a major challenge in dynamic modeling most of the eutrophication models in the early development stage were static types but rapid development in dynamic modeling has been observed in the recent times as these models can give a deeper insight into the eutrophication mechanism with higher predictive power 4 2 early development stage the first eutrophication model was given by vollenweider in 1968 as discussed earlier development of ecological modeling in the succeeding period was based on the scientific insight of this work the work of sakamoto 1966 where the relation of nutrients and chlorophyll a was first established by conducting study in some japanese lakes were used with data of north american lakes by dillon and rigler 1974 to form a statistical model between tp and chlorophyll a in this model correlation coefficient r 2 was 0 95 another model gained popularity in eutrophication control is the oecd model which is an empirical modification of the vollenweider model this model was tested for 87 lakes with varying values of tp concentration and retention time and results yielded correlation coefficient r 2 value as 0 86 many other similar static load models were presented thereafter by kirchner and dillon 1975 larsen and mercier 1976 jones and bachmann 1976 nicholls and dillon 1978 ostrofsky 1978 chapra and reckhow 1979 nurnberg 1984 ahlgren et al 1988 etc all these static models were designed in more or less similar fashion it is considered that the lake is a completely mixed steady state reactor and one or few simple equations were employed to calculate the outflow load of nutrients mainly p with outflow water and the quantity of load retained in sediments the input variables considered in these models are nutrient influx tp concentration water retention time and occasionally water mean depth general output variables are tp in the lake water and tp retention these models are very simple as the input variable for any lake can be measured and by using simple empirical relationships output variable may be found out nutrient concentration in inflow water can be measured directly and by conducting morphometric study mean depth of water and water retention time can be found out for example canfield and bachmann 1981 adopted following empirical equations to predict mean annual tp concentration in lake water t p 0 8 l d m 0 0942 l d m 0 422 k t t p 0 49 l d m 0 0926 l d m 0 510 k t t p 0 603 l d m 0 257 k t where tp is annual mean lake tp concentration in mg m3 l is area tp load in mg m2 year d m is mean water depth kt is lake water retention or sedimentation rate in year 1 due to their simplicity static models gained popularity and frequently used in practical lake mitigation and control plans but these models do not account for factors such as internal nutrient loading from the sediments bioavailable nutrient concentration seasonal variation of nutrient flux etc which lead to uncertainty in predicting nutrient concentration for individual lakes håkanson 1999 especially its nutrient predictive efficiency will seriously hamper in case of recovering lakes having internal nutrient loading where the lakes are not at all in steady state jensen et al 2006 these factors prompt the development and popularity of dynamic models in the recent times and are found to have better accuracy over the static ones 4 3 recent developments in modeling approach from the late 90s to till date ecological modeling has developed tremendously now it has become possible to find a eutrophication model suitable for any kind of lake with better predictive capacity but still new lake models are developing day by day having wider and complex domain for better restoration policy making now a day the dynamic models are quite advanced and tend to consider various aspects of the problem by coupling ecological and hydrodynamic processes adaptation and alteration in species composition in a waterbody etc jørgensen 2010 fig 2 illustrates a typical dynamic eutrophication model with different variables and processes jørgensen 1999 models such as pclake aldenberg et al 1995 janse 2005 lake mab håkanson 2000 håkanson and boulion 2002 leeds håkanson and carlsson 1998 håkanson 1999a b malmaeus and håkanson 2004 etc developed in the late 90s gained popularity and modifications were implemented in the later phases are well documented in the literature hence not repeated in this paper in the present paper a general overview of the new techniques and factors that are being considered in ecological modeling in recent times are discussed as presented below under different sub headings 4 3 1 suspended particulate matter spm malmaeus and håkanson 2003 have given a dynamic model for prediction of suspended particulate matter spm in lake water various pathways of spm have been considered such as tributary inflow indigenous production sedimentation transportation erosion re suspension mixing etc the model has been tested against empirical data set of several european lakes and it was seen that it had close agreement with the empirical data set all the easily accessible variables such as lake area mean depth nutrient inflow and climatic factors had been considered for model input variables from the model uncertainty and sensitivity analysis it was concluded that quantifying allochthonous and autochthonous spm generation were quite uncertain to predict compared to internal processes like sedimentation and mineralization 4 3 2 integration of sophisticated mathematical approaches in ecological modeling yadav et al 2017 have used satellite remote sensing a landsat 8 image to develop a model for shallow eutrophic lake biwa in japan the model was used to evaluate the submerged aquatic vegetation sav coverage area and its biomass for the peak growth period algorithm based on the linear regression approach r 2 0 77 was used to determine the water clarity for the period 2013 2016 which was later used for sav classification and biomass estimation it was found that water clarity is very much essential for the sav detection and biomass estimation using satellite remote sensing in shallow eutrophic lakes and the results demonstrates the successful application of satellite based approach for sav biomass estimation in shallow eutrophic lakes yan et al 2017 have proposed a rough set and multidimensional cloud model rsmcm for prediction of trophic status and nutrient status value of water bodies this model was applied to 24 major lakes and the results were very much consistent and give more accuracy compared to other models 4 3 3 hysteresis response of vegetation and water quality zhang et al 2003a b have developed a structurally dynamic model for lake mogan to show the hysteresis response of vegetation and water quality with increases phosphate concentration the model had in total nine state variables including p in phytoplankton zooplankton the sediment the pore water in the sediment the submerged plants epiphytes the detritus soluble reactive phosphate po4 2 and planktivorous fish in the lake it was found that in between tp concentration 0 16 and 0 25mg l water state changes from fresh to turbid bringing in significant changes in submerged plants the model was able to predict the shifts from submerged vegetation to phytoplankton at about 0 25mg l p concentration and again from phytoplankton at about 0 10mg l p concentration which similar to the observations by scheffer et al 2001 through the model results it was concluded that restoration of shallow lakes is much slower than eutrophication rate and above the threshold concentration of p i e 0 25mg l restoration of submerged plants may not be feasible 4 3 4 multi variable models arhonditsis and brett 2005a b had proposed a complex multi elemental model for restoration of lake washington usa the model takes into account multiple nutrient cycles c n p si o different phytoplankton and zooplankton diversities the model provided a good fit between simulated and observed monthly values with relative error below 20 for major water quality parameters like tp tn do phytoplankton etc the model could successfully simulate the loading scenario of 1962 when the lake received maximum treated sewage effluent and predicted the phytoplankton response nitrogen and phosphorus cycles accurately zhao et al 2008 have proposed consideration of wide range of variables for improvement of eutrophication models they suggested use of multiple nutrients cycles p n si c and o functional groups of phytoplankton diatoms green algae and cyanobacteria and inclusion of two zooplankton groups copepods and cladocerans into account their model results suggest that use of recent advances in stoichiometric nutrient recycling theory is beneficial in examination of the food quality their results indicate significant model improvement but parameterization particularly of the zooplankton processes should be reliable and robust mukherjee et al 2008 have developed a model for analysis of the carbon cycle in a simulated pond for assessment of cultural eutrophication the major processes studied were photosynthesis respiration and decomposition that play an important part in balancing the nutrient content of the system and maintain a dynamic equilibrium in eutrophication models the carbon cycle is usually not considered in detail but this model study shows that the nutrients processes are dependent on proper and detailed description of the carbon cycle insights of this work may have great application in development of eutrophication models perhar et al 2013 have given a zooplankton submodel to study the behavior of zooplankton physiology and behavior by enhancing an existing eutrophication model of arhonditsis and brett 2005a b the model simulates the interplay of n p and highly unsaturated fatty acids hufa through the grazer s digestive tracks the model provided a good epilimnetic and hypolimnetic patterns in lake washington usa 4 3 5 biomanipulation another model was given by gurkan et al 2006 for lake fure in denmark considering three prognosis scenarios for forecasting the restoration effects the model was validated by taking two years data and it was reported that the combined effect of aeration of sediment and biomanipulation by removing the trash fish was more successful for reduction of phytoplankton and tp in the lake compared to individual application of processes however the model had some limitation as the data used were having lower confidence which resulted in large deviations in the validation simulations for zooplankton the peak values of cyanobacteria and the timing of phytoplankton zooplankton and cyanobacteria in the calibration and validation simulations in a study carried out by ofir et al 2017 a food web modeling approach have been used to predict the impact of lake biomanipulation on water quality by taking lake kinneret as a case study in this study a time dynamic model ecosim has been used which is based on ecopath model to study lake s food web ofir et al 2016 the model was used to see the effect of the long term biomanipulation program implemented in the lake from 1996 to 2012 the model includes total 26 groups considering different groups of phytoplankton zooplankton and fish species to represent important components of lake foodweb the simulation results revealed that the biomanipulation program applied in the lake failed to improve the water quality rather it deteriorates the water quality with increase in phytoplankton growth 4 3 6 seasonal variation of nutrient budget and foodweb interactions jensen et al 2006 have developed an empirical model for seasonal fluctuation of tp concentration to external loading in 16 shallow eutrophic lakes in denmark based on 7 8 years mass balance data the model was intended to describe the early recovery phase where external loading is low compared to internal loading model results revealed that estimated mean tp concentration deviated 12 on average compared to the observed values and closely resembled the seasonal dynamics following the external loading reduction however the model was not able to describe the seasonal variations during the shift from turbid to clear water state håkanson and boulion 2002 have developed a model named lake foodweb to quantify all lake foodweb interactions where a sub model lakemab was first presented for tp which is a process based mass balance model thereafter this model has been modified by håkanson and bryhn 2008 for tp applicable to all types of lakes this model is based on ordinary differential equations and mass balance of inflow outflow and internal fluxes model was tested for different 41 numbers of lakes and it was found that that model could successfully predict the tp concentrations in water moreover it can give additional information regarding tp in sediments sedimentation temporal changes surface and deep water volumes etc not only in surface water level but also in deep water level and sediment level zhang et al 2008 has given a two dimensional eutrophication model of lake erie by considering coupling between hydrodynamics and the food web of lower trophic levels this fine scale dynamic model considers air temperature wind conditions and inputs from atmosphere and tributaries this study also considered detailed zooplankton model and how to include impact of zebra and quagga mussels the model has 18 state variables and was acceptably validated results indicated that dreissenid mussels have weak direct grazing impacts on algal biomass but indirect effects of their nutrient excretion have a greater impact on the ecosystem seasonal variation of phytoplankton and nutrient budget in bizerte lagoon tunisia was reproduced in a 3 d coupled biogeochemical model béjaoui et al 2017 model simulation results showed that plankton production is highest in the inner part of the waterbody due to high water retention time and contribution of nutrients from boundary both n and p loading contribute to the production of plankton intensive use of fertilizers in the catchment and contribution of mediterranean sea to the lagoon have impact on the increased plankton growth several other authors have presented three dimensional models to simulate hydrodynamics and nutrient cycling in shallow lakes which are effective in forecasting water quality and algal growth jin et al 2007 li et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 page et al 2017 have conducted a study on the windermere bassenthwaite lake and esthwaite water in north west england they have used model protech elliott et al 2009 elliott 2010 2012 for process representation of algal community using high frequency in lake observations for real time forecasting of algal bloom the model s uncertainty and sensitivity were tested within the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation framework which includes pre defined limits of acceptability for simulations from the model simulations it was observed that differences between underwater light in real lake systems studied and model s representation and the uncertainties associated with nutrient fluxes are of great challenge while forecasting algal bloom li kun et al 2017 have developed a 2 dimensional uncertainty eutrophication model for urban lakes in china the model could simulate the interactions between nutrients phytoplankton and zooplankton and also seasonal and regional water quality changes can be described comparison between model simulation and field data revealed that the model could calculate the hydrodynamic data and eutrophication dynamics reasonably with relative error less than 11 the results showed that the concentration of nitrate phosphate ammonia and chlorophyll a at the vicinity of lake was higher than at the middle indicating that rainwater runoff had a major impact on the algal bloom which needs to be taken care 4 3 7 life cycle of cyanobacteria hense and beckmann 2006 have modeled the life stages of cyanobacteria considering four life stages the investigation indicates that for better prediction of cyanobacterial blooms knowledge of all stages of the life cycle has to be made and it is not sufficient only to consider temperature and p n ratio into account the model study improved the understanding of harmful cyanobacteria bloom and its prediction as it is the major part governing eutrophication mitigation and control 4 3 8 mathematical models to predict dissolved oxygen concentration mishra 2007 has proposed a model for ecosystem dynamics in an eutrophied waterbody by considering concentration of nutrients densities of algal population zooplankton population detritus and the concentration of dissolved oxygen as the variables here the nutrient input was considered from water runoff from agricultural fields unlike the work of voinov and tonkikh 1987 where they have considered detritus as only nutrient source and not any other external the model analysis successfully simulated the eutrophication process and was able to draw relationship between the variables considered results showed that as the supply of nutrients increases the densities of algae and other aquatic species increases a decrease in the concentration of dissolved oxygen is observed when the density of detritus increases shukla et al 2008 gave a mathematical model for an eutrophied waterbody affected by organic pollutants the cumulative concentration of organic pollutants the densities of bacteria nutrients algae detritus and the concentration of do are the variables considered for the model model analysis revealed that the simultaneous effect of both water pollution and eutrophication decreases the do level at a higher rate compared to presence of only one phenomenon alvarez vázquez et al 2009 presented a mathematical model simulating the interactions of nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton organic detritus and dissolved oxygen into the eutrophication processes for the observed five variables unique solution has been achieved for eutrophication with non smooth coefficients 4 3 9 climate change reid and crout 2008 have developed a thermodynamic model of freshwater crooked lake in antarctica from the model simulations it was observed that freshwater lake ice is affected more by air temperature than any other variable and so can serve as a useful indicator of climate changes the model could successfully reproduce earlier data with r 2 value 0 89 and can be used to follow the climate changes and compare different climate change scenarios the impact of global warming on lake water temperature have been addressed by yamashiki et al 2010 sensitivity analysis for climate change scenario on lake water temperature was done by integrating mri gcm with 20km outputs and biwa 3d model for lake biwa in japan a significant temperature increase in surface water during summer have been projected for the very hot year determined form mri gcm output for the year 2099 compared to the temperature in 2002 model results also revealed that the thickness of epilimnion also increases for very hot year owing to higher atmospheric temperature and the accumulated heat in the hypolimnion may result in severe degradation of lake ecosystem 4 3 10 integration of hydrodynamics and ecological processes fragoso et al 2008 have developed a 2 dimensional model that to describe the spatial heterogeneity in a large shallow subtropical lake in brazil the model had three modules hydrodynamic module nutrient module and biological module to describe phytoplankton growth the model depicts the advantages that can be achieved by coupling of the hydrodynamic and ecological components in lake modeling the model was able to identify zones with a higher potential for eutrophication so can be very beneficial tool for eutrophication control to predict trophic status of subtropical lakes and estuaries the hydrodynamic model hydrax oppermann 2010 and the water quality model qsim kirchesch and schöl 1999 were used by lindim et al 2015 to study the effect of nutrient reduction n and p to lake restoration in a german shallow lake the simulation results reveal that for a successful water quality control both internal and external p load should be reduced combined reduction of both n and p was not found to be beneficial as compared with only p whereas reduction of only external n load was not found to have significant impact on ecosystem it has been reported that p loading of only 400g may lead to production of 350 tons of algal bloom sharma 1998 these findings are also in agreement with the findings of wang and wang 2009 from the long term studies in 40 yangtze lakes and the lakes of north america it was generalized that n abatement may not decrease the phytoplankton as it can stimulate nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria and p is the key factor governing total phytoplankton biomass however effect of climate nitrogen and other factors should also be considered for proper lake management program watson et al 2016 rucinski et al 2016 have given a model for forecasting of ecosystem response to altered phosphate loading to lake erie the 1 dimensional model was a linked hydrodynamic and eutrophication model and calibrated with 19 years of observations of the lake in the central basin the results demonstrate that hypoxia can be reduced by controlling nutrient loading however variations will be observed depending on the climate and meteorological conditions the model was quite effective in setting phosphorus loading targets to meet the water quality standards of the great lakes a mass balance model was given by chapra et al 2016 to simulate tp concentrations for lower great lakes based on measured and estimated tp loading in time series for managing long term water quality the model results showed that loading control on lake erie would have measurable effect on offshore phosphate concentration of the lower great lakes 5 discussion and conclusion it is quite evident that dynamic modeling has undergone tremendous refinement in recent times and several new processes have been tested and the results obtained are very much consistent to be used as a predictive tool for lake eutrophication control specially in cases where adaptation and species composition plays a crucial role in the ecosystem coupling of ecological models hydrodynamic models and watershed models are continuously getting evolved factors such as effect of different phytoplankton and zooplankton diversity mussels and biomanipulation studies on eutrophication dynamics have been given more attention use of advanced uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques application of artificial intelligence and remote sensing etc are gaining popularity in lake modeling in recent times impact of climatic factors and effect of global warming on eutrophication dynamics are also gaining popularity in modeling context general developments in recent modeling compared to the earlier ones can be summarized as below i incorporation of multiple nutrient cycles p n c si o gives better insight of the eutrophication mechanism arhonditsis and brett 2005a b zhao et al 2008 ii effect of different phytoplankton and zooplankton diversity zebra and quagga mussels in eutrophication modeling have been tested zhang et al 2008 iii response of aquatic vegetation different phytoplankton and zooplankton and fish species and their alteration and adaptation with respect to nutrient loading in different trophic condition have been checked yadav et al 2017 zhang et al 2003a b iv cyanobacterial bloom often considered as major threat to lake ecosystem has been given special attention in many ecosystem models hense and beckmann 2006 v advances in stoichiometric nutrient recycling theory has been applied in some eutrophication models which helps in examination of the food quality zhao et al 2008 vi eutrophication control through biomanipulation has been paid attention gurkan et al 2006 ofir et al 2017 vii use of 3 dimensional models coupling hydrodynamic models watershed models and lake models are gaining popularity in recent times in terms of better predictive capacity and understanding of the in depth mechanism fragoso et al 2008 lindim et al 2015 rucinski et al 2016 béjaoui et al 2017 viii incorporation of advanced methods of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis like generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation framework have resulted in better accuracy of the models with lesser relative error in simulations page et al 2017 ix seasonal variation of nutrient loading sediment transport and nutrient release suspended particulate matter climatic and temporal variations have been paid attention jensen et al 2006 malmaeus and håkanson 2003 reid and crout 2008 yamashiki et al 2010 x advanced tools like remote sensing rough set and multidimensional cloud model etc have been applied in ecological modeling yadav et al 2017 yan et al 2017 with the advancement of ecosystem modeling it becomes feasible for the government bodies and policy makers to make proper lake control and restoration programs lake restoration done in recent times in some of the lakes like lake washington lake erie etc has been possible mainly due to lake modeling approaches also drawbacks of already implemented programs and their remediation has been possible with the help of modeling studies like the case of lake kinneret recent dynamic models are very useful tool for getting answers to problems such as how trophic state of a lake is going to change if certain amount of nutrient loading is reduced for a certain time period it can be also beneficial for ascertaining sedimentation rate sediment removal time require to regain original natural stage etc however selection of the variable in the model and their validation in different lake condition plays the crucial part for successful prediction of lake eutrophication dynamics in an overall conclusion from the review of eutrophication dynamics and recent advances in ecological modeling to mitigate eutrophication we can summarize that in the last two three decades many freshwater lakes turned into highly eutrophied waterbodies bringing changes in water quality and affecting its natural habitat anthropogenic activities are the major cause of rapid nutrient loadings into most of the water bodies compared with the natural sources such as sediment transportation erosion of parent rock etc with the development of ecological modeling prediction and eutrophication control of lakes now has become easier than before however refinements are still going on owing to the ever increased complexity and lake specific problems that require wider experience and more details conflict of interest none

1143,the term nature based solutions nbs has now entered the lexicon of natural resource managers yet there is still a lack of clarity regarding what nature based solutions offer to a world pining for sustainability this is shown in sharp relief by the different definitions and positions taken by iucn and among others the european commission although nbs are applicable worldwide the origin of the idea from two european based agencies has given it a strong eurocentric focus recent literature has expanded the focus to a more global one yet in striving for sustainability in today s world with rapid and unpredictable change and real questions on how close we are to crossing planetary boundaries if indeed such boundaries exist we need to resolve what nature we are talking about and what solutions we see it providing there are 10 clear interrelated principles governed by feedbacks between and among them that can be derived from the thinking behind nbs these principles echo those of the ecosystem approach of the convention on biological diversity and can be linked to the whole theoretical and practical base included under the discipline of ecohydrology unesco s work in ecohydrology and biosphere reserves under the international hydrological and man and the biosphere programmes continues to provide practical solutions for global management of water and ecosystems on a rapidly evolving theoretical base to be fully effective nbs must focus on twenty first century environmental problems and what solutions nature can contribute in resolving known known unknown and unknown unknown problems keywords nature based solutions ecosystem approach ecohydrology biosphere reserves ecological infrastructure 1 introduction this paper originates from a keynote delivered at the international symposium on ecohydrology for the circular economy and nature based solutions towards mitigation adaptation to climate change 2017 łódź poland a decade or so ago iucn started to use the term natural solutions as a means of proselytizing for new protected areas and species conservation measures more recently the term nature based solutions nbs has been used by the european commission maes and jacobs 2017 iucn in modifying the use of natural solutions has adopted nature based solutions as well largely to promote nature as providing solutions for climate mitigation and adaptation challenges cohen shacham et al 2016 iucn 2012 yet nbs have a much broader potential than simply a nexus with climate and have now entered the lexicon of natural resource managers in a much broader sense eggermont et al 2015 nbs also can reflect and amplify the multidimensional approach that ecohydrology brings to solving aquatic ecosystem and environmental problems a key issue though is that there is still a lack of clarity regarding just what nature or natural means and what solutions nature offers to develop a more sustainable world the definition used by iucn comes from the nature side the potential power of nature and the solutions it can provide to global challenges in fields such as climate change food security social and economic development healthy diverse and well managed ecosystems lay the foundation for practical solutions to global problems iucn 2012 the european commission has a slightly different formulation emphasizing the socio economic aspects more nature based solutions harness the power and sophistication of nature to turn environmental social and economic challenges into innovation opportunities european commission 2015 eggermont et al 2015 notes there are three types of nbs type 1 no or minimal intervention in ecosystems with the objectives of maintaining or improving the delivery of a range of es both inside and outside of these preserved sic ecosystems type 2 management approaches that develop sustainable and multifunctional ecosystems and landscapes extensively or intensively managed which improves the delivery of selected es compared to what would be obtained with a more conventional intervention and type 3 consists of managing ecosystems in very intrusive ways or even creating new ecosystems for a discussion on new novel ecosystems see hobbs et al 2014 it is worth emphasizing that this typology centres on the delivery of ecosystem services with a strong people oriented focus although type 1 refers to natural ecosystems these are now no longer much in evidence globally and semi natural would be a better descriptor many type 2 solutions fall into the category of landscape stewardship management bieling and plieninger 2017 wu 2013 and that for type 3 ecological engineering mitsch 2012 approaches artificial ecosystem design management of urban ecosystems and the management of novel ecosystems hobbs et al 2014 is a better fit in all cases the human context of the nbs is critical and recent work suggests more attention should be given to the incorporation of local and indigenous knowledge into formulating and applying solutions see inter alia díaz et al 2018 this is all the more true for approximately 70 of the poor in sub saharan africa and southeast asia who subsist largely on natural resources ngonghala et al 2017 consideration of nature based solutions should be set in the likely scenario of a world in which by 2040 it is likely that we will live in a continuum of managed patchwork landscapes including managed wildness parklands agroecosystems sustainable forestry large scale zoos botanical gardens will develop from a combination of current zoo botanic gardens and protected areas urban systems will have more green blue connected and racemiform infrastructure including constructed wetlands and other novel ecosystems living buildings and urban greenspace this paper examines aspects of nbs as they relate to ecohydrology principles and practices and the policy setting in which nbs can operate 2 nature based solutions nbs and ecohydrology nbs fit well with and give clarity to the whole theoretical and practical base included under the discipline of modern ecohydrology as defined by zalewski 2013 unesco s work in ecohydrology and biosphere reserves under the international hydrological and man and the biosphere programmes continues to provide practical solutions on a rapidly evolving theoretical base which can mutually reinforce the developing field of nbs nesshöver et al 2017 point out some key issues with the nbs concept of which three are especially relevant to ecohydrology emphasis mine nbs need to be developed and discussed in relation to existing concepts to clarify their added value when considering and implementing nbs the relabeling of related concepts and the misuse of the concept must be prevented to avoid misunderstanding duplication and unintended consequences the strength of the nbs concept is its integrative systemic approach which prevents it from becoming just another green communication tool that provides justification for a classical model of natural resource exploitation and management measures zalewski 2013 2014 proposed an approach to ecohydrology termed wbsr to indicate the key elements w for water b for biodiversity s for ecosystem services and r for resilience he also notes these elements are linked through three related principles viz hydrological principle ecological principle and ecological engineering principle the hydrological principle links quantification of hydrological processes to quantification of ecosystem function typically at the basin scale but the principle is scale independent the ecological engineering principle promotes people using ecosystem properties both ecological and hydrological as management tools primarily through construction and management of artificial ecosystems the ecological principle implies the need for understanding ecosystem change in terms of ecosystem change there are several change agents that can be identified especially the role of people in causing managing and mediating such change viz through cultural flows bridgewater and aricò 2016 mdbc 2016 the role of ecosystem engineers other than people as key change agents and the importance of ecological flows crucial to understanding ecosystem change is increasing evidence of the importance that should be afforded to the role of other knowledges alongside science in developing the wbsr paradigm see e g díaz et al 2018 under the biodiversity component b of ecohydrology the concept of ecosystem engineers was proposed by jones et al 1994 for any organism that creates or modifies ecosystems ecosystem engineers can be confused with the concept of keystone species but while the latter have especially important roles in defining ecosystem structure or ensuring ecosystem function ecosystem engineers are primarily identified with promoting ecosystem change jones et al 1994 identified two different types of ecosystem engineers allogenic engineers that modify the environment by mechanically changing materials from one form to another examples here include a range of invertebrate species living in aquatic environments that actively change sediment deposition patterns and rates and larger animals such as beavers manipulating materials to change water flows and autogenic engineers that modify the environment by modifying themselves through growth or population expansion examples here include mangrove species stromatolites etc ecosystem engineers also contribute to ecosystem resilience r there is a range of species that act as ecosystem engineers in aquatic and semi aquatic ecosystems and already provide people independent solutions to land management problems understanding and using these ecosystem engineers as part of nbs is an important nexus between ecohydrology and nbs an emerging issue in ecosystem engineering is that of rewilding the re introduction of species lost through human activity to help restore ecosystem processes and functions rewilding is usually defined as re establishing a trophic cascade where bringing back locally extinct top predators suppresses expanded herbivore populations leading to a release of pressure on vegetation and causing ecosystems to revert to their historical status ripple et al 2014 observe that current ecological knowledge indicates that large carnivores are necessary for the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem function human actions cannot fully replace the role of large carnivores while not carnivores beavers castor fiber introduced as a trial in scotland scottish beaver trial 2016 are currently also considered for release on a trial basis in england defra 2017 beavers are candidates of interest because of their ability to act as ecosystem engineers examining the role of ecosystem engineers as potential drivers of landscape change is an element of rewilding that has received much less attention than that given to restoration of trophic cascades a key consequence of beaver reintroduction has been rapid change of stream flows with concomitant effects on groundwater there is a clear role for ecohydrology to help manage understandable enthusiasm for such nbs related actions with realistic assessments of the likely hydrological consequences people are both autogenic and allogenic ecosystem engineers and have the special and unique characteristic of being able to transfer species and genetic material from widespread locations to assist in engineering ecosystems people need or want this is especially true for ecosystems involving ecohydrological functions and processes these processes are also linked to the provision of particular kinds of ecosystem services to the exclusion of many others for example nesshöver et al 2017 point out that positive impacts result from rehabilitation of wetlands for flood protection on other ecosystem services such as climate regulation and water purification but may negatively impact the ecosystem potential for farming while the field of synthetic ecosystems is relatively new amor et al 2017 suggest that in future work it will be possible to identify and bio engineer environments such as manipulating agricultural soil microbiomes suggesting that ecological engineers can range from single cell organisms to vertebrate animals and higher plants understanding and using ecosystem engineers as part of nbs and ensuring that ecological engineering uses ecosystem engineers as part of the overall engineering process is an important step in nbs development and one that ecohydrology can help inform díaz et al 2018 redefine ecosystem services s as nature s contributions to people ncp reflecting the increasingly important perspective of the contributions that nature offers people rather than the narrower economically based ecosystem service concept see e g costanza et al 2017 díaz et al 2018 suggest that the intergovernmental platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services ipbes will be moving to this approach as the platform develops assessments at various scales of biodiversity implementing the ncp approach will have implications for all other processes that use the ecosystem services concept including ecohydrology while díaz et al 2018 make much of the role that knowledge held by indigenous peoples and local communities has had on the development of ncp they underemphasize the role that nature has in contributing to nature through what were previously described as supporting ecosystem services they also underemphasize that people as part of nature in turn have contributions to nature díaz et al 2018 categorize nature s contributions to people in way reflective of the ecosystem service paradigm with some examples of interest to ecohydrology is the category of regulation of freshwater quality quantity location and timing the examples they offer are regulation by ecosystems of the quantity location and timing of the flow of surface and groundwater used for drinking irrigation transport hydropower and as the support of non material contributions regulation of flow to water dependent natural habitats that in turn positively or negatively affect people downstream including via flooding wetlands including ponds rivers lakes swamps modification of groundwater levels which can ameliorate dryland salinization in unirrigated landscapes regulation through filtration of particles pathogens excess nutrients and other chemicals by ecosystems or particular organisms of the quality of water used directly e g drinking swimming or indirectly e g aquatic foods irrigated food and fibre crops freshwater and coastal habitats of heritage value bearing all the above in mind ecohydrology can make use of nbs concepts and practice in its own development some specific examples using the wbsr categories are pinpointing species that can be used in rewilding for water related ecosystems changing flows and patterns of water movement w managing manipulating ecosystems and if necessary creating novel ecosystems allowing space for evolution b understanding ecosystem processes help provide natures contributions to people ecosystem services and that people can drive change in ecosystem processes s rebuilding resilience through ensuring landscapes have a mixture of different types of nbs r bridgewater and aricò 2016 developed a conceptual framework for a modern ecohydrology this conceptual framework needs revising in the light of ncps and fig 1 shows a new conceptual framework drawing on the work of díaz et al 2018 and focusing it in an ecohydrological context considering the links between nbs natures contributions to people and the wbsr paradigm it is suggested that the latter should be updated to wncr or water nature contributions resilience nature here refers to genetic species and ecosystem components of the environment and contributions to both the benefits goods and services nature provides to people and people s feedbacks to management of nature importantly this new perspective points to a central role for people so that issues of cultural flows for rivers and wetlands are understood as part of environmental or ecological flows incorporating these ideas in nbs will be an important contribution ecohydrology can make to these developing paradigms 3 policy reflections issues concerning the future of biodiversity are global hence the development of the un convention on biological diversity cbd in 1992 yet a global response is inadequate to address the many problems faced by biodiversity only a local response will solve the problems of conservation and management here the value of nbs is evident as the solutions are inherently local while incorporating nbs into international environmental governance is feasible as international environmental architecture is incapable of swift response and has difficulties with locally based responses make this an unsatisfactory approach but nbs also mirror the ecosystem approach of the cbd whose 12 principles cbd 2004 can help form a framework for the application of nbs the ecosystem approach ea of the cbd is the primary framework for action under the convention of biological diversity it provides a framework within which the relationship of protected areas to the wider landscape and seascape can be understood and the goods and services flowing from protected areas can be valued it has 12 principles cbd 2004 that reflect and reinforce the application of nbs principle 1 of the ea states that the objectives of management of land water and living resources are a matter of societal choice other key principles include recognizing potential gains from management there is a need to understand the ecosystem in an economic context the ecosystem approach should be undertaken at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales management must recognize that change is inevitable the ecosystem approach should seek the appropriate balance between and integration of conservation and use of biological diversity coming full circle the twelfth principle states the ecosystem approach should involve all relevant sectors of society and scientific disciplines it is unfortunate that the idea of the ea as the primary framework for action under the cbd has slipped somewhat as being the primary framework for implementation would assist uptake of nbs nonetheless these principles reflect the issues identified for nbs by nesshöver et al 2017 and for urban environments by raymond et al 2017 in summary the ea helps define the appropriate management level local regional global places people as part of ecosystems and allows examination of results from different knowledge management systems to provide sustainable management and conservation solutions while the cbd is in effect a framework convention on biodiversity the international political institutional landscape relevant to nbs and ecohydrology also consists of the suite of programmes and agreements managed by various un agencies including the un fao programmes and actions of the undp the international waters programme of the gef and unesco ihp mab programmes in addition but not under the direct purview of the un are the decisions of the convention on wetlands ramsar iran 1971 while much policy activity is undertaken by un agencies it is noteworthy that the g20 meeting held in hamburg in 2017 recorded the following actions for member countries to undertake g20 2017 promote responsible investment in rural economies to support sustainable development and growth through promoting the voluntary guidelines on the responsible governance of tenure of land fisheries and forests in the context of national food security this statement links logically to the sustainable development goals sdgs sdgs 2016 these sdgs need application as an integrated set of goals but can also be helped by the concepts and practice of nbs four of the 17 sdgs may be regarded as foundational goals related to the biosphere these are goals 6 water and sanitation 13 climate change 14 life under water and 15 life on land e g swedish mab committee 2017 links and feedbacks between these goals is complex and governed through a range of feedback loops both positive and negative understanding measuring and managing these goals and the social and economic goals which build on them will require considerable input from nbs and as water is a critical element ecohydrology is a key source of scientific advice work done by the swedish mab committee 2017 demonstrates how swedish unesco biosphere reserves can serve as arenas and exemplars for implementing the 2030 agenda in the broader unesco context the man and the biosphere and international hydrological programmes as sponsors of the development of ecohydrology have a key role to play through interactions between the programmes the man and the biosphere programme with its key asset of the world network of biosphere reserves has a ready made set of global sites for testing how ecohydrology through informing development of nbs can help achieve the sdgs ecohydrology and nbs together can help craft policy development and implementation from local to global levels as we move to living in more sustainable environments 4 conclusions nbs can help define the type and scale local regional global of ecosystem management place people as part of ecosystems and bring traditional and indigenous worldviews of ecosystem management alongside the worldview of western science ecohydrology can bring the needed cross disciplinary focus to nbs through wnrc so an approach recognizing how nbs and ecohydrology working together and governed by key principles can assist environmental policy formulation and implementation is an important one to develop the following ten principles are proposed as a framework to promote interaction between ecohydrology and nbs based on the foregoing discussion these principles governed by feedbacks between and among them are sustainable management of ecosystems is key to human development and survivability benefits from nature support ecosystem wildlife and human health nbs informed by ecohydrology and effectively implemented in aquatic systems have benefits for people and the rest of nature nature well managed properly conserved and appropriately shared is at the heart of solutions to environmental problems building ecological green and blue or soft infrastructure is a necessary complement to hard engineering infrastructure ecological engineering using ecosystem engineers and other key species is vital for the future of the planets aquatic ecosystems adaptive management is at the core of both nbs and ecohydrology ecology and economics should share a co operative not competitive space social and cultural elements are as important as biophysical elements in reaching sustainability and building resilience in socio ecological coupled systems is critical for the implementation of sustainable environmental solutions nbs are applicable worldwide to a range of ecosystems but where these ecosystems have significant aquatic components ecohydrology has a key role to play in providing the evidence base for such nbs in both a policy and practical sense in today s world with rapid and unpredictable change resolving twenty first century environmental problems will need the perspectives nbs provides to manage the known known unknown and unknown unknown issues that confront humanity the critical perspectives nbs can bring to achieve the agreed global goals for sustainability sdgs 2106 will be strengthened by the growing corpus of knowledge within ecohydrology providing that evidence base for nbs in aquatic environments conflict

unesco biosphere reserves can serve as arenas and exemplars for implementing the 2030 agenda in the broader unesco context the man and the biosphere and international hydrological programmes as sponsors of the development of ecohydrology have a key role to play through interactions between the programmes the man and the biosphere programme with its key asset of the world network of biosphere reserves has a ready made set of global sites for testing how ecohydrology through informing development of nbs can help achieve the sdgs ecohydrology and nbs together can help craft policy development and implementation from local to global levels as we move to living in more sustainable environments 4 conclusions nbs can help define the type and scale local regional global of ecosystem management place people as part of ecosystems and bring traditional and indigenous worldviews of ecosystem management alongside the worldview of western science ecohydrology can bring the needed cross disciplinary focus to nbs through wnrc so an approach recognizing how nbs and ecohydrology working together and governed by key principles can assist environmental policy formulation and implementation is an important one to develop the following ten principles are proposed as a framework to promote interaction between ecohydrology and nbs based on the foregoing discussion these principles governed by feedbacks between and among them are sustainable management of ecosystems is key to human development and survivability benefits from nature support ecosystem wildlife and human health nbs informed by ecohydrology and effectively implemented in aquatic systems have benefits for people and the rest of nature nature well managed properly conserved and appropriately shared is at the heart of solutions to environmental problems building ecological green and blue or soft infrastructure is a necessary complement to hard engineering infrastructure ecological engineering using ecosystem engineers and other key species is vital for the future of the planets aquatic ecosystems adaptive management is at the core of both nbs and ecohydrology ecology and economics should share a co operative not competitive space social and cultural elements are as important as biophysical elements in reaching sustainability and building resilience in socio ecological coupled systems is critical for the implementation of sustainable environmental solutions nbs are applicable worldwide to a range of ecosystems but where these ecosystems have significant aquatic components ecohydrology has a key role to play in providing the evidence base for such nbs in both a policy and practical sense in today s world with rapid and unpredictable change resolving twenty first century environmental problems will need the perspectives nbs provides to manage the known known unknown and unknown unknown issues that confront humanity the critical perspectives nbs can bring to achieve the agreed global goals for sustainability sdgs 2106 will be strengthened by the growing corpus of knowledge within ecohydrology providing that evidence base for nbs in aquatic environments conflict

1144,the economic development environmental protection dichotomy is an out dated construct a 21st century approach to the world s water problems is progressively being developed by researchers and practitioners who are combining traditional and ecosystem based engineering systems to yield cost effective solutions given the continuing and widespread loss of ecological services and functions water security in a multi generational sdg context requires a meaningful global commitment to redirect the current downward trajectory in both i the state of the world s ecosystems and the services they provide to society and ii our collective level of stewardship of these important resources achieving sustainable water security will require overcoming strategic challenges related to protected areas ecosystem based solutions research water observatories and expanded technical readiness it also needs to address other limitations and demands related to water infrastructure economies human settlements and water quality sanitation and health four globally significant actions can support the adoption of more efficient and sustainable water futures green infrastructure watershed banks an accelerated global research and solutions program a new global water ecosystem services observatory and an improved technical capacity workforce development initiative finally the engagement of relevant stakeholders from academia government the private sector and civil society are needed to ensure that humankind will be able to meet its water security goals and commitments including those expressed in the sustainable development agenda keywords ecosystem based solutions water related ecosystem services sustainable water security green infrastructure 1 introduction an sdg inspired vision of water security given the central role of water to human enterprise the successful achievement of nearly all of the sustainable development goals will depend on water the integrity of the environment underpins a reliable water resource base and well managed environments offer essential and low cost public goods and services thus if these aquatic environments and their concomitant services are managed with a long time horizon in mind the essence of sustainability they will provide a critical foundation to human well being and economic development iucn 2018 defines nature based solutions as actions to protect sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively simultaneously providing human well being and biodiversity benefits it has also been a central focus of the 2018 world water assessment program s 2018 report wwap un water 2018 for the purposes of this article we use ecosystem based solutions interchangably with this other nomenclature the current heavy reliance on modern centralized engineering solutions to water problems typically ignores more cost effective problem prevention and collaterally destroys environmental systems that produce renewable freshwater resources these realities can be used to motivate a fundamental change in the way water security in the sense of the collective definition articulated through the high level panel on water focal points see section 3 could be effected through innovations in the arena of traditional engineering linked to the services provided by natural capital essential to any success in this domain will be a formal recognition of the role of environmental stewardship combining the realities of the day with aspirations for the future suggests a vision box 1 which we propose as a useful guidepost for formulating water related policies and interventions during the execution phase of the sdgs the remainder of this paper highlights the challenges and opportunities in realizing this vision 2 the ecosystem services challenge fresh water serves many roles in the earth system sustaining our climate biosphere and human society the availability of renewable and reliable water resources the key to human water security cannot be achieved on a truly sustainable basis without a well functioning environment capable of supporting adequate resource quantity quality and timing ecological integrity the combination of the biodiversity and ecosystem processes that characterize an area at a given point in time bridgewater et al 2014 needs to also be viewed as an integral building block of the sustainable development agenda water related ecosystem services include a broad array of benefits such as the provision of clean water supplies water for farming and food processing fish protein and greater resilience to climate extremes like flooding box 2 they also convey values in many parts of the world that are less visible but are equally important in social environmental and economic realms díaz et al 2018 pascual et al 2017 much has been written on the global water crisis with regard to scarcity pollution and lack of clean drinking water and sanitation available to large segments of the world s population fao 2012 hoekstra et al 2012 who unicef jmp 2016 wwap 2015 2016 water scarcity already affects more than 40 of the global population and water crises are now ranked as third in the top 10 global risks to the world economy wef 2017 water scarcity is projected to increase substantially well into the future fao 2012 wwap un water 2018 with global demand for water services from industry agriculture and domestic use sectors projected to rise by 20 30 in 2050 burek et al 2016 many of these problems proliferate as a by product of development in the absence of adequate environmental management harrison et al 2016 vörösmarty et al 2010 to achieve human water security modern centralized engineering based solutions frequently have been promoted addams et al 2009 gleick 2003 hansjürgens et al 2016 tockner et al 2016 in many cases ignoring more cost effective problem prevention or mitigation achievable through improved management of natural infrastructure palmer et al 2010 2015 while traditional engineering approaches hereafter referred to as grey infrastructure without question convey immediate benefits in addressing a target water problem they typically have been costly to install often outstrip the technical capacity of many nations to operate and maintain and in many cases impair environmental systems this includes green infrastructure natural and semi natural ecosystems and other environmental features designed and managed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services that serve as the foundation or source for renewable water supplies ec 2013 green et al 2015 unep 2014 vörösmarty et al 2013 elements of these two categories of infrastructure are often combined as with municipal water supplies relying on both protected watersheds as well as traditional water collection treatment and distribution systems dudley and stolton 2003 poustie et al 2015 kabisch et al 2017 in this context four strategic challenges if left unaddressed will continue to entrench the status quo making it increasingly difficult to move onto more sustainable water pathways for economic development i protected area shortfalls even if protected areas have not been created to protect water supplies for humans per se they often host valuable green infrastructure and deliver water and other types of ecosystem services to downstream users dudley et al 2016 even though there have been constant gains in protected area coverage in past years in some parts of the world 15 4 of terrestrial area and 8 4 of marine areas under national jurisdiction ec 2017 juffe bignoli et al 2014 the global protected area coverage still falls short of meeting chief strategic targets set by the cbd lewis et al 2017 watson et al 2014 despite some progress towards achieving some of the cbd aichi targets especially target 1 on awareness 11 on protected areas and 19 on knowledge further efforts are needed to reduce pressures on biodiversity and ecosystem services tittensor et al 2014 ipbes 2018 for example in the case of target 11 area coverage where most progress has been reported is only a component of this target and other essential aspects need to be fulfilled for the target to effectively be met some of these include the effective equitable management of biodiversity ecological representation of mixed ecosystems and the improvement of connectivity between sites barnes 2015 there are important needs to be considered in the case of freshwater biodiversity and achieving this target this target needs to account not only for area but also for the endemism of aquatic life forms freshwater ecosystem processes habitats pressures and essential actions to maintain them juffe bignoli et al 2016 strayer and dudgeon 2010 a baseline is required to report on national and global progress juffe bignoli et al 2016 furthermore protected areas are often not effectively managed and do not sufficiently cover areas that are of special importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services including those related to water provisioning services darwall et al 2011 holland et al 2012 harrison et al 2016 hermoso et al 2016 juffe bignoli et al 2014 despite the recognized importance of green infrastructure epa 2015 ec 2016 protected areas remain grossly underfunded relative to traditional water engineering investments global investments in protected areas and their maintenance which would otherwise help to reduce the cost of traditional water engineering services is less than 3 of standard water sector expenditures with us 10s of billions in annual shortfalls ashley and cashman 2006 mccarthy et al 2012 even when in place protected areas are often positioned inside regions that are characterized by impaired environments or do not include headwater or recharge regions sáenz et al 2016 limiting their value as natural capital fig 1 remarkably watersheds purposefully managed for municipal water supplies which should have as a preeminent concern their environmental protection have instead shown progressive degradation that is evident worldwide mcdonald et al 2016 these accumulated effects arise from population incursion poor land management nutrient and sediment pollution and substantially raise the costs of providing an essential human water service a 50 modeled rise in capital and operational costs for one third of cities recently analyzed ii lack of solutions oriented research on composite grey green infrastructure the idea of ecosystem based water supply systems is not new in fact it is part of a broader set of integrated water resource management iwrm approaches bunn 2016 poff et al 2015 the economic costs of relying solely on grey infrastructure is prohibitive for many countries and once built it often has unintended consequences loss of life or surrounding buit capital additional costs for repairs due to partial or total failures in the united states nearly 14 000 dams have been classified as high hazard asce 2013 combining grey with green infrastructure applied in the urban domain can increase resilience while providing other benefits e g attenuating urban heat island impacts and saving energy via green roofs providing natural habitats that buffer the impact of flood events kabisch et al 2017 however there has been insufficient work on the design and context dependency of performance for blending human engineering with natural ecosystems hermoso et al 2012 2015 and application of methodologies on a scale required by the sdgs has yet to be formalized iii observatories in decline the application of sdgs to support water sustainability requires both a broad and deep knowledge of freshwater ecosystem function and the dynamics of regional water use bhaduri et al 2016 however monitoring networks depicting the global water resource base and its supporting environments continue to deteriorate particularly in response to reduced funding and operational support thereby forcing researchers and practitioners to rely on ad hoc assemblages of data simulation models or best guess approaches geo 2014 wwap 2015 yet water resources managers cannot effectively plan or site grey infrastructure without detailed knowledge on the distribution and characteristics of existing infrastructure both natural and grey such data limitations are a common problem in developing countries poustie et al 2015 monitoring networks need to help ensure that investments in protecting and restoring water resources are effective which in turn can engender public confidence in the safety and reliability of their water supplies garrick et al 2017 with further development space based remote sensing could make a larger contribution to addressing these needs geo 2014 iv technical readiness in question significant human and institutional capacity gaps limit the technical readiness of water professionals in many countries unesco ihe 2013 moreover the additional knowledge needed to combine green with grey engineering for more cost effective human water security remains in its infancy and requires a paradigm shift in engineering technology training necessitating new interdisciplinary education programs worldwide new programs to build technical capacity especially in the global south are needed a recent example is a program funded by the united states agency for international development in partnership with the university of utah and mehran university in pakistan that is creating a center for advanced studies in water in pakistan burian et al 2017 the project is aligned with attaining the sdgs for water sustainability over a multi generational timeframe however will be difficult without a meaningful global commitment to addressing both the degradation of the world s drainage basins and their affiliated freshwater ecosystems as well as the commitment to adequate collective stewardship of natural capital to maintain their ecosystem services into the future garrick et al 2017 3 key interlinkages of ecosystem services with other sustainable development challenge domains this document is in response to an official request made by the high level panel on water hlpw 2016 which is co convened by the un secretary general and the world bank president and includes 11 heads of state and governments a general inquiry was posted to the community of water experts in six sub domains of the water security issue on the themes of water and the environment water infrastructure and investment resilient economies and societies and disaster risk reduction universal access to safe water and sanitation building partnerships and international cooperation and sustainable cities and human settlements we here deliver recommendations on the topic of water and environment specifically focused on water related ecosystem services and how they could be configured to support the sustainable development agenda box 3 given the interconnected nature of these six themes we were requested to explore the relationship of ecosystem services to these other high level challenges and to identify the co benefits that would emerge should the themes be addressed together these are discussed immediately below in so doing we also hope to identify some specific objectives and actions that as noted by others garrick et al 2017 are necessary to address sustainable development of water resources i e measurement valuation decision making and governance 3 1 water infrastructure our reliance on water engineering to provide secure freshwater resources extends to the earliest periods of human history vörösmarty et al 2015 but today reflects a heavy dependence on grey infrastructure and some of the largest built systems on the planet grey infrastructure is sometimes overbuilt and its operation and maintenance costs are often ignored and not properly accounted for into water projects resulting in less than optimal service palmer et al 2015 alternatively as water and sewer services proliferate wastewater treatment investments remain persistently underfunded wwap 2015 it is reasonable to question the overwhelming emphasis on such systems in lieu of green infrastructure alternatives i e the use of ecosystem services like floodplains for flood control or waste treatment as they have been shown to provide an equivalent service such a debate is a rich one with strong arguments on both sides of the question for instance in the developing world with poor or non existent water security grey infrastructure is often seen as the only viable solution over an immediate timeframe muller et al 2015 further where reliability must be high green systems have not yet been fully justified at the same time grey systems are relatively inflexible with much collateral and long term potential damage to ecosystems palmer et al 2015 alternatives to an often overdesigned grey infrastructure include demand management or a reliance on small scale systems but these are seldom addressed in planning also benefit cost economics for green infrastructure is much less well developed relative to traditional engineering thus limiting its attractiveness as an investment option if one accepts the importance of maintaining ecosystem services their impairment represents water security threats with a substantial lost value to society meriting rehabilitation post hoc reparation is costly for example up to us 80 billion spent to rehabilitate the yamatogawa river in japan a relatively small basin inhabited by only 2 1 million people tsuzuki and yoneda 2012 even when investments are made follow up monitoring on the effectiveness of stream rehabilitation interventions is seldom attempted bernhardt et al 2005 with the possibility that ineffective investment goes undetected or is even replicated in other regions additonally this lack of monitoring and impact evaluation of rehabilitation and restoration means that the effectiveness of these processes may not be fully realized where a nation s ability to invest in traditional water engineering solutions create local technical capacity and maintain workforce readiness is limited green infrastructure solutions can provide cost effective alternatives to grey engineering with additional environmental economic and social benefits based on existing scientific knowledge elsevier 2016 green et al 2015 many management options are available including combinations of grey and green approaches garrick et al 2017 wwap un water 2018 with specific choices determined by budget constraints and the existence of natural capital assets young 2000 riparian vegetation acting as green infrastructure is increasingly considered valuable for safeguarding water services especially in latin america grieg gran and porras 2012 veiga and gavaldão 2012 properly designed green infrastructure e g natural areas delivering urban water supplies or urban rainfall gardens provides a less costly service for flash flood reduction compared to replacing or upgrading sewer mains epa 2015 more generally cities may be the ideal proving ground for new grey green infrastructure especially where the reliability of traditional systems can be combined with the inherent environmental protection of green systems palmer et al 2015 vollmer et al 2016 such solutions can also generate a significant number of jobs thereby contributing to sustainable social and economic development wwap 2016 a new paradigm for developing countries and the sdgs that embeds the economic valuation of ecosystem services and green infrastructure into traditional benefit cost analysis could stimulate new blended engineering approaches to water security elsevier 2016 poff et al 2015 there is growing concern that for many parts of the world including the usa the aging of infrastructure threatens to decrease water management efficiencies and lead to catastrophic failures in times of floods the replacement of these dated grey water infrastructure facilities with green infrastructure alternatives could provide capital savings to support a broader green infrastructure upgrade important initiatives with hybrid systems are available at local scales for example engineering and biological measures sedimentation biofiltration can be used for the treatment of stormwater jurczak et al 2018 however a broader scale perspective is required to address the challenge of establishing human water security green et al 2015 harrison et al 2016 valderrama et al 2017 3 2 resilient economies an important byproduct of blending grey green water engineering would be a fundamentally new approach regarding the use of natural assets to help attain sdg 6 and universal water security this greater water security would in turn support many other goals such as sdg 2 on food and sdg 15 on conservation restoration and sustainable use of freshwater ecosystems and their services see box 3 if natural capital is viewed as a building block of resilient water engineering systems then its state and stewardship should become an intrinsic part of the planning process bennett et al 2016 this perspective would have the practical impact of expanding the decision trade off space for acceptable water allocations to industry energy and food versus other essential societal needs like public water supply or safeguarding the environment garrick et al 2017 investing in natural capital and its water related ecosystem services will be especially significant for sectors heavily dependent on water e g 95 of jobs in the agriculture sector 30 of jobs in the industry sector and 10 of jobs in the services sector wwap 2016 the emergence of new business models based on verifiable science based metrics that support sustainable impact investment choices by recognizing good corporate practices can represent an important turning point in how society values ecological integrity in the broader economy vörösmarty et al 2018 such models would seek structural market changes and practices that account for and value natural capital based on data and analytics that allow companies to objectively evaluate costs and benefits vogl et al 2017 3 3 human settlements global population is forecast to expand during the period of the sdgs and through mid century to 9 10 billion people lutz et al 2014 after 2025 all of this growth will be in the world s cities as global rural populations begin to decline un 2014 with urban growth will come increasing demands for energy materials and infrastructure yet this growth already outpaces the capacity of governments to build essential infrastructure creating informal settlements or slums often along rivers and riparian areas lutz et al 2014 there may be more than 200 000 world communities that can be classified as slums and the un suggests that today these are where 1 in 3 urban dwellers reside un habitat 2010 who and un habitat 2010 un water wwap 2015 highlights both the challenges and potential solutions for water the world s slum population which is expected to reach nearly 900 million by 2020 is both underserved with respect to basic water needs and also more vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events it is however possible to improve performance of urban water supply systems while continuing to expand the system and addressing the needs of the poor under the specter of climate change these development deficiencies turn into adaptation deficits satterthwaite et al 2007 the challenge of supplying adequate freshwater under uncertain future climate is exacerbated in xeric coastal and riverine cities approximately 34 of the global urban population lives in arid regions mcgranahan et al 2005 and more than 150 million people today are dependent on urban water supplies that show perennial shortage with forecasts for that number to rise to 1 billion by mid century mcdonald et al 2011 further more than 50 of the world s urban population lives along coastlines or rivers mcgranahan et al 2005 in these locations the most vulnerable are typically the urban poor in part because they often live in hazardous locations such as floodplains in these contexts protected watersheds and their associated ecosystem services can play an important role in managing the global transformation to an urbanized planet for example cities can rely on the protective role of ecosystem services by using natural lowlands as relief valves to allow dense settlements to escape the impact of river floods as is current practice by the netherlands room for the river programme roth and warner 2007 or in the mississippi river basin usace iwr 2000 for example the netherlands programme recognized the flood risk reduction benefits of giving more space to rivers to increase their discharge capacity instead of building higher dikes in the face of increasing impacts of extreme flood events which are likely to be exacerbated by climate change this was done by constructing a bypass channel an island in the river waal and bridges to improve the connectivity of the area both the bypass channel and the island form a river park that provides recreational ecological and aesthetic benefits besides flood risk protection van herk et al 2015 wla 2017 another example is low impact development lid design and technologies within cities that focus on a range of stormwater management outcomes from restoring water quality to flood prevention and rainwater harvesting lid design includes hydrologic analysis in site planning integrated management of erosion and sediment control as well as public outreach lid technologies include green roofs rain gardens permeable pavement retention cells and treatment swales lid has been implemented in the usa europe australia new zealand and china chang et al 2018 a study of community demand in jakarta also showed that the public would be willing to pay for freshwater ecosystem protection and rehabilitation that result in increased water security vollmer et al 2016 this includes park space along the river and conservation of forests in the upper part of the catchment outside of the city and possibly also support for a widened channel for flood risk mitigation the key will be to create solution frameworks to more sensibly manage the inevitable trade offs between urban water provision and urban infrastructure protection while simultaneously preserving water flows for aquatic ecosystem health and biodiversity 3 4 water quality sanitation and health significant direct health impacts occur when ecosystem services are no longer able to meet human water security needs healthy ecosystems are highly effective at improving water quality and quantity russi et al 2013 teeb 2010 removing pathogenic microbes sequestering and converting inorganic ions and transforming persistent organic pollutants teeb 2010 impairing or degrading ecosystems especially those directly linked to the freshwater supply fig 1 yields significant consequences for sanitation and hygiene even in places like the u s a nearly 50 million people have used public water systems containing concentrations of chemicals and bacteria that exceed regulatory limits duhigg 2009 the recent transboundary waters assessment programme twap synthesis report tabulated 1 4 billion people half the population living in transboundary basins facing serious and increasing risks due to pollution unep dhi and unep 2016 these realities are not inconsequential to the basic water goals sdg 6 of the sustainable development agenda insofar as inland aquatic ecosystems convey 80 of sustainable water supply to humans yet are broadly degraded vörösmarty et al 2010 this has already elevated costs for remediation to the level of us 100s of billions worldwide ashley and cashman 2006 vörösmarty et al 2010 if left unchecked such degraded aquatic ecosystems produce substantial risks to human health one of countless examples occurred in 2014 in toledo ohio usa which had to temporarily cease drinking water operations due to the presence of cyanotoxins produced by blue green algae in lake erie a result of poor management of point and non point source pollution across contributing landscapes what was once considered a sporadic phenomenon such harmful algal blooms have proliferated both in the u s and globally over only the last 30 years whoi 2016 4 brief overview of the current landscape of the challenge 4 1 diagnosing the challenge while there is no shortage of individual challenges associated with ecosystem services that support water in the context of the sdgs box 3 these can be synthesized into a small number of urgent concerns seven such challenges areas are presented below ranging from benchmarking the current state of affairs with respect to water related ecosystem services to the impact of their loss their surveillance and approaches to coping with ongoing water stress 4 1 1 ecosystems in decline maintaining healthy ecosystems in light of ongoing economic development remains a persistent challenge with a global disappearance of the wild in the contemporary world sanderson et al 2002 in a turn of the century benchmark study the millennium ecosystem assessment mea 2005 demonstrated that all but one of 13 major ecosystem classes was in decline since this time numerous studies have shown a deterioration of these ecosystems and their services today and into the future living planet index wwf 2016 unep geo 5 unep 2012 and human ecological footprint mancini et al 2016 four recently launched landmark assessment reports of the intergovernmental science policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services ipbes with 129 member governments across four world regions the americas asia and the pacific africa as well as europe and central asia show alarming trends of declining biodiversity and ecosystem services ipbes n d in the americas 65 per cent of biodiversity and ecosystem conditions that are important for human well being are declining with 21 per cent declining strongly wetlands have been highly transformed across large areas of the american continent ipbes 2018 this loss of healthy ecosystems translates to a pandemic loss of effective support systems for a number of watershed ecosystem services of direct benefit to society safe drinking water wastewater processing and dilution river bank stabilization erosion control and disaster risk reduction to downstream populations medeiros et al 2011 teeb 2010 ipbes 2018 4 1 2 biodiversity implications degraded freshwater ecosystems vital for species diversity are also a critical focal point of global species loss at least 126 000 described species rely directly on freshwater habitats including many diverse plants invertebrates and vertebrates balian et al 2008 iucn 2016 this number while based on the most comprehensive global analysis thus far is certainly an underestimate and is likely to grow to over 1 million species if currently undescribed species are included iucn 2016 of the 28 000 freshwater dependent species that have been assessed for the iucn red list of threatened species www iucnredlist org thus far approximately one third are threatened with extinction carrizo et al 2017 some estimates place the per area rates of imperilment and extinction for freshwater species likely to be 100s if not 1000s of times more rapid than in land or ocean strayer and dudgeon 2010 the acceleration of biogeochemical cycles e g erosion n2 fixation due to human activities affect riverborne material and its transfer across river systems meybeck and vörösmarty 2005 when natural filters

riversymposium 2017 pittock et al 2015 poff et al 2010 poff and matthews 2013 while certainly water engineering works such as dams and reservoirs are sometimes necessary to address water security the challenge is how to manage the negative effects these produce on natural flows and freshwater and riparian biodiversity relating to the physical chemical and biological impacts they confer emphasis on renewable energy under the paris agreement is likely to stimulate investment in hydropower iha 2016 with severe negative impacts on aquatic biodiversity strayer and dudgeon 2010 in certain parts of the world environmental flow protection is intimately connected with issues of the social and associated cultural values of water morgan 2012 one example is the national cultural flows research project in australia that aims to align indigenous water allocations in australia s water planning and management efforts ensuring appropriate delivery and maintenance of the cultural social and spiritual benefits in systems like the murray darling basin national cultural flows research project 2018 the twap unep dhi and unep 2016 noted that extinction risk to freshwater biodiversity is moderate to very high in 70 of the area of transboundary river basins indicating a strong need for international cooperation to address this issue important international agreements promote the effective transboundary management of aquatic systems within countries but also across boundaries for example the convention on wetlands ramsar provides a framework for national and international action towards the conservation and adequate use of wetlands and their resources ramsar et al 2014 the convention on migratory species cms is also focused on the protection of species that migrate across or outside national jurisdictional boundaries https www cms int en convention text hogan 2011 identified ca 30 species of freshwater fishes that meet all the criteria for cms listing and a further ca 10 species that might benefit from a listing there are 29 freshwater megafauna species which represent flagships for the conservation of freshwater ecosystems currently listed by cms carrizo et al 2017 4 1 3 lost ecosystem services mean rising economic costs the supporting environment is rapidly losing its ability to deliver services day et al 2014 with wetlands of particular value to water security in terms of pollution abatement fisheries and flood control particularly in decline overall declines represent an economic loss of us 4 3 20 2 trillion in ecosystem services between 1997 and 2011 costanza et al 2014a nevertheless in most countries funding for ecosystem protection for water services and infrastructure is neither sufficient nor sustainable wwap 2015 despite high return on investment ratios e g 3 to 1 recognized in china china water risk 2016 for protected areas that are designed to convey ecosystem services of many types less than 6 of countries reporting to cbd indicated adequate resources for the management of such areas watson et al 2014 yet a recent study showed that staff and budget capacity were the strongest predictor of the conservation impact of protected areas gill et al 2017 a survey of protected areas in the southeast usa showed that most protected areas have fewer resources dedicated to freshwater conservation and management than to other activities and some completely lack the necessary resources mcdonald et al 2016 thieme et al 2012 this is further evident in many populated parts of the world where protected areas face increasing threats due to their proximity to poorly managed watersheds and other external stressors harrison et al 2016 thieme et al 2012 which raises the cost of protected area management see fig 1 4 1 4 funding of protected ecosystems and their services despite the fundamental role of ecosystem based solutions in biodiversity conservation and provision of ecosystem services investment in these solutions remains well below 1 of total investment in water resources management infrastructure wwap un water 2018 governments businesses and donors invested only us 25 billion in 2015 on payments for green infrastructure for water directed at rehabilitating and or protecting 487 million ha under watershed management bennett and ruef 2016 such investments included public subsidies e g government based payment for watershed services user driven watershed investments e g payments from water users such as water utilities or companies to conserve restore or create green infrastructure water quality trading and offsets and water markets that trade water rights bennett and ruef 2016 these interventions relied primarily on public subsidies but also collective actions such as water trust funds the potential for success of payment for watershed services schemes is regionally highly variable harrison et al 2016 but has been shown to be successful in some areas abell et al 2017 a new initiative under development is the cloud forest blue energy mechanism that aims to mobilize domestic commercial finance to reforest and conserve cloud forests that provide crucial benefits to the hydropower industry in latin america it is based on a pay for success financing model where hydropower plants pay for the ecosystem benefits provided by restored cloud forests the lab 2018 in some parts of the world especially in developing countries there is a severe underfunding of protected areas mccarthy et al 2012 watson et al 2014 and an additional area of 2 2 million km2 of land and inland waters is needed to be effectively managed and sufficiently cover areas that are of special importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services juffe bignoli et al 2014 preserving and effectively managing all terrestrial sites for global taxa protection was estimated to cost us 76 1 billion annually mccarthy et al 2012 to put this in perspective more than us 1 trillion will be needed by the traditional water services sector alone by year 2030 ashley and cashman 2006 4 1 5 tracking metrics observational networks and monitoring systems through remote sensing in situ sampling ground truthing surveys to evaluate the ways in which humans control degrade or possibly enhance water services and thus define the collective significance of these changes remains an urgent global need gardner et al 2015 turak et al 2017 garrick et al 2017 wwap un water 2018 consistent and objective information on the state of water resources including their use and management is frequently missing inadequate or unavailable with the situation for water quality data even more severe fao 2006 wwap 2015 currently water observation networks over most parts of the world provide only partial or unreliable data on surface and groundwater quantity and quality with a similar paucity of information with respect to wastewater related services geo 2014 wwap 2009 furthermore several studies show only static snapshots of the state of water services at a particular time and place failing to include a more comprehensive view of water challenge trends over time and across different regions in the world for example inability to measure all of the implications of an extreme precipitation event for erosion and pollution mobilization reflects our inability to undertake fully integrated monitoring programs this has an obvious and direct practical implication for water system planning and decision making wwap 2015 the situation is particularly severe in the least developed countries where long term sustainability clearly hinges on reliable water data in addition the potential for using remote sensing data to help address these monitoring needs should be further explored water indicators of a systematic and dynamic nature e g near real time from the earth system sciences can provide long term annual and sub annual tracking of water availability fao 2006 which can be combined with coincident socio economic changes to compute water vulnerability indicators vollmer et al 2016 such a capability would be an important step forward in creating an operational and dynamic monitoring capability this is critical as hydrologic change keeps pace or not with climate change milly et al 2008 nrc cohs 2011 this would be a necessary precursor for a sustained and comprehensive global water assessment procedure 4 1 6 capacity building for water related sdg support achieving long term positive environmental benefits is an especially important outcome of capacity development particularly if they can be used to train a next generation of practitioners and decision makers in strengthening policies strategies and legal frameworks that support the sustainable use of water related ecosystem services unesco ihe 2013 wyborn et al 2016 however this has not been well implemented in terms of capacity only 14 of 108 surveyed nations were capable of instituting the johannesburg target on integrated water resource management iwrm wwap 2006 in addition to traditional water engineering and technology training current and future professionals need to be trained to bettter understand and then use water related ecosystem services datasets and tools with blended engineering approaches future earth 2016 siwi 2016 start 2016 swfp 2016 unesco ihe 2013 un water 2015 this includes accounting of the benefits of water related ecosystem services to improve quality of life as well as to evaluate ecosystem states and trajectories in addition an appreciation of the cross linkages among the sdgs will be essential a general framework for mapping these interactions has been proposed nilsson et al 2016 and a logical next step is to apply this more specificially to the sdg targets that are relevant to freshwater bhaduri et al 2016 major investments are needed in water education and capacity building particularly in africa where the gap between needs and reality is highest 4 2 key actors and activities existing mechanisms are in place to address many of the challenges highlighted in this document advanced by a community that recognizes a high demand for water related ecosystem services and an opportunity to implement cost effective actions towards watershed protection restoration and sustainable management rodríguez osuna 2015 teeb 2010 such mechanisms include payments for watershed services pws or water quality quantity trading markets and reciprocal or in kind agreements water funds support for research and applications there is also a ready made community of actors contributing to water related ecosystem services protection or capacity development that could jointly be mobilized for protection and management efforts in the context of the sdgs table 1 for example unesco s international hydrological programme ihp is the intergovernmental program of the un system devoted to water research water resources management education and capacity building since its foundation in 1975 ihp has evolved from an international hydrological research program into an institution with a broader agenda to facilitate education and capacity building and improve water resources management and governance this program has been implemented in six year stages and is in its eight implementation phase 2014 2021 this current phase focuses on six thematic areas 1 water related disaster and hydrological changes 2 groundwater in a changing environment 3 addressing water scarcity and quality 4 water and human settlements of the future 5 ecohydrology engineering harmony for a sustainable world and 6 water education key to water security unesco 2018 an affiliated unesco european regional center for ecohydrology links the understanding of relationships between hydrological and biological processes at different scales to improve human water security enhance biodiversity and other opportunities for sustainable development ecohydrology

to climatic changes and cultural heritage zalewski 2000 zalewski et al 2017 the wbsrc strategy aims at gaining synergies between ecosystem based solutions and the circular economy zalewski et al 2017 5 call to action managing supplies quality and risk the economic development environmental protection dichotomy is an out dated construct and a 21st century approach to the water crisis young 2000 is progressively being developed by researchers and practitioners in which they combine traditional and ecosystem based engineering solutions a major strategic initiative is proposed here four strategic globally significant supporting actions are shown here as opportunities to counterbalance trends in the deterioration of water related ecosystem services as well as in the erosion of the capacity of sdg signatory states to address four main strategic water challenges as outlined in section 2 green infrastructure watershed banks comprising natural ecosystem based assets that would be identified and employed in water delivery systems designed for long term cost effective human use an accelerated global research and solutions program on coupled human environment engineered systems based on cost benefit analyses that explicitly evaluate green infrastructure to attain universal human water security through well functioning integral environments a new global water ecosystem services observatory to assess progress or backsliding in sustainable management of water assets combining state of the art earth observations survey data and simulation models depicting conditions from worldwide to local scales and with near real time operational coverage and an expanded capacity workforce development initiative to create universal readiness among un member states to produce a next generation of environmental planners and water practitioners the supporting initiatives are presented here as durable actions to the development agenda during the full sdg timeframe but also post 2030 a brief annotated description is offered in box 4 a diverse set of stakeholders from academia government the private sector and civil society would need to be engaged to ensure success a global inventory of watershed banks would help to identify candidate natural assets to be combined ultimately with grey approaches research of both a basic and applied nature would need to include the scientific community and engineers supported by public funding agencies but also through innovation grants from foundations and private sector research and development r d observatory and monitoring components of such a program would involve a similar set of actors to expand technical capacity international research societies technical schools and universities un and other development oriented educational programs and private sector internal training programs would need to be engaged 6 conclusion a growing and rapidly urbanizing population and its associated production and consumption of energy and materials will impact fresh water systems for the foreseeable future yet these drivers and their impacts have not been sufficiently controlled by current conservation and mitigation measures garrick et al 2017 green et al 2015 harrison et al 2016 rendering improved environmental management for water security a persistent societal imperative over the entire sdg execution period if one accepts the premise that durable water security requires well functioning ecosystems a central tenet of sdg 6 expressed through target 6 6 then this improvement we speak of becomes critical as the biocapacity or carrying capacity of ecosystems catchments and the biosphere at large to provide water services to humankind is likely to otherwise continue its long term decline global footprint network 2016 and compromise the very water security that sdg 6 seeks in the context of sustainability new solutions become apparent at once recognizing the need to raise the level of human economic well being while at the same time preserving the underlying benefits of natural capital in water provisioning innovation in the evolving 21st century water sector will be central to such a transformation and a critical part of this innovation will be a deeper understanding of ecosystem services and appreciation of how these can be used productively and in tandem with traditionally engineered systems palmer et al 2015 one could argue that the degree to which we have thus far been successful or not in meeting the water challenge is predicated on our more or less unitary focus on traditional engineering to address society s growing water challenges an expanded approach that includes an admittedly more complex and unwieldy set of multiple perspectives that embody ecology engineering economics governance ethics and culture will undoubtedly be a challenge for researchers and practitioners to achieve the broad scale absence of integrated water resource management benefits vörösmarty et al 2010 themselves multi dimensional is a testament to this challenge ahead in this context it is important to recognize that the community is in the early stages of a much needed but much longer term dialogue on this subject the proposals made in this article are admittedly but a starting point and but one way forward yet they hopefully provide a small enough set of practical guideposts around which policymakers and practitioners could begin to unite formulating international policies on climate mitigation and adaption suggests that overcoming water challenges will not be an easy task but one that will bear no less critical impacts on human well being and environmental integrity for many decades to come conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards funding body none acknowledgements none 
1144,the economic development environmental protection dichotomy is an out dated construct a 21st century approach to the world s water problems is progressively being developed by researchers and practitioners who are combining traditional and ecosystem based engineering systems to yield cost effective solutions given the continuing and widespread loss of ecological services and functions water security in a multi generational sdg context requires a meaningful global commitment to redirect the current downward trajectory in both i the state of the world s ecosystems and the services they provide to society and ii our collective level of stewardship of these important resources achieving sustainable water security will require overcoming strategic challenges related to protected areas ecosystem based solutions research water observatories and expanded technical readiness it also needs to address other limitations and demands related to water infrastructure economies human settlements and water quality sanitation and health four globally significant actions can support the adoption of more efficient and sustainable water futures green infrastructure watershed banks an accelerated global research and solutions program a new global water ecosystem services observatory and an improved technical capacity workforce development initiative finally the engagement of relevant stakeholders from academia government the private sector and civil society are needed to ensure that humankind will be able to meet its water security goals and commitments including those expressed in the sustainable development agenda keywords ecosystem based solutions water related ecosystem services sustainable water security green infrastructure 1 introduction an sdg inspired vision of water security given the central role of water to human enterprise the successful achievement of nearly all of the sustainable development goals will depend on water the integrity of the environment underpins a reliable water resource base and well managed environments offer essential and low cost public goods and services thus if these aquatic environments and their concomitant services are managed with a long time horizon in mind the essence of sustainability they will provide a critical foundation to human well being and economic development iucn 2018 defines nature based solutions as actions to protect sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively simultaneously providing human well being and biodiversity benefits it has also been a central focus of the 2018 world water assessment program s 2018 report wwap un water 2018 for the purposes of this article we use ecosystem based solutions interchangably with this other nomenclature the current heavy reliance on modern centralized engineering solutions to water problems typically ignores more cost effective problem prevention and collaterally destroys environmental systems that produce renewable freshwater resources these realities can be used to motivate a fundamental change in the way water security in the sense of the collective definition articulated through the high level panel on water focal points see section 3 could be effected through innovations in the arena of traditional engineering linked to the services provided by natural capital essential to any success in this domain will be a formal recognition of the role of environmental stewardship combining the realities of the day with aspirations for the future suggests a vision box 1 which we propose as a useful guidepost for formulating water related policies and interventions during the execution phase of the sdgs the remainder of this paper highlights the challenges and opportunities in realizing this vision 2 the ecosystem services challenge fresh water serves many roles in the earth system sustaining our climate biosphere and human society the availability of renewable and reliable water resources the key to human water security cannot be achieved on a truly sustainable basis without a well functioning environment capable of supporting adequate resource quantity quality and timing ecological integrity the combination of the biodiversity and ecosystem processes that characterize an area at a given point in time bridgewater et al 2014 needs to also be viewed as an integral building block of the sustainable development agenda water related ecosystem services include a broad array of benefits such as the provision of clean water supplies water for farming and food processing fish protein and greater resilience to climate extremes like flooding box 2 they also convey values in many parts of the world that are less visible but are equally important in social environmental and economic realms díaz et al 2018 pascual et al 2017 much has been written on the global water crisis with regard to scarcity pollution and lack of clean drinking water and sanitation available to large segments of the world s population fao 2012 hoekstra et al 2012 who unicef jmp 2016 wwap 2015 2016 water scarcity already affects more than 40 of the global population and water crises are now ranked as third in the top 10 global risks to the world economy wef 2017 water scarcity is projected to increase substantially well into the future fao 2012 wwap un water 2018 with global demand for water services from industry agriculture and domestic use sectors projected to rise by 20 30 in 2050 burek et al 2016 many of these problems proliferate as a by product of development in the absence of adequate environmental management harrison et al 2016 vörösmarty et al 2010 to achieve human water security modern centralized engineering based solutions frequently have been promoted addams et al 2009 gleick 2003 hansjürgens et al 2016 tockner et al 2016 in many cases ignoring more cost effective problem prevention or mitigation achievable through improved management of natural infrastructure palmer et al 2010 2015 while traditional engineering approaches hereafter referred to as grey infrastructure without question convey immediate benefits in addressing a target water problem they typically have been costly to install often outstrip the technical capacity of many nations to operate and maintain and in many cases impair environmental systems this includes green infrastructure natural and semi natural ecosystems and other environmental features designed and managed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services that serve as the foundation or source for renewable water supplies ec 2013 green et al 2015 unep 2014 vörösmarty et al 2013 elements of these two categories of infrastructure are often combined as with municipal water supplies relying on both protected watersheds as well as traditional water collection treatment and distribution systems dudley and stolton 2003 poustie et al 2015 kabisch et al 2017 in this context four strategic challenges if left unaddressed will continue to entrench the status quo making it increasingly difficult to move onto more sustainable water pathways for economic development i protected area shortfalls even if protected areas have not been created to protect water supplies for humans per se they often host valuable green infrastructure and deliver water and other types of ecosystem services to downstream users dudley et al 2016 even though there have been constant gains in protected area coverage in past years in some parts of the world 15 4 of terrestrial area and 8 4 of marine areas under national jurisdiction ec 2017 juffe bignoli et al 2014 the global protected area coverage still falls short of meeting chief strategic targets set by the cbd lewis et al 2017 watson et al 2014 despite some progress towards achieving some of the cbd aichi targets especially target 1 on awareness 11 on protected areas and 19 on knowledge further efforts are needed to reduce pressures on biodiversity and ecosystem services tittensor et al 2014 ipbes 2018 for example in the case of target 11 area coverage where most progress has been reported is only a component of this target and other essential aspects need to be fulfilled for the target to effectively be met some of these include the effective equitable management of biodiversity ecological representation of mixed ecosystems and the improvement of connectivity between sites barnes 2015 there are important needs to be considered in the case of freshwater biodiversity and achieving this target this target needs to account not only for area but also for the endemism of aquatic life forms freshwater ecosystem processes habitats pressures and essential actions to maintain them juffe bignoli et al 2016 strayer and dudgeon 2010 a baseline is required to report on national and global progress juffe bignoli et al 2016 furthermore protected areas are often not effectively managed and do not sufficiently cover areas that are of special importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services including those related to water provisioning services darwall et al 2011 holland et al 2012 harrison et al 2016 hermoso et al 2016 juffe bignoli et al 2014 despite the recognized importance of green infrastructure epa 2015 ec 2016 protected areas remain grossly underfunded relative to traditional water engineering investments global investments in protected areas and their maintenance which would otherwise help to reduce the cost of traditional water engineering services is less than 3 of standard water sector expenditures with us 10s of billions in annual shortfalls ashley and cashman 2006 mccarthy et al 2012 even when in place protected areas are often positioned inside regions that are characterized by impaired environments or do not include headwater or recharge regions sáenz et al 2016 limiting their value as natural capital fig 1 remarkably watersheds purposefully managed for municipal water supplies which should have as a preeminent concern their environmental protection have instead shown progressive degradation that is evident worldwide mcdonald et al 2016 these accumulated effects arise from population incursion poor land management nutrient and sediment pollution and substantially raise the costs of providing an essential human water service a 50 modeled rise in capital and operational costs for one third of cities recently analyzed ii lack of solutions oriented research on composite grey green infrastructure the idea of ecosystem based water supply systems is not new in fact it is part of a broader set of integrated water resource management iwrm approaches bunn 2016 poff et al 2015 the economic costs of relying solely on grey infrastructure is prohibitive for many countries and once built it often has unintended consequences loss of life or surrounding buit capital additional costs for repairs due to partial or total failures in the united states nearly 14 000 dams have been classified as high hazard asce 2013 combining grey with green infrastructure applied in the urban domain can increase resilience while providing other benefits e g attenuating urban heat island impacts and saving energy via green roofs providing natural habitats that buffer the impact of flood events kabisch et al 2017 however there has been insufficient work on the design and context dependency of performance for blending human engineering with natural ecosystems hermoso et al 2012 2015 and application of methodologies on a scale required by the sdgs has yet to be formalized iii observatories in decline the application of sdgs to support water sustainability requires both a broad and deep knowledge of freshwater ecosystem function and the dynamics of regional water use bhaduri et al 2016 however monitoring networks depicting the global water resource base and its supporting environments continue to deteriorate particularly in response to reduced funding and operational support thereby forcing researchers and practitioners to rely on ad hoc assemblages of data simulation models or best guess approaches geo 2014 wwap 2015 yet water resources managers cannot effectively plan or site grey infrastructure without detailed knowledge on the distribution and characteristics of existing infrastructure both natural and grey such data limitations are a common problem in developing countries poustie et al 2015 monitoring networks need to help ensure that investments in protecting and restoring water resources are effective which in turn can engender public confidence in the safety and reliability of their water supplies garrick et al 2017 with further development space based remote sensing could make a larger contribution to addressing these needs geo 2014 iv technical readiness in question significant human and institutional capacity gaps limit the technical readiness of water professionals in many countries unesco ihe 2013 moreover the additional knowledge needed to combine green with grey engineering for more cost effective human water security remains in its infancy and requires a paradigm shift in engineering technology training necessitating new interdisciplinary education programs worldwide new programs to build technical capacity especially in the global south are needed a recent example is a program funded by the united states agency for international development in partnership with the university of utah and mehran university in pakistan that is creating a center for advanced studies in water in pakistan burian et al 2017 the project is aligned with attaining the sdgs for water sustainability over a multi generational timeframe however will be difficult without a meaningful global commitment to addressing both the degradation of the world s drainage basins and their affiliated freshwater ecosystems as well as the commitment to adequate collective stewardship of natural capital to maintain their ecosystem services into the future garrick et al 2017 3 key interlinkages of ecosystem services with other sustainable development challenge domains this document is in response to an official request made by the high level panel on water hlpw 2016 which is co convened by the un secretary general and the world bank president and includes 11 heads of state and governments a general inquiry was posted to the community of water experts in six sub domains of the water security issue on the themes of water and the environment water infrastructure and investment resilient economies and societies and disaster risk reduction universal access to safe water and sanitation building partnerships and international cooperation and sustainable cities and human settlements we here deliver recommendations on the topic of water and environment specifically focused on water related ecosystem services and how they could be configured to support the sustainable development agenda box 3 given the interconnected nature of these six themes we were requested to explore the relationship of ecosystem services to these other high level challenges and to identify the co benefits that would emerge should the themes be addressed together these are discussed immediately below in so doing we also hope to identify some specific objectives and actions that as noted by others garrick et al 2017 are necessary to address sustainable development of water resources i e measurement valuation decision making and governance 3 1 water infrastructure our reliance on water engineering to provide secure freshwater resources extends to the earliest periods of human history vörösmarty et al 2015 but today reflects a heavy dependence on grey infrastructure and some of the largest built systems on the planet grey infrastructure is sometimes overbuilt and its operation and maintenance costs are often ignored and not properly accounted for into water projects resulting in less than optimal service palmer et al 2015 alternatively as water and sewer services proliferate wastewater treatment investments remain persistently underfunded wwap 2015 it is reasonable to question the overwhelming emphasis on such systems in lieu of green infrastructure alternatives i e the use of ecosystem services like floodplains for flood control or waste treatment as they have been shown to provide an equivalent service such a debate is a rich one with strong arguments on both sides of the question for instance in the developing world with poor or non existent water security grey infrastructure is often seen as the only viable solution over an immediate timeframe muller et al 2015 further where reliability must be high green systems have not yet been fully justified at the same time grey systems are relatively inflexible with much collateral and long term potential damage to ecosystems palmer et al 2015 alternatives to an often overdesigned grey infrastructure include demand management or a reliance on small scale systems but these are seldom addressed in planning also benefit cost economics for green infrastructure is much less well developed relative to traditional engineering thus limiting its attractiveness as an investment option if one accepts the importance of maintaining ecosystem services their impairment represents water security threats with a substantial lost value to society meriting rehabilitation post hoc reparation is costly for example up to us 80 billion spent to rehabilitate the yamatogawa river in japan a relatively small basin inhabited by only 2 1 million people tsuzuki and yoneda 2012 even when investments are made follow up monitoring on the effectiveness of stream rehabilitation interventions is seldom attempted bernhardt et al 2005 with the possibility that ineffective investment goes undetected or is even replicated in other regions additonally this lack of monitoring and impact evaluation of rehabilitation and restoration means that the effectiveness of these processes may not be fully realized where a nation s ability to invest in traditional water engineering solutions create local technical capacity and maintain workforce readiness is limited green infrastructure solutions can provide cost effective alternatives to grey engineering with additional environmental economic and social benefits based on existing scientific knowledge elsevier 2016 green et al 2015 many management options are available including combinations of grey and green approaches garrick et al 2017 wwap un water 2018 with specific choices determined by budget constraints and the existence of natural capital assets young 2000 riparian vegetation acting as green infrastructure is increasingly considered valuable for safeguarding water services especially in latin america grieg gran and porras 2012 veiga and gavaldão 2012 properly designed green infrastructure e g natural areas delivering urban water supplies or urban rainfall gardens provides a less costly service for flash flood reduction compared to replacing or upgrading sewer mains epa 2015 more generally cities may be the ideal proving ground for new grey green infrastructure especially where the reliability of traditional systems can be combined with the inherent environmental protection of green systems palmer et al 2015 vollmer et al 2016 such solutions can also generate a significant number of jobs thereby contributing to sustainable social and economic development wwap 2016 a new paradigm for developing countries and the sdgs that embeds the economic valuation of ecosystem services and green infrastructure into traditional benefit cost analysis could stimulate new blended engineering approaches to water security elsevier 2016 poff et al 2015 there is growing concern that for many parts of the world including the usa the aging of infrastructure threatens to decrease water management efficiencies and lead to catastrophic failures in times of floods the replacement of these dated grey water infrastructure facilities with green infrastructure alternatives could provide capital savings to support a broader green infrastructure upgrade important initiatives with hybrid systems are available at local scales for example engineering and biological measures sedimentation biofiltration can be used for the treatment of stormwater jurczak et al 2018 however a broader scale perspective is required to address the challenge of establishing human water security green et al 2015 harrison et al 2016 valderrama et al 2017 3 2 resilient economies an important byproduct of blending grey green water engineering would be a fundamentally new approach regarding the use of natural assets to help attain sdg 6 and universal water security this greater water security would in turn support many other goals such as sdg 2 on food and sdg 15 on conservation restoration and sustainable use of freshwater ecosystems and their services see box 3 if natural capital is viewed as a building block of resilient water engineering systems then its state and stewardship should become an intrinsic part of the planning process bennett et al 2016 this perspective would have the practical impact of expanding the decision trade off space for acceptable water allocations to industry energy and food versus other essential societal needs like public water supply or safeguarding the environment garrick et al 2017 investing in natural capital and its water related ecosystem services will be especially significant for sectors heavily dependent on water e g 95 of jobs in the agriculture sector 30 of jobs in the industry sector and 10 of jobs in the services sector wwap 2016 the emergence of new business models based on verifiable science based metrics that support sustainable impact investment choices by recognizing good corporate practices can represent an important turning point in how society values ecological integrity in the broader economy vörösmarty et al 2018 such models would seek structural market changes and practices that account for and value natural capital based on data and analytics that allow companies to objectively evaluate costs and benefits vogl et al 2017 3 3 human settlements global population is forecast to expand during the period of the sdgs and through mid century to 9 10 billion people lutz et al 2014 after 2025 all of this growth will be in the world s cities as global rural populations begin to decline un 2014 with urban growth will come increasing demands for energy materials and infrastructure yet this growth already outpaces the capacity of governments to build essential infrastructure creating informal settlements or slums often along rivers and riparian areas lutz et al 2014 there may be more than 200 000 world communities that can be classified as slums and the un suggests that today these are where 1 in 3 urban dwellers reside un habitat 2010 who and un habitat 2010 un water wwap 2015 highlights both the challenges and potential solutions for water the world s slum population which is expected to reach nearly 900 million by 2020 is both underserved with respect to basic water needs and also more vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events it is however possible to improve performance of urban water supply systems while continuing to expand the system and addressing the needs of the poor under the specter of climate change these development deficiencies turn into adaptation deficits satterthwaite et al 2007 the challenge of supplying adequate freshwater under uncertain future climate is exacerbated in xeric coastal and riverine cities approximately 34 of the global urban population lives in arid regions mcgranahan et al 2005 and more than 150 million people today are dependent on urban water supplies that show perennial shortage with forecasts for that number to rise to 1 billion by mid century mcdonald et al 2011 further more than 50 of the world s urban population lives along coastlines or rivers mcgranahan et al 2005 in these locations the most vulnerable are typically the urban poor in part because they often live in hazardous locations such as floodplains in these contexts protected watersheds and their associated ecosystem services can play an important role in managing the global transformation to an urbanized planet for example cities can rely on the protective role of ecosystem services by using natural lowlands as relief valves to allow dense settlements to escape the impact of river floods as is current practice by the netherlands room for the river programme roth and warner 2007 or in the mississippi river basin usace iwr 2000 for example the netherlands programme recognized the flood risk reduction benefits of giving more space to rivers to increase their discharge capacity instead of building higher dikes in the face of increasing impacts of extreme flood events which are likely to be exacerbated by climate change this was done by constructing a bypass channel an island in the river waal and bridges to improve the connectivity of the area both the bypass channel and the island form a river park that provides recreational ecological and aesthetic benefits besides flood risk protection van herk et al 2015 wla 2017 another example is low impact development lid design and technologies within cities that focus on a range of stormwater management outcomes from restoring water quality to flood prevention and rainwater harvesting lid design includes hydrologic analysis in site planning integrated management of erosion and sediment control as well as public outreach lid technologies include green roofs rain gardens permeable pavement retention cells and treatment swales lid has been implemented in the usa europe australia new zealand and china chang et al 2018 a study of community demand in jakarta also showed that the public would be willing to pay for freshwater ecosystem protection and rehabilitation that result in increased water security vollmer et al 2016 this includes park space along the river and conservation of forests in the upper part of the catchment outside of the city and possibly also support for a widened channel for flood risk mitigation the key will be to create solution frameworks to more sensibly manage the inevitable trade offs between urban water provision and urban infrastructure protection while simultaneously preserving water flows for aquatic ecosystem health and biodiversity 3 4 water quality sanitation and health significant direct health impacts occur when ecosystem services are no longer able to meet human water security needs healthy ecosystems are highly effective at improving water quality and quantity russi et al 2013 teeb 2010 removing pathogenic microbes sequestering and converting inorganic ions and transforming persistent organic pollutants teeb 2010 impairing or degrading ecosystems especially those directly linked to the freshwater supply fig 1 yields significant consequences for sanitation and hygiene even in places like the u s a nearly 50 million people have used public water systems containing concentrations of chemicals and bacteria that exceed regulatory limits duhigg 2009 the recent transboundary waters assessment programme twap synthesis report tabulated 1 4 billion people half the population living in transboundary basins facing serious and increasing risks due to pollution unep dhi and unep 2016 these realities are not inconsequential to the basic water goals sdg 6 of the sustainable development agenda insofar as inland aquatic ecosystems convey 80 of sustainable water supply to humans yet are broadly degraded vörösmarty et al 2010 this has already elevated costs for remediation to the level of us 100s of billions worldwide ashley and cashman 2006 vörösmarty et al 2010 if left unchecked such degraded aquatic ecosystems produce substantial risks to human health one of countless examples occurred in 2014 in toledo ohio usa which had to temporarily cease drinking water operations due to the presence of cyanotoxins produced by blue green algae in lake erie a result of poor management of point and non point source pollution across contributing landscapes what was once considered a sporadic phenomenon such harmful algal blooms have proliferated both in the u s and globally over only the last 30 years whoi 2016 4 brief overview of the current landscape of the challenge 4 1 diagnosing the challenge while there is no shortage of individual challenges associated with ecosystem services that support water in the context of the sdgs box 3 these can be synthesized into a small number of urgent concerns seven such challenges areas are presented below ranging from benchmarking the current state of affairs with respect to water related ecosystem services to the impact of their loss their surveillance and approaches to coping with ongoing water stress 4 1 1 ecosystems in decline maintaining healthy ecosystems in light of ongoing economic development remains a persistent challenge with a global disappearance of the wild in the contemporary world sanderson et al 2002 in a turn of the century benchmark study the millennium ecosystem assessment mea 2005 demonstrated that all but one of 13 major ecosystem classes was in decline since this time numerous studies have shown a deterioration of these ecosystems and their services today and into the future living planet index wwf 2016 unep geo 5 unep 2012 and human ecological footprint mancini et al 2016 four recently launched landmark assessment reports of the intergovernmental science policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services ipbes with 129 member governments across four world regions the americas asia and the pacific africa as well as europe and central asia show alarming trends of declining biodiversity and ecosystem services ipbes n d in the americas 65 per cent of biodiversity and ecosystem conditions that are important for human well being are declining with 21 per cent declining strongly wetlands have been highly transformed across large areas of the american continent ipbes 2018 this loss of healthy ecosystems translates to a pandemic loss of effective support

of global species loss at least 126 000 described species rely directly on freshwater habitats including many diverse plants invertebrates and vertebrates balian et al 2008 iucn 2016 this number while based on the most comprehensive global analysis thus far is certainly an underestimate and is likely to grow to over 1 million species if currently undescribed species are included iucn 2016 of the 28 000 freshwater dependent species that have been assessed for the iucn red list of threatened species www iucnredlist org thus far approximately one third are threatened with extinction carrizo et al 2017 some estimates place the per area rates of imperilment and extinction for freshwater species likely to be 100s if not 1000s of times more rapid than in land or ocean strayer and dudgeon 2010 the

riversymposium 2017 pittock et al 2015 poff et al 2010 poff and matthews 2013 while certainly water engineering works such as dams and reservoirs are sometimes necessary to address water security the challenge is how to manage the negative effects these produce on natural flows and freshwater and riparian biodiversity relating to the physical chemical and biological impacts they confer emphasis on renewable energy under the paris agreement is likely to stimulate investment in hydropower iha 2016 with severe negative impacts on aquatic biodiversity strayer and dudgeon 2010 in certain parts of the world environmental flow protection is intimately connected with issues of the social and associated cultural values of water morgan 2012 one example is the national cultural flows research project in australia that aims to align indigenous water allocations in australia s water planning and management efforts ensuring appropriate delivery and maintenance of the cultural social and spiritual benefits in systems like the murray darling basin national cultural flows research project 2018 the twap unep dhi and unep 2016 noted that extinction risk to freshwater biodiversity is moderate to very high in 70 of the area of transboundary river basins indicating a strong need for international cooperation to address this issue important international agreements promote the effective transboundary management of aquatic systems within countries but also across boundaries for example the convention on wetlands ramsar provides a framework for national and international action towards the conservation and adequate use of wetlands and their resources ramsar et al 2014 the convention on migratory species cms is also focused on the protection of species that migrate across or outside national jurisdictional boundaries https www cms int en convention text hogan 2011 identified ca 30 species of freshwater fishes that meet all the criteria for cms listing and a further ca 10 species that might benefit from a listing there are 29 freshwater megafauna species which represent flagships for the conservation of freshwater ecosystems currently listed by cms carrizo et al 2017 4 1 3 lost ecosystem services mean rising economic costs the supporting environment is rapidly losing its ability to deliver services day et al 2014 with wetlands of particular value to water security in terms of pollution abatement fisheries and flood control particularly in decline overall declines represent an economic loss of us 4 3 20 2 trillion in ecosystem services between 1997 and 2011 costanza et al 2014a nevertheless in most countries funding for ecosystem protection for water services and infrastructure is neither sufficient nor sustainable wwap 2015 despite high return on investment ratios e g 3 to 1 recognized in china china water risk 2016 for protected areas that are designed to convey ecosystem services of many types less than 6 of countries reporting to cbd indicated adequate resources for the management of such areas watson et al 2014 yet a recent study showed that staff and budget capacity were the strongest predictor of the conservation impact of protected areas gill et al 2017 a survey of protected areas in the southeast usa showed that most protected areas have fewer resources dedicated to freshwater conservation and management than to other activities and some completely lack the necessary resources mcdonald et al 2016 thieme et al 2012 this is further evident in many populated parts of the world where protected areas face increasing threats due to their proximity to poorly managed watersheds and other external stressors harrison et al 2016 thieme et al 2012 which raises the cost of protected area management see fig 1 4 1 4 funding of protected ecosystems and their services despite the fundamental role of ecosystem based solutions in biodiversity conservation and provision of ecosystem services investment in these solutions remains well below 1 of total investment in water resources management infrastructure wwap un water 2018 governments businesses and donors invested only us 25 billion in 2015 on payments for green infrastructure for water directed at rehabilitating and or protecting 487 million ha under watershed management bennett and ruef 2016 such investments included public subsidies e g government based payment for watershed services user driven watershed investments e g payments from water users such as water utilities or companies to conserve restore or create green infrastructure water quality trading and offsets and water markets that trade water rights bennett and ruef 2016 these interventions relied primarily on public subsidies but also collective actions such as water trust funds the potential for success of payment for watershed services schemes is regionally highly variable harrison et al 2016 but has been shown to be successful in some areas abell et al 2017 a new initiative under development is the cloud forest blue energy mechanism that aims to mobilize domestic commercial finance to reforest and conserve cloud forests that provide crucial benefits to the hydropower industry in latin america it is based on a pay for success financing model where hydropower plants pay for the ecosystem benefits provided by restored cloud forests the lab 2018 in some parts of the world especially in developing countries there is a severe underfunding of protected areas mccarthy et al 2012 watson et al 2014 and an additional area of 2 2 million km2 of land and inland waters is needed to be effectively managed and sufficiently cover areas that are of special importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services juffe bignoli et al 2014 preserving and effectively managing all terrestrial sites for global taxa protection was estimated to cost us 76 1 billion annually mccarthy et al 2012 to put this in perspective more than us 1 trillion will be needed by the traditional water services sector alone by year 2030 ashley and cashman 2006 4 1 5 tracking metrics observational networks and monitoring systems through remote sensing in situ sampling ground truthing surveys to evaluate the ways in which humans control degrade or possibly enhance water services and thus define the collective significance of these changes remains an urgent global need gardner et al 2015 turak et al 2017 garrick et al 2017 wwap un water 2018 consistent and objective information on the state of water resources including their use and management is frequently missing inadequate or unavailable with the situation for water quality data even more severe fao 2006 wwap 2015 currently water observation networks over most parts of the world provide only partial or unreliable data on surface and groundwater quantity and quality with a similar paucity of information with respect to wastewater related services geo 2014 wwap 2009 furthermore several studies show only static snapshots of the state of water services at a particular time and place failing to include a more comprehensive view of water challenge trends over time and across different regions in the world for example inability to measure all of the implications of an extreme precipitation event for erosion and pollution mobilization reflects our inability to undertake fully integrated monitoring programs this has an obvious and direct practical implication for water system planning and decision making wwap 2015 the situation is particularly severe in the least developed countries where long term sustainability clearly hinges on reliable water data in addition the potential for using remote sensing data to help address these monitoring needs should be further explored water indicators of a systematic and dynamic nature e g near real time from the earth system sciences can provide long term annual and sub annual tracking of water availability fao 2006 which can be combined with coincident socio economic changes to compute water vulnerability indicators vollmer et al 2016 such a capability would be an important step forward in creating an operational and dynamic monitoring capability this is critical as hydrologic change keeps pace or not with climate change milly et al 2008 nrc cohs 2011 this would be a necessary precursor for a sustained and comprehensive global water assessment procedure 4 1 6 capacity building for water related sdg support achieving long term positive environmental benefits is an especially important outcome of capacity development particularly if they can be used to train a next generation of practitioners and decision makers in strengthening policies strategies and legal frameworks that support the sustainable use of water related ecosystem services unesco ihe 2013 wyborn et al 2016 however this has not been well implemented in terms of capacity only 14 of 108 surveyed nations were capable of instituting the johannesburg target on integrated water resource management iwrm wwap 2006 in addition to traditional water engineering and technology training current and future professionals need to be trained to bettter understand and then use water related ecosystem services datasets and tools with blended engineering approaches future earth 2016 siwi 2016 start 2016 swfp 2016 unesco ihe 2013 un water 2015 this includes accounting of the benefits of water related ecosystem services to improve quality of life as well as to evaluate ecosystem states and trajectories in addition an appreciation of the cross linkages among the sdgs will be essential a general framework for mapping these interactions has been proposed nilsson et al 2016 and a logical next step is to apply this more specificially to the sdg targets that are relevant to freshwater bhaduri et al 2016 major investments are needed in water education and capacity building particularly in africa where the gap between needs and reality is highest 4 2 key actors and activities existing mechanisms are in place to address many of the challenges highlighted in this document advanced by a community that recognizes a high demand for water related ecosystem services and an opportunity to implement cost effective actions towards watershed protection restoration and sustainable management rodríguez osuna 2015 teeb 2010 such mechanisms include payments for watershed services pws or water quality quantity trading markets and reciprocal or in kind agreements water funds support for research and applications there is also a ready made community of actors contributing to water related ecosystem services protection or capacity development that could jointly be mobilized for protection and management efforts in the context of the sdgs table 1 for example unesco s international hydrological programme ihp is the intergovernmental program of the un system devoted to water research water resources management education and capacity building since its foundation in 1975 ihp has evolved from an international hydrological research program into an institution with a broader agenda to facilitate education and capacity building and improve water resources management and governance this program has been implemented in six year stages and is in its eight implementation phase 2014 2021 this current phase focuses on six thematic areas 1 water related disaster and hydrological changes 2 groundwater in a changing environment 3 addressing water scarcity and quality 4 water and human settlements of the future 5 ecohydrology engineering harmony for a sustainable world and 6 water education key to water security unesco 2018 an affiliated unesco european regional center for ecohydrology links the understanding of relationships between hydrological and biological processes at different scales to improve human water security enhance biodiversity and other opportunities for sustainable development ecohydrology views ecosystem processes as management tools to achieve sustainability by stating multidimensional objectives to manage catchments wbsrc water biodiversity ecosystem services for society resilience to climatic changes and cultural heritage zalewski 2000 zalewski et al 2017 the wbsrc strategy aims at gaining synergies between ecosystem based solutions and the circular economy zalewski et al 2017 5 call to action managing supplies quality and risk the economic development environmental protection dichotomy is an out dated construct and a 21st century approach to the water crisis young 2000 is progressively being developed by researchers and practitioners in which they combine traditional and ecosystem based engineering solutions a major strategic initiative is proposed here four strategic globally significant supporting actions are shown here as opportunities to counterbalance trends in the deterioration of water related ecosystem services as well as in the erosion of the capacity of sdg signatory states to address four main strategic water challenges as outlined in section 2 green infrastructure watershed banks comprising natural ecosystem based assets that would be identified and employed in water delivery systems designed for long term cost effective human use an accelerated global research and solutions program on coupled human environment engineered systems based on cost benefit analyses that explicitly evaluate green infrastructure to attain universal human water security through well functioning integral environments a new global water ecosystem services observatory to assess progress or backsliding in sustainable management of water assets combining state of the art earth observations survey data and simulation models depicting conditions from worldwide to local scales and with near real time operational coverage and an expanded capacity workforce development initiative to create universal readiness among un member states to produce a next generation of environmental planners and water practitioners the supporting initiatives are presented here as durable actions to the development agenda during the full sdg timeframe but also post 2030 a brief annotated description is offered in box 4 a diverse set of stakeholders from academia government the private sector and civil society would need to be engaged to ensure success a global inventory of watershed banks would help to identify candidate natural assets to be combined ultimately with grey approaches research of both a basic and applied nature would need to include the scientific community and engineers supported by public funding agencies but also through innovation grants from foundations and private sector research and development r d observatory and monitoring components of such a program would involve a similar set of actors to expand technical capacity international research societies technical schools and universities un and other development oriented educational programs and private sector internal training programs would need to be engaged 6 conclusion a growing and rapidly urbanizing population and its associated production and consumption of energy and materials will impact fresh water systems for the foreseeable future yet these drivers and their impacts have not been sufficiently controlled by current conservation and mitigation measures garrick et al 2017 green et al 2015 harrison et al 2016 rendering improved environmental management for water security a persistent societal imperative over the entire sdg execution period if one accepts the premise that durable water security requires well functioning ecosystems a central tenet of sdg 6 expressed through target 6 6 then this improvement we speak of becomes critical as the biocapacity or carrying capacity of ecosystems catchments and the biosphere at large to provide water services to humankind is likely to otherwise continue its long term decline global footprint network 2016 and compromise the very water security that sdg 6 seeks in the context of sustainability new solutions become apparent at once recognizing the need to raise the level of human economic well being while at the same time preserving the underlying benefits of natural capital in water provisioning innovation in the evolving 21st century water sector will be central to such a transformation and a critical part of this innovation will be a deeper understanding of ecosystem services and appreciation of how these can be used productively and in tandem with traditionally engineered systems palmer et al 2015 one could argue that the degree to which we have thus far been successful or not in meeting the water challenge is predicated on our more or less unitary focus on traditional engineering to address society s growing water challenges an expanded approach that includes an admittedly more complex and unwieldy set of multiple perspectives that embody ecology engineering economics governance ethics and culture will undoubtedly be a challenge for researchers and practitioners to achieve the broad scale absence of integrated water resource management benefits vörösmarty et al 2010 themselves multi dimensional is a testament to this challenge ahead in this context it is important to recognize that the community is in the early stages of a much needed but much longer term dialogue on this subject the proposals made in this article are admittedly but a starting point and but one way forward yet they hopefully provide a small enough set of practical guideposts around which policymakers and practitioners could begin to unite formulating international policies on climate mitigation and adaption suggests that overcoming water challenges will not be an easy task but one that will bear no less critical impacts on human well being and environmental integrity for many decades to come conflict of interest none declared ethical statement
