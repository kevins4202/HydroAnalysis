8615,when using a ground water elevation dataset for the development of a ground water model it is prudent to first evaluate the quality of the data before using it in a ground water model however it may not be practical to evaluate every data point when working with large datasets associated with a regional model to isolate misrepresentative points in a large dataset a graphical technique has been developed which examines the variance of ground water elevation values from an unconfined aquifer to identify points with high variance the potential outliers identified using the graphical variogram process are subsequently evaluated by reviewing well borings well installation records and available time series of water level measurements to retain or reject outlier status supplemental ground elevation data from a digital elevation model is used to create a threshold on the experimental variogram of the ground water elevation data this process is verified using a developed synthetic ground water dataset then applied to a case study at the fort leonard wood military reservation missouri the method showed good results in identifying points that were justified for removal upon inspection of the available records and provides recommendations based on common causes of error with this method s reliance on both an experimental variogram of measured water levels and a binned variogram of ground elevation measures it naturally fits as a preprocessing step that can be applied prior to kriging keywords outlier detection spatial outlier variogram supplemental topographic data gradient 1 introduction pucci and murashige 1987 state that before a ground water resource investigation is established or a hydraulic model developed existing ground water measurements should first be evaluated for their usefulness there are many potential sources of error in measures of the potentiometric surface including human error in measuring the depth to static water level inaccurate well coordinates measurements taken directly after well completion before the water level has stabilized and non representative measurements in wells with long completion intervals and significant vertical gradients elçi et al 2003 hill rowley et al 2003 snyder 2008 arihood 2009 tremblay et al 2015 all these sources of error may be present in databases that are not always systematically validated with quality control often absent and reliability in the measurements highly variable depending on where the data is sourced tremblay et al 2015 in addition to sampling errors there are naturally occurring for example sources or sinks from karst and or anthropogenic features such as leaking water from supply pipelines which can create a localized effect on the potentiometric surface which may skew the characterization of the more regional surface especially when monitoring locations are relatively sparse when this is the case points reflecting such local variability should be considered for exclusion from a regional model such data points that differ significantly from neighboring points for the reasons given above are referred to as spatial outliers shekhar et al 2003 chen et al 2008 liu et al 2001 spatial outliers differ from global outliers in that global outliers are identified by comparison with the aggregate of the entire population while spatial outliers are those that go against regional trends or do not maintain local continuity there are two general methods applied to detect spatial outliers the most common approach is a quantitative method which looks at the residual between a point and a predicted value at the same location then applies some mathematical method to determine if the residual is significant tremblay et al 2015 shekhar et al 2003 miller et al 1997 bardossy and kundzewicz 1990 liu et al 2001 quantitative methods such as local morans i and getis ord gi check the spatial association to identify clusters of data or distinctly isolated data getis and ord 1992 rogerson 2015 fu et al 2015 points that do not cluster are significantly different than their neighbors and may be identified as spatial outliers the second method is identified by shekhar et al 2003 and chen et al 2008 as a graphical method which is based on the visualization of spatial data to highlight spatial outliers graphical methods rely on the qualitative identification of outliers which appear to fall outside of the grouping of the remainder of the data and thus lack defined criteria for when a point on the graph qualifies as an outlier when discussing different outlier detection methods bardossy and kundzewicz 1990 and shekhar et al 2003 discuss the conceptual use of an experimental variogram as a way of identifying outlying points however the presentation of a systematic approach to selecting outlying points based on a variogram is absent a common assumption in the development of ground water models is that for unconfined conditions the ground water table is a smoothed version of the topographic surface king 1899 domenico and schwartz 1998 blauvelt and fullmer 2011 this assumption enables the incorporation of a ground elevation dataset to supplement sparse ground water elevation gwe measurements when developing a model of the potentiometric surface desbarats et al 2002 boezio et al 2005 2006 hoeksema et al 1989 the purpose of this paper is to present a new graphical approach to identify potential spatial outliers which use a digital elevation model dem dataset to establish criteria for detecting spatial outliers in ground water level measurements from an unconfined aquifer unlike those in the literature this approach addresses regional trends at the site in addition to comparing each individual data point to its neighbors thus fully using all point to point relationships to demonstrate the applicability of the approach it is used to perform an outlier analysis on a dataset collected at fort leonard wood missouri where multiple monitoring well mw networks have been established to sample the quality of the regional aquifer 2 methods variogram a common geostatistical tool is key to this method a variogram is used to describe the difference between pairs of points based on the distance between the points in pairs goovaerts 1997 presents the variogram function as 1 γ s 1 2 n s α 1 n h u α h u α s 2 where h a m e a s u r e m e n t o f s o m e s c a l e r q u a n t i t y s a v e c t o r s e p a r a t i n g t w o d a t a v a l u e s n s n u m b e r o f d a t a p a i r s w i t h i n t h e c l a s s o f d i s t a n c e a n d d i r e c t i o n o f s u a v e c t o r o f s p a t i a l c o o r d i n a t e s o f t h e α th p o i n t the γ s values from equation 1 will be referred to here as the variance although other authors refer to it as the variability journel and huijbregts 1997 or the semi variance goovaerts 1997 the variogram is usually either expressed as a binned variogram or a variogram cloud a variogram cloud also referred to as an experimental variogram plots half the squared difference of every pair of points against the separation distance for that pair so every separation vector s is considered and n is one when there are no data pairs separated by the same vector for the binned variogram point pairs are separated into distance bins which only include pairs in which points are separated by a specified range of the magnitude of s within each distance bin pairs are further classified by the direction in which they are separated half the average squared difference of each directional class is plotted within each bin of separation distance the principal assumption used in this analysis is that the potentiometric surface is a smoothed version of the topographic surface it is noted that this common assumption is not universally valid haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 and others have addressed the pitfalls with this assumption however for many sites where hydrogeological data are relatively scarce including the one described subsequently in this paper the smoothed topographic surface assumption is a reasonable point of departure for characterizing the ground water elevation surface this assumption should always be evaluated for each individual case as it may not always hold blauvelt and fullmer 2011 condon and maxwell 2015 the main assumption allows for the comparison of gwe variogram cloud to a threshold derived from a dem binned variogram the model consists of the following steps 1 characterize the local and regional gradient scales using site specific topographic data to determine the extent of the elevation dataset 2 develop a binned variogram of the dem with an extent corresponding to the maximum local topographic gradient determined in the prior step 3 the upper boundary of the dem binned variogram serves as a threshold compare the variogram cloud of the ground water dataset to the binned variogram of the dem dataset 4 identify points on the ground water variogram cloud that lie above the dem binned variogram threshold 5 for the points selected on the variogram cloud in the previous step identify wells with at least two links where a linkage is a connection drawn between two data points represented by a single point on the variogram cloud 6 review boring logs well completion records water level measurement data and other site specific data to retain or reject high linkage points as spatial outliers as an initial processing step for this method the gwe dataset to be tested is input into a gis database along with a dem which will be used to represent the topographic surface a 30 ft 10 m resolution dem was used in this study an issue of scale arises when comparing the primary ground water level measures which have a defined domain to a dem dataset which has no defined domain the approach used here to determine the appropriate dem domain was to use only dem values lying within a radial extent about each ground water measure equal to the scale of local continuity of the ground water dataset the method of finding the local scale derived from the work of silliman and frost 1998 looked at the response of calculated gradients to changes in the extent of the dem domenico and schwartz 1998 define the gradient of a scalar field of some attribute a as 2 a a x i a y j a z k the gradient was calculated using the three point problem as presented by vacher 2005 the gradient direction expressed in degrees azimuth of each possible point trio within the spatial dataset was plotted against the area of the triangle formed by that point trio to rule out point trios that were close to falling along a line only trios with an inner acute angle greater than a prescribed tolerance were used in the computation from these gradient direction plots as shown in fig 1 it is observed that for small triangular areas there is no relation between the gradient direction of point trios with the same calculated area however with increasing calculation area or point trios separated by a greater distance the gradient directions begin to converge to a single value visually this behavior can roughly be described as a hummocky surface lying on a tilted plane at a smaller scale the surface gradient is dependent upon location where at the region scale with adequate spacing between point trios the gradient of the underlying surface becomes apparent the domain of the dem to be used is found by identifying the area at which the gradient direction first begins to converge to a regional value this triangular area is then used to solve for the radius of a circle with equivalent area the radial extent equal to this radius about the ground water dataset is used to define the domain to be used for the dem now a relationship can be developed between the gradient and variance of the primary and secondary variable ground water elevations and topographic elevation founded upon our main assumption that at the same location the gradient of the topographic surface is greater than or equal to the gradient of the potentiometric surface the direction of the gradient a corresponds to the direction of greatest change in attribute a the magnitude of a for a planar surface is the greatest level of change per unit length that will occur on that surface the gradient of a planar surface is calculated using any three points that do not fall along a line and the three point problem can be simplified to a two point problem if the direction of the gradient is known with a known gradient direction the magnitude of the gradient can be determined from the residual of two points separated in that direction 3 a r a s a where r a t h e d i f f e r e n c e b e t w e e n a p a i r o f p o i n t s s e p a r a t e d b y s a s a v e c t o r s e p a r a t i n g a p a i r o f p o i n t s i n t h e g r a d i e n t d i r e c t i o n when the direction of the gradient is not known a reasonable approximation of the planar surface gradient can be found by looking at the residual of every pair of points in the domain the magnitude of the gradient is approximated as the greatest residual between a pair of points in the domain divided by the magnitude of the vector separating the pair of points and the direction of the gradient is a direction parallel to the vector separating the two points 4 a r max s max with 5 r max m a x r i where r i t h e r e s i d u a l o f t h e i th p a i r o f p o i n t s l y i n g o n a p l a n e s max v e c t o r s e p a r a t i n g a p a i r o f p o i n t s c o r r e s p o n d i n g t o r max now consider that the variance eq 1 and gradient approximation eq 4 both consider the residual of every point pair on the area of interest so for a set of data on the same domain 6 r i h u α h u α s from eq 4 we expect the variance corresponding to the points separated in the direction of the gradient to be at r i r max therefore the greatest value from h u α h u α s corresponds to the greatest variance and is expected to result from a pair of points separated in the direction of the gradient thus for each separation distance the largest variance to occur is dependent on the gradient between the points the inherent variability of the topographic surface causes the gradient to fluctuate over the entire domain of interest to find a representative variance which adequately describes the gradient of the entire domain the average variance corresponding to the directional bin with the highest average variance from the binned dem variogram should be used the maximum of the directional variance averages gives a good estimate of the average calculated gradient magnitude for different separation distances to target values on the gwe variogram cloud the maximum variance on the binned dem variogram can be used as a threshold when multiple points lie above this threshold the corresponding pairs should coincide with a single point that can be identified as a potential spatial outlier to isolate points above the threshold lines are drawn on a site map between pairs of gwe measures corresponding to each point lying above the dem threshold a point cannot be isolated as a potential outlier from a single linkage therefore at least two linkages are needed to identify a point as a potential spatial outlier however a point with two links may not be the source of high variance but rather be linked with two potential outlying points ideally there should be an iterative approach to removing the point with the greatest number of linkages and then repeating the analysis to ensure that only points contributing to the high variance are removed to replace this time consuming process it can be determined from the first iteration if a link should be associated with a point links to a point can be established as significant or not based on if they connect with a higher level candidate where a higher level candidate is one with more linkages a link only significantly contributes to a point if it does not connect with a higher level candidate a point is identified as a potential spatial outlier if it has at least two significant links for points identified as potential outliers justification should be provided through inspection of each point in order to retain the point as a spatial outlier 2 1 development of a synthetic dataset a synthetic dataset was created to test the validity of the method to create artificial ground water elevations that represented a smoothed version of the topography surface elevations gathered from a dem were divided into 24 equal sized bins each bin covering 15 feet of elevation for each of the 34 synthetic points the surface elevation at that point was multiplied by a coefficient ranging from 0 95 to 0 75 corresponding to the elevation bin it belonged to the lowest coefficient was used at points with the highest surface elevation and likewise the highest coefficient was used at the lowest surface elevation this produced a smoothing effect so that at topographic highs the difference in ground water and surface elevation was the greatest from the average of the original synthetic dataset six potential outlier points where added that corresponded to three levels of error the first level being the lowest level of error contained two points corresponding to plus and minus a single standard deviation from the mean of the synthetic dataset following this two second level error points were added whose values were plus and minus two standard deviations from the synthetic data mean and the two points with the highest level of error were plus and minus three standard deviations from the mean of the synthetic dataset the spatial coordinates of the outlying points were constrained to fall inside the domain of the original synthetic dataset 3 results and discussion a 30 ft 10 m resolution dem with a sampling frequency reduced to 160 ft 50 m intervals was used to determine the threshold variance of the synthetic gwe dataset reducing the sampling frequency allowed for faster computations of the dem gradient plots and variogram in addition the gradient may not be an accurate reflection of the surface when calculated between short distances the increased distance between sampling points reduces anonymously high or low gradients due to embankments or flat areas from human development such as parking lots the scale of the synthetic dataset was determined from the gradient direction plot with the local scale defined by an area to the left of the vertical dashed line in fig 2 the radial extent of the dem used for comparison was determined from the radius of a circle with an area equal to the maximum area at the local scale the resulting extent of the dem was a 2400 ft radius about the synthetic data points the binned variogram of the dem was laid over the variogram cloud of the synthetic data as shown in fig 3 the data pair links corresponding to gwe points lying above the variogram threshold are illustrated in fig 4 to identify points with the highest variability when multiple linkages are drawn to the same point it indicates the point is the source of the high variance and should be further investigated that is it is a potential outlier inspection of fig 4 shows that point c has 3 linkages the link connecting to point b should not be considered because b has a greater number of linkages than c so it is a higher level candidate this leaves point c with 2 significant linkages so it still qualifies as a potential spatial outlier in addition to point c points a and b are also identified as potential spatial outliers both a and b have at least 5 linkages so can easily be identified as potential spatial outliers all three of the points identified corresponded to the introduced outlier points points a and b were the highest level error points and point c was a second level error point the remaining second level error point is relatively far away from other points therefore a higher residual is tolerated so it was not identified as an outlier the two points with the lowest level of error a single standard deviation from the original mean were not identified either the first level error points are least likely to significantly deviate from neighbors and regional trends and thus were not identified as outliers in this case with a greater number of significant linkages corresponding to higher level error points this synthetic study shows that the number of significant linkages can be used as degree of confidence in positive identification of spatial outliers 3 1 fort leonard wood case study results a case study was performed using ground water elevation data collected at fort leonard wood military reservation flwmr in south central missouri the regional aquifer is unconfined and is within the gasconade formation consisting of ordovician aged dolomite a number of detailed investigations have been carried out at the flwmr which discuss the site geological and ground water flow mechanisms kleeschulte and imes 1997 mugel and imes 2003 harrison et al 1996 imes et al 1996 schumacher and imes 2000 the dataset is from a set of 69 monitoring wells installed for environmental sampling measurements of the depth from the top of the casing were all collected within a 24 h period in january of 2015 using an electronic water level meter the measured depth to water ranges from 3 ft to 326 ft below top of casing and screened intervals ranged from 10 ft to 206 ft in length the site was divided into three subsites based on the geographic separation of the monitoring wells as shown in fig 5 for each subsite the binned variogram from a 30 ft 10 m resolution dem sampled at 160 ft 50 m intervals was used to establish the threshold on the variogram cloud of the gwe values for brevity only the analysis for mwg1 is shown here however the procedure was the same for the remaining sites after creating the gradient direction plot for mwg1 it was observed that the regional gradient converged in two directions as shown in fig 6 a potential reason for this is that the northern most points belonged to a different flow regime and thus should be considered separately therefore mwg1 was divided into two separate subsites mwg1a and mwg1b as shown in fig 7 the resulting gradient direction plots for mwg1a and mwg1b are shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively the maximum area corresponding to the local scale at mwg1a is shown and the regional value now converges to a single direction the local scale was not readily determined for mwg1b because it was a relatively small dataset so the scale was assumed to the greatest calculated area for the mwg1b site by using the greatest calculated area a larger extent dem is used which results in a lower variogram threshold with this approach more linkages are drawn so a point may be identified with greater confidence while this approach may lead to the identification of more potential outliers this places more reliance on the individual analysis of each point to determine if an outlier should be retained with the calculated area corresponding to the determined local scale the binned variogram of the dem with corresponding radial extent about each point in mwg1a and mwg1b was overlaid over the gwe variogram cloud shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively figs 12 and 13 show the linkages to the data pairs corresponding to the points above the variogram threshold for mwg1a and mwg1b respectively mw 1207 was included in both subsites since its location fell approximately in the middle of the two sites from the results of both subsites mwg1a and mwg1b mw 1207 was identified as a spatial outlier from mwg1b two additional potential outliers are identified with both mw 1204 and mw 1205 having at least two significant linkages the small number of points in mwg1b showed to be of low quality with nearly half of the points on the site identified as potential outliers this procedure was repeated for both mwg2 and mwg3 and a total of 7 more potential spatial outliers were identified all points identified from the variogram comparison method have been outlined in table 1 with the number of links shown to indicate the level of confidence in a positive identification of a potential spatial outlier a number of potential causes or indicators of error which might justify retaining a potential outlier were considered for the flmwr site after the review of borings logs and well installation records each well that possessed the specified attribute was indicated by a dot in table 2 with closed dots indicating that the well which possessed that attribute was retained as a spatial outlier wells in bold correspond to the potential outliers identified in table 1 wells with long completion intervals greater than 50 ft in length were expected to be a potential source of error wells with shallow completion were completed above the gasconade formation the regional aquifer unit and thus potentially sampling a different aquifer unit or perched zone wells with solution features voids greater than 5 ft identified in the boring logs were thought to have potential sources or sinks wells with any perched zones identified in the boring log if not properly completed may reflect an average of the perched and regional aquifer wells with inconsistent initial water levels deviating more than 30 ft from the water level measured at the time of drilling may indicate that the water level might not have stabilized when the initial measurement was taken or there may be seepage in an improperly completed well seasonal variation marks those wells which had a greater water level in january 2015 than the average of the previous four years of spring measures this goes against the assumption that water levels in spring are greater than in january and thus a source term such as a leaky pipe may provide a source to keep the water level in january high as shown in table 2 the most common cause of error were wells completed above the regional aquifer unit leading to uncharacteristically high water levels in addition each well showing unexpected seasonal variation was retained as a spatial outlier inspection of boring logs for mw 305 and adjacent wells showed a large void 14 ft at the same depth in each borehole however mw 305 was the only well with no record of grouting the void and thus was retained as an outlier for mw 307 the january water level was more than 40 ft higher than the measured water level at time of drilling as shown in table 2 mw 309 is the only well that was identified as a potential spatial outlier but not excluded from the regional model table 2 shows that despite expectations long screened wells perched zones and solution features did not significantly contribute as a source of error when deciding if a point should be removed the resulting loss of resolution in the model should be considered if the resolution loss is negligible then even for low confidence points one can simply drop the targeted outlier liu et al 2001 likewise if the inclusion of a targeted outlier that is suspected to be caused by natural variation has significant effects on the development of a ground water model then it should be excluded for this case study ground water elevation values were used to develop a ground water surface by kriging both censored and uncensored ground water elevation data for the post outlier removal dataset there was a significant improvement in cross validation statistics with regression slope increasing from 0 77 to 0 96 and root mean square standardized error values going from 0 56 to 1 06 in order to test this new procedure against more established approaches to data quality analysis the results of this method were compared against results from a more conventional cross validation approach specifically the approach presented by miller et al 1997 miller et al 1997 identified that estimation errors from kriging greater than two kriging standard deviations may indicate an anomaly or erroneous value therefore points with z scores which is the estimation error divided by the kriging standard deviation greater than 2 are potentially spatial outliers results from the z score method for each site are shown in table 3 it is immediately noted that there is little agreement in the results of the two methods notably absent are points identified from the variogram approach that were confirmed to be measures of perched aquifers mw 1204 and mw 1205 likely the reason these points were not identified is that for the mwg1b area kriging standard deviation values were so high that the z score was acceptably low from table 2 we see some of the wells identified in mwg1a only with the z score method are wells which have long completion intervals and others have solution features present in the borehole however the remaining wells mw 5602 mw 5607 mw 5612 and mw 0605 have no justification for removal the case here may be the opposite than shown for mwg1b were with a higher density of points in the area a lower kriging standard deviation causes the method to be overly sensitive in identification of points the potential outliers in mwg3 agreed for both methods for mwg2 there were no points with a z score higher than two however the two points with the highest z score were retained outliers identified in the variogram approach the principal assumption of this analysis is that the potentiometric surface is a smoothed version of the topographic surface this assumption was tested for the flw dataset by calculating the correlation coefficient between the measured ground water elevations at each of the 62 retained monitoring wells after the deletion of the 7 spatial outliers and the topographic elevation at each well the resulting value of 0 36 shows that there is a relatively weak correlation between the two variables while this is not strong evidence to support the principal assumption neither does it provide motivation to discard the assumption it is recommended that a similar correlation check be performed at other applications in order to evaluate the appropriateness of the principal assumption on a site specific basis 4 conclusions the variogram comparison approach to detecting spatial outliers provided reasonable results with a synthetic dataset and when applied during a case study at fort leonard wood missouri in comparison of kriging results from censored to uncensored data kriging validation statistics were improved post removal of identified spatial outliers by providing justification as a final step to retaining a spatial outlier a better understanding of causes of error are gained and there is a chance to introduce best management practices for monitoring well installation and sampling the results showed that a recommended best practice from this study is to verify the geologic units during well construction and completion in addition because every point that showed seasonal variation was identified as an outlier expected seasonal trends should be considered when evaluating if a measured water level is a good representation of the ground water surface the use of the variogram cloud is a powerful approach because every gwe data pair is considered against the dem threshold therefore deviations from expected local and regional trends are considered by using a supplemental dem and every gwe point relationship spatial outliers were still able to be identified in small low quality datasets other approaches which use cross validation from some interpolation method may have skewed results based on the structure and density of data points which ultimately affects the results of the interpolation therefore these methods may be overly sensitive for clustered data or the standard deviation from interpolation may be high enough to mask any potential outliers in sparse gwe datasets the approach presented in miller et al 1997 is presented as only a rapid filtering procedure to identify points to be inspected other cross validation procedures are made more robust such as was presented in liu et al 2001 and may not be subject to such shortcomings this approach overcomes these shortcomings as it is not reliant on placing confidence in neighboring points but rather compares observations to a secondary high confidence dataset it should be kept in mind that when supplementing the primary data the relation between primary ground water datasets and secondary topographic data should be verified condon and maxwell 2015 blauvelt and fullmer 2011 tradition spatial outlier detection methods only consider the expected continuity of a point with its nearest neighbors this approach looks at the relation of neighboring points along with distant points to see if data pairs also conform to expected regional trends whereas other methods such as moran s i and cross validation techniques only look at the expected value of a point based on its neighbors unlike other spatial statistics presented this method is useful for highlighting outliers in a non academic setting as the output is a clear graphic which shows the potentially outlying point and links to those neighboring points with a significantly high variance limitations of this method should also be considered the location of the variogram threshold is dependent upon the qualitative identification of the area of the local scale on the gradient direction plot leading to non unique results in addition while assuming a single average gradient value for each scale on the variogram was necessary for comparison in reality the gradient is a vector field and thus unique to each location in the case study the procedure did not identify outliers in areas with long screened intervals or areas with known leaky pipes there was concern that these areas may not give representative water levels while the variation between a pair of points on the ground water surface may be less than the average variation on the topographic surface this does not disqualify a point as a spatial outlier it may be the case that this method is not sensitive enough to the small changes these processes may have on the ground water table lastly the requirement for a supplementary related dataset limits extended application of this procedure this technique is recommended for those already applying geostatistical techniques to develop a ground water surface the ground water surfaces were reasonably subdued versions of the ground surfaces for the datasets analyzed in this paper however that will not be true for every site and future applications may benefit from a study of the sensitivity of correlation of the gwe primary dataset and the dem secondary dataset on the results of this method when co kriging the development of an experimental variogram of gwe values and a binned variogram of the secondary variable dem are already part of the process

8615,when using a ground water elevation dataset for the development of a ground water model it is prudent to first evaluate the quality of the data before using it in a ground water model however it may not be practical to evaluate every data point when working with large datasets associated with a regional model to isolate misrepresentative points in a large dataset a graphical technique has been developed which examines the variance of ground water elevation values from an unconfined aquifer to identify points with high variance the potential outliers identified using the graphical variogram process are subsequently evaluated by reviewing well borings well installation records and available time series of water level measurements to retain or reject outlier status supplemental ground elevation data from a digital elevation model is used to create a threshold on the experimental variogram of the ground water elevation data this process is verified using a developed synthetic ground water dataset then applied to a case study at the fort leonard wood military reservation missouri the method showed good results in identifying points that were justified for removal upon inspection of the available records and provides recommendations based on common causes of error with this method s reliance on both an experimental variogram of measured water levels and a binned variogram of ground elevation measures it naturally fits as a preprocessing step that can be applied prior to kriging keywords outlier detection spatial outlier variogram supplemental topographic data gradient 1 introduction pucci and murashige 1987 state that before a ground water resource investigation is established or a hydraulic model developed existing ground water measurements should first be evaluated for their usefulness there are many potential sources of error in measures of the potentiometric surface including human error in measuring the depth to static water level inaccurate well coordinates measurements taken directly after well completion before the water level has stabilized and non representative measurements in wells with long completion intervals and significant vertical gradients elçi et al 2003 hill rowley et al 2003 snyder 2008 arihood 2009 tremblay et al 2015 all these sources of error may be present in databases that are not always systematically validated with quality control often absent and reliability in the measurements highly variable depending on where the data is sourced tremblay et al 2015 in addition to sampling errors there are naturally occurring for example sources or sinks from karst and or anthropogenic features such as leaking water from supply pipelines which can create a localized effect on the potentiometric surface which may skew the characterization of the more regional surface especially when monitoring locations are relatively sparse when this is the case points reflecting such local variability should be considered for exclusion from a regional model such data points that differ significantly from neighboring points for the reasons given above are referred to as spatial outliers shekhar et al 2003 chen et al 2008 liu et al 2001 spatial outliers differ from global outliers in that global outliers are identified by comparison with the aggregate of the entire population while spatial outliers are those that go against regional trends or do not maintain local continuity there are two general methods applied to detect spatial outliers the most common approach is a quantitative method which looks at the residual between a point and a predicted value at the same location then applies some mathematical method to determine if the residual is significant tremblay et al 2015 shekhar et al 2003 miller et al 1997 bardossy and kundzewicz 1990 liu et al 2001 quantitative methods such as local morans i and getis ord gi check the spatial association to identify clusters of data or distinctly isolated data getis and ord 1992 rogerson 2015 fu et al 2015 points that do not cluster are significantly different than their neighbors and may be identified as spatial outliers the second method is identified by shekhar et al 2003 and chen et al 2008 as a graphical method which is based on the visualization of spatial data to highlight spatial outliers graphical methods rely on the qualitative identification of outliers which appear to fall outside of the grouping of the remainder of the data and thus lack defined criteria for when a point on the graph qualifies as an outlier when discussing different outlier detection methods bardossy and kundzewicz 1990 and shekhar et al 2003 discuss the conceptual use of an experimental variogram as a way of identifying outlying points however the presentation of a systematic approach to selecting outlying points based on a variogram is absent a common assumption in the development of ground water models is that for unconfined conditions the ground water table is a smoothed version of the topographic surface king 1899 domenico and schwartz 1998 blauvelt and fullmer 2011 this assumption enables the incorporation of a ground elevation dataset to supplement sparse ground water elevation gwe measurements when developing a model of the potentiometric surface desbarats et al 2002 boezio et al 2005 2006 hoeksema et al 1989 the purpose of this paper is to present a new graphical approach to identify potential spatial outliers which use a digital elevation model dem dataset to establish criteria for detecting spatial outliers in ground water level measurements from an unconfined aquifer unlike those in the literature this approach addresses regional trends at the site in addition to comparing each individual data point to its neighbors thus fully using all point to point relationships to demonstrate the applicability of the approach it is used to perform an outlier analysis on a dataset collected at fort leonard wood missouri where multiple monitoring well mw networks have been established to sample the quality of the regional aquifer 2 methods variogram a common geostatistical tool is key to this method a variogram is used to describe the difference between pairs of points based on the distance between the points in pairs goovaerts 1997 presents the variogram function as 1 γ s 1 2 n s α 1 n h u α h u α s 2 where h a m e a s u r e m e n t o f s o m e s c a l e r q u a n t i t y s a v e c t o r s e p a r a t i n g t w o d a t a v a l u e s n s n u m b e r o f d a t a p a i r s w i t h i n t h e c l a s s o f d i s t a n c e a n d d i r e c t i o n o f s u a v e c t o r o f s p a t i a l c o o r d i n a t e s o f t h e α th p o i n t the γ s values from equation 1 will be referred to here as the variance although other authors refer to it as the variability journel and huijbregts 1997 or the semi variance goovaerts 1997 the variogram is usually either expressed as a binned variogram or a variogram cloud a variogram cloud also referred to as an experimental variogram plots half the squared difference of every pair of points against the separation distance for that pair so every separation vector s is considered and n is one when there are no data pairs separated by the same vector for the binned variogram point pairs are separated into distance bins which only include pairs in which points are separated by a specified range of the magnitude of s within each distance bin pairs are further classified by the direction in which they are separated half the average squared difference of each directional class is plotted within each bin of separation distance the principal assumption used in this analysis is that the potentiometric surface is a smoothed version of the topographic surface it is noted that this common assumption is not universally valid haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 and others have addressed the pitfalls with this assumption however for many sites where hydrogeological data are relatively scarce including the one described subsequently in this paper the smoothed topographic surface assumption is a reasonable point of departure for characterizing the ground water elevation surface this assumption should always be evaluated for each individual case as it may not always hold blauvelt and fullmer 2011 condon and maxwell 2015 the main assumption allows for the comparison of gwe variogram cloud to a threshold derived from a dem binned variogram the model consists of the following steps 1 characterize the local and regional gradient scales using site specific topographic data to determine the extent of the elevation dataset 2 develop a binned variogram of the dem with an extent corresponding to the maximum local topographic gradient determined in the prior step 3 the upper boundary of the dem binned variogram serves as a threshold compare the variogram cloud of the ground water dataset to the binned variogram of the dem dataset 4 identify points on the ground water variogram cloud that lie above the dem binned variogram threshold 5 for the points selected on the variogram cloud in the previous step identify wells with at least two links where a linkage is a connection drawn between two data points represented by a single point on the variogram cloud 6 review boring logs well completion records water level measurement data and other site specific data to retain or reject high linkage points as spatial outliers as an initial processing step for this method the gwe dataset to be tested is input into a gis database along with a dem which will be used to represent the topographic surface a 30 ft 10 m resolution dem was used in this study an issue of scale arises when comparing the primary ground water level measures which have a defined domain to a dem dataset which has no defined domain the approach used here to determine the appropriate dem domain was to use only dem values lying within a radial extent about each ground water measure equal to the scale of local continuity of the ground water dataset the method of finding the local scale derived from the work of silliman and frost 1998 looked at the response of calculated gradients to changes in the extent of the dem domenico and schwartz 1998 define the gradient of a scalar field of some attribute a as 2 a a x i a y j a z k the gradient was calculated using the three point problem as presented by vacher 2005 the gradient direction expressed in degrees azimuth of each possible point trio within the spatial dataset was plotted against the area of the triangle formed by that point trio to rule out point trios that were close to falling along a line only trios with an inner acute angle greater than a prescribed tolerance were used in the computation from these gradient direction plots as shown in fig 1 it is observed that for small triangular areas there is no relation between the gradient direction of point trios with the same calculated area however with increasing calculation area or point trios separated by a greater distance the gradient directions begin to converge to a single value visually this behavior can roughly be described as a hummocky surface lying on a tilted plane at a smaller scale the surface gradient is dependent upon location where at the region scale with adequate spacing between point trios the gradient of the underlying surface becomes apparent the domain of the dem to be used is found by identifying the area at which the gradient direction first begins to converge to a regional value this triangular area is then used to solve for the radius of a circle with equivalent area the radial extent equal to this radius about the ground water dataset is used to define the domain to be used for the dem now a relationship can be developed between the gradient and variance of the primary and secondary variable ground water elevations and topographic elevation founded upon our main assumption that at the same location the gradient of the topographic surface is greater than or equal to the gradient of the potentiometric surface the direction of the gradient a corresponds to the direction of greatest change in attribute a the magnitude of a for a planar surface is the greatest level of change per unit length that will occur on that surface the gradient of a planar surface is calculated using any three points that do not fall along a line and the three point problem can be simplified to a two point problem if the direction of the gradient is known with a known gradient direction the magnitude of the gradient can be determined from the residual of two points separated in that direction 3 a r a s a where r a t h e d i f f e r e n c e b e t w e e n a p a i r o f p o i n t s s e p a r a t e d b y s a s a v e c t o r s e p a r a t i n g a p a i r o f p o i n t s i n t h e g r a d i e n t d i r e c t i o n when the direction of the gradient is not known a reasonable approximation of the planar surface gradient can be found by looking at the residual of every pair of points in the domain the magnitude of the gradient is approximated as the greatest residual between a pair of points in the domain divided by the magnitude of the vector separating the pair of points and the direction of the gradient is a direction parallel to the vector separating the two points 4 a r max s max with 5 r max m a x r i where r i t h e r e s i d u a l o f t h e i th p a i r o f p o i n t s l y i n g o n a p l a n e s max v e c t o r s e p a r a t i n g a p a i r o f p o i n t s c o r r e s p o n d i n g t o r max now consider that the variance eq 1 and gradient approximation eq 4 both consider the residual of every point pair on the area of interest so for a set of data on the same domain 6 r i h u α h u α s from eq 4 we expect the variance corresponding to the points separated in the direction of the gradient to be at r i r max therefore the greatest value from h u α h u α s corresponds to the greatest variance and is expected to result from a pair of points separated in the direction of the gradient thus for each separation distance the largest variance to occur is dependent on the gradient between the points the inherent variability of the topographic surface causes the gradient to fluctuate over the entire domain of interest to find a representative variance which adequately describes the gradient of the entire domain the average variance corresponding to the directional bin with the highest average variance from the binned dem variogram should be used the maximum of the directional variance averages gives a good estimate of the average calculated gradient magnitude for different separation distances to target values on the gwe variogram cloud the maximum variance on the binned dem variogram can be used as a threshold when multiple points lie above this threshold the corresponding pairs should coincide with a single point that can be identified as a potential spatial outlier to isolate points above the threshold lines are drawn on a site map between pairs of gwe measures corresponding to each point lying above the dem threshold a point cannot be isolated as a potential outlier from a single linkage therefore at least two linkages are needed to identify a point as a potential spatial outlier however a point with two links may not be the source of high variance but rather be linked with two potential outlying points ideally there should be an iterative approach to removing the point with the greatest number of linkages and then repeating the analysis to ensure that only points contributing to the high variance are removed to replace this time consuming process it can be determined from the first iteration if a link should be associated with a point links to a point can be established as significant or not based on if they connect with a higher level candidate where a higher level candidate is one with more linkages a link only significantly contributes to a point if it does not connect with a higher level candidate a point is identified as a potential spatial outlier if it has at least two significant links for points identified as potential outliers justification should be provided through inspection of each point in order to retain the point as a spatial outlier 2 1 development of a synthetic dataset a synthetic dataset was created to test the validity of the method to create artificial ground water elevations that represented a smoothed version of the topography surface elevations gathered from a dem were divided into 24 equal sized bins each bin covering 15 feet of elevation for each of the 34 synthetic points the surface elevation at that point was multiplied by a coefficient ranging from 0 95 to 0 75 corresponding to the elevation bin it belonged to the lowest coefficient was used at points with the highest surface elevation and likewise the highest coefficient was used at the lowest surface elevation this produced a smoothing effect so that at topographic highs the difference in ground water and surface elevation was the greatest from the average of the original synthetic dataset six potential outlier points where added that corresponded to three levels of error the first level being the lowest level of error contained two points corresponding to plus and minus a single standard deviation from the mean of the synthetic dataset following this two second level error points were added whose values were plus and minus two standard deviations from the synthetic data mean and the two points with the highest level of error were plus and minus three standard deviations from the mean of the synthetic dataset the spatial coordinates of the outlying points were constrained to fall inside the domain of the original synthetic dataset 3 results and discussion a 30 ft 10 m resolution dem with a sampling frequency reduced to 160 ft 50 m intervals was used to determine the threshold variance of the synthetic gwe dataset reducing the sampling frequency allowed for faster computations of the dem gradient plots and variogram in addition the gradient may not be an accurate reflection of the surface when calculated between short distances the increased distance between sampling points reduces anonymously high or low gradients due to embankments or flat areas from human development such as parking lots the scale of the synthetic dataset was determined from the gradient direction plot with the local scale defined by an area to the left of the vertical dashed line in fig 2 the radial extent of the dem used for comparison was determined from the radius of a circle with an area equal to the maximum area at the local scale the resulting extent of the dem was a 2400 ft radius about the synthetic data points the binned variogram of the dem was laid over the variogram cloud of the synthetic data as shown in fig 3 the data pair links corresponding to gwe points lying above the variogram threshold are illustrated in fig 4 to identify points with the highest variability when multiple linkages are drawn to the same point it indicates the point is the source of the high variance and should be further investigated that is it is a potential outlier inspection of fig 4 shows that point c has 3 linkages the link connecting to point b should not be considered because b has a greater number of linkages than c so it is a higher level candidate this leaves point c with 2 significant linkages so it still qualifies as a potential spatial outlier in addition to point c points a and b are also identified as potential spatial outliers both a and b have at least 5 linkages so can easily be identified as potential spatial outliers all three of the points identified corresponded to the introduced outlier points points a and b were the highest level error points and point c was a second level error point the remaining second level error point is relatively far away from other points therefore a higher residual is tolerated so it was not identified as an outlier the two points with the lowest level of error a single standard deviation from the original mean were not identified either the first level error points are least likely to significantly deviate from neighbors and regional trends and thus were not identified as outliers in this case with a greater number of significant linkages corresponding to higher level error points this synthetic study shows that the number of significant linkages can be used as degree of confidence in positive identification of spatial outliers 3 1 fort leonard wood case study results a case study was performed using ground water elevation data collected at fort leonard wood military reservation flwmr in south central missouri the regional aquifer is unconfined and is within the gasconade formation consisting of ordovician aged dolomite a number of detailed investigations have been carried out at the flwmr which discuss the site geological and ground water flow mechanisms kleeschulte and imes 1997 mugel and imes 2003 harrison et al 1996 imes et al 1996 schumacher and imes 2000 the dataset is from a set of 69 monitoring wells installed for environmental sampling measurements of the depth from the top of the casing were all collected within a 24 h period in january of 2015 using an electronic water level meter the measured depth to water ranges from 3 ft to 326 ft below top of casing and screened intervals ranged from 10 ft to 206 ft in length the site was divided into three subsites based on the geographic separation of the monitoring wells as shown in fig 5 for each subsite the binned variogram from a 30 ft 10 m resolution dem sampled at 160 ft 50 m intervals was used to establish the threshold on the variogram cloud of the gwe values for brevity only the analysis for mwg1 is shown here however the procedure was the same for the remaining sites after creating the gradient direction plot for mwg1 it was observed that the regional gradient converged in two directions as shown in fig 6 a potential reason for this is that the northern most points belonged to a different flow regime and thus should be considered separately therefore mwg1 was divided into two separate subsites mwg1a and mwg1b as shown in fig 7 the resulting gradient direction plots for mwg1a and mwg1b are shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively the maximum area corresponding to the local scale at mwg1a is shown and the regional value now converges to a single direction the local scale was not readily determined for mwg1b because it was a relatively small dataset so the scale was assumed to the greatest calculated area for the mwg1b site by using the greatest calculated area a larger extent dem is used which results in a lower variogram threshold with this approach more linkages are drawn so a point may be identified with greater confidence while this approach may lead to the identification of more potential outliers this places more reliance on the individual analysis of each point to determine if an outlier should be retained with the calculated area corresponding to the determined local scale the binned variogram of the dem with corresponding radial extent about each point in mwg1a and mwg1b was overlaid over the gwe variogram cloud shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively figs 12 and 13 show the linkages to the data pairs corresponding to the points above the variogram threshold for mwg1a and mwg1b respectively mw 1207 was included in both subsites since its location fell approximately in the middle of the two sites from the results of both subsites mwg1a and mwg1b mw 1207 was identified as a spatial outlier from mwg1b two additional potential outliers are identified with both mw 1204 and mw 1205 having at least two significant linkages the small number of points in mwg1b showed to be of low quality with nearly half of the points on the site identified as potential outliers this procedure was repeated for both mwg2 and mwg3 and a total of 7 more potential spatial outliers were identified all points identified from the variogram comparison method have been outlined in table 1 with the number of links shown to indicate the level of confidence in a positive identification of a potential spatial outlier a number of potential causes or indicators of error which might justify retaining a potential outlier were considered for the flmwr site after the review of borings logs and well installation records each well that possessed the specified attribute was indicated by a dot in table 2 with closed dots indicating that the well which possessed that attribute was retained as a spatial outlier wells in bold correspond to the potential outliers identified in table 1 wells with long completion intervals greater than 50 ft in length were expected to be a potential source of error wells with shallow completion were completed above the gasconade formation the regional aquifer unit and thus potentially sampling a different aquifer unit or perched zone wells with solution features voids greater than 5 ft identified in the boring logs were thought to have potential sources or sinks wells with any perched zones identified in the boring log if not properly completed may reflect an average of the perched and regional aquifer wells with inconsistent initial water levels deviating more than 30 ft from the water level measured at the time of drilling may indicate that the water level might not have stabilized when the initial measurement was taken or there may be seepage in an improperly completed well seasonal variation marks those wells which had a greater water level in january 2015 than the average of the previous four years of spring measures this goes against the assumption that water levels in spring are greater than in january and thus a source term such as a leaky pipe may provide a source to keep the water level in january high as shown in table 2 the most common cause of error were wells completed above the regional aquifer unit leading to uncharacteristically high water levels in addition each well showing unexpected seasonal variation was retained as a spatial outlier inspection of boring logs for mw 305 and adjacent wells showed a large void 14 ft at the same depth in each borehole however mw 305 was the only well with no record of grouting the void and thus was retained as an outlier for mw 307 the january water level was more than 40 ft higher than the measured water level at time of drilling as shown in table 2 mw 309 is the only well that was identified as a potential spatial outlier but not excluded from the regional model table 2 shows that despite expectations long screened wells perched zones and solution features did not significantly contribute as a source of error when deciding if a point should be removed the resulting loss of resolution in the model should be considered if the resolution loss is negligible then even for low confidence points one can simply drop the targeted outlier liu et al 2001 likewise if the inclusion of a targeted outlier that is suspected to be caused by natural variation has significant effects on the development of a ground water model then it should be excluded for this case study ground water elevation values were used to develop a ground water surface by kriging both censored and uncensored ground water elevation data for the post outlier removal dataset there was a significant improvement in cross validation statistics with regression slope increasing from 0 77 to 0 96 and root mean square standardized error values going from 0 56 to 1 06 in order to test this new procedure against more established approaches to data quality analysis the results of this method were compared against results from a more conventional cross validation approach specifically the approach presented by miller et al 1997 miller et al 1997 identified that estimation errors from kriging greater than two kriging standard deviations may indicate an anomaly or erroneous value therefore points with z scores which is the estimation error divided by the kriging standard deviation greater than 2 are potentially spatial outliers results from the z score method for each site are shown in table 3 it is immediately noted that there is little agreement in the results of the two methods notably absent are points identified from the variogram approach that were confirmed to be measures of perched aquifers mw 1204 and mw 1205 likely the reason these points were not identified is that for the mwg1b area kriging standard deviation values were so high that the z score was acceptably low from table 2 we see some of the wells identified in mwg1a only with the z score method are wells which have long completion intervals and others have solution features present in the borehole however the remaining wells mw 5602 mw 5607 mw 5612 and mw 0605 have no justification for removal the case here may be the opposite than shown for mwg1b were with a higher density of points in the area a lower kriging standard deviation causes the method to be overly sensitive in identification of points the potential outliers in mwg3 agreed for both methods for mwg2 there were no points with a z score higher than two however the two points with the highest z score were retained outliers identified in the variogram approach the principal assumption of this analysis is that the potentiometric surface is a smoothed version of the topographic surface this assumption was tested for the flw dataset by calculating the correlation coefficient between the measured ground water elevations at each of the 62 retained monitoring wells after the deletion of the 7 spatial outliers and the topographic elevation at each well the resulting value of 0 36 shows that there is a relatively weak correlation between the two variables while this is not strong evidence to support the principal assumption neither does it provide motivation to discard the assumption it is recommended that a similar correlation check be performed at other applications in order to evaluate the appropriateness of the principal assumption on a site specific basis 4 conclusions the variogram comparison approach to detecting spatial outliers provided reasonable results with a synthetic dataset and when applied during a case study at fort leonard wood missouri in comparison of kriging results from censored to uncensored data kriging validation statistics were improved post removal of identified spatial outliers by providing justification as a final step to retaining a spatial outlier a better understanding of causes of error are gained and there is a chance to introduce best management practices for monitoring well installation and sampling the results showed that a recommended best practice from this study is to verify the geologic units during well construction and completion in addition because every point that showed seasonal variation was identified as an outlier expected seasonal trends should be considered when evaluating if a measured water level is a good representation of the ground water surface the use of the variogram cloud is a powerful approach because every gwe data pair is considered against the dem threshold therefore deviations from expected local and regional trends are considered by using a supplemental dem and every gwe point relationship spatial outliers were still able to be identified in small low quality datasets other approaches which use cross validation from some interpolation method may have skewed results based on the structure and density of data points which ultimately affects the results of the interpolation therefore these methods may be overly sensitive for clustered data or the standard deviation from interpolation may be high enough to mask any potential outliers in sparse gwe datasets the approach presented in miller et al 1997 is presented as only a rapid filtering procedure to identify points to be inspected other cross validation procedures are made more robust such as was presented in liu et al 2001 and may not be subject to such shortcomings this approach overcomes these shortcomings as it is not reliant on placing confidence in neighboring points but rather compares observations to a secondary high confidence dataset it should be kept in mind that when supplementing the primary data the relation between primary ground water datasets and secondary topographic data should be verified condon and maxwell 2015 blauvelt and fullmer 2011 tradition spatial outlier detection methods only consider the expected continuity of a point with its nearest neighbors this approach looks at the relation of neighboring points along with distant points to see if data pairs also conform to expected regional trends whereas other methods such as moran s i and cross validation techniques only look at the expected value of a point based on its neighbors unlike other spatial statistics presented this method is useful for highlighting outliers in a non academic setting as the output is a clear graphic which shows the potentially outlying point and links to those neighboring points with a significantly high variance limitations of this method should also be considered the location of the variogram threshold is dependent upon the qualitative identification of the area of the local scale on the gradient direction plot leading to non unique results in addition while assuming a single average gradient value for each scale on the variogram was necessary for comparison in reality the gradient is a vector field and thus unique to each location in the case study the procedure did not identify outliers in areas with long screened intervals or areas with known leaky pipes there was concern that these areas may not give representative water levels while the variation between a pair of points on the ground water surface may be less than the average variation on the topographic surface this does not disqualify a point as a spatial outlier it may be the case that this method is not sensitive enough to the small changes these processes may have on the ground water table lastly the requirement for a supplementary related dataset limits extended application of this procedure this technique is recommended for those already applying geostatistical techniques to develop a ground water surface the ground water surfaces were reasonably subdued versions of the ground surfaces for the datasets analyzed in this paper however that will not be true for every site and future applications may benefit from a study of the sensitivity of correlation of the gwe primary dataset and the dem secondary dataset on the results of this method when co kriging the development of an experimental variogram of gwe values and a binned variogram of the secondary variable dem are already part of the process

8616,groundwater seepage influences the temperature of streams and rivers by providing a relatively cool input in summer and warm input in winter because of this groundwater seepage can be a determining factor in the provision of suitable water temperatures for aquatic biota climate warming affects stream and groundwater temperatures and changes the thermal characteristics of streams leading to the potential disappearance of habitats in this study the importance of groundwater for the temperature of two dutch lowland streams and its possible role in mitigating the effects of climate change was determined by combining field measurements and a modelling experiment stream temperature measurements using fibre optic cables fo dts and sampling of 222rn were done to map localized groundwater inflow several springs and seepage hot spots were located which buffered the water temperature in summer and winter a stream temperature model was constructed and calibrated using the fo dts measurements to quantify the energy fluxes acting on stream water this way the contribution to the stream thermal budget of direct solar radiation air temperature and seepage were separated the model was then used to simulate the effects of changes in shading groundwater seepage and climate shading was shown to be an important control on summer temperature maxima groundwater seepage seemed to buffer the effect of climate warming potentially making groundwater dominated streams more climate robust protecting groundwater resources in a changing climate is important for the

aquatic ecology still requires more research the objective of this study is to determine the influence of groundwater on the temperature of two dutch lowland streams and to get insight into its

2013 vandenbohede et al 2014 westhoff et al 2007 the presence of the isotope 222rn in surface water also indicates recent seepage of groundwater as it is rapidly removed in surface waters by radioactive decay and degassing in addition to this field data we construct a stream temperature model which includes the effects of air temperature radiation shading and groundwater seepage the model is used to analyze the behavior of the different processes affecting stream temperature by applying different scenarios we derive the effect of climate change on stream thermal habitats and the mitigating effects of groundwater seepage 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area field measurements were done in two lowland streams in the east of the netherlands the springendalse beek and the elsbeek fig 1 with catchments sizes of 4 km2 and 11 km2 respectively these streams discharge to the dinkel river the area has a temperate marine climate with a mean annual air temperature of 9 6 c and mean annual precipitation and evaporation of 850 and 560 mm per year respectively the average discharge is 0 043 m3 s 1 for the springendalse beek and 0 104 m3 s 1 for the elsbeek the subsurface of the catchments consists of shallow aquifers 1 20 m thick on top of clayey moraines the streambed of the streams consists of sand with occasionally some gravel details on the study catchments were described by kaandorp et al 2018b a concise description of the studied stream stretches is given here the upstream catchment of the springendalse beek contains a few distinct spring areas and consists mainly of forest with some agricultural fields the studied stream stretch extends 1500 m downstream from the stream origin fig 1a the upstream part has a relatively stable discharge a stream width between 0 5 and 1 0 m and a water depth of a few centimetres a small spring a tributary two seepage ponds and tributaries from a swamp discharge into the stream fig 1a the downstream part has a width of 1 0 1 5 m and a water depth of around 10 cm the elsbeek predominantly consists of agricultural areas the measured stream stretch extends from approximately 5000 to 6500 m downstream from the stream origin fig 1b the most upstream 200 m of the study stretch is straightened flows through an agricultural area and has a width of about 1 m and a water depth of around 5 cm here the outflow of an agricultural ditch which dries up during summer joins the stream this is followed by a stream stretch with a riparian forest and a pool riffle sequence with pools up to 1 m deep and a width varying between 0 5 and 1 5 m a stretch with a length of 150 m in the central part is again straightened and flows through an agricultural area with a width of around 1 m and a water depth of about 30 cm after this an agricultural ditch joins the stream the most downstream part of the studied stream stretch flows again through a forest is shallow 3 10 cm and has a width varying between 0 5 and 2 0 m this part of the stream is deeply incised 1 0 1 5 m into the landscape 2 2 fo dts set up stream temperatures were measured using an oryx dts sensornet usa unit and ctc lszh fibre optic cables tkf connectivity solutions netherlands a cable with a length of 1300 m was positioned in the study stretch of the springendalse beek from 200 m downstream from the stream origin x 200 to the end of the studied stream stretch x 1500 fig 1 at x 305 and x 435 the cable was looped back and forth through a small spring directly next to the stream x 305 and in a side branch of the stream x 435 respectively fig 1a approximately 1500 m of fibre optic cable was installed in the elsbeek covering the two forested stream stretches and two open areas fig 1b in both streams the cable was installed on the streambed and fixed using u shaped metal pegs a double ended configuration was used with two calibration baths next to the oxyx unit and a splice at the end of the fibre optic cable by using the double ended setup corrections for splices and light attenuation in the fibre optic cable can be made hausner et al 2011 van de giesen et al 2012 for calibration a coil of cable was placed in each isolated calibration bath which was equipped with a pt 100 temperature sensor and connected with the oryx unit measurements were done for the whole months of august 2016 and january 2017 to capture both summer and winter temperature patterns each dts measurement was done with a spatial resolution of 1 0 m and consisted of sequential measuring of 5 min through 2 channels which were repeated either every half an hour summer or every hour winter because the dts cable was placed on the streambed the measurements represent the temperature at the bottom of the stream unless it was buried by sediments sediment was removed from the dts cable several times but it could not be prevented that during part of the measurement period some parts of the cable were buried by sediment in the streambed the temperature variation present in the stream is attenuated with depth and as such sedimentation leads to a temperature signal comparable to that of groundwater seepage such as a decrease in the standard deviation sd of the temperature sebok et al 2015 the dts temperature measurements were calibrated using dispersion slope and offset corrections which followed from the calibration baths further corrections for offsets were applied using onset 12 bit temperature smart sensors s tmb m006 with hobo data loggers h21 001 which were installed just above the stream bed at 5 locations in the springendalse beek and 3 locations in the elsbeek fig 1 comparison of the separate temperature sensors and the corrected dts temperature measurements showed that stream temperatures could be measured with an accuracy of 0 19 c on average temperatures were logged every 15 min and some of the loggers were supplied with an extra sensor to measure air temperature additional weather data was collected from nearby meteorological station twenthe of the royal netherlands meteorological institute knmi 2 3 radon measurements 222rn an isotope released to the groundwater from aquifer material was used as a tracer for groundwater in along stream profiling cartwright et al 2014 cook et al 2006 genereux and hemond 1990 samples were taken and measured immediately in the field using an electronic radon detector rad7 durridge high radon values in streams were expected to be found only near locations with groundwater seepage because it rapidly decays half life of 3 8 days and is released to the atmosphere due to degassing 2 4 stream temperature model a stream temperature model stm gw was built in python using the xarray simlab model framework bovy and mcbain 2017 the model is largely based on the model descriptions of boyd and kasper 2003 and westhoff et al 2007 and additionally simulates the interaction with groundwater in more detail fig 2 in the model all water fluxes q are considered constant in time and only increase in the downstream direction due to groundwater and lateral inflow the stream stretch is discretized into a 1d cell centred grid and to prevent numerical diffusion a courant number of 1 is used for this the size of the stream cells fluctuates spatially with the flow velocity which depends on the discharge depth and stream width 1 c v i δ t δ

friction is considered to be negligible 2 5 model parameterization the model was set up for a length of 1500 m divided into 45 cells based on the flow velocity eq 3 and with characteristics similar to the springendalse beek such as springs tributaries and groundwater fed ponds the model was run with a time step of 90 s for a total of three months june and july 2016 to spin up the model to get rid of artificial features inherited from the simple initial condition and august 2016 for analysis the vertical streambed models consisted of cells of 0 05 m and had a constant temperature boundary equal to the mean annual air temperature at a depth of 5 m this depth could potentially be too shallow to have no seasonal temperature variations and we therefore ran a model test with the boundary at a depth of 10 m but this did not result in a significant difference in stream temperature the first cell was fed by seepage and an extra discharge component with the same temperature as the seepage in that cell so that this discharge could be calibrated without getting unrealistic seepage rates through the small streambed area in the model cell air temperature humidity cloud cover and solar radiation were measured at nearby meteorological station twenthe by the dutch meteorological institute the values that were used for thermal physical properties of the sediments were reported by anibas et al 2011 for another lowland stream with a sandy streambed and a wind velocity of 0 1 m s 1 was taken from westhoff et al 2007 representing the wind sheltered location of the stream in a dense forest with abundant plants growing in and around the stream 2 6 scenario modelling different scenarios were run with the calibrated model table 3 the effect of climate warming was tested by raising the air temperature by two degrees in scenario 1a while keeping the temperature of the deeper groundwater the same because the increase in air temperature is expected to also increase the temperature of the groundwater e g menberg et al 2014 taylor and stefan 2009 in scenario 1b both the air and groundwater temperature were increased by 2 c the importance of groundwater was tested by running the model with 50 more and 50 less groundwater seepage in the stream scenarios 2 and 3 the effect of shading was evaluated by removing shading from a small part of the modelled stream scenario 4 and by removing shading from the whole catchment scenario 5 3 results 3 1 fo dts temperature measurements 3 1 1 springendalse beek fig 3 displays results of temperature measurements in the springendalse beek in summer and winter in summer the absolute temperature slightly increases in the downstream direction fig 3b and the daily temperature amplitude tends to go up when there are no lateral inflows low temperatures between 10 3 and 15 0 c close to the spring area x 200 indicate a strong influence of groundwater inflow downstream of the spring the inflow of groundwater is less and stream temperature is more influenced by atmospheric processes measured temperatures vary between 12 3 and 18 8 c at x 1450 fig 3b in winter the effect of groundwater seepage also is clearly visible in the dts measurements upstream the stream water has a relatively high temperature in winter 5 0 9 6 c while temperatures decrease downstream 2 1 6 6 c fig 3e g the mean and average daily standard deviation sd were also derived from the dts data in order to locate groundwater seepage zones using the fact that groundwater has less temperature variation and thus the sd is lowered at locations with seepage e g hare et al 2015 lowry et al 2007 matheswaran et al 2014a rosenberry et al 2016 see for instance at x 630 and table 1 which summarizes the data for some specific locations upstream in the springendalse beek the sd is around 0 5 c both in summer and winter and in the downstream direction increases in summer to around 1 c and remains approximately stable at 0 5 c in winter table 1 lists characteristics of thermal anomalies associated with specific hydrological features such as tributaries and springs at location 1 fig 3 the cable was looped through the outflow of a small spring which had a lower summer and higher winter temperature than the water in the stream table 1 as a result of the stable temperature of groundwater seepage the outflow of a small groundwater fed pond at location 3 had this same thermal groundwater characteristics of lower summer and higher winter temperatures than the stream water in addition the stream temperature at x 350 650 1100 and 1400 m had similar characteristics as the spring 1 and the small groundwater fed pond 3 the up to downstream summer warming and winter cooling was dampened and sd values were lower than expected fig 3 this suggests that significant seepage occurs at these locations the outflow of a larger groundwater fed pond at 4 had high summer temperatures and a high sd table 1 which is different from the small groundwater fed pond and suggests a smaller groundwater influence on the temperature this is potentially due to a longer residence time in the larger pond although fed by groundwater the larger volume of the pond results in a larger residence time of the water which slowly loses the groundwater thermal signal contrary to the groundwater indicative thermal signals a tributary stream at location 2 fig 3 had relatively high summer and low winter temperatures table 1 and the same holds for the outflow of a swamp through two small tributaries at location 5 the discharge of both these inflows is fed by an agricultural area where it derives from drains shallow groundwater and is influenced by atmospheric processes while flowing towards the springendalse beek besides effects from groundwater seepage effects of air temperature and rainfall are also visible in the dts measurements for instance a sharp increase in stream temperature occurred between august 1st and 2nd fig 3a and is the result of input from precipitation during a rainstorm in addition monitoring artefacts are shown for instance around x 1280 where a temperature increase is seen from august 4th as a result of the cable becoming exposed to air due to lowering of the water level 3 1 2 elsbeek the measured stream stretch in the elsbeek is located further downstream from the stream origin than the measured stretch in the springendalse beek approximately 5000 vs 200 m the measured temperature of the elsbeek slightly decreases in the downstream direction before increasing between x 750 and 900 and finally decreasing again towards the most downstream measured point fig 4 a b this pattern is also clearly visible in the sd fig 4c which is lower at locations with a lower temperature the parts of the stream with decreasing temperatures coincide with the locations of riparian forests while the stretches with increasing temperatures are located in agricultural fields the temperature measurements show several negative spikes in maximum temperature and sd fig 4 while this appears similar to the characteristics of seepage these locations have a minimum temperature significantly above the average groundwater temperature of around 11 c instead of seepage visual inspections showed that at these locations the dts cable is either located on the bottom of stagnant pools or buried by sediment 3 2 222rn measurements the 222rn concentration in groundwater was measured both at piezometers within our catchment which showed concentrations between 3210 and 5800 bq m 3 and at the spring which showed concentrations of 733 and 3730 bq m 3 fig 5 the low spring concentration of 733 bq m 3 might be influenced by recent precipitation or by some decay in the spring area as the other radon concentrations of 3000 bq m 3 and higher are in line with the concentrations found for groundwater in other studies in the netherlands including well fields in the region of our catchment kwakman and versteegh 2016 yu et al 2019 the 222rn activity in the stream water in the most upstream part of the springendalse beek catchment is between 104 and 1240 bq m 3 while more downstream 222rn concentrations are below 500 bq m 3 fig 5 showing a decrease in groundwater influence in the downstream direction the small groundwater fed pond has a mean radon level of 1388 bq m3 n 4 indicating a large relative influence of recent groundwater seepage the concentrations in the large pond have an average of 177 bq m 3 n 3 fig 5 indicating only a small influence of recent seepage 3 3 model calibration the manual calibration was done step wise and an overview of the model parameters is shown in table 2 the model is most sensitive to the parameters θvts ddiffuse upstream starting q and the width of the stream and therefore focus was on these parameters during calibration discharge from groundwater seepage and lateral inflow stream width and depth and shading varied along the stream length and were estimated using our knowledge of the field sites and were then further calibrated fig 6 the initial temperature of the stream and the streambed were set to 10 and 11 c respectively calibration of df and ddiffuse resulted in values of 0 5 and 0 0 respectively lateral inflow from an agricultural stream was added to the model at x 435 the temperature of this inflow represented discharge from a tile drained area seepage from 1 m depth the two seepage ponds in the springendalse beek were located at locations x 650 and 1150 m in the model the pond sizes depths shading and seepage rates were also calibrated with the dts measurements their depths were 1 5 and 1 0 m and their surface areas 900 and 3000 m2 respectively the pond at 650 m had a calibrated seepage rate of 1000 mm per day and was 90 shaded the pond at 1150 m had a calibrated seepage rate of 350 mm per day and was not shaded with a shading factor of only 10 3 4 modelled temperature distribution along the stream the calibrated stm gw model using the parameters listed in table 2 shows a reasonable fit with the observed dts data from the springendalse beek fig 7 especially considering that the model does not include local heterogeneity in e g water depth and air temperature both the diurnal temperature variation in the up and downstream temperature are represented well by the model although the simulated temperature upstream is slightly underestimated fig 7b fig 7c shows the modelled result for two night and two days 2 am and 2 pm for a warmer day day 1 and colder day day 2 the temperature pattern from up to downstream on these days is simulated adequately by the model including the modelled features such as the spring and tributary spring especially the temperature step resulting from the tributary stream at x 450 and the inflow of water from the seepage ponds x 700 and x 1200 lead to clear temperature steps in the model that were also observed in the dts measurements fig 7c using the model we were able to investigate the theoretical importance of the different processes affecting the stream temperature for comparison with the other energy fluxes the heat energy provided by seepage w m 2 was calculated using 34 e seepage δ t v z c w ρ w where δ t is the temperature difference between the stream and seeping groundwater which means that eq 34 gives the energy flux compared to the current stream water temperature and is thus an apparent rather than an absolute heat flux as explained by kurylyk et al 2016 fig 8 shows the modelled energy fluxes to and from the stream on august 6 2016 the energy flux from seepage is mostly negative because seepage of groundwater often leads to cooling on summer days the higher seepage rates given to the upstream part of the model are also shown in the energy fluxes fig 8a and c higher seepage rates lead to more cooling of the stream both through the advective flux and through increased streambed conduction the negative energy fluxes from both bed conduction and seepage increase during the day because stream water is heated and the temperature difference between seepage and stream water increases the flux from solar radiation naturally has a day night fluctuation and is lower at locations with shading sensible heat flow is dependent on the difference between stream water and air temperature eq 27 and therefore shows a day night pattern as well it decreases in the downstream direction as the difference between stream water and air temperature decreases due to the heating or cooling of the stream water in the downstream direction by atmospheric processes 3 5 scenario modelling from the base run fig 7 several model parameters were changed to simulate different scenarios to get a better understanding of the possible future changes resulting from climate change and the role of groundwater in this table 3 shows the upstream x 200 and downstream x 1450 average minimum and maximum stream temperature for the calibrated base run and five different scenarios an increase in air temperature in scenarios 1a and 1b resulted in an increase in water temperature fig 9 a in scenario 1a a stable groundwater temperature buffers the increase in water temperature compared to scenario 1b where the stream temperature increased by approximately the same amount as the air and groundwater temperature table 3 fig 9a the upstream temperature is hardly affected by an increase in air temperature because it is located close to the upstream stream spring especially the night temperature both up and downstream seems to be almost fully determined by the groundwater temperature as the 2 c increase of the lower boundary in scenario 1b leads to a similar increase of the minimum temperature both upstream and downstream scenarios 2 and 3 show the effect of an increase or decrease of groundwater seepage in the stream an increase of seepage resulted in lower maximum temperatures while a decrease resulted in higher maximum temperatures table 3 the removal of shading between x 450 and 500 had a local effect on this new non shaded part where temperature increased by 0 4 c fig 9b and had only a slight effect on the maximum temperature downstream 0 1 c in scenario 5 where shading was removed from the whole stream daytime temperatures strongly increased approximately the same or more as in scenario 1b however night temperatures stayed the same since the effect of shading is depleted when there is no solar radiation fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 mapping local and diffuse groundwater seepage 4 1 1 springendalse beek the stream temperature and 222rn measurement in the springendalse beek reflected the stream to be highly influenced by groundwater as was expected from the fact that several springs exist in this particular catchment van der aa et al 1999 the stream had both local and diffuse seepage locations two local seepage spots were identified from the temperature measurements a spring and groundwater fed pond locations 1 and 3 table 1 the 222rn measurements and other field observations such as sand volcanoes loose sediments abundant presence of macrofauna and year round discharge confirmed the presence of seepage at these features fig 5 small hotspots of diffuse seepage maximum length a few meters were located at 4 locations around x 350 650 1100 and 1400 indicated by lower sd values and a dampening of the warming in summer and cooling in winter in the downstream direction however the hotspots were not clearly visible in the 222rn measurements probably because their flux was too small compared to river discharge to influence 222rn downstream the observed increase in discharge in the downstream direction indicates that low rates of diffuse seepage are occurring in the catchment but this could not be shown in the measurements as small fluxes cannot be located adequately using dts e g krause et al 2012 or 222rn measurements substantial variations in time were found between the 222rn measurements which could be related to changes in exchange with the atmosphere due to wind and turbulence e g cartwright et al 2014 cook 2013 genereux and hemond 1992 wallin et al 2011 or to changing flow velocities and discharge leading to a change in decay time the outflow of the small pond and the measured groundwater spring and piezometers have a clear groundwater 222rn signal which is much higher than the 222rn values measured in the outflow of the large groundwater fed pond fig 5 it was expected that both ponds would show a clear groundwater signal because both have a year round discharge but no inflow of surface water and therefore must have a significant input of groundwater the 222rn concentration at the large pond is the lowest measured in the catchment and was at some occasions difficult to detect fig 5 the difference in 222rn between the ponds suggests that the residence time of water in the large pond is much larger than in the small pond allowing for more decay of radon and a change in the thermal signature with a half life time of 3 8 days and ignoring degassing for simplicity seeping groundwater with a 222rn concentration of 3500 bq m 3 as measured in the piezometers and spring would take approximately 5 days to reach the average level of 1400 bq m 3 found in the small pond but 19 days to reach the average level of 117 bq m 3 found in the large pond relating the residence time with the volume and discharge in the pond is done using 35 t v n where t is the characteristic time days v is the volume l and n is the groundwater recharge l s 1 e g van ommen 1986 the outflow of the pond can be assumed to equal the groundwater discharge towards the ponds and was measured at 4 vs 3 l s 1 for the large and small pond respectively with estimated volumes of 5000 and 1300 m3 respectively the characteristic residence time is estimated to be 15 and 5 days and thus close to the estimations of 19 and 5 days using 222rn the slight deviation found for the large pond could result from an underestimation of pond volume but also from ignoring the atmospheric exchange of radon which would also lead to a decrease in the estimated residence time however we assume atmospheric exchange to be a much slower process than radioactive decay in the ponds especially because they contain stagnant water are located in a forest and thus sheltered from wind and contain abundant water plants that prohibit the presence of waves or turbulence that would promote the atmospheric exchange as atmospheric exchange would then be governed by diffusion from deeper water to the pond surface this effect was assumed to be negligible relative to the effect of the radioactive decay with a half life time of 3 8 days e g dimova et al 2013 dulaiova and burnett 2006 emerson and broecker 1973 zappa et al 2003 the longer residence time in the large pond than in the small pond results in more warming in summer table 1 especially since the large pond is barely shaded 4 1 2 elsbeek it was not possible to locate groundwater seepage in the elsbeek using the fo dts measurements an increase in streamflow and the presence of iron oxide precipitation along banks show that diffuse seepage does occur in the catchment but apparently these fluxes are not large enough to create a distinguishable temperature signal patterns in the measured temperature were attributed to morphological and riparian differences several thermal anomalies were found but were caused by the burial of sediment and presence of pools in addition the temperature and sd along the stream seem to have a good correlation with the sequence of open shaded open shaded stream stretches fig 4 4 2 dts measurements in a heterogeneous stream system similar to the conclusions of matheswaran et al 2014a the standard deviation of diurnal temperatures was found to be best suitable for locating groundwater seepage in summer while the mean temperature appeared useful for winter measurements several difficulties appeared in analysis of the dts measurements first the dts cable and streambed may be warmed up by direct solar radiation neilson et al 2010 although we did not find evidence for this second sedimentation of the dts cable led to a similar signal as seepage which was also found by e g karan et al 2017 sediment functions as insolation of the cable which therefore shows a buffered temperature signal to separate the temperature effect of sedimentation sebok et al 2015 used parallel dts cables which allowed them to detect sedimentation and scouring hilgersom et al 2016 were able to distinguish sedimentation by applying a 3d dts devise although this seems only practical for lab or small field areas third we aimed to place the cable in the centre of the stream but because of that may have missed seepage occurring only on certain sides of the stream as recent studies have shown the large heterogeneity in shallow subsurface temperatures groundwater flow paths and seepage e g gilmore et al 2016 kennedy et al 2009 rosenberry et al 2016 lastly measurements from the elsbeek suggested that stratification of water temperatures neilson et al 2010 is occurring in pools fig 4 also leading to a temperature signal similar to that of seepage these pools in the elsbeek are deep 1 m compared to the low streamflow in summer can go to zero in dry periods because the fibre optic cable is placed on the streambed the temperature of the water at the bottom of a pool is measured because more energy is needed to heat the water mass in a pool the temperature reacts more slowly on changes and thus pools present a buffered temperature signal similar to the effect of groundwater seepage the temperature at the pool bottom can significantly differ from the temperature of the surface as thermal layering can occur in deeper pools where solar radiation does not heat the entire water column sebok et al 2013 pools do not necessary greatly influence the temperature of streams as this stratification can only occur if the water flowing into the pool stays at the surface and continues to flow in the downward direction with limited mixing with the water in the pool sedimentation of the cable at the bottom of the pool may also occur further buffering the measured temperature signal 4 3 the buffering capacity of shading and stream morphology compared to other studies e g harrington et al 2017 the effect of direct solar radiation on the temperature of our study stream is relatively low and the other fluxes relatively high fig 8 direct solar radiation does not affect stream temperatures as much as the other atmospheric energy fluxes because of the high shading of the springendalse beek in addition the other energy fluxes are relatively high because the temperature difference between the stream water and air is large increasing e g longwave radiation equation 19 as expected shading reduced maximum stream temperatures table 3 fig 9 however shading has a large impact on the temperature of the stream without shading the water temperature would increase in summer by 4 c scenario 5 removing shading from a small stream stretch 50 m affected the maximum temperature even 1 km downstream scenario 4 fig 9b garner et al 2014 argued that while shading seems to cause cooling of stream water the discrepancy between the water temperature in open and shaded stretches is caused by the fact that in shaded parts water is less heated and daytime heating therefore lags behind compared to non shaded parts this could also explain the observed temperature variation between open and shaded parts in the elsbeek where temperatures increase in the non shaded parts and decrease in the shaded parts fig 4 in addition to shading the stream temperature is also influenced by the water depth a shallow stream warms up faster but also has a higher flow velocity than locations with pools allowing less time for warming of the water the temperature measured in the elsbeek showed that the temperature at the bottom of deeper pools was buffered and had less extreme temperature peaks than the surrounding stream sections because the larger body of water at these locations was able to adsorb more heat than shallow stream sections 4 4 temperature buffering by groundwater our temperature measurements showed that groundwater provides relatively cool water in summer and warm water in winter figs 4 and 5 which was especially clear in springs table 1 separating the energy fluxes of seepage from the other processes using the model fig 8 showed that the importance of groundwater for stream temperature depends on the temperature difference between the surface and groundwater for instance the buffering capacity of seepage increases during a summer day as the stream gets heated and the temperature difference increases fig 8 the scenarios showed that the increase in stream temperature resulting from decreased seepage scenario 3 is larger than the decrease in temperature following from increased seepage scenario 2 this is not only due to the change in the amount of groundwater versus the volume of stream water but also follows from the fact that with higher groundwater fluxes the temperature of seepage is more similar to the deeper groundwater than with low seepage rates because less time is available for downward conduction of heat higher seepage fluxes thus increase the temperature gradient in the streambed and therefore increase the buffering capacity of groundwater both through the advective flux and through increased streambed conduction caissie and luce 2017 recent studies showed the importance of source depth of seepage for the temperature signal that is transported by groundwater to surface waters briggs et al 2018a 2018b kurylyk et al 2015 the temperature of shallow groundwater is influenced by the seasonality at the surface and as such the buffering capacity of this groundwater is lower than that of deeper groundwater thus groundwater seepage may hold a lagged and attenuated seasonal temperature signal resulting from either the groundwater flow path and transferred from infiltration zones briggs et al 2018b 2018a kurylyk et al 2015 or from heat conduction from the streambed at the seepage zone caissie and luce 2017 our study did include the second process of heat conduction at seepage zones eq 32 which is especially important if seepage velocities are slower and deep flow paths are dominant however with the methods in our study we were not able to consider the first process of source depth which is especially important when groundwater velocities are high and or travel times short which is known to be the case for at least part of the seepage in these catchments kaandorp et al 2018a we found that the spring and two groundwater fed ponds discharge groundwater towards the stream but with different residence times from the moment of seepage till the moment of discharge to the stream this leads to a clear difference in the temperature effect on the stream which is listed in table 4 because the water discharging through the spring only takes little time to join the stream its temperature in winter is always higher than the stream water fig 3 as residence time increases the water is more influenced by atmospheric processes such as sensible heat flow and it changes temperature compared to the stream water for instance the large groundwater fed pond has an estimated residence time between 15 and 19 days and in winter discharges water towards the stream which is both colder on average and during the day maximum than the water in the stream 4 5 climate warming scenarios 1a and 1b in which air temperatures where increased in both scenarios and groundwater temperatures only in scenario 1b showed how the buffering capacity of groundwater highly depends on the temperature increase of groundwater in a changing climate much is still unknown about the exact response of the temperature of groundwater to climate change e g menberg et al 2014 watts et al 2015 kurylyk et al 2015 simulated the temperature of shallow groundwater during several climate change scenarios they showed for instance a case where 50 years after an instantaneous increase in the air temperature of 2 0 c the temperature of groundwater at a recharge location in a sandy aquifer had increased by 1 9 c at a depth of 5 m and by 1 6 c at a depth of 20 m because it is expected that the increase in the groundwater temperature will always lag behind on the increase of the air temperature e g kurylyk et al 2013 the temperature difference between the two increases in a warming climate depending on the depth where groundwater is flowing this would lead to a relative increase in the buffering capacity of groundwater compared to the current climate and thus partly buffers the effect of climate warming in groundwater dominated streams climate change might not lead to a consistent year round increase in temperatures but instead lead to a different temperature increase in summer than in winter which will also affect the buffering capacity of groundwater on stream temperature in our study area part of the streamflow is derived from deeper groundwater kaandorp et al 2018a and the temperature of this deeper groundwater depends on the average temperature increase not seasonality as seasonal signals are dampened with depth therefore if summer temperatures increase more than winter temperatures e g by 3 c and 1 c respectively and the groundwater temperature increases by the average e g 2 c the temperature difference between the stream and groundwater changes in this example the thermal buffering by groundwater is increased both in summer and winter compared to in the current climate however if the reverse happens and winter temperatures increase more than summer temperatures the buffering capacity of groundwater decreases furthermore climate change also leads to changes in cloudiness and humidity affecting direct solar radiation and latent heat flow and thus both stream and groundwater temperatures taylor and stefan 2009 we conclude that the effect of climate warming on groundwater temperatures is extremely complex and can have large spatial heterogeneity due to differences in e g recharge rates kurylyk et al 2014 and geohydrological settings 4 6 implications for groundwater dependent streams and ecology the temperature of groundwater is likely to be lower than maximum air temperatures in summer and thus in most climate warming scenarios seepage buffers temperature peaks in addition groundwater dominated streams have a lower risk of drying up than other streams and rivers and are therefore able to support the survival of species during drought springs especially can deliver a thermal signal most related to groundwater towards the stream due to their local high flow velocities which does not allow much time for downward heat conduction groundwater fed streams are less vulnerable to climate change thanks to these less intense temperature and discharge extremes however the thermal refugia created by groundwater seepage are still threatened by climate warming as many species living at these locations are more susceptible to changes in temperatures than species that are already adapted to more variable water temperatures e g hazelwood and hazelwood 1985 van den hoek and verdonschot 2001 if future temperatures rise the input flux of groundwater might not be high enough to ensure the required low temperature certain species need to survive e g kurylyk et al 2014 the high groundwater input into the springendalse beek allows for the presence of spring and spring stream species verdonschot 1990 and a high amount of rare species van walsum et al 2002 this together with the high amount of shading makes this stream a special case especially for the netherlands and worth protecting 5 conclusions several measurement techniques were combined with a stream temperature model in order to study the importance of groundwater on the temperature of lowland streams using dts measurements localized seepage was mapped in two dutch streams which was confirmed by sampling of 222rn we have seen that groundwater seepage is able to buffer the temperature of stream and provide thermal and climate refugia by lowering maximum temperatures seasonality in seepage temperatures can be caused by shallow and fast flow paths from infiltration areas or by heat conduction in seepage zones with slow groundwater velocities our measurements suggest that while air temperature and shading generally have a large influence on stream temperature the presence of significant seepage can be crucial in the occurrence of thermal refugia the effect of groundwater may be even more important in a warming climate although this depends on the exact change in air temperature and its seasonality we conclude that groundwater dominated streams are potentially more climate resilient than streams without a significant contribution from seepage it seems possible to make use of groundwater in reducing summer temperature maximums as an alternative or additionally to the creation of riparian shading for instance reducing the pumping of groundwater can increase groundwater levels and seepage more research effort is needed on the exact consequence of climate change on the temperature of groundwater and therefore of seepage as this is still mostly unclear and depends on many local factors we conclude with the statement that groundwater seepage is a crucial factor to include the study and management of lowland stream temperatures and ecology

8616,groundwater seepage influences the temperature of streams and rivers by providing a relatively cool input in summer and warm input in winter because of this groundwater seepage can be a determining factor in the provision of suitable water temperatures for aquatic biota climate warming affects stream and groundwater temperatures and changes the thermal characteristics of streams leading to the potential disappearance of habitats in this study the importance of groundwater for the temperature of two dutch lowland streams and its possible role in mitigating the effects of climate change was determined by combining field measurements and a modelling experiment stream temperature measurements using fibre optic cables fo dts and sampling of 222rn were done to map localized groundwater inflow several springs and seepage hot spots were located which buffered the water temperature in summer and winter a stream temperature model was constructed and calibrated using the fo dts measurements to quantify the energy fluxes acting on stream water this way the contribution to the stream thermal budget of direct solar radiation air temperature and seepage were separated the model was then used to simulate the effects of changes in shading groundwater seepage and climate shading was shown to be an important control on summer temperature maxima groundwater seepage seemed to buffer the effect of climate warming potentially making groundwater dominated streams more climate robust protecting groundwater resources in a changing climate is important for the survival of aquatic species in groundwater fed systems as groundwater seepage both sustains flow and buffers temperature extremes keywords stream temperature groundwater surface water interaction

aquatic ecology still requires more research the objective of this study is to determine the influence of groundwater on the temperature of two dutch lowland streams and to get insight into its possible role in mitigating the effects of climate change for this both field measurements and a modelling experiment are done research questions are a what is the spatial variability of groundwater seepage to the streams b what is the spatial and temporal effect of groundwater seepage on stream temperature c how does the effect of groundwater inflow on stream temperature compare to the effect of air temperature and radiation including shading and d what is the effect of groundwater on stream temperature in a warming climate we combine different field techniques such as fibre optic distributed temperature sensing fo dts and measurements of the isotope 222rn to detect diffuse and localized groundwater inputs to the two dutch lowland streams fo dts is used to make high resolution temperature measurements both in time and space selker et al 2006 compared to surface water the temperature of groundwater is relatively constant throughout the year and as such lateral changes in stream water

2013 vandenbohede et al 2014 westhoff et al 2007 the presence of the isotope 222rn in surface water also indicates recent seepage of groundwater as it is rapidly removed in surface waters by radioactive decay and degassing in addition to this field data we construct a stream temperature model which includes the effects of air temperature radiation shading and groundwater seepage the model is used to analyze the behavior of the different processes affecting stream temperature by applying different scenarios we derive the effect of climate change on stream thermal habitats and the mitigating effects of groundwater seepage 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area field measurements were done in two lowland streams in the east of the netherlands the springendalse beek and the elsbeek fig 1 with catchments sizes of 4 km2 and 11 km2 respectively these streams discharge to the dinkel river the area has a temperate marine climate with a mean annual air temperature of 9 6 c and mean annual precipitation and evaporation of 850 and 560 mm per year respectively the average discharge is 0 043 m3 s 1 for the springendalse beek and 0 104 m3 s 1 for the elsbeek the subsurface of the catchments consists of shallow aquifers 1 20 m thick on top of clayey moraines the streambed of the streams consists of sand with occasionally some gravel details on the study catchments were described by kaandorp et al 2018b a concise description of the studied stream stretches is given here the upstream catchment of the springendalse beek contains a few distinct spring areas and consists mainly of forest with some agricultural fields the studied stream stretch extends 1500 m downstream from the stream origin fig 1a the upstream part has a relatively stable discharge a stream width between 0 5 and 1 0 m and a water depth of a few centimetres a small spring a tributary two seepage ponds and tributaries from a swamp discharge into the stream fig 1a the downstream part has a width of 1 0 1 5 m and a water depth of around 10 cm the elsbeek predominantly consists of agricultural areas the measured stream stretch extends from approximately 5000 to 6500 m downstream from the stream origin fig 1b the most upstream 200 m of the study stretch is straightened flows through an agricultural area and has a width of about 1 m and a water depth of around 5 cm here the outflow of an agricultural ditch which dries up during summer joins the stream this is followed by a stream stretch with a riparian forest and a pool riffle sequence with pools up to 1 m deep and a width varying between 0 5 and 1 5 m a stretch with a length of 150 m in the central part is again straightened and flows through an agricultural area with a width of around 1 m and a water depth of about 30 cm after this an agricultural ditch joins the stream the most downstream part of the studied stream stretch flows again through a forest is shallow 3 10 cm and has a width varying between 0 5 and 2 0 m this part of the stream is deeply incised 1 0 1 5 m into the landscape 2 2 fo dts set up stream temperatures were measured using an oryx dts sensornet usa unit and ctc lszh fibre optic cables tkf connectivity solutions netherlands a cable with a length of 1300 m was positioned in the study stretch of the springendalse beek from 200 m downstream from the stream origin x 200 to the end of the studied stream stretch x 1500 fig 1 at x 305 and x 435 the cable was looped back and forth through a small spring directly next to the stream x 305 and in a side branch of the stream x 435 respectively fig 1a approximately 1500 m of fibre optic cable was installed in the elsbeek covering the two forested stream stretches and two open areas fig 1b in both streams the cable was installed on the streambed and fixed using u shaped metal pegs a double ended configuration was used with two calibration baths next to the oxyx unit and a splice at the end of the fibre optic cable by using the double ended setup corrections for splices and light attenuation in the fibre optic cable can be made hausner et al 2011 van de giesen et al 2012 for calibration a coil of cable was placed in each isolated calibration bath which was equipped with a pt 100 temperature sensor and connected with the oryx unit measurements were done for the whole months of august 2016 and january 2017 to capture both summer and winter temperature patterns each dts measurement was done with a spatial resolution of 1 0 m and consisted of sequential measuring of 5 min through 2 channels which were repeated either every half an hour summer or every hour winter because the dts cable was placed on the streambed the measurements represent the temperature at the bottom of the stream unless it was buried by sediments sediment was removed from the dts cable several times but it could not be prevented that during part of the measurement period some parts of the cable were buried by sediment in the streambed the temperature variation present in the stream is attenuated with depth and as such sedimentation leads to a temperature signal comparable to that of groundwater seepage such as a decrease in the standard deviation sd of the temperature sebok et al 2015 the dts temperature measurements were calibrated using dispersion slope and offset corrections which followed from the calibration baths further corrections for offsets were applied using onset 12 bit temperature smart sensors s tmb m006 with hobo data loggers h21 001 which were installed just above the stream bed at 5 locations in the springendalse beek and 3 locations in the elsbeek fig 1 comparison of the separate temperature sensors and the corrected dts temperature measurements showed that stream temperatures could be measured with an accuracy of 0 19 c on average temperatures were logged every 15 min and some of the loggers were supplied with an extra sensor to measure air temperature additional weather data was collected from nearby meteorological station twenthe of the royal netherlands meteorological institute knmi 2 3 radon measurements 222rn an isotope released to the groundwater from aquifer material was used as a tracer for groundwater in along stream profiling cartwright et al 2014 cook et al 2006 genereux and hemond 1990 samples were taken and measured immediately in the field using an electronic radon detector rad7 durridge high radon values in streams were expected to be found only near locations with groundwater seepage because it rapidly decays half life of 3 8 days and is released to the atmosphere due to degassing 2 4 stream temperature model a stream temperature model stm gw was built in python using the xarray simlab model framework bovy and mcbain 2017 the model is largely based on the model descriptions of boyd and kasper 2003 and westhoff et al 2007 and additionally simulates the interaction with groundwater in more detail fig 2 in the model all water fluxes q are considered constant in time and only increase in the downstream direction due to groundwater and lateral inflow the stream stretch is discretized into a 1d cell centred grid and to prevent numerical diffusion a courant number of 1 is used for this the size of the stream cells fluctuates spatially with the flow velocity which depends on the discharge depth and stream width 1 c v i δ t δ

friction is considered to be negligible 2 5 model parameterization the model was set up for a length of 1500 m divided into 45 cells based on the flow velocity eq 3 and with characteristics similar to the springendalse beek such as springs tributaries and groundwater fed ponds the model was run with a time step of 90 s for a total of three months june and july 2016 to spin up the model to get rid of artificial features inherited from the simple initial condition and august 2016 for analysis the vertical streambed models consisted of cells of 0 05 m and had a constant temperature boundary equal to the mean annual air temperature at a depth of 5 m this depth could potentially be too shallow to have no seasonal temperature variations and we therefore ran a model test with the boundary at a depth of 10 m but this did not result in a significant difference in stream temperature the first cell was fed by seepage and an extra discharge component with the same temperature as the seepage in that cell so that this discharge could be calibrated without getting unrealistic seepage rates through the small streambed area in the model cell air temperature humidity cloud cover and solar radiation were measured at nearby meteorological station twenthe by the dutch meteorological institute the values that were used for thermal physical properties of the sediments were reported by anibas et al 2011 for another lowland stream with a sandy streambed and a wind velocity of 0 1 m s 1 was taken from westhoff et al 2007 representing the wind sheltered location of the stream in a dense forest with abundant plants growing in and around the stream 2 6 scenario modelling different scenarios were run with the calibrated model table 3 the effect of climate warming was tested by raising the air temperature by two degrees in scenario 1a while keeping the temperature of the deeper groundwater the same because the increase in air temperature is expected to also increase the temperature of the groundwater e g menberg et al 2014 taylor and stefan 2009 in scenario 1b both the air and groundwater temperature were increased by 2 c the importance of groundwater was tested by running the model with 50 more and 50 less groundwater seepage in the stream scenarios 2 and 3 the effect of shading was evaluated by removing shading from a small part of the modelled stream scenario 4 and by removing shading from the whole catchment scenario 5 3 results 3 1 fo dts temperature measurements 3 1 1 springendalse beek fig 3 displays results of temperature measurements in the springendalse beek in summer and winter in summer the absolute temperature slightly increases in the downstream direction fig 3b and the daily temperature amplitude tends to go up when there are no lateral inflows low temperatures between 10 3 and 15 0 c close to the spring area x 200 indicate a strong influence of groundwater inflow downstream of the spring the inflow of groundwater is less and stream temperature is more influenced by atmospheric processes measured temperatures vary between 12 3 and 18 8 c at x 1450 fig 3b in winter the effect of groundwater seepage also is clearly visible in the dts measurements upstream the stream water has a relatively high temperature in winter 5 0 9 6 c while temperatures decrease downstream 2 1 6 6 c fig 3e g the mean and average daily standard deviation sd were also derived from the dts data in order to locate groundwater seepage zones using the fact that groundwater has less temperature variation and thus the sd is lowered at locations with seepage e g hare et al 2015 lowry et al 2007 matheswaran et al 2014a rosenberry et al 2016 see for instance at x 630 and table 1 which summarizes the data for some specific locations upstream in the springendalse beek the sd is around 0 5 c both in summer and winter and in the downstream direction increases in summer to around 1 c and remains approximately stable at 0 5 c in winter table 1 lists characteristics of thermal anomalies associated with specific hydrological features such as tributaries and springs at location 1 fig 3 the cable was looped through the outflow of a small spring which had a lower summer and higher winter temperature than the water in the stream table 1 as a result of the stable temperature of groundwater seepage the outflow of a small groundwater fed pond at location 3 had this same thermal groundwater characteristics of lower summer and higher winter temperatures than the stream water in addition the stream temperature at x 350 650 1100 and 1400 m had similar characteristics as the spring 1 and the small groundwater fed pond 3 the up to downstream summer warming and winter cooling was dampened and sd values were lower than expected fig 3 this suggests that significant seepage occurs at these locations the outflow of a larger groundwater fed pond at 4 had high summer temperatures and a high sd table 1 which is different from the small groundwater fed pond and suggests a smaller groundwater influence on the temperature this is potentially due to a longer residence time in the larger pond although fed by groundwater the larger volume of the pond results in a larger residence time of the water which slowly loses the groundwater thermal signal contrary to the groundwater indicative thermal signals a tributary stream at location 2 fig 3 had relatively high summer and low winter temperatures table 1 and the same holds for the outflow of a swamp through two small tributaries at location 5 the discharge of both these inflows is fed by an agricultural area where it derives from drains shallow groundwater and is influenced by atmospheric processes while flowing towards the springendalse beek besides effects from groundwater seepage effects of air temperature and rainfall are also visible in the dts measurements for instance a sharp increase in stream temperature occurred between august 1st and 2nd fig 3a and is the result of input from precipitation during a rainstorm in addition monitoring artefacts are shown for instance around x 1280 where a temperature increase is seen from august 4th as a result of the cable becoming exposed to air due to lowering of the water level 3 1 2 elsbeek the measured stream stretch in the elsbeek is located further downstream from the stream origin than the measured stretch in the springendalse beek approximately 5000 vs 200 m the measured temperature of the elsbeek slightly decreases in the downstream direction before increasing between x 750 and 900 and finally decreasing again towards the most downstream measured point fig 4 a b this pattern is also clearly visible in the sd fig 4c which is lower at locations with a lower temperature the parts of the stream with decreasing temperatures coincide with the locations of riparian forests while the stretches with increasing temperatures are located in agricultural fields the temperature measurements show several negative spikes in maximum temperature and sd fig 4 while this appears similar to the characteristics of seepage these locations have a minimum temperature significantly above the average groundwater temperature of around 11 c instead of seepage visual inspections showed that at these locations the dts cable is either located on the bottom of stagnant pools or buried by sediment 3 2 222rn measurements the 222rn concentration in groundwater was measured both at piezometers within our catchment which showed concentrations between 3210 and 5800 bq m 3 and at the spring which showed concentrations of 733 and 3730 bq m 3 fig 5 the low spring concentration of 733 bq m 3 might be influenced by recent precipitation or by some decay in the spring area as the other radon concentrations of 3000 bq m 3 and higher are in line with the concentrations found for groundwater in other studies in the netherlands including well fields in the region of our catchment kwakman and versteegh 2016 yu et al 2019 the 222rn activity in the stream water in the most upstream part of the springendalse beek catchment is between 104 and 1240 bq m 3 while more downstream 222rn concentrations are below 500 bq m 3 fig 5 showing a decrease in groundwater influence in the downstream direction the small groundwater fed pond has a mean radon level of 1388 bq m3 n 4 indicating a large relative influence of recent groundwater seepage the concentrations in the large pond have an average of 177 bq m 3 n 3 fig 5 indicating only a small influence of recent seepage 3 3 model calibration the manual calibration was done step wise and an overview of the model parameters is shown in table 2 the model is most sensitive to the parameters θvts ddiffuse upstream starting q and the width of the stream and therefore focus was on these parameters during calibration discharge from groundwater seepage and lateral inflow stream width and depth and shading varied along the stream length and were estimated using our knowledge of the field sites and were then further calibrated fig 6 the initial temperature of the stream and the streambed were set to 10 and 11 c respectively calibration of df and ddiffuse resulted in values of 0 5 and 0 0 respectively lateral inflow from an agricultural stream was added to the model at x 435 the temperature of this inflow represented discharge from a tile drained area seepage from 1 m depth the two seepage ponds in the springendalse beek were located at locations x 650 and 1150 m in the model the pond sizes depths shading and seepage rates were also calibrated with the dts measurements their depths were 1 5 and 1 0 m and their surface areas 900 and 3000 m2 respectively the pond at 650 m had a calibrated seepage rate of 1000 mm per day and was 90 shaded the pond at 1150 m had a calibrated seepage rate of 350 mm per day and was not shaded with a shading factor of only 10 3 4 modelled temperature distribution along the stream the calibrated stm gw model using the parameters listed in table 2 shows a reasonable fit with the observed dts data from the springendalse beek fig 7 especially considering that the model does not include local heterogeneity in e g water depth and air temperature both the diurnal temperature variation in the up and downstream temperature are represented well by the model although the simulated temperature upstream is slightly underestimated fig 7b fig 7c shows the modelled result for two night and two days 2 am and 2 pm for a warmer day day 1 and colder day day 2 the temperature pattern from up to downstream on these days is simulated adequately by the model including the modelled features such as the spring and tributary spring especially the temperature step resulting from the tributary stream at x 450 and the inflow of water from the seepage ponds x 700 and x 1200 lead to clear temperature steps in the model that were also observed in the dts measurements fig 7c using the model we were able to investigate the theoretical importance of the different processes affecting the stream temperature for comparison with the other energy fluxes the heat energy provided by seepage w m 2 was calculated using 34 e seepage δ t v z c w ρ w where δ t is the temperature difference between the stream and seeping groundwater which means that eq 34 gives the energy flux compared to the current stream water temperature and is thus an apparent rather than an absolute heat flux as explained by kurylyk et al 2016 fig 8 shows the modelled energy fluxes to and from the stream on august 6 2016 the energy flux from seepage is mostly negative because seepage of groundwater often leads to cooling on summer days the higher seepage rates given to the upstream part of the model are also shown in the energy fluxes fig 8a and c higher seepage rates lead to more cooling of the stream both through the advective flux and through increased streambed conduction the negative energy fluxes from both bed conduction and seepage increase during the day because stream water is heated and the temperature difference between seepage and stream water increases the flux from solar radiation naturally has a day night fluctuation and is lower at locations with shading sensible heat flow is dependent on the difference between stream water and air temperature eq 27 and therefore shows a day night pattern as well it decreases in the downstream direction as the difference between stream water and air temperature decreases due to the heating or cooling of the stream water in the downstream direction by atmospheric processes 3 5 scenario modelling from the base run fig 7 several model parameters were changed to simulate different scenarios to get a better understanding of the possible future changes resulting from climate change and the role of groundwater in this table 3 shows the upstream x 200 and downstream x 1450 average minimum and maximum stream temperature for the calibrated base run and five different scenarios an increase in air temperature in scenarios 1a and 1b resulted in an increase in water temperature fig 9 a in scenario 1a a stable groundwater temperature buffers the increase in water temperature compared to scenario 1b where the stream temperature increased by approximately the same amount as the air and groundwater temperature table 3 fig 9a the upstream temperature is hardly affected by an increase in air temperature because it is located close to the upstream stream spring especially the night temperature both up and downstream seems to be almost fully determined by the groundwater temperature as the 2 c increase of the lower boundary in scenario 1b leads to a similar increase of the minimum temperature both upstream and downstream scenarios 2 and 3 show the effect of an increase or decrease of groundwater seepage in the stream an increase of seepage resulted in lower maximum temperatures while a decrease resulted in higher maximum temperatures table 3 the removal of shading between x 450 and 500 had a local effect on this new non shaded part where temperature increased by 0 4 c fig 9b and had only a slight effect on the maximum temperature downstream 0 1 c in scenario 5 where shading was removed from the whole stream daytime temperatures strongly increased approximately the same or more as in scenario 1b however night temperatures stayed the same since the effect of shading is depleted when there is no solar radiation fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 mapping local and diffuse groundwater seepage 4 1 1 springendalse beek the stream temperature and 222rn measurement in the springendalse beek reflected the stream to be highly influenced by groundwater as was expected from the fact that several springs exist in this particular catchment van der aa et al 1999 the stream had both local and diffuse seepage locations two local seepage spots were identified from the temperature measurements a spring and groundwater fed pond locations 1 and 3 table 1 the 222rn measurements and other field observations such as sand volcanoes loose sediments abundant presence of macrofauna and year round discharge confirmed the presence of seepage at these features fig 5 small hotspots of diffuse seepage maximum length a few meters were located at 4 locations around x 350 650 1100 and 1400 indicated by lower sd values and a dampening of the warming in summer and cooling in winter in the downstream direction however the hotspots were not clearly visible in the 222rn measurements probably because their flux was too small compared to river discharge to influence 222rn downstream the observed increase in discharge in the downstream direction indicates that low rates of diffuse seepage are occurring in the catchment but this could not be shown in the measurements as small fluxes cannot be located adequately using dts e g krause et al 2012 or 222rn measurements substantial variations in time were found between the 222rn measurements which could be related to changes in exchange with the atmosphere due to wind and turbulence e g cartwright et al 2014 cook 2013 genereux and hemond 1992 wallin et al 2011 or to changing flow velocities and discharge leading to a change in decay time the outflow of the small pond and the measured groundwater spring and piezometers have a clear groundwater 222rn signal which is much higher than the 222rn values measured in the outflow of the large groundwater fed pond fig 5 it was expected that both ponds would show a clear groundwater signal because both have a year round discharge but no inflow of surface water and therefore must have a significant input of groundwater the 222rn concentration at the large pond is the lowest measured in the catchment and was at some occasions difficult to detect fig 5 the difference in 222rn between the ponds suggests that the residence time of water in the large pond is much larger than in the small pond allowing for more decay of radon and a change in the thermal signature with a half life time of 3 8 days and ignoring degassing for simplicity seeping groundwater with a 222rn concentration of 3500 bq m 3 as measured in the piezometers and spring would take approximately 5 days to reach the average level of 1400 bq m 3 found in the small pond but 19 days to reach the average level of 117 bq m 3 found in the large pond relating the residence time with the volume and discharge in the pond is done using 35 t v n where t is the characteristic time days v is the volume l and n is the groundwater recharge l s 1 e g van ommen 1986 the outflow of the pond can be assumed to equal the groundwater discharge towards the ponds and was measured at 4 vs 3 l s 1 for the large and small pond respectively with estimated volumes of 5000 and 1300 m3 respectively the characteristic residence time is estimated to be 15 and 5 days and thus close to the estimations of 19 and 5 days using 222rn the slight deviation found for the large pond could result from an underestimation of pond volume but also from ignoring the atmospheric exchange of radon which would also lead to a decrease in the estimated residence time however we assume atmospheric exchange to be a much slower process than radioactive decay in the ponds especially because they contain stagnant water are located in a forest and thus sheltered from wind and contain abundant water plants that prohibit the presence of waves or turbulence that would promote the atmospheric exchange as atmospheric exchange would then be governed by diffusion from deeper water to the pond surface this effect was assumed to be negligible relative to the effect of the radioactive decay with a half life time of 3 8 days e g dimova et al 2013 dulaiova and burnett 2006 emerson and broecker 1973 zappa et al 2003 the longer residence time in the large pond than in the small pond results in more warming in summer table 1 especially since the large pond is barely shaded 4 1 2 elsbeek it was not possible to locate groundwater seepage in the elsbeek using the fo dts measurements an increase in streamflow and the presence of iron oxide precipitation along banks show that diffuse seepage does occur in the catchment but apparently these fluxes are not large enough to create a distinguishable temperature signal patterns in the measured temperature were attributed to morphological and riparian differences several thermal anomalies were found but were caused by the burial of sediment and presence of pools in addition the temperature and sd along the stream seem to have a good correlation with the sequence of open shaded open shaded stream stretches fig 4 4 2 dts measurements in a heterogeneous stream system similar to the conclusions of matheswaran et al 2014a the standard deviation of diurnal temperatures was found to be best suitable for locating groundwater seepage in summer while the mean temperature appeared useful for winter measurements several difficulties appeared in analysis of the dts measurements first the dts cable and streambed may be warmed up by direct solar radiation neilson et al 2010 although we did not find evidence for this second sedimentation of the dts cable led to a similar signal as seepage which was also found by e g karan et al 2017 sediment functions as insolation of the cable which therefore shows a buffered temperature signal to separate the temperature effect of sedimentation sebok et al 2015 used parallel dts cables which allowed them to detect sedimentation and scouring hilgersom et al 2016 were able to distinguish sedimentation by applying a 3d dts devise although this seems only practical for lab or small field areas third we aimed to place the cable in the centre of the stream but because of that may have missed seepage occurring only on certain sides of the stream as recent studies have shown the large heterogeneity in shallow subsurface temperatures groundwater flow paths and seepage e g gilmore et al 2016 kennedy et al 2009 rosenberry et al 2016 lastly measurements from the elsbeek suggested that stratification of water temperatures neilson et al 2010 is occurring in pools fig 4 also leading to a temperature signal similar to that of seepage these pools in the elsbeek are deep 1 m compared to the low streamflow in summer can go to zero in dry periods because the fibre optic cable is placed on the streambed the temperature of the water at the bottom of a pool is measured because more energy is needed to heat the water mass in a pool the temperature reacts more slowly on changes and thus pools present a buffered temperature signal similar to the effect of groundwater seepage the temperature at the pool bottom can significantly differ from the temperature of the surface as thermal layering can occur in deeper pools where solar radiation does not heat the entire water column sebok et al 2013 pools do not necessary greatly influence the temperature of streams as this stratification can only occur if the water flowing into the pool stays at the surface and continues to flow in the downward direction with limited mixing with the water in the pool sedimentation of the cable at the bottom of the pool may also occur further buffering the measured temperature signal 4 3 the buffering capacity of shading and stream morphology compared to other studies e g harrington et al 2017 the effect of direct solar radiation on the temperature of our study stream is relatively low and the other fluxes relatively high fig 8 direct solar radiation does not affect stream temperatures as much as the other atmospheric energy fluxes because of the high shading of the springendalse beek in addition the other energy fluxes are relatively high because the temperature difference between the stream water and air is large increasing e g longwave radiation equation 19 as expected shading reduced maximum stream temperatures table 3 fig 9 however shading has a large impact on the temperature of the stream without shading the water temperature would increase in summer by 4 c scenario 5 removing shading from a small stream stretch 50 m affected the maximum temperature even 1 km downstream scenario 4 fig 9b garner et al 2014 argued that while shading seems to cause cooling of stream water the discrepancy between the water temperature in open and shaded stretches is caused by the fact that in shaded parts water is less heated and daytime heating therefore lags behind compared to non shaded parts this could also explain the observed temperature variation between open and shaded parts in the elsbeek where temperatures increase in the non shaded parts and decrease in the shaded parts fig 4 in addition to shading the stream temperature is also influenced by the water depth a shallow stream warms up faster but also has a higher flow velocity than locations with pools allowing less time for warming of the water the temperature measured in the elsbeek showed that the temperature at the bottom of deeper pools was buffered and had less extreme temperature peaks than the surrounding stream sections because the larger body of water at these locations was able to adsorb more heat than shallow stream sections 4 4 temperature buffering by groundwater our temperature measurements showed that groundwater provides relatively cool water in summer and warm water in winter figs 4 and 5 which was especially clear in springs table 1 separating the energy fluxes of seepage from the other processes using the model fig 8 showed that the importance of groundwater for stream temperature depends on the temperature difference between the surface and groundwater for instance the buffering capacity of seepage increases during a summer day as the stream gets heated and the temperature difference increases fig 8 the scenarios showed that the increase in stream temperature resulting from decreased seepage scenario 3 is larger than the decrease in temperature following from increased seepage scenario 2 this is not only due to the change in the amount of groundwater versus the volume of stream water but also follows from the fact that with higher groundwater fluxes the temperature of seepage is more similar to the deeper groundwater than with low seepage rates because less time is available for downward conduction of heat higher seepage fluxes thus increase the temperature gradient in the streambed and therefore increase the buffering capacity of groundwater both through the advective flux and through increased streambed conduction caissie and luce 2017 recent studies showed the importance of source depth of seepage for the temperature signal that is transported by groundwater to surface waters briggs et al 2018a 2018b kurylyk et al 2015 the temperature of shallow groundwater is influenced by the seasonality at the surface and as such the buffering capacity of this groundwater is lower than that of deeper groundwater thus groundwater seepage may hold a lagged and attenuated seasonal temperature signal resulting from either the groundwater flow path and transferred from infiltration zones briggs et al 2018b 2018a kurylyk et al 2015 or from heat conduction from the streambed at the seepage zone caissie and luce 2017 our study did include the second process of heat conduction at seepage zones eq 32 which is especially important if seepage velocities are slower and deep flow paths are dominant however with the methods in our study we were not able to consider the first process of source depth which is especially important when groundwater velocities are high and or travel times short which is known to be the case for at least part of the seepage in these catchments kaandorp et al 2018a we found that the spring and two groundwater fed ponds discharge groundwater towards the stream but with different residence times from the moment of seepage till the moment of discharge to the stream this leads to a clear difference in the temperature effect on the stream which is listed in table 4 because the water discharging through the spring only takes little time to join the stream its temperature in winter is always higher than the stream water fig 3 as residence time increases the water is more influenced by atmospheric processes such as sensible heat flow and it changes temperature compared to the stream water for instance the large groundwater fed pond has an estimated residence time between 15 and 19 days and in winter discharges water towards the stream which is both colder on average and during the day maximum than the water in the stream 4 5 climate warming scenarios 1a and 1b in which air temperatures where increased in both scenarios and groundwater temperatures only in scenario 1b showed how the buffering capacity of groundwater highly depends on the temperature increase of groundwater in a changing climate much is still unknown about the exact response of the temperature of groundwater to climate change e g menberg et al 2014 watts et al 2015 kurylyk et al 2015 simulated the temperature of shallow groundwater during several climate change scenarios they showed for instance a case where 50 years after an instantaneous increase in the air temperature of 2 0 c the temperature of groundwater at a recharge location in a sandy aquifer had increased by 1 9 c at a depth of 5 m and by 1 6 c at a depth of 20 m because it is expected that the increase in the groundwater temperature will always lag behind on the increase of the air temperature e g kurylyk et al 2013 the temperature difference between the two increases in a warming climate depending on the depth where groundwater is flowing this would lead to a relative increase in the buffering capacity of groundwater compared to the current climate and thus partly buffers the effect of climate warming in groundwater dominated streams climate change might not lead to a consistent year round increase in temperatures but instead lead to a different temperature increase in summer than in winter which will also affect the buffering capacity of groundwater on stream temperature in our study area part of the streamflow is derived from deeper groundwater kaandorp et al 2018a and the temperature of this deeper groundwater depends on the average temperature increase not seasonality as seasonal signals are dampened with depth therefore if summer temperatures increase more than winter temperatures e g by 3 c and 1 c respectively and the groundwater temperature increases by the average e g 2 c the temperature difference between the stream and groundwater changes in this example the thermal buffering by groundwater is increased both in summer and winter compared to in the current climate however if the reverse happens and winter temperatures increase more than summer temperatures the buffering capacity of groundwater decreases furthermore climate change also leads to changes in cloudiness and humidity affecting direct solar radiation and latent heat flow and thus both stream and groundwater temperatures taylor and stefan 2009 we conclude that the effect of climate warming on groundwater temperatures is extremely complex and can have large spatial heterogeneity due to differences in e g recharge rates kurylyk et al 2014 and geohydrological settings 4 6 implications for groundwater dependent streams and ecology the temperature of groundwater is likely to be lower than maximum air temperatures in summer and thus in most climate warming scenarios seepage buffers temperature peaks in addition groundwater dominated streams have a lower risk of drying up than other streams and rivers and are therefore able to support the survival of species during drought springs especially can deliver a thermal signal most related to groundwater towards the stream due to their local high flow velocities which does not allow much time for downward heat conduction groundwater fed streams are less vulnerable to climate change thanks to these less intense temperature and discharge extremes however the thermal refugia created by groundwater seepage are still threatened by climate warming as many species living at these locations are more susceptible to changes in temperatures than species that are already adapted to more variable water temperatures e g hazelwood and hazelwood 1985 van den hoek and verdonschot 2001 if future temperatures rise the input flux of groundwater might not be high enough to ensure the required low temperature certain species need to survive e g kurylyk et al 2014 the high groundwater input into the springendalse beek allows for the presence of spring and spring stream species verdonschot 1990 and a high amount of rare species van walsum et al 2002 this together with the high amount of shading makes this stream a special case especially for the netherlands and worth protecting 5 conclusions several measurement techniques were combined with a stream temperature model in order to study the importance of groundwater on the temperature of lowland streams using dts measurements localized seepage was mapped in two dutch streams which was confirmed by sampling of 222rn we have seen that groundwater seepage is able to buffer the temperature of stream and provide thermal and climate refugia by lowering maximum temperatures seasonality in seepage temperatures can be caused by shallow and fast flow paths from infiltration areas or by heat conduction in seepage zones with slow groundwater velocities our measurements suggest that while air temperature and shading generally have a large influence on stream temperature the presence of significant seepage can be crucial in the occurrence of thermal refugia the effect of groundwater may be even more important in a warming climate although this depends on the exact change in air temperature and its seasonality we conclude that groundwater dominated streams are potentially more climate resilient than streams without a significant contribution from seepage it seems possible to make use of groundwater in reducing summer temperature maximums as an alternative or additionally to the creation of riparian shading for instance reducing the pumping of groundwater can increase groundwater levels and seepage more research effort is needed on the exact consequence of climate change on the temperature of groundwater and therefore of seepage as this is still mostly unclear and depends on many local factors we conclude with the statement that groundwater seepage is a crucial factor to include the study and management of lowland stream temperatures and ecology

with the widespread availability of moderate resolution remotely sensed and geographic information system gis derived datasets at national scales coupled with assemblages of streamflow observation datasets opportunities have emerged to develop relatively high resolution spatially explicit classifications of streamflow permanence at regional extents that also account for prevailing hydrologic conditions the prospect of temporally dynamic streamflow permanence classifications at a regional scale consequently not only allows for improved understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of streamflow permanence and the physiographic and hydroclimatic variables that control streamflow permanence costigan et al 2016 datry et al 2018 eng et al 2016 but also serves as an immediate tool to

encompassed all of washington most of oregon and idaho western montana and smaller portions of wyoming utah and nevada along state boundaries fig 1 post hoc analysis of the variability in the prosper model output was evaluated by partitioning the study area into four subbasin regions 17a b c and d based on approximate partitioning between huc4 basins fig 1 increases in digit numbers associated with the huc correspond to smaller basin size the huc4 watershed boundaries presumably reflect similarity in climate and physiography and therefore are a reasonable approach to evaluate subregional variability as well as a convenient straightforward approach to break up the relatively large study area for a post hoc subregional analysis topographically the study area includes mountain chains of varying spatial extent broad valley and lowland areas and extensive plateau regions fig 1 the study area occurs in four geologic provinces that include the cascade volcanoes the columbia plateau the north cascades and the coast mountains the region is mostly underlain by volcanic rock but also includes areas of granite metamorphic and mixed sedimentary and volcanic rock schruben et al 1994 portions of the study area are strongly influenced by volcanism and the last glacial maximum the study area represents a broad range of climates from inland arid and semi arid to coastal humid regions

from mild temperatures and rain dominated precipitation along the coast and at low elevations to cold temperatures and snow dominated precipitation at higher elevations griffith 2010 the methow river basin in washington the adjacent basins of willow and whitehorse creeks in oregon and the boise river basin in idaho were selected to serve as examples for a more detailed evaluation of the spatiotemporal variability of streamflow permanence predictions within the context of basin scale hydroclimatic conditions fig 1 table si 1 these focal basins represent the broad range of hydroclimatic and physical conditions in the study area and illustrate the range in predictive ability of prosper by including a gradient of streamflow permanence conditions konrad et al 2003 wood et al 2009 schultz et al 2017 in particular the methow river basin is known to have strong surface groundwater interactions konrad et al 2003 which are processes not directly captured by prosper the boise river and willow and whitehorse creek basins have similar geologic and climatic conditions but willow and whitehorse creeks tend towards reduced streamflow permanence compared to the boise river 2 2 data to build the prosper model we used streamflow permanence observations aggregated from various datasets that were part of previous or ongoing field data collection efforts mcshane et al 2017 a broad suite of gis derived climate and physiographic characteristics were used as predictor variables for streamflow permanence probabilities 2 2 1 streamflow observations a total of 3878 observations 1941 wet 1937 dry were used in the prosper model fig 1 final observations used in the prosper model were filtered methods detailed in sando and hockman wert 2018 from a larger dataset of 24 316 streamflow observations that occurred from 1977 to 2016 the larger observation dataset was compiled or derived from 11 datasets that were part of independent projects that included aquatic species habitat surveys wet dry stream channel mapping and beneficial use reconnaissance surveys or were collected specifically for the prosper project mcshane et al 2017 observations were distributed across a range of drainage areas 0 092 24 300 km2 with a focus on small streams more than one third of the observations occurred in streams with a drainage area less than 10 km2 streamflow observations included one time surveys and repeat surveys extending over several years as well as discrete locations or continuous sections of a stream channel reach the streamflow observations were processed into a single consistent binary dataset with classifications of wet or dry a site classified as wet required the presence of surface water that could either be flowing or standing water in pools a site classified as dry had no surface water present wet classifications required that the observation occurred after july 1 to coincide with the hydroclimatically driest time of the year dry classifications could occur any time within the year repeat streamflow observations within a single year at the same location were considered dry if any of the observations were dry or wet if all observations were wet and an observation occurred after july 1 2 2 2 climatic and physiographic variables to capture the mechanisms that influence streamflow permanence in the study area a total of 257 climatic and 35 physical predictor variables 292 total were considered for inclusion in the statistical model development table 1 nhdplus flow direction grids were used to summarize each predictor variable upstream of every channel grid cell on the river network we refer to these predictor variable grids e g monthly precipitation percent forest cover as continuous parameter grids cpgs sando et al 2018 the inter annual variability in streamflow permanence conditions is important in studying annual patterns for a variety of ecological phenomena datry et al 2017 thus values for many of the climatic variables represented monthly or annual conditions rather than 30 year normal conditions climatic predictor variables included in the prosper model represented annual or monthly values for each year from 2004 through 2016 this time period represents the longest continuous period of existing data for all of the climatic variables physiographic characteristics considered as potential predictor variables in prosper were selected to capture mechanisms that directly affect streamflow permanence while limiting redundancy in particular geologic characteristics that are presumed to influence flow permanence are captured in predictor variables of permeability topography and soil characteristics surface geology was not explicitly included as a predictor variable permeability was derived based on the surficial geology presented as percent contributing area permeable versus non permeable surficial geology while basin elevation and drainage area are highly correlated with streamflow permanence sun et al 2011 gonzález ferreras and barquín 2017 they were excluded from the model to avoid reducing the statistical influence of temporally variable predictor variables e g precipitation and temperature which may better describe year to year changes in streamflow permanence the topographic wetness index incorporates local slope and drainage area and was included as a predictor variable to capture the topographic control on hydrologic condition beven and kirkby 1979 sörensen et al 2006 williamson et al 2015 2 3 analysis a series of steps were employed to provide annual predictions of streamflow permanence probabilities fig 2 the prosper model was developed using random forest classification to produce annual streamflow permanence probabilities for every stream channel pixel within the study area a localized threshold analysis was then conducted to identify threshold values that classify the streamflow permanence probabilities as wet or dry at each stream channel pixel confidence intervals were constructed for the threshold values and their associated mean standard errors of predictions finally the confidence intervals were used to categorize the streamflow permanence probabilities at each pixel into a streamflow permanence class which consisted of a wet or dry classification with an associated confidence e g dry with 95 confidence additional validation steps were included to evaluate the reliability of streamflow permanence probabilities and classes methods to develop the random forest classification model are detailed below methods to translate streamflow permanence probabilities to classes and post hoc validation analyses are detailed in appendices 2 3 1 prosper model development and validation random forest classification breiman 2001 was used as the statistical modeling framework random forest classification constructs several decision trees e g a forest on a training dataset and outputs the class in this case wet or dry that is the mode of the individual trees as well as the proportion of total trees represented by each class the randomforest package liaw and wiener 2002 was used in r r core team 2015 the number of trees built was set to 500 and the number of predictor variables randomly selected to split the data at each node was set to five for this study bootstrapped methods breiman 2001 that included a random subsample of about two thirds of the data were employed each individual classification tree in the random forest model was developed using one of the subsamples obtained from the bootstrapping process the submodel was then applied to each observation that was not included in the subsample and a class wet or dry was predicted for each individual classification tree the number of misclassified observations was then divided by the total number of observations to obtain an out of bag error estimate which is the standard metric to evaluate the strength of the rf model as a classifier breiman 2001 to obtain a final classification for each observation first a probability was produced by running the predictor values through each classification tree and dividing the frequency of predicted wet classes by the total number of trees 500 we call this probability for each observation the streamflow permanence probability while we use the term probability to describe the outcome the prediction can be considered a relative degree to which a particular observation or pixel is more statistically similar in terms of predictor variables to either the population of wet or dry observations higher streamflow permanence probabilities represent statistical similarities to the hydrologic and physiographic conditions where wet observations occurred lower streamflow permanence probabilities represent statistical similarities to the hydrologic and physiographic conditions where dry observations occurred in that given year the streamflow permanence probability for each observation was then converted to a final predicted class based on the default approach of the predicted class with the highest proportion of total predictions specifically a final prediction of wet was assigned if the probability for an observation was greater than 0 5 conversely a final prediction of dry was assigned for probability values less than 0 5 the default out of bag error rate was determined by averaging the out of bag error rates from all the random forest classification trees the importance of each explanatory variable was quantified by calculating the percent decrease of default classification error associated with the inclusion of each predictor variable liaw and wiener 2002 an additional analysis was conducted to determine if classification accuracy could be improved in some or all of the study area by empirically adjusting the threshold from a default of 0 5 to a value that more accurately reflects local conditions this analysis termed the localized threshold analysis is described in appendix a the local threshold error rate was determined by analyzing the models ability to correctly classify both true positives sensitivity and negatives specificity performance of the local threshold was evaluated by analyzing the resulting changes in probability of misclassification of wet and dry observations for each huc 8 region in the study area a global random forest prosper model was developed for the entire study area with subsequent analysis of the spatial characteristics of the residuals at a subregional scale a global model was chosen because the density of streamflow observations was highly variable across the study area and the influence of statistical and spatial distributions of the predictor variable data on streamflow permanence was not well known three subregional models were also developed which included subregion 17a 17b and a combined subregion of 17c and 17d to assess in a post hoc analysis how predictor variable importance varies among these different regions fig 1 subregion 17d was combined with 17c because it contained only 28 streamflow observations which was insufficient for a stand alone submodel the final global random forest model developed and calibrated using the available observation data was used to provide streamflow permanence probabilities for each year 2004 2016 at each 30 m grid cell in the study area 570 400 479 total predictions representing a total of approximately 1 84 million km in stream channel length this was done by calculating predictor variable values for each pixel location in the study area and running those data through the rf classification model the streamflow permanence probabilities were then converted into streamflow permanence classes of either wet or dry binary classification with an associated confidence appendix a a total of 10 streamflow permanence classes range from 5 dry classification with 95 confidence or greater to 5 wet classification with 95 confidence or greater three post hoc supplemental validation exercises were conducted in addition to validation internal to the random forest modeling approach first streamflow permanence probability values were compared to streamflow statistics at usgs gages stratified by six subregional climate classes within the study area appendix b the six climate classes ranged from arid to very wet as defined by leibowitz et al 2016 and based on the feddema 2005 moisture index which is a ratio between precipitation and evapotranspiration second a predictor variable suitability grid appendix c was created to evaluate how well the study area is represented by the streamflow observation dataset third streamflow permanence classes were compared to nhdplus classifications to evaluate the reliability of streamflow permanence classifications appendix d 2 3 2 prosper derived descriptors of streamflow permanence streamflow permanence classes were extracted for each year 2004 2016 for the methow river willow and whitehorse creeks and boise river focal basins fig 1 for further evaluation of spatiotemporal variability in streamflow permanence we used standardized total annual precipitation as an initial approach to investigate potential relationships between streamflow permanence and basin scale drought conditions specifically we assessed 1 the year to year change in the statistical distribution of contiguous wet and dry stream segments 2 how continuity of wet or dry stream segments as a proxy for streamflow fragmentation varies with differences in total annual precipitation and 3 how the position of wet and dry segments in a stream network varies with differences in total annual precipitation this demonstrates one of the potential ways to analyze model output a comprehensive analysis of each predictor variable in relation to streamflow permanence predictions was beyond the scope of this project but it is important to note that an analysis is only meaningful for those predictor variables that were most influential in the global random forest model e g total annual precipitation we assessed the relation between basin dryness and streamflow fragmentation to evaluate how the two vary in relation to inter annual precipitation variability we use the proportion of the channel network that is predicted to be dry as a descriptor of overall basin dryness streamflow fragmentation is represented by the ratio of contiguously wet stream segments to contiguously dry stream segments low ratios correspond to higher streamflow fragmentation as a result of higher frequencies of dry channel segments an increase in the proportion of the network with dry stream segments and potentially increased frequency of dry stream segments would be expected in years of lower precipitation consequently basin dryness and streamflow fragmentation would be expected to increase changes in the position of wet and dry channel segments within the river network were evaluated in terms of the elevation and drainage area of wet and dry stream segments when considering the topology of a river network stream segments with smaller cumulative drainage areas represent headwater streams which can occur at either high or low elevations moving in the downstream direction stream segments of increasing cumulative drainage area correspond to decreasing elevations for example in a catchment that contains dry headwater channels and progressive downstream wetting of channels dry headwater channels occur at higher elevations and small drainage areas wet channels occur downstream at lower elevations and progressively larger drainage areas because the wet stream segments occur at low elevations the ratio of elevations of wet stream segments to dry stream segments would also be low conversely the ratio of cumulative drainage area of wet stream segments to dry stream segments would be high in climatically drier years an increase in the elevation ratio could reflect lower elevation wet segments that remain stable while dry channel segments expand downstream a decrease in the drainage area ratio could reflect a downstream expansion of dry channel segments 3 results 3 1 model performance and prosper streamflow permanence probabilities streamflow permanence probabilities were calculated for the 3878 observations that met the data filtering criteria the mean out of bag oob error rate for the global model was approximately 20 and ranged from 17 to 22 for the subregional models table 2 the error rate was lowest for the 17a subregional model located in the southeastern portion of the study area which is largely located within the semiarid climate class leibowitz et al 2016 the highest error rate was for the 17b subregional model which corresponds to the northern third of the study area and includes a strong climatic gradient of arid to very wet a total of 29 predictor variables were included in the global model and the three subregional models used for post hoc analysis total annual precipitation and percent forest cover were two of the top three most important predictor variables for the global model and two of the three submodels 17a and 17cd fig 3 table 2 if precipitation or forest cover was not included in the models standardized mean accuracy decreased by 30 50 and 25 40 respectively fig 3 annual mean monthly minimum temperature and evapotranspiration et in may and august were also included as important predictor variables for these three models standardized mean accuracy decreased by 22 40 if these predictor variables were not included in the model fig 3 a decrease in accuracy for individual predictor variables does not directly correspond to the overall oob error rate strobl et al 2008 snow water equivalent swe on april 1 and may 1 and annual mean monthly minimum temperature were the most important predictor variables for submodel 17b table 2 higher values of total annual precipitation percent forest cover et and swe corresponded to more wet classifications streamflow permanence probabilities had high variability among subregional climate classes within the study area in addition to inter annual variability within each climate class fig 4 notably lower streamflow permanence probabilities corresponded to the climatically drier regions of the study area which also generally had lower standard deviations in annual predictions fig 4b higher streamflow permanence probabilities were concentrated in coastal and higher elevation mountain regions which had moderate inter annual standard deviations relatively high standard deviations e g 17 to 18 were limited to a few isolated areas in the interior regions of the study area associated with transitional climatic zones i e wet to dry or dry to wet transitions fig 4b the hydroclimatic conditions of the modeling period represent the wide range of variability that characterizes the study area si 1 hydroclimatic conditions were broadly evaluated using the self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi wells et al 2004 a common index of meteorological drought used in the u s the scpdsi serves as a convenient metric to evaluate hydroclimatic conditions because it integrates a suite of hydrologic conditions that presumably influence streamflow permanence including precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration the scpdsi values are calculated using data over the entire period of record in this case 1895 2016 values range from about 10 to 10 where negative values reflect drought conditions values of 2 indicate moderate drought values less than 4 indicate extreme drought the scpdsi was used to identify the hydroclimatically driest and wettest years during the modeling period for further analysis of streamflow permanence in the three focal basins additional analysis beyond the scope of this project is needed to evaluate potential patterns in streamflow permanence probabilities and year to year climate conditions the reliability of threshold values was assessed through evaluation of the predictions maximum standard error of prediction appendix a and comparison of streamflow permanence classifications with nhdplus classifications appendix d this resulted in 29 out of a total of 220 huc8 basins being flagged as potentially unreliable 22 basins flagged with high maximum standard error of prediction values seven basins flagged because of disagreement between nhdplus classifications 3 2 using prosper to quantify flow permanence in focal basins distinct differences in predicted wet and dry conditions were evident between climatically drier 2004 and wetter 2011 years highlighting the sensitivity of flow permanence to hydroclimatic conditions fig 5 inter annual variability in flow permanence had subsequent implications on the character and basin scale configuration of wet and dry stream segments that varied across the three focal basins fig 6 during years with less precipitation the frequency and length of dry channel segments generally increased across the three focal basins resulting in an overall increase in basin dryness and increased streamflow fragmentation fig 6a and b however the inter annual change in the position of dry channel segments within the river network was inconsistent across basins and years of different precipitation fig 6c annual tallies of the contiguous wet and dry stream segments for each of the three focal basins over the 13 year model period indicated that on average dry stream segments accounted for 55 92 of the stream network length within each basin fig 6a the willow and whitehorse creeks were exceptionally dry predicted dry stream segments accounted for more than 82 of the stream network in any year while in the methow and boise rivers basins dry stream segments were at least 50 and 42 of the stream network in any year respectively predicted length of contiguous wet and dry stream segments ranged from 30 m individual pixel to 7230 km fig 6a the statistical distribution of the contiguous wet and dry stream segments is a reflection that the methow and boise rivers are composed of long wet stream segments that correspond to the mainstem that extend into the lower reaches of tributaries and short wet streams segments that are interspersed with longer dry stream segments in the upper reaches of tributaries willow and whitehorse creeks are drier versions of the methow and boise rivers in which the longest contiguous wet stream segments also corresponded to the mainstems but the majority of the river network was dominated by longer maximum of more than 500 km contiguous dry stream segments relative to the methow and boise rivers fig 6a the inter annual variability in the statistical distribution of wet and dry stream segments was greatest for the boise river basin the range in annual proportion of predicted dry segments was 27 in the boise river basin compared to 19 in the methow basin and 16 for the willow and whitehorse basins for the methow and boise river basins the predicted lengths of dry stream segments appeared more variable relative to wet stream segments however wet stream segments are orders of magnitudes longer in these two rivers with the mainstem and connected tributaries comprising a large and relatively consistent portion of the wetted networks years with less precipitation generally resulted in greater overall basin dryness and generally followed the expected trend of decreased wet to dry segment ratio and consequently increased streamflow fragmentation in the methow river and willow and whitehorse creek basins fig 6b this result is attributed to increased frequency of dry stream segments in tributaries in drier years the boise river basin exhibited a greater range in overall dryness of the basin relative to the other two focal basins that only moderately aligned with precipitation of individual years however year to year changes in streamflow fragmentation were limited in the boise river basin which is attributed to consistent contiguous wet segments that extend into the tributaries finally climatically drier years resulted in lower elevations having more dry segments and consequently the remaining wet segments being higher elevation as reflected in the increased ratio of mean elevation of wet and dry segments in the methow river and willow and whitehorse creek basins with little change in the boise river basin fig 6c the willow and whitehorse creek basins showed an increase in drainage area of dry segments relative to wet segments in years with less precipitation however the methow river basin exhibited virtually no change in the drainage area ratio along with the boise river basin although the boise river basin exhibited minimal inter annual variability in both ratio descriptors the slight increase of the elevation ratio in years of low precipitation adheres to expected patterns fig 6c 4 discussion the prosper model was built to provide predictions of annual streamflow permanence for 2004 2016 for all minimally impaired and unregulated streams and rivers in the pacific northwest concurrent with nhdplus grids we also used a localized threshold analysis to translate streamflow permanence probabilities produced with the prosper model back into discrete classes of wet or dry conditions with an associated confidence we use these interpreted wet dry conditions to derive additional descriptors of annual streamflow permanence conditions in three focal basins to demonstrate model utility for applied and basic science questions 4 1 model characteristics streamflow generation is the result of interactions between precipitation and the physiographic conditions of geology topography soil type and land cover winter 2007 buttle et al 2012 sayama et al 2011 these interactions exhibit high spatial heterogeneity and vary considerably across the spatial extent of the study area tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 however the inclusion of total annual precipitation as the most important predictor variable in the global model and two of the three subregional models underscores how precipitation exerts primary control on surface flow conditions at a regional scale buttle et al 2012 wenger et al 2010 and can be an important determinant on baseflow conditions at smaller catchment scales belmar et al 2016 the importance of may 1 swe for submodel 17b is more consistent with sando and blasch 2015 who identified average snow extent in late spring march through july as the most important variable in a rocky mountain watershed this result may be driven by the high density of streamflow observations in the mountainous snow dominated geography of northern idaho which is similar to the catchment conditions of study sites used by sando and blasch 2015 the importance of may 1 swe might also be augmented by the relative sparseness of streamflow observations in the western region of 17b which includes rain dominated and rain snow mix climatic regimes in the cascade mountains and columbia plateau region leibowitz et al 2016 although the other subregions of the study area include some snow dominated areas e g eastern oregon mountains most precipitation falls as rain temperate coast range and more arid low elevation inland areas as a result annual precipitation which includes snow more accurately describes the study area as a whole and the subregions 17a c and d percent forest cover was a consistently important predictor variable included in the global and two of the three subregional models although percent forest cover is correlated with precipitation these results are consistent with findings from gonzález ferreras and barquín 2017 who employed random forest classification to map streamflow permanence probabilities in a mediterranean catchment in spain similar to the prosper model increase in broadleaf forest cover increased classification of stream reaches as perennial gonzález ferreras and barquín 2017 the study area of sando and blasch 2015 was located on heavily forested u s forest service lands and may have lacked the spatial heterogeneity in land cover for percent forest cover to be included as a distinguishing factor of flow permanence alternatively differences in important variables on flow permanence may also be attributed to the differences in spatial scale between the two studies nonetheless inclusion of percent forest cover as one of the most important predictor variables may reflect the ability of forest soils to regulate hydrologic conditions including sustaining baseflows belmar et al 2016 in particular characteristically high infiltration rates of forest soils can facilitate both high soil water that contributes to baseflows along shallower pathways sayama et al 2011 and deeper percolation to groundwater that also contributes to baseflow hewlett 1961 winter 2007 the absence of topographic wetness index as an important predictor variable was unexpected table 3 however this variable was a basin average and it is likely to have greater influence on local conditions therefore a basin average or local topographic wetness index may be more important for streamflow permanence predictions for basin model domains smaller than a regional or sub regional scale 4 2 variability and uncertainty in model predictions comparison of streamflow permanence probabilities at identified flowing and no flow classified usgs gage locations across the range of climate classes of the study area provided a convenient method to validate prosper output in parts of the study area that lacked streamflow observations fig b 1 and b 2 we recognize that the density and spatial extent of usgs gage locations imposes limitations on this analysis as a comprehensive model validation tool nonetheless consistent statistically significant differences in streamflow permanence probabilities between flowing and no flow classified usgs stream gages across five of the six climate classes provided support for the validity of the relative streamflow permanence probabilities within a given climate class the lack of statistically significant differences in streamflow permanence probabilities between flowing and no flow classified usgs stream gage locations for the wettest climate class is attributed to a limited number of dry observations relative to wet observations 27 vs 277 in this climate class and thus an inability to discern potential differences in streamflow permanence probabilities the variability of streamflow permanence probabilities for usgs gages across climate classes however illuminated the challenge of a global model to represent the geographic heterogeneity of the study area in particular because precipitation forest cover and temperature were the most important variables in the global model stream channel pixels in arid climate classes including pixels with consistent year round flow will have lower streamflow permanence probabilities compared to wetter climate classes this is a function of the inherent arid region characteristics of lower annual precipitation lower forest coverage and higher minimum temperatures smaller subregional or local watershed models may result in a consistent range of streamflow permanence probabilities that correspond to wet or dry streamflow conditions sando and blasch 2015 gonzález ferreras and barquín 2017 but are likely constrained to a homogeneous climate the geographic variability that occurs in the threshold values the reliability of threshold values at a location and the resulting streamflow permanence classification of wet or dry with associated confidence are a result of two factors first the geographic variability reflects subregional or local scale processes not captured in the global prosper model but which influence streamflow permanence second adequate representation of both wet and dry conditions in the streamflow observation data result at least in part in threshold values that are considered reliable local scale controls can often be the dominating factor on flow permanence whiting and godsey 2016 processes that include local surficial or hydrogeologic controls that can either contribute to sustained year round flow in arid climates winter 2007 or result in streams going dry in wetter climates jaeger et al 2007 are not represented in the global prosper model at this time as a result it is likely that locations with stronger hydrogeologic controls on flow permanence may require smaller scale models that are specific to those locations for more accurate prediction of flow permanence in particular the flagged huc8 basins with high maximum standard error of prediction in the southwestern region of 17b fig 5b are candidate areas for smaller scale models that may better capture local controls on flow permanence sparsity of field observations particularly contributes to the variability in the uncertainty of threshold values and the consequent streamflow permanence classes that have lower confidence levels for example the huc8 basins flagged with high maximum standard error of prediction that are concentrated along the oregon coast range region 17d and western portion of region 17c fig 5b lacked dry streamflow observations although this area is located in a very wet climate class dry streamflow conditions occur but in limited frequency relative to year round flowing conditions may and gresswell 2004 therefore concerted efforts to identify river networks in these huc8 basins in which dry streamflow conditions occur have the potential to improve prosper s predictive ability in these basins in the absence of local scale flow permanence prediction models prosper streamflow permanence classifications in flagged huc8 basins with high maximum standard error of prediction should be considered with caution by the end user wet and dry classification that have lower associated confidence within the study area are useful predictions depending on the objective of the end user however reliance on these predictions would benefit from ground truthing field efforts in these areas of less reliable threshold values relative comparison of streamflow permanence probabilities between streams of interest and known perennial systems in the area may be a useful approach to evaluate streamflow permanence 4 3 variability in flow permanence characteristics in three focal basins results from comprehensive mapping of the three focal basins highlight the predominance of dry stream segments in these basins but also yield information on how streamflow permanence expands and contracts under different hydroclimatic conditions initial descriptors of basin dryness streamflow fragmentation and position in the river network employed here serve as potential examples of how prosper output can be used to generate a myriad of metrics that quantitatively describe the temporal changes and spatial organization of wet and dry stream segments at local e g 30 m2 to basin 101 km2 to regional landscape 102 3 km2 scales and which are germane to a wide range of applications in addition to prosper derived descriptors the total variance in predictions and degree in fluctuation in annual streamflow permanence probabilities can be used to develop and test hypotheses regarding flow permanence in particular prosper output can be used to identify sections of the river network that may be resilient or sensitive to drought conditions allowing for management efforts that target protection of critical reaches sando and blasch 2015 isaak et al 2016 4 4 limitations of prosper it is important to recognize the known limitations of the prosper model to help users avoid misinterpreting streamflow permanence conditions in some areas across the pacific northwest a main limitation is that prosper does not account for the effects of streamflow regulation dams or diversions thus for stream segments downstream of reservoirs it is likely that streamflow permanence conditions are more stable and potentially more likely to flow year round than what is predicted by prosper conversely diversions and withdrawals from a stream network are likely to reduce the probability of streamflow permanence for downstream locations and should be considered in addition to the probability of streamflow permanence predicted by prosper additionally preliminary analysis of prosper results shows that spring fed streams in arid climate regions tended to be biased toward low streamflow permanence probabilities resulting in erroneous dry classifications future work for improving the prosper model includes adding a springs dataset obtained from the high resolution nhd as a predictor variable in the model other predictor variables may also be included in future iterations of prosper that better capture local processes and conditions that influence streamflow permanence updated prosper models and associated predictions is publicly available through the usgs streamstats platform https water usgs gov osw streamstats and in updated usgs sciencebase data releases sando et al 2018 sando and hockman wert 2018 all data and processing scripts necessary for reproducing the results presented in this manuscript are permanently archived by the usgs and are available upon request to the wyoming montana water science center finally prosper model output does not provide information on the hydroperiod of flowing conditions in terms of the timing and duration of flowing or no flow conditions for a given pixel while it is assumed that dry classifications correspond to the late summer baseflow period that is typical of the pacific northwest region further work is necessary to characterize the flow permanence hydroperiod arismendi et al 2017 which has been shown to vary both regionally and through time eng et al 2016 while prosper is an unprecedented and valuable effort to model annual streamflow permanence we recognize that it is not a substitute for on the ground local knowledge of hydrologic systems in the pacific northwest rather our intent is for the model to serve as a supplemental dataset to help understand the dynamic nature of regional hydrology particularly as it is affected by changing climatic conditions 5 conclusions the prosper model is a moderate resolution temporally resolved predictive model of streamflow permanence for the pacific northwest region u s the model provides annual predictions of streamflow permanence probabilities and wet or dry classifications at a 30 m spatial resolution for streams that correspond to the nhdplus stream grid data in this form are publicly available appendix e and have potential use in a wide array of applications across a range of spatial scales that can provide a better understanding of controls on streamflow permanence and also allow for quantitative characterization of the spatiotemporal dynamism of streamflow permanence and its sensitivity or resilience to physiographic and hydroclimatic conditions total annual precipitation was identified as one of the most important predictor variables in the global model and two of the three subregional models which underscores the importance of precipitation as a primary control on surface flow conditions at a regional scale and baseflow conditions at smaller catchment scales however local scale controls on flow permanence including local surficial or hydrogeologic controls are not yet adequately represented in the prosper model despite this the prosper model delivered approximately 80 accuracy in correct classification of wet or dry streamflow observations for the pacific northwest study area some huc8 basins with local controls on flow permanence may be candidate areas for smaller scale models however increased observation data of no flow conditions that occur but may be infrequent in very wet climates such as the oregon coast range could improve prosper prediction accuracy in basins an initial analysis of prosper predictions for three focal basins in the study area illustrate the ubiquity of dry stream segments but also the year to year changes in the spatial composition and configuration of surface flow in these networks under drier climatic conditions the proportion of wet segments decreased substantially in all three focal basins especially in the most arid basin the average elevation of both wet and dry segments in all three basins increased in years with less precipitation but more so for wet segments particularly in the wettest focal basin also in years with low precipitation only in the driest focal basin did the average drainage area of wet segments increase considerably the mainstems and lower extremities of larger tributaries in wetter river basins may be able to persistently flow through still considerable portions of the river network during drought conditions but in more arid river basins only stream segments with increasingly larger catchments may be able to sustain year round streamflow if drought conditions were to worsen and even then for a relatively minor portion of the river network conflict of interest none acknowledgments support for this project was provided by the department of the

trees 500 all streamflow observation locations used to build prosper therefore have a streamflow permanence probability between 0 and 1 theoretically dry state observations have corresponding lower streamflow permanence probabilities while wet state observations have higher streamflow permanence probabilities however in some applications random forest has been shown to produce bias in the predictions this bias which can be generally described as over predicting extreme low values and under predicting extreme high values has been demonstrated and described extensively in applications of random forest regression analysis xu 2013 zhang and lu 2012 this bias can result in over predicting streamflow permanence probabilities at dry locations in generally wet environments and under predicting streamflow permanence probabilities at wet locations in generally dry environments while this issue has received much attention in the context of random forest regression analysis e g xu 2013 zhang and lu 2012 there has been little documentation of similar bias in random forest classification to provide an alternative method for assigning a final class to predicted probabilities a locally optimized singh et al 2012 kang et al 2014 but regionally consistent probability threshold analysis was developed rather than assume the probabilities are equally distributed around 0 5 everywhere in the study area this analysis identifies threshold streamflow permanence probability values that effectively determine if the streamflow permanence probability for any given pixel is either statistically more similar to a wet site above the threshold or a dry site below the threshold in that local area the resulting wet or dry classification is distinct from perennial and non perennial classifications used by nhdplus in that it is variable not just in space but also in time capturing the annual conditions as a consequence of inclusion of climatic predictor variables this analysis allows us to statistically categorize annual streamflow permanence probabilities into wet or dry classes for each year that are representative for different hydroclimatic regions which can then be used to compare predictions across the study area translating probabilities to a meaningful descriptor of streamflow permanence condition e g a wet or dry classification facilitates quantitative description of the year to year variability of streamflow presence or absence at a variety of spatial scales that extend from the local 30 m grid cell to catchment or regional scale the localized threshold analysis represents a novel approach to provide a spatially adaptive classification threshold in the random forest method the probabilistic threshold analysis hereafter referred to as the threshold analysis was conducted using the following steps the predicted mean 2004 2016 streamflow permanence probabilities for separate populations of wet observations and dry observations were spatially interpolated across the study area using empirical bayesian kriging pilz and spöck 2008 resulting in a mean wet and mean dry probability grid respectively the parameters of the semivariogram eq 1 used to interpolate the data were estimated for this study empirically by taking 100 bootstrap samples consisting of 30 observations and calculating semivariograms for each sample for each prediction location the prediction is calculated using a semivariogram distribution generated by a likelihood based sampling of semivariograms in the neighborhood 345 km of the location krivoruchko and gribov 2014 the semivariogram model used in the empirical bayesian kriging is shown as 1 γ h n u g g e t b h α where γ is the variance measured as a function of h h is a given distance maximum of 345 km for this analysis nugget is the error associated with the modeled data b is the slope and α is a value ranging between 0 25 and 1 75 a threshold grid was created by averaging the mean wet probability grid and the mean dry probability grid which represents the threshold value that will classify the streamflow permanence probability as wet or dry for that location to evaluate the uncertainty around the threshold values standard error of prediction grids for both the mean wet probability grid and the mean dry probability grid were created using the square root of the mean variance calculated from subsets used in the streamflow permanence probability grid generated by empirical bayesian kriging a mean standard error of prediction grid was then created by averaging the standard error of prediction grids for the mean wet and the mean dry probability grids because the threshold and associated mean standard error of prediction grids are expected to represent catchment scale rather than site scale conditions the grids were smoothed to avoid introducing abrupt localized fluctuations in the data at observations that might not be representative of the catchment scale conditions to smooth the grids the average values for individual huc8 watersheds within the study area were calculated the huc8 polygons were then converted to points at their centroids the threshold and associated mean standard error of prediction values were then re interpolated with a spatial resolution of 4 km a series of confidence intervals 70 80 90 and 95 were constructed using the equation 2 ci i t i z sep i n where ci i is the confidence interval value at pixel i ti is the threshold grid value at pixel i z is the critical value for a 1 tailed student s t test sepi is the mean standard error of prediction value at pixel i and n is the sample size the confidence intervals were used to categorize the streamflow permanence probability at each pixel into a streamflow permanence class which consisted of a wet or dry classification with an associated confidence represented as one of the 5 intervals a total of 10 streamflow permanence classes ranged from 5 dry classification with 95 confidence or greater to 5 wet classification with 95 confidence or greater the streamflow permanence classes represent spatially explicit binary categorical values high mean standard error of prediction values could indicate areas with potentially unreliable threshold values that are used to translate probabilities into classifications to provide some qualifying measure of threshold value reliability huc8 regions with relatively high mean standard error of prediction values were identified and flagged to assess threshold value reliability specifically standard error of prediction grids for the mean dry and the mean wet probability grids were calculated for each huc8 region and the maximum of the two means was retained to generate a grid of maximum mean standard error of prediction any huc8 region with a maximum mean standard error of prediction value in the 90th percentile 0 19 or higher was flagged as having a potentially unreliable threshold value as a consequence of relatively large uncertainty around the threshold values in that huc8 region the default method of using the majority class for assigning a final prediction class in random forest typically results in the best overall model performance however gaining accuracy in overall model performance can also mean sacrificing accuracy for subsets of data if the response variable being predicted is not randomly distributed to determine the effect on model performance of using the local threshold compared to the default 0 5 threshold the out of bag classification accuracy associated with each threshold method was compared for the overall model as well as for each huc8 the differences in classification accuracy for the two classes wet and dry were visualized as a function of the proportion of streamflow observations in each huc8 basin represented by that class and fit with a linear function using a generalized additive model gam technique hastie 2017 as part of the gam package developed for r both gam models were statistically significant p values less than 0 01 the relationship between the standard error of prediction local threshold value and associated confidence intervals for a given stream grid pixel a predicted streamflow permanence probability that is much greater or less than the threshold value at that location will tend to be assigned a streamflow permanence classification with a high associated confidence e g 5 for dry with 95 confidence 5 for wet with 95 confidence however the mean standard error of prediction directly affects the width of confidence intervals around threshold values lower mean standard error of prediction results in a narrower confidence interval higher mean standard error of prediction results in a wider confidence interval consequently for a given location with a low mean standard error of prediction associated with the threshold value a predicted streamflow permanence probability for a stream pixel that is not necessarily far from the threshold value in that location can be assigned a streamflow permanence classification with high confidence in contrast threshold values with high mean standard error of prediction require streamflow permanence probability values to be farther from the threshold value in order to be assigned a streamflow permanence classification with high confidence therefore locations in the study area with low mean standard error of prediction consequently have a higher frequency of a streamflow permanence classification at 95 confidence locations in the study area with high mean standard error of prediction have a higher frequency of lower confidence streamflow permanence classification e g 3 to 3 results the threshold analysis was conducted for the entire study area at a 4 km resolution which classified streamflow permanence probabilities into either a wet or dry streamflow permanence class with associated confidence fig a1 localized threshold values that determined wet or dry classes ranged from 0 32 to 0 77 with a mean of 0 53 variability in threshold values appeared to be regionally coherent lower threshold values occurred in the arid lower elevation regions of the study area including the columbia plateau and snake river plain the highest threshold values occurred in the interior high elevation mountain region that is generally associated with the three wetter climate classes uncertainty in the threshold values as represented by the standard error of prediction was a function of streamflow observation density the lowest mean standard error of prediction occurred in the eastern half of the study area where observational data density was the highest correspondingly the highest standard error of prediction values occurred in the western third of the study area where data density was lower and which includes subregion 17d and the western portion of subregions 17b and 17c figs 1 and a1 on average 82 of the pixels classified as dry were predicted with 95 confidence over the study period with little year to year variability 16 table a1 the percentage of wet pixels predicted with 95 confidence accounted for 46 of all predicted wet pixels with substantially more 37 year to year variability the out of bag classification accuracy was essentially the same using the two threshold methods with slightly better performance using the default threshold 0 5 when the default threshold was used to assign a class the accuracy was 81 for wet observations and 79 for dry observations when the locally optimized threshold was used the accuracy was 80 for wet observations and 78 for dry observations however when the classification accuracy for each method was first stratified by huc8 regions results indicate that the mean probability of accurately classifying dry observations increased by 7 while the mean probability of accurately classifying wet observations decreased by 6 furthermore when the change in classification accuracy caused by using the local threshold is modeled as a function of normal 1981 2010 annual precipitation prism climate group averaged for each huc8 basin results show a marked increase in classification accuracy of dry observations in huc8 regions that typically receive more than about 500 mm year of precipitation wet basins fig a2 there is also a slight increase in classification accuracy of wet observations in huc8 regions that typically receive less than 500 mm year of precipitation dry basins conversely there is a slight decrease in classification accuracy of dry observations in dry basins and a larger decrease in classification accuracy of wet observations in wet basins twenty two huc8 regions were flagged because of 90th percentile or higher maximum standard error of prediction and were located mostly along the oregon coast range as well as the southern puget sound region that corresponds to mt rainier fig a1 appendix b comparison of prosper streamflow permanence probabilities to usgs gages across the pacific northwest methods prosper model predictions were compared to streamflow statistics at usgs gages for years prior to the prosper period of record as an additional validation measure of correspondence between streamflow permanence probabilities and observed values streamflow data at these usgs gages that correspond to the 2004 2016 modeling period were part of the observation data used to build the random forest model daily streamflow statistics at usgs gages for streamflow measurements recorded through november 2001 and computed by wolock 2003c were evaluated for 1072 usgs gages within the study area these data were snapped to their corresponding location on the stream grid gages included in the analysis had more than five years of continuous streamflow records were located within 100 m of a stream grid cell and were neither located on cells with missing predictor variable data nor located on a canal or diversion the gages were subdivided into two groups that either represented a no flow condition or a flowing condition gages where the first percentile of the daily streamflow was less than 0 0283 m3s 1 1 ft3s 1 were classified as no flow gages where the first percentile of the daily streamflow was greater than or equal to 0 0283 m3s 1 1 ft3s 1 were classified as flow this value was chosen because it was not clear if zero values at some of the gages represented true minimum daily values or reflected missing data therefore in all cases the first percentile threshold value of 0 0283 m3s 1 1 ft3s 1 was applied as a more robust approach over the minimum daily value that is determined by a single value and thus more prone to being influenced by a non representative value additionally the selection of 0 0283 m3s 1 was based on the finding that there was no change in the statistical significance of the results described in the following paragraph when the threshold value was varied within the range of 0 to 0 113 m3s 1 0 4 ft3s 1 because of the broad range of climates that occur within the study area the gages were further partitioned into one of six climate classes as defined by leibowitz et al 2016 to determine if differences existed in streamflow permanence probabilities among different climates fig b1 climate classes ranged from very wet to arid based on the feddema 2005 moisture index that incorporates precipitation and evapotranspiration climate classes are assigned for washington oregon and idaho and do not extend to adjacent states that are still included in the study area about 15 of study area welch s unequal variances t tests were used to detect differences between mean prosper streamflow permanence probabilities for flow and no flow gages in each climate class welch 1947 while acknowledging that the data from usgs gages are for different time periods and thus potentially different climatic conditions than prosper data the comparison nevertheless can serve as a proxy for the accuracy of mean prosper predictions results streamflow permanence probabilities were significantly lower for no flow classified usgs gages across the climate classes fig b2 the very wet climate class was the only exception in which statistical differences were not detected between streamflow permanence probabilities of flow and no flow classified gages differences in the range of streamflow permanence probabilities across climate classes highlighted the variability in how streamflow permanence probabilities represent streamflow permanence for example streamflow permanence probabilities that correspond to flow classified usgs gages in the arid climate class were low enough to be well within the range of streamflow permanence probabilities that correspond to no flow classified usgs gages in other climate classes thus presenting a challenge for a global interpretation of streamflow permanence probabilities recognition of this variability consequently necessitated the subsequent threshold analysis that allows translation of streamflow permanence probabilities back into wet or dry conditions appendix a appendix c a predictor variable suitability grid to evaluate prosper streamflow permanence predictions a predictor variable suitability grid was created to identify pixels for which predictor variable values extend beyond those associated with streamflow observation point locations that were used in the model development the number of predictor variables with values that fell outside of the range of values used for model development was compiled for each pixel to create the predictor variable suitability grid larger numbers reflect more predictor variables at that 30 m location that were outside the range of predictor variable values used in model development and thus might indicate potentially less reliable predictions a complementary attribute includes the proportion of predictor variables with values within the range of predictor variable values that were used in model development larger proportions reflect more predictor variables at that 30 m location that were within the range of predictor variable values used in model development and thus can indicate more reliable predictions while portions of the study area might have a lower density of streamflow observations for example central and eastern washington these areas are potentially still well represented if they are statistically similar defined in predictor variable space to other locations that are represented in the streamflow observation dataset used to calibrate the random forest model approximately 38 of pixels within the study area have at least one predictor variable that was outside the range of values used in model development however more than 80 of those pixels have less than 5 variables outside of the model range the maximum number of predictor variables for an individual grid cell pixel at which values extended beyond the range of model development is 101 currently the predictor variable suitability grid does not identify the specific predictor variables whose values are beyond those used in the model future work should identify specific predictor variables in the grid and their spatial distribution in the study area however in the absence of this analysis a reasonable approach for end users may be to simply consider these areas that have a relatively high number value in the grid e g more than 5 as potentially not well represented by the model high number values in the grid results in higher uncertainty in streamflow permanence probabilities at those locations and may account for streamflow permanence probabilities and classifications that are not aligned with on the ground conditions appendix d comparison of prosper streamflow permanence classifications with nhdplus streamflow classifications streamflow permanence classifications were compared to nhdplus streamflow classifications perennial or intermittent for huc8 watersheds in the study area as another method to quantify the reliability of identified threshold values appendix a seven huc8 watersheds mostly clustered in the north cascades mountain region along the northern border of the study area fig a1 were flagged because of disagreement with nhdplus classifications although there is recognition that nhdplus classifications are an imperfect baseline for comparison based on the known errors in the nhdplus classification system fritz et al 2013 it is nevertheless the most spatially comprehensive streamflow permanence dataset for the study area particularly for data sparse regions there was an approximately 80 agreement between streamflow field observations used in the model development and the nhd classifications using both the medium and high resolution nhd the streamflow permanence classifications were extracted from the prosper stream grid cells using a 15 meter buffer around the nhdplus flowlines for each huc8 region the proportion of 30 m grid cells classified as wet based on the streamflow permanence classifications averaged over the years 2004 2016 was compared to the proportion of stream length classified as perennial in the nhdplus dataset the huc8 regions were ranked and sorted according to both the proportion of pixels classified as wet by the streamflow permanence classification and the proportion of streams classified as perennial by nhdplus the huc8 streamflow permanence classification ranks were plotted against nhdplus ranks and a 90 confidence interval ellipse was constructed the huc8 regions outside the 90 confidence interval with nhdplus were flagged as having potentially unreliable threshold values appendix e obtaining prosper predictions in streamstats streamstats is a web based gis

8617,the u s geological survey usgs has developed the probability of streamflow permanence prosper model a gis raster based empirical model that provides streamflow permanence probabilities probabilistic predictions of a stream channel having year round flow for any unregulated and minimally impaired stream channel in the pacific northwest region u s the model provides annual predictions for 2004 2016 at a 30 m spatial resolution based on monthly or annually updated values of climatic conditions and static physiographic variables associated with the upstream basin predictions correspond to any pixel on the channel network consistent with the medium resolution national hydrography dataset channel network stream grid total annual precipitation and percent forest cover were consistently the most important predictor variables among global and most subregional models which had error rates between 17 and 22 probabilities were converted to wet and dry streamflow permanence classes with an associated confidence wet and dry classifications were used to derive descriptors that characterize the statistical and spatial distribution of streamflow permanence in three focal basins predicted dry channel segments account for 52 92 of the stream network across the three focal basins streamflow permanence decreased during climatically drier years predictions are publicly available through the usgs streamstats platform results demonstrate the utility of the prosper model as a tool for identifying areas that may be resilient or sensitive to drought conditions allowing for management efforts that target protecting critical reaches importantly prosper s successful predictive performance can be improved with new datasets of streamflow permanence underscoring the importance of field observations keywords flow permanence intermittent ephemeral perennial non perennial streams 1 introduction streamflow permanence defined as the degree to which rivers and streams

of water resources despite the importance of accurate streamflow permanence classifications our understanding and available observations of streamflow permanence at a regional extent is surprisingly incomplete currently 2018 the most comprehensive dataset containing nationally consistent streamflow permanence classifications is the national hydrography dataset plus nhdplus https www epa gov waterdata nhdplus national hydrography dataset plus streamflow permanence classifications contained in the nhdplus are based on one time field surveys typically conducted in the mid to late 1900s although contemporary stewardship efforts update nhdplus classifications mckay et al 2012 using various methods in areas where the accuracy of the nhdplus streamflow classifications has been analyzed results showed that misclassifications can be as high as 50 fritz et al 2013 ebersole et al 2014 and that flow permanence may change through time eng et al 2016 additionally there is increasing recognition of the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of streamflow permanence streamflow permanence patterns may be conceptualized as a spatial and temporal gradient boulton et al 2017 costigan et al 2017 that includes substantial inter annual variability of stream drying patterns jaeger and olden 2012 godsey and kirchner 2014 jensen et al 2017 as the need for accurate and up to date streamflow permanence classifications has been recognized locally scoped efforts have gained popularity these efforts include conducting field mapping of streamflow presence through direct observation turner and richter 2011 jensen et al 2017 using temperature or other sensors as proxies for streamflow or surface water presence blasch et al 2002 chapin et al 2014 gungle 2006 bhamjee et al 2015 arismendi et al 2017 and identifying indirect physical or biological indicators of streamflow permanence fritz et al 2006 2008 nadeau et al 2015 streamflow presence has also been interpreted from the intensity of ground returns of topographic airborne light detection and ranging lidar systems hooshyar et al 2015 and unmanned aerial vehicles may provide a cost effective method to field mapping although this method remains experimental spence and mengistu 2016 whereas these approaches can provide valuable insight for specific locations or basins it is also important to develop approaches for analyzing streamflow permanence at a regional extent in the current 2018 absence of exhaustive streamflow permanence observations at regional scales pairing streamflow permanence observations where they do exist with statistical or physical modeling approaches can yield streamflow permanence classifications for areas that lack field observations sando and blasch 2015 gonzález ferreras and barquín 2017 with the widespread availability of moderate resolution remotely sensed and geographic information system gis derived datasets at national scales coupled with assemblages of streamflow observation datasets opportunities have emerged to develop relatively high resolution spatially explicit classifications of streamflow permanence at regional extents that also account for prevailing hydrologic conditions the prospect of temporally dynamic streamflow permanence classifications at a regional scale consequently not only allows for improved understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of streamflow permanence and the physiographic and hydroclimatic variables that control streamflow permanence costigan et al 2016 datry et al 2018 eng et al 2016 but also serves as an immediate tool to water resource managers who are increasingly challenged by limited knowledge of where and when streams and rivers maintain streamflow sando and blasch 2015 1 1 the prosper model the u s geological survey usgs created a 30 m resolution temporally resolved model of streamflow permanence for the pacific northwest region u s the probability of streamflow permanence prosper model incorporates empirical data static physiographic variables and monthly to annual climatic data to predict the annual probability of year round streamflow for any unregulated and minimally impaired stream channel predictions extend to channels draining 0 09 km2 or greater and are concurrent with medium resolution nhdplus version 2 grids predictions are made for greater stream length than is represented by the nhdplus stream channel network but it is widely acknowledged that small headwater streams are underrepresented by nhd fritz et al 2013 benstead and leigh 2012 predicted annual probabilities of streamflow permanence for 2004 2016 are publicly available through the interactive usgs streamstats platform https water usgs gov osw streamstats and as a usgs sciencebase data release sando and hockman wert 2018 the objectives of this paper are to 1 introduce the prosper model and describe model output of streamflow permanence probabilities and streamflow permanence classes and 2 demonstrate applications of the prosper model to quantitatively describe streamflow permanence using three focal basins this work provides end users with streamflow permanence conditions for the pacific northwest region at unprecedented spatial extent and temporal resolution representing the largest dynamic stream mapping effort the authors are aware of and which is readily available for applications in water resources management or species conservation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area a global prosper model was developed for 2 digit hydrologic unit code huc2 17 pacific northwest region u s which encompassed all of washington most of oregon and idaho western montana and smaller portions of wyoming utah and nevada along state boundaries fig 1 post hoc analysis of the variability in the prosper model output was evaluated by partitioning the study area into four subbasin regions 17a b c and d based on approximate partitioning between huc4 basins fig 1 increases in digit numbers associated with the huc correspond to smaller basin size the huc4 watershed boundaries presumably reflect similarity in climate and physiography and therefore are a reasonable approach to evaluate subregional variability as well as a convenient straightforward approach to break up the relatively large study area for a post hoc subregional analysis topographically the study area includes mountain chains of varying spatial extent broad valley and lowland areas and extensive plateau regions fig 1 the study area occurs in four geologic provinces that include the cascade volcanoes the columbia plateau the north cascades and the coast mountains the region is mostly underlain by volcanic rock but also includes areas of granite metamorphic and mixed sedimentary and volcanic rock schruben et al 1994 portions of the study area are strongly influenced by volcanism and the last glacial maximum the study area represents a broad range of climates from inland arid and semi arid to coastal humid regions that support temperate rainforests wolock 2003a leibowitz et al 2016 normal mean annual precipitation totals range from approximately 310 mm in inland low elevation areas to 2400 mm along the coast prism climate group 2004 normal mean annual temperatures 1981 2010 range from approximately 4 c in inland areas to 11 c in coastal areas prism climate group 2004 summers are dry and warm winters range from mild temperatures and rain dominated precipitation along the coast and at low elevations to cold temperatures and snow dominated precipitation at higher elevations griffith 2010 the methow river basin in washington the adjacent basins of willow and whitehorse creeks in oregon and the boise river basin in idaho were selected to serve as examples for a more detailed evaluation of the spatiotemporal variability of streamflow permanence predictions within the context of basin scale hydroclimatic conditions fig 1 table si 1 these focal basins represent the broad range of hydroclimatic and physical conditions in the study area and illustrate the range in predictive ability of prosper by including a gradient of streamflow permanence conditions konrad et al 2003 wood et al 2009 schultz et al 2017 in particular the methow river basin is known to have strong surface groundwater interactions konrad et al 2003 which are processes not directly captured by prosper the boise river and willow and whitehorse creek basins have similar geologic and climatic conditions but willow and whitehorse creeks tend towards reduced streamflow permanence compared to the boise river 2 2 data to build the prosper model we used streamflow permanence observations aggregated from various datasets that were part of previous or ongoing field data collection efforts mcshane et al 2017 a broad suite of gis derived climate and physiographic characteristics were used as predictor variables for streamflow permanence probabilities 2 2 1 streamflow observations a total of 3878 observations 1941 wet 1937 dry were used in the prosper model fig 1 final observations used in the prosper model were filtered methods detailed in sando and hockman wert 2018 from a larger dataset of 24 316 streamflow observations that occurred from 1977 to 2016 the larger observation dataset was compiled or derived from 11 datasets that were part of independent projects that included aquatic species habitat surveys wet dry stream channel mapping and beneficial use reconnaissance surveys or were collected specifically for the prosper project mcshane et al 2017 observations were distributed across a range of drainage areas 0 092 24 300 km2 with a focus on small streams more than one third of the observations occurred in streams with a drainage area less than 10 km2 streamflow observations included one time surveys and repeat surveys extending over several years as well as discrete locations or continuous sections of a stream channel reach the streamflow observations were processed into a single consistent binary dataset with classifications of wet or dry a site classified as wet required the presence of surface water that could either be flowing or standing water in pools a site classified as dry had no surface water present wet classifications required that the observation occurred after july 1 to coincide with the hydroclimatically driest time of the year dry classifications could occur any time within the year repeat streamflow observations within a single year at the same location were considered dry if any of the observations were dry or wet if all observations were wet and an observation occurred after july 1 2 2 2 climatic and physiographic variables to capture the mechanisms that influence streamflow permanence in the study area a total of 257 climatic and 35 physical predictor variables 292 total were considered for inclusion in the statistical model development table 1 nhdplus flow direction grids were used to summarize each predictor variable upstream of every channel grid cell on the river network we refer to these predictor variable grids e g monthly precipitation percent forest cover as continuous parameter grids cpgs sando et al 2018 the inter annual variability in streamflow permanence conditions is important in studying annual patterns for a variety of ecological phenomena datry et al 2017 thus values for many of the climatic variables represented monthly or annual conditions rather than 30 year normal conditions climatic predictor variables included in the prosper model represented annual or monthly values for each year from 2004 through 2016 this time period represents the longest continuous period of existing data for all of the climatic variables physiographic characteristics considered as potential predictor variables in prosper were selected to capture mechanisms that directly affect streamflow permanence while limiting redundancy in particular geologic characteristics that are presumed to influence flow permanence are captured in predictor variables of permeability topography and soil characteristics surface geology was not explicitly included as a predictor variable permeability was derived based on the surficial geology presented as percent contributing area permeable versus non permeable surficial geology while basin elevation and drainage area are highly correlated with streamflow permanence sun et al 2011 gonzález ferreras and barquín 2017 they were excluded from the model to avoid reducing the statistical influence of temporally variable predictor variables e g precipitation and temperature which may better describe year to year changes in streamflow permanence the topographic wetness index incorporates local slope and drainage area and was included as a predictor variable to capture the topographic control on hydrologic condition beven and kirkby 1979 sörensen et al 2006 williamson et al 2015 2 3 analysis a series of steps were employed to provide annual predictions of streamflow permanence probabilities fig 2 the prosper model was developed using random forest classification to produce annual streamflow permanence probabilities for every stream channel pixel within the study area a localized threshold analysis was then conducted to identify threshold values that classify the streamflow permanence probabilities as wet or dry at each stream channel pixel confidence intervals were constructed for the threshold values and their associated mean standard errors of predictions finally the confidence intervals were used to categorize the streamflow permanence probabilities at each pixel into a streamflow permanence class which consisted of a wet or dry classification with an associated confidence e g dry with 95 confidence additional validation steps were included to evaluate the reliability of streamflow permanence probabilities and classes methods to develop the random forest classification model are detailed below methods to translate streamflow permanence probabilities to classes and post hoc validation analyses are detailed in appendices 2 3 1 prosper model development and validation random forest classification breiman 2001 was used as the statistical modeling framework random forest classification constructs several decision trees e g a forest on a training dataset and outputs the class in this case wet or dry that is the mode of the individual trees as well as the proportion of total trees represented by each class the randomforest package liaw and wiener 2002 was used in r r core team 2015 the number of trees built was set to 500 and the number of predictor variables randomly selected to split the data at each node was set to five for this study bootstrapped methods breiman 2001 that included a random subsample of about two thirds of the data were employed each individual classification tree in the random forest model was developed using one of the subsamples obtained from the bootstrapping process the submodel was then applied to each observation that was not included in the subsample and a class wet or dry was predicted for each individual classification tree the number of misclassified observations was then divided by the total number of observations to obtain an out of bag error estimate which is the standard metric to evaluate the strength of the rf model as a classifier breiman 2001 to obtain a final classification for each observation first a probability was produced by running the predictor values through each classification tree and dividing the frequency of predicted wet classes by the total number of trees 500 we call this probability for each observation the streamflow permanence probability while we use the term probability to describe the outcome the prediction can be considered a relative degree to which a particular observation or pixel is more statistically similar in terms of predictor variables to either the population of wet or dry observations higher streamflow permanence probabilities represent statistical similarities to the hydrologic and physiographic conditions where wet observations occurred lower streamflow permanence probabilities represent statistical similarities to the hydrologic and physiographic conditions where dry observations occurred in that given year the streamflow permanence probability for each observation was then converted to a final predicted class based on the default approach of the predicted class with the highest proportion of total predictions specifically a final prediction of wet was assigned if the probability for an observation was greater than 0 5 conversely a final prediction of dry was assigned for probability values less than 0 5 the default out of bag error rate was determined by averaging the out of bag error rates from all the random forest classification trees the importance of each explanatory variable was quantified by calculating the percent decrease of default classification error associated with the inclusion of each predictor variable liaw and wiener 2002 an additional analysis was conducted to determine if classification accuracy could be improved in some or all of the study area by empirically adjusting the threshold from a default of 0 5 to a value that more accurately reflects local conditions this analysis termed the localized threshold analysis is described in appendix a the local threshold error rate was determined by analyzing the models ability to correctly classify both true positives sensitivity and negatives specificity performance of the local threshold was evaluated by analyzing the resulting changes in probability of misclassification of wet and dry observations for each huc 8 region in the study area a global random forest prosper model was developed for the entire study area with subsequent analysis of the spatial characteristics of the residuals at a subregional scale a global model was chosen because the density of streamflow observations was highly variable across the study area and the influence of statistical and spatial distributions of the predictor variable data on streamflow permanence was not well known three subregional models were also developed which included subregion 17a 17b and a combined subregion of 17c and 17d to assess in a post hoc analysis how predictor variable importance varies among these different regions fig 1 subregion 17d was combined with 17c because it contained only 28 streamflow observations which was insufficient for a stand alone submodel the final global random forest model developed and calibrated using the available observation data was used to provide streamflow permanence probabilities for each year 2004 2016 at each 30 m grid cell in the study area 570 400 479 total predictions representing a total of approximately 1 84 million km in stream channel length this was done by calculating predictor variable values for each pixel location in the study area and running those data through the rf classification model the streamflow permanence probabilities were then converted into streamflow permanence classes of either wet or dry binary classification with an associated confidence appendix a a total of 10 streamflow permanence classes range from 5 dry classification with 95 confidence or greater to 5 wet classification with 95 confidence or greater three post hoc supplemental validation exercises were conducted in addition to validation internal to the random forest modeling approach first streamflow permanence probability values were compared to streamflow statistics at usgs gages stratified by six subregional climate classes within the study area appendix b the six climate classes ranged from arid to very wet as defined by leibowitz et al 2016 and based on the feddema 2005 moisture index which is a ratio between precipitation and evapotranspiration second a predictor variable suitability grid appendix c was created to evaluate how well the study area is represented by the streamflow observation dataset third streamflow permanence classes were compared to nhdplus classifications to evaluate the reliability of streamflow permanence classifications appendix d 2 3 2 prosper derived descriptors of streamflow permanence streamflow permanence classes were extracted for each year 2004 2016 for the methow river willow and whitehorse creeks and boise river focal basins fig 1 for further evaluation of spatiotemporal variability in streamflow permanence we used standardized total annual precipitation as an initial approach to investigate potential relationships between streamflow permanence and basin scale drought conditions specifically we assessed 1 the year to year change in the statistical distribution of contiguous wet and dry stream segments 2 how continuity of wet or dry stream segments as a proxy for streamflow fragmentation varies with differences in total annual precipitation and 3 how the position of wet and dry segments in a stream network varies with differences in total annual precipitation this demonstrates one of the potential ways to analyze model output a comprehensive analysis of each predictor variable in relation to streamflow permanence predictions was beyond the scope of this project but it is important to note that an analysis is only meaningful for those predictor variables that were most influential in the global random forest model e g total annual precipitation we assessed the relation between basin dryness and streamflow fragmentation to evaluate how the two vary in relation to inter annual precipitation variability we use the proportion of the channel network that is predicted to be dry as a descriptor of overall basin dryness streamflow fragmentation is represented by the ratio of contiguously wet stream segments to contiguously dry stream segments low ratios correspond to higher streamflow fragmentation as a result of higher frequencies of dry channel segments an increase in the proportion of the network with dry stream segments and potentially increased frequency of dry stream segments would be expected in years of lower precipitation consequently basin dryness and streamflow fragmentation would be expected to increase changes in the position of wet and dry channel segments within the river network were evaluated in terms of the elevation and drainage area of wet and dry stream segments when considering the topology of a river network stream segments with smaller cumulative drainage areas represent headwater streams which can occur at either high or low elevations moving in the downstream direction stream segments of increasing cumulative drainage area correspond to decreasing elevations for example in a catchment that contains dry headwater channels and progressive downstream wetting of channels dry headwater channels occur at higher elevations and small drainage areas wet channels occur downstream at lower elevations and progressively larger drainage areas because the wet stream segments occur at low elevations the ratio of elevations of wet stream segments to dry stream segments would also be low conversely the ratio of cumulative drainage area of wet stream segments to dry stream segments would be high in climatically drier years an increase in the elevation ratio could reflect lower elevation wet segments that remain stable while dry channel segments expand downstream a decrease in the drainage area ratio could reflect a downstream expansion of dry channel segments 3 results 3 1 model performance and prosper streamflow permanence probabilities streamflow permanence probabilities were calculated for the 3878 observations that met the data filtering criteria the mean out of bag oob error rate for the global model was approximately 20 and ranged from 17 to 22 for the subregional models table 2 the error rate was lowest for the 17a subregional model located in the southeastern portion of the study area which is largely located within the semiarid climate class leibowitz et al 2016 the highest error rate was for the 17b subregional model which corresponds to the northern third of the study area and includes a strong climatic gradient of arid to very wet a total of 29 predictor variables were included in the global model and the three subregional models used for post hoc analysis total annual precipitation and percent forest cover were two of the top three most important predictor variables for the global model and two of the three submodels 17a and 17cd fig 3 table 2 if precipitation or forest cover was not included in the models standardized mean accuracy decreased by 30 50 and 25 40 respectively fig 3 annual mean monthly minimum temperature and evapotranspiration et in may and august were also included as important predictor variables for these three models standardized mean accuracy decreased by 22 40 if these predictor variables were not included in the model fig 3 a decrease in accuracy for individual predictor variables does not directly correspond to the overall oob error rate strobl et al 2008 snow water equivalent swe on april 1 and may 1 and annual mean monthly minimum temperature were the most important predictor variables for submodel 17b table 2 higher values of total annual precipitation percent forest cover et and swe corresponded to more wet classifications streamflow permanence probabilities had high variability among subregional climate classes within the study area in addition to inter annual variability within each climate class fig 4 notably lower streamflow permanence probabilities corresponded to the climatically drier regions of the study area which also generally had lower standard deviations in annual predictions fig 4b higher streamflow permanence probabilities were concentrated in coastal and higher elevation mountain regions which had moderate inter annual standard deviations relatively high standard deviations e g 17 to 18 were limited to a few isolated areas in the interior regions of the study area associated with transitional climatic zones i e wet to dry or dry to wet transitions fig 4b the hydroclimatic conditions of the modeling period represent the wide range of variability that characterizes the study area si 1 hydroclimatic conditions were broadly evaluated using the self calibrating palmer drought severity index scpdsi wells et al 2004 a common index of meteorological drought used in the u s the scpdsi serves as a convenient metric to evaluate hydroclimatic conditions because it integrates a suite of hydrologic conditions that presumably influence streamflow permanence including precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration the scpdsi values are calculated using data over the entire period of record in this case 1895 2016 values range from about 10 to 10 where negative values reflect drought conditions values of 2 indicate moderate drought values less than 4 indicate extreme drought the scpdsi was used to identify the hydroclimatically driest and wettest years during the modeling period for further analysis of streamflow permanence in the three focal basins additional analysis beyond the scope of this project is needed to evaluate potential patterns in streamflow permanence probabilities and year to year climate conditions the reliability of threshold values was assessed through evaluation of the predictions maximum standard error of prediction appendix a and comparison of streamflow permanence classifications with nhdplus classifications appendix d this resulted in 29 out of a total of 220 huc8 basins being flagged as potentially unreliable 22 basins flagged with high maximum standard error of prediction values seven basins flagged because of disagreement between nhdplus classifications 3 2 using prosper to quantify flow permanence in focal basins distinct differences in predicted wet and dry conditions were evident between climatically drier 2004 and wetter 2011 years highlighting the sensitivity of flow permanence to hydroclimatic conditions fig 5 inter annual variability in flow permanence had subsequent implications on the character and basin scale configuration of wet and dry stream segments that varied across the three focal basins fig 6 during years with less precipitation the frequency and length of dry channel segments generally increased across the three focal basins resulting in an overall increase in basin dryness and increased streamflow fragmentation fig 6a and b however the inter annual change in the position of dry channel segments within the river network was inconsistent across basins and years of different precipitation fig 6c annual tallies of the contiguous wet and dry stream segments for each of the three focal basins over the 13 year model period indicated that on average dry stream segments accounted for 55 92 of the stream network length within each basin fig 6a the willow and whitehorse creeks were exceptionally dry predicted dry stream segments accounted for more than 82 of the stream network in any year while in the methow and boise rivers basins dry stream segments were at least 50 and 42 of the stream network in any year respectively predicted length of contiguous wet and dry stream segments ranged from 30 m individual pixel to 7230 km fig 6a the statistical distribution of the contiguous wet and dry stream segments is a reflection that the methow and boise rivers are composed of long wet stream segments that correspond to the mainstem that extend into the lower reaches of tributaries and short wet streams segments that are interspersed with longer dry stream segments in the upper reaches of tributaries willow and whitehorse creeks are drier versions of the methow and boise rivers in which the longest contiguous wet stream segments also corresponded to the mainstems but the majority of the river network was dominated by longer maximum of more than 500 km contiguous dry stream segments relative to the methow and boise rivers fig 6a the inter annual variability in the statistical distribution of wet and dry stream segments was greatest for the boise river basin the range in annual proportion of predicted dry segments was 27 in the boise river basin compared to 19 in the methow basin and 16 for the willow and whitehorse basins for the methow and boise river basins the predicted lengths of dry stream segments appeared more variable relative to wet stream segments however wet stream segments are orders of magnitudes longer in these two rivers with the mainstem and connected tributaries comprising a large and relatively consistent portion of the wetted networks years with less precipitation generally resulted in greater overall basin dryness and generally followed the expected trend of decreased wet to dry segment ratio and consequently increased streamflow fragmentation in the methow river and willow and whitehorse creek basins fig 6b this result is attributed to increased frequency of dry stream segments in tributaries in drier years the boise river basin exhibited a greater range in overall dryness of the basin relative to the other two focal basins that only moderately aligned with precipitation of individual years however year to year changes in streamflow fragmentation were limited in the boise river basin which is attributed to consistent contiguous wet segments that extend into the tributaries finally climatically drier years resulted in lower elevations having more dry segments and consequently the remaining wet segments being higher elevation as reflected in the increased ratio of mean elevation of wet and dry segments in the methow river and willow and whitehorse creek basins with little change in the boise river basin fig 6c the willow and whitehorse creek basins showed an increase in drainage area of dry segments relative to wet segments in years with less precipitation however the methow river basin exhibited virtually no change in the drainage area ratio along with the boise river basin although the boise river basin exhibited minimal inter annual variability in both ratio descriptors the slight increase of the elevation ratio in years of low precipitation adheres to expected patterns fig 6c 4 discussion the prosper model was built to provide predictions of annual streamflow permanence for 2004 2016 for all minimally impaired and unregulated streams and rivers in the pacific northwest concurrent with nhdplus grids we also used a localized threshold analysis to translate streamflow permanence probabilities produced with the prosper model back into discrete classes of wet or dry conditions with an associated confidence we use these interpreted wet dry conditions to derive additional descriptors of annual streamflow permanence conditions in three focal basins to demonstrate model utility for applied and basic science questions 4 1 model characteristics streamflow generation is the result of interactions between precipitation and the physiographic conditions of geology topography soil type and land cover winter 2007 buttle et al 2012 sayama et al 2011 these interactions exhibit high spatial heterogeneity and vary considerably across the spatial extent of the study area tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 however the inclusion of total annual precipitation as the most important predictor variable in the global model and two of the three subregional models underscores how precipitation exerts primary control on surface flow conditions at a regional scale buttle et al 2012 wenger et al 2010 and can be an important determinant on baseflow conditions at smaller catchment scales belmar et al 2016 the importance of may 1 swe for submodel 17b is more consistent with sando and blasch 2015 who identified average snow extent in late spring march through july as the most important variable in a rocky mountain watershed this result may be driven by the high density of streamflow observations in the mountainous snow dominated geography of northern idaho which is similar to the catchment conditions of study sites used by sando and blasch 2015 the importance of may 1 swe might also be augmented by the relative sparseness of streamflow observations in the western region of 17b which includes rain dominated and rain snow mix climatic regimes in the cascade mountains and columbia plateau region leibowitz et al 2016 although the other subregions of the study area include some snow dominated areas e g eastern oregon mountains most precipitation falls as rain temperate coast range and more arid low elevation inland areas as a result annual precipitation which includes snow more accurately describes the study area as a whole and the subregions 17a c and d percent forest cover was a consistently important predictor variable included in the global and two of the three subregional models although percent forest cover is correlated with precipitation these results are consistent with findings from gonzález ferreras and barquín 2017 who employed random forest classification to map streamflow permanence probabilities in a mediterranean catchment in spain similar to the prosper model increase in broadleaf forest cover increased classification of stream reaches as perennial gonzález ferreras and barquín 2017 the study area of sando and blasch 2015 was located on heavily forested u s forest service lands and may have lacked the spatial heterogeneity in land cover for percent forest cover to be included as a distinguishing factor of flow permanence alternatively differences in important variables on flow permanence may also be attributed to the differences in spatial scale between the two studies nonetheless inclusion of percent forest cover as one of the most important predictor variables may reflect the ability of forest soils to regulate hydrologic conditions including sustaining baseflows belmar et al 2016 in particular characteristically high infiltration rates of forest soils can facilitate both high soil water that contributes to baseflows along shallower pathways sayama et al 2011 and deeper percolation to groundwater that also contributes to baseflow hewlett 1961 winter 2007 the absence of topographic wetness index as an important predictor variable was unexpected table 3 however this variable was a basin average and it is likely to have greater influence on local conditions therefore a basin average or local topographic wetness index may be more important for streamflow permanence predictions for basin model domains smaller than a regional or sub regional scale 4 2 variability and uncertainty in model predictions comparison of streamflow permanence probabilities at identified flowing and no flow classified usgs gage locations across the range of climate classes of the study area provided a convenient method to validate prosper output in parts of the study area that lacked streamflow observations fig b 1 and b 2 we recognize that the density and spatial extent of usgs gage locations imposes limitations on this analysis as a comprehensive model validation tool nonetheless consistent statistically significant differences in streamflow permanence probabilities between flowing and no flow classified usgs stream gages across five of the six climate classes provided support for the validity of the relative streamflow permanence probabilities within a given climate class the lack of statistically significant differences in streamflow permanence probabilities between flowing and no flow classified usgs stream gage locations for the wettest climate class is attributed to a limited number of dry observations relative to wet observations 27 vs 277 in this climate class and thus an inability to discern potential differences in streamflow permanence probabilities the variability of streamflow permanence probabilities for usgs gages across climate classes however illuminated the challenge of a global model to represent the geographic heterogeneity of the study area in particular because precipitation forest cover and temperature were the most important variables in the global model stream channel pixels in arid climate classes including pixels with consistent year round flow will have lower streamflow permanence probabilities compared to wetter climate classes this is a function of the inherent arid region characteristics of lower annual precipitation lower forest coverage and higher minimum temperatures smaller subregional or local watershed models may result in a consistent range of streamflow permanence probabilities that correspond to wet or dry streamflow conditions sando and blasch 2015 gonzález ferreras and barquín 2017 but are likely constrained to a homogeneous climate the geographic variability that occurs in the threshold values the reliability of threshold values at a location and the resulting streamflow permanence classification of wet or dry with associated confidence are a result of two factors first the geographic variability reflects subregional or local scale processes not captured in the global prosper model but which influence streamflow permanence second adequate representation of both wet and dry conditions in the streamflow observation data result at least in part in threshold values that are considered reliable local scale controls can often be the dominating factor on flow permanence whiting and godsey 2016 processes that include local surficial or hydrogeologic controls that can either contribute to sustained year round flow in arid climates winter 2007 or result in streams going dry in wetter climates jaeger et al 2007 are not represented in the global prosper model at this time as a result it is likely that locations with stronger hydrogeologic controls on flow permanence may require smaller scale models that are specific to those locations for more accurate prediction of flow permanence in particular the flagged huc8 basins with high maximum standard error of prediction in the southwestern region of 17b fig 5b are candidate areas for smaller scale models that may better capture local controls on flow permanence sparsity of field observations particularly contributes to the variability in the uncertainty of threshold values and the consequent streamflow permanence classes that have lower confidence levels for example the huc8 basins flagged with high maximum standard error of prediction that are concentrated along the oregon coast range region 17d and western portion of region 17c fig 5b lacked dry streamflow observations although this area is located in a very wet climate class dry streamflow conditions occur but in limited frequency relative to year round flowing conditions may and gresswell 2004 therefore concerted efforts to identify river networks in these huc8 basins in which dry streamflow conditions occur have the potential to improve prosper s predictive ability in these basins in the absence of local scale flow permanence prediction models prosper streamflow permanence classifications in flagged huc8 basins with high maximum standard error of prediction should be considered with caution by the end user wet and dry classification that have lower associated confidence within the study area are useful predictions depending on the objective of the end user however reliance on these predictions would benefit from ground truthing field efforts in these areas of less reliable threshold values relative comparison of streamflow permanence probabilities between streams of interest and known perennial systems in the area may be a useful approach to evaluate streamflow permanence 4 3 variability in flow permanence characteristics in three focal basins results from comprehensive mapping of the three focal basins highlight the predominance of dry stream segments in these basins but also yield information on how streamflow permanence expands and contracts under different hydroclimatic conditions initial descriptors of basin dryness streamflow fragmentation and position in the river network employed here serve as potential examples of how prosper output can be used to generate a myriad of metrics that quantitatively describe the temporal changes and spatial organization of wet and dry stream segments at local e g 30 m2 to basin 101 km2 to regional landscape 102 3 km2 scales and which are germane to a wide range of applications in addition to prosper derived descriptors the total variance in predictions and degree in fluctuation in annual streamflow permanence probabilities can be used to develop and test hypotheses regarding flow permanence in particular prosper output can be used to identify sections of the river network that may be resilient or sensitive to drought conditions allowing for management efforts that target protection of critical reaches sando and blasch 2015 isaak et al 2016 4 4 limitations of prosper it is important to recognize the known limitations of the prosper model to help users avoid misinterpreting streamflow permanence conditions in some areas across the pacific northwest a main limitation is that prosper does not account for the effects of streamflow regulation dams or diversions thus for stream segments downstream of reservoirs it is likely that streamflow permanence conditions are more stable and potentially more likely to flow year round than what is predicted by prosper conversely diversions and withdrawals from a stream network are likely to reduce the probability of streamflow permanence for downstream locations and should be considered in addition to the probability of streamflow permanence predicted by prosper additionally preliminary analysis of prosper results shows that spring fed streams in arid climate regions tended to be biased toward low streamflow permanence probabilities resulting in erroneous dry classifications future work for improving the prosper model includes adding a springs dataset obtained from the high resolution nhd as a predictor variable in the model other predictor variables may also be included in future iterations of prosper that better capture local processes and conditions that influence streamflow permanence updated prosper models and associated predictions is publicly available through the usgs streamstats platform https water usgs gov osw streamstats and in updated usgs sciencebase data releases sando et al 2018 sando and hockman wert 2018 all data and processing scripts necessary for reproducing the results presented in this manuscript are permanently archived by the usgs and are available upon request to the wyoming montana water science center finally prosper model output does not provide information on the hydroperiod of flowing conditions in terms of the timing and duration of flowing or no flow conditions for a given pixel while it is assumed that dry classifications correspond to the late summer baseflow period that is typical of the pacific northwest region further work is necessary to characterize the flow permanence hydroperiod arismendi et al 2017 which has been shown to vary both regionally and through time eng et al 2016 while prosper is an unprecedented and valuable effort to model annual streamflow permanence we recognize that it is not a substitute for on the ground local knowledge of hydrologic systems in the pacific northwest rather our intent is for the model to serve as a supplemental dataset to help understand the dynamic nature of regional hydrology particularly as it is affected by changing climatic conditions 5 conclusions the prosper model is a moderate resolution temporally resolved predictive model of streamflow permanence for the pacific northwest region u s the model provides annual predictions of streamflow permanence probabilities and wet or dry classifications at a 30 m spatial resolution for streams that correspond to the nhdplus stream grid data in this form are publicly available appendix e and have potential use in a wide array of applications across a range of spatial scales that can provide a better understanding of controls on streamflow permanence and also allow for quantitative characterization of the spatiotemporal dynamism of streamflow permanence and its sensitivity or resilience to physiographic and hydroclimatic conditions total annual precipitation was identified as one of the most important predictor variables in the global model and two of the three subregional models which underscores the importance of precipitation as a primary control on surface flow conditions at a regional scale and baseflow conditions at smaller catchment scales however local scale controls on flow permanence including local surficial or hydrogeologic controls are not yet adequately represented in the prosper model despite this the prosper model delivered approximately 80 accuracy in correct classification of wet or dry streamflow observations for the pacific northwest study area some huc8 basins with local controls on flow permanence may be candidate areas for smaller scale models however increased observation data of no flow conditions that occur but may be infrequent in very wet climates such as the oregon coast range could improve prosper prediction accuracy in basins an initial analysis of prosper predictions for three focal basins in the study area illustrate the ubiquity of dry stream segments but also the year to year changes in the spatial composition and configuration of surface flow in these networks under drier climatic conditions the proportion of wet segments decreased substantially in all three focal basins especially in the most arid basin the average elevation of both wet and dry segments in all three basins increased in years with less precipitation but more so for wet segments particularly in the wettest focal basin also in years with low precipitation only in the driest focal basin did the average drainage area of wet segments increase considerably the mainstems and lower extremities of larger tributaries in wetter river basins may be able to persistently flow through still considerable portions of the river network during drought conditions but in more arid river basins only stream segments with increasingly larger catchments may be able to sustain year round streamflow if drought conditions were to worsen and even then for a relatively minor portion of the river network conflict of interest none acknowledgments support for this project was provided by the department of the

the following appendices support the probability of streamflow permanence prosper model specifically the appendices include methods that describe the following analyses and processes a threshold analysis to support conversion of streamflow permanence probabilities into wet and dry streamflow permanence classifications appendix a a comparison between prosper streamflow permanence probabilities and usgs streamgages appendix b a supplementary product to evaluate prosper predictor variables appendix c a comparison of prosper classifications with nhd classifications appendix d and detailed directions on how to obtain prosper output for end users appendix e appendix a a local threshold analysis to translate streamflow permanence probabilities to wet and dry classes methods streamflow permanence probabilities are determined by the relation between predictor variables and the streamflow permanence conditions i e whether a location is in a wet or dry state during assumed annual low flow periods these probabilities are defined in the random forest classification model as the ratio of classification trees that predict a site to be wet divided by the total number of classification trees 500 all streamflow observation locations used to build prosper therefore have a streamflow permanence probability between 0 and 1 theoretically dry state observations have corresponding lower streamflow permanence probabilities while wet state observations have higher streamflow permanence probabilities however in some applications random forest has been shown to produce bias in the predictions this bias which can be generally described as over predicting extreme low values and under predicting extreme high values has been demonstrated and described extensively in applications of random forest regression analysis xu 2013 zhang and lu 2012 this bias can result in over predicting streamflow permanence probabilities at dry locations in generally wet environments and under predicting streamflow permanence probabilities at wet locations in generally dry environments while this issue has received much attention in the context of random forest regression analysis e g xu 2013 zhang and lu 2012 there has been little documentation of similar bias in random forest classification to provide an alternative method for assigning a final class to predicted probabilities a locally optimized singh et al 2012 kang et al 2014 but regionally consistent probability threshold analysis was developed rather than assume the probabilities are equally distributed around 0 5 everywhere in the study area this analysis identifies threshold streamflow permanence probability values that effectively determine if the streamflow permanence probability for any given pixel is either statistically more similar to a wet site above the threshold or a dry site below the threshold in that local area the resulting wet or dry classification is distinct from perennial and non perennial classifications used by nhdplus in that it is variable not just in space but also in time capturing the annual conditions as a consequence of inclusion of climatic predictor variables this analysis allows us to statistically categorize annual streamflow permanence probabilities into wet or dry classes for each year that are representative for different hydroclimatic regions which can then be used to compare predictions across the study area translating probabilities to a meaningful descriptor of streamflow permanence condition e g a wet or dry classification facilitates quantitative description of the year to year variability of streamflow presence or absence at a variety of spatial scales that extend from the local 30 m grid cell to catchment or regional scale the localized threshold analysis represents a novel approach to provide a spatially adaptive classification threshold in the random forest method the probabilistic threshold analysis hereafter referred to as the threshold analysis was conducted using the following steps the predicted mean 2004 2016 streamflow permanence probabilities for separate populations of wet observations and dry observations were spatially interpolated across the study area using empirical bayesian kriging pilz and spöck 2008 resulting in a mean wet and mean dry probability grid respectively the parameters of the semivariogram eq 1 used to interpolate the data were estimated for this study empirically by taking 100 bootstrap samples consisting of 30 observations and calculating semivariograms for each sample for each prediction location the prediction is calculated using a semivariogram distribution generated by a likelihood based sampling of semivariograms in the neighborhood 345 km of the location krivoruchko and gribov 2014 the semivariogram model used in the empirical bayesian kriging is shown as 1 γ h n u g g e t b h α where γ is the variance measured as a function of h h is a given distance maximum of 345 km for this analysis nugget is the error associated with the modeled data b is the slope and α is a value ranging between 0 25 and 1 75 a threshold grid was created by averaging the mean wet probability grid and the mean dry probability grid which represents the threshold value that will classify the streamflow permanence probability as wet or dry for that location to evaluate the uncertainty around the threshold values standard error of prediction grids for both the mean wet probability grid and the mean dry probability grid were created using the square root of the mean variance calculated from subsets used in the streamflow permanence probability grid generated by empirical bayesian kriging a mean standard error of prediction grid was then created by averaging the standard error of prediction grids for the mean wet and the mean dry probability grids because the threshold and associated mean standard error of prediction grids are expected to represent catchment scale rather than site scale conditions the grids were smoothed to avoid introducing abrupt localized fluctuations in the data at observations that might not be representative of the catchment scale conditions to smooth the grids the average values for individual huc8 watersheds within the study area were calculated the huc8 polygons were then converted to points at their centroids the threshold and associated mean standard error of prediction values were then re interpolated with a spatial resolution of 4 km a series of confidence intervals 70 80 90 and 95 were constructed using the equation 2 ci i t i z sep i n where ci i is the confidence interval value at pixel i ti is the threshold grid value at pixel i z is the critical value for a 1 tailed student s t test sepi is the mean standard error of prediction value at pixel i and n is the sample size the confidence intervals were used to categorize the streamflow permanence probability at each pixel into a streamflow permanence class which consisted of a wet or dry classification with an associated confidence represented as one of the 5 intervals a total of 10 streamflow permanence classes ranged from 5 dry classification with 95 confidence or greater to 5 wet classification with 95 confidence or greater the streamflow permanence classes represent spatially explicit binary categorical values high mean standard error of prediction values could indicate areas with potentially unreliable threshold values that are used to translate probabilities into classifications to provide some qualifying measure of threshold value reliability huc8 regions with relatively high mean standard error of prediction values were identified and flagged to assess threshold value reliability specifically standard error of prediction grids for the mean dry and the mean wet probability grids were calculated for each huc8 region and the maximum of the two means was retained to generate a grid of maximum mean standard error of prediction any huc8 region with a maximum mean standard error of prediction value in the 90th percentile 0 19 or higher was flagged as having a potentially unreliable threshold value as a consequence of relatively large uncertainty around the threshold values in that huc8 region the default method of using the majority class for assigning a final prediction class in random forest typically results in the best overall model performance however gaining accuracy in overall model performance can also mean sacrificing accuracy for subsets of data if the response variable being predicted is not randomly distributed to determine the effect on model performance of using the local threshold compared to the default 0 5 threshold the out of bag classification accuracy associated with each threshold method was compared for the overall model as well as for each huc8 the differences in classification accuracy for the two classes wet and dry were visualized as a function of the proportion of streamflow observations in each huc8 basin represented by that class and fit with a linear function using a generalized additive model gam technique hastie 2017 as part of the gam package developed for r both gam models were statistically significant p values less than 0 01 the relationship between the standard error of prediction local threshold value and associated confidence intervals for a given stream grid pixel a predicted streamflow permanence probability that is much greater or less than the threshold value at that location will tend to be assigned a streamflow permanence classification with a high associated confidence e g 5 for dry with 95 confidence 5 for wet with 95 confidence however the mean standard error of prediction directly affects the width of confidence intervals around threshold values lower mean standard error of prediction results in a narrower confidence interval higher mean standard error of prediction results in a wider confidence interval consequently for a given location with a low mean standard error of prediction associated with the threshold value a predicted streamflow permanence probability for a stream pixel that is not necessarily far from the threshold value in that location can be assigned a streamflow permanence classification with high confidence in contrast threshold values with high mean standard error of prediction require streamflow permanence probability values to be farther from the threshold value in order to be assigned a streamflow permanence classification with high confidence therefore locations in the study area with low mean standard error of prediction consequently have a higher frequency of a streamflow permanence classification at 95 confidence locations in the study area with high mean standard error of prediction have a higher frequency of lower confidence streamflow permanence classification e g 3 to 3 results the threshold analysis was conducted for the entire study area at a 4 km resolution which classified streamflow permanence probabilities into either a wet or dry streamflow permanence class with associated confidence fig a1 localized threshold values that determined wet or dry classes ranged from 0 32 to 0 77 with a mean of 0 53 variability in threshold values appeared to be regionally coherent lower threshold values occurred in the arid lower elevation regions of the study area including the columbia plateau and snake river plain the highest threshold values occurred in the interior high elevation mountain region that is generally associated with the three wetter climate classes uncertainty in the threshold values as represented by the standard error of prediction was a function of streamflow observation density the lowest mean standard error of prediction occurred in the eastern half of the study area where observational data density was the highest correspondingly the highest standard error of prediction values occurred in the western third of the study area where data density was lower and which includes subregion 17d and the western portion of subregions 17b and 17c figs 1 and a1 on average 82 of the pixels classified as dry were predicted with 95 confidence over the study period with little year to year variability 16 table a1 the percentage of wet pixels predicted with 95 confidence accounted for 46 of all predicted wet pixels with substantially more 37 year to year variability the out of bag classification accuracy was essentially the same using the two threshold methods with slightly better performance using the default threshold 0 5 when the default threshold was used to assign a class the accuracy was 81 for wet observations and 79 for dry observations when the locally optimized threshold was used the accuracy was 80 for wet observations and 78 for dry observations however when the classification accuracy for each method was first stratified by huc8 regions results indicate that the mean probability of accurately classifying dry observations increased by 7 while the mean probability of accurately classifying wet observations decreased by 6 furthermore when the change in classification accuracy caused by using the local threshold is modeled as a function of normal 1981 2010 annual precipitation prism climate group averaged for each huc8 basin results show a marked increase in classification accuracy of dry observations in huc8 regions that typically receive more than about 500 mm year of precipitation wet basins fig a2 there is also a slight increase in classification accuracy of wet observations in huc8 regions that typically receive less than 500 mm year of precipitation dry basins conversely there is a slight decrease in classification accuracy of dry observations in dry basins and a larger decrease in classification accuracy of wet observations in wet basins twenty two huc8 regions were flagged because of 90th percentile or higher maximum standard error of prediction and were located mostly along the oregon coast range as well as the southern puget sound region that corresponds to mt rainier fig a1 appendix b comparison of prosper streamflow permanence probabilities to usgs gages across the pacific northwest methods prosper model predictions were compared to streamflow statistics at usgs gages for years prior to the prosper period of record as an additional validation measure of correspondence between streamflow permanence probabilities and observed values streamflow data at these usgs gages that correspond to the 2004 2016 modeling period were part of the observation data used to build the random forest model daily streamflow statistics at usgs gages for streamflow measurements recorded through november 2001 and computed by wolock 2003c were evaluated for 1072 usgs gages within the study area these data were snapped to their corresponding location on the stream grid gages included in the analysis had more than five years of continuous streamflow records were located within 100 m of a stream grid cell and were neither located on cells with missing predictor variable data nor located on a canal or diversion the gages were subdivided into two groups that either represented a no flow condition or a flowing condition gages where the first percentile of the daily streamflow was less than 0 0283 m3s 1 1 ft3s 1 were classified as no flow gages where the first percentile of the daily streamflow was greater than or equal to 0 0283 m3s 1 1 ft3s 1 were classified as flow this value was chosen because it was not clear if zero values at some of the gages represented true minimum daily values or reflected missing data therefore in all cases the first percentile threshold value of 0 0283 m3s 1 1 ft3s 1 was applied as a more robust approach over the minimum daily value that is determined by a single value and thus more prone to being influenced by a non representative value additionally the selection of 0 0283 m3s 1 was based on the finding that there was no change in the statistical significance of the results described in the following paragraph when the threshold value was varied within the range of 0 to 0 113 m3s 1 0 4 ft3s 1 because of the broad range of climates that occur within the study area the gages were further partitioned into one of six climate classes as defined by leibowitz et al 2016 to determine if differences existed in streamflow permanence probabilities among different climates fig b1 climate classes ranged from very wet to arid based on the feddema 2005 moisture index that incorporates precipitation and evapotranspiration climate classes are assigned for washington oregon and idaho and do not extend to adjacent states that are still included in the study area about 15 of study area welch s unequal variances t tests were used to detect differences between mean prosper streamflow permanence probabilities for flow and no flow gages in each climate class welch 1947 while acknowledging that the data from usgs gages are for different time periods and thus potentially different climatic conditions than prosper data the comparison nevertheless can serve as a proxy for the accuracy of mean prosper predictions results streamflow permanence probabilities were significantly lower for no flow classified usgs gages across the climate classes fig b2 the very wet climate class was the only exception in which statistical differences were not detected between streamflow permanence probabilities of flow and no flow classified gages differences in the range of streamflow permanence probabilities across climate classes highlighted the variability in how streamflow permanence probabilities represent streamflow permanence for example streamflow permanence probabilities that correspond to flow classified usgs gages in the arid climate class were low enough to be well within the range of streamflow permanence probabilities that correspond to no flow classified usgs gages in other climate classes thus presenting a challenge for a global interpretation of streamflow permanence probabilities recognition of this variability consequently necessitated the subsequent threshold analysis that allows translation of streamflow permanence probabilities back into wet or dry conditions appendix a appendix c a predictor variable suitability grid to evaluate prosper streamflow permanence predictions a predictor variable suitability grid was created to identify pixels for which predictor variable values extend beyond those associated with streamflow observation point locations that were used in the model development the number of predictor variables with values that fell outside of the range of values used for model development was compiled for each pixel to create the predictor variable suitability grid larger numbers reflect more predictor variables at that 30 m location that were outside the range of predictor variable values used in model development and thus might indicate potentially less reliable predictions a complementary attribute includes the proportion of predictor variables with values within the range of predictor variable values that were used in model development larger proportions reflect more predictor variables at that 30 m location that were within the range of predictor variable values used in model development and thus can indicate more reliable predictions while portions of the study area might have a lower density of streamflow observations for example central and eastern washington these areas are potentially still well represented if they are statistically similar defined in predictor variable space to other locations that are represented in the streamflow observation dataset used to calibrate the random forest model approximately 38 of pixels within the study area have at least one predictor variable that was outside the range of values used in model development however more than 80 of those pixels have less than 5 variables outside of the model range the maximum number of predictor variables for an individual grid cell pixel at which values extended beyond the range of model development is 101 currently the predictor variable suitability grid does not identify the specific predictor variables whose values are beyond those used in the model future work should identify specific predictor variables in the grid and their spatial distribution in the study area however in the absence of this analysis a reasonable approach for end users may be to simply consider these areas that have a relatively high number value in the grid e g more than 5 as potentially not well represented by the model high number values in the grid results in higher uncertainty in streamflow permanence probabilities at those locations and may account for streamflow permanence probabilities and classifications that are not aligned with on the ground conditions appendix d comparison of prosper streamflow permanence classifications with nhdplus streamflow classifications streamflow permanence classifications were compared to nhdplus streamflow classifications perennial or intermittent for huc8 watersheds in the study area as another method to quantify the reliability of identified threshold values appendix a seven huc8 watersheds mostly clustered in the north cascades mountain region along the northern border of the study area fig a1 were flagged because of disagreement with nhdplus classifications although there is recognition that nhdplus classifications are an imperfect baseline for comparison based on the known errors in the nhdplus classification system fritz et al 2013 it is nevertheless the most spatially comprehensive streamflow permanence dataset for the study area particularly for data sparse regions there was an approximately 80 agreement between streamflow field observations used in the model development and the nhd classifications using both the medium and high resolution nhd the streamflow permanence classifications were extracted from the prosper stream grid cells using a 15 meter buffer around the nhdplus flowlines for each huc8 region the proportion of 30 m grid cells classified as wet based on the streamflow permanence classifications averaged over the years 2004 2016 was compared to the proportion of stream length classified as perennial in the nhdplus dataset the huc8 regions were ranked and sorted according to both the proportion of pixels classified as wet by the streamflow permanence classification and the proportion of streams classified as perennial by nhdplus the huc8 streamflow permanence classification ranks were plotted against nhdplus ranks and a 90 confidence interval ellipse was constructed the huc8 regions outside the 90 confidence interval with nhdplus were flagged as having potentially unreliable threshold values appendix e obtaining prosper predictions in streamstats streamstats is a web based gis

8618,today it is still common practice to analyse pumping tests assuming theissian conditions resulting in interpretations that are at best grossly approximated if not erroneous with potentially negative impacts on the quality of water resource management over the last several decades numerous technological advances in hydrogeology have been developed that make it possible to perform more realistic analyses of heterogeneous non purely theissian flow systems e g aquifers with non uniform geometry and or hydraulic properties for this study a catalog of available behavioral flow models was compiled from the literature and consolidated into a unique interpretative scheme this is based on two first order flow modelling breakthrough developments derived from research works the derivative analysis bourdet et al 1983 and the flow dimension theory barker 1988 each derivative type curve is segmented and converted into a sequence of stable flow dimensions in order to integrate a large panel of models into a comprehensive conceptual hydrodynamic and interpretative framework this allowed us to conduct a thorough discussion on a range of different hydraulic conditions and their associated most common responses to constant rate pump tests namely the linear bilinear radial and spherical flow regimes and various sequential combinations of these elementary flow regimes the relevance of the catalogued behavioral flow models is examined based on the realism of their postulates and on their frequency of occurrence in the field the proposed diagnostic methodology makes it possible to further refine the interpretation of pumping tests and to routinely detect complex aquifer conditions keywords transient tests flow dimension diagnostic plots numerical modeling non theis aquifers 1 introduction groundwater resources are subjected to growing pressure due to increasing population industrial development and climate changes the decline in water quality and or quantity is becoming an issue of global concern behmel et al 2016 applied hydrogeology must cope with new scientific and environmental issues related to sustainability management of resources stricter water quality legislation and emerging industrial activities such as geothermal energy radionuclide in situ repositioning and carbon sequestration groundwater investigation tools are being called upon to respond to these new concerns they should have the capability of providing more precise routine assessments of the hydraulic properties of real aquifers this challenge in many instances requires an understanding of their complex heterogeneous non uniform or discontinuous nature it appears evident that more hydrogeology research is needed to develop more precise aquifer modeling tools for practitioners the issue is not only to improve the quantitative estimation of the bulk hydraulic properties of aquifers but also to develop realistic qualitative conceptualizations of heterogeneous flow conditions the analytical flow models that are commonly used today are overly simplified with a high degree of idealization which makes it impossible to realistically represent the complexity of aquifers in nature this leads to gross assessments of the hydraulic properties of aquifers although it appears that customary practices in modeling are slowly changing most hydrogeology practitioners are still interpreting most cases of constant rate pumping tests by matching theoretical type curves obtained from theis 1935 and theis derived models cooper and jacob 1946 merely by routinely fitting these type curves practitioners are positing that pumping tests produce a cylindrical radial flow regime in an infinite acting radial flow iarf model thus ignoring in most cases the flow regime that is really occurring within the aquifer indeed numerous studies audouin et al 2008 ferroud et al 2018 kuusela lahtinen et al 2003 leveinen 2000 lods and gouze 2004 maréchal et al 2004 odling et al 2013 verbovšek 2011 2009 have reported from field investigations that the flow regimes occurring in real media are actually much more complex and diversified than what is modeled by the simple theis derived cylindrical radial flow regime ferroud et al 2018 observed that 88 of 69 pumping tests exhibited multi stage derivative signatures and 69 of 121 interpreted flow regimes were non radial the database was composed of constant rate pumping tests performed in various geological settings despite this all of the compiled tests had been interpreted by practitioners using the theis cooper jacob cj models in cases where flow regimes are in actual fact non radial applying an overly idealized interpretation model would lead to serious consequences among which are the following ferroud 2018 ferroud et al 2018 le borgne et al 2004 rafini et al 2017 1 simplifying the behaviour of the system to an extreme degree and disregarding the real geometry of flow 2 ignoring the presence of several 1d 2d or 3d hydraulic objects with non equal properties which may actually be governing the aquifer s global hydrodynamics at various pumping times 3 in low conductivity contexts overestimating the hydraulic properties of the pumped domain and missing the presence of distal and or discrete conductive domains which may be exerting a predominant role in supplying water to the well over some pumping time windows 4 missing the presence of partial or non uniform boundaries or erroneously interpreting hydraulic frontiers that are non existent 5 globally dismissing most of the diagnostic potential of the time drawdown signal 6 poorly assessing the impact of the disruption that is applied to the aquifer leading to erroneous delineation of water productive wellhead protection areas erroneous estimates of sustainable pumping rates etc it should be noted that in this study the term flow regime refers to a specific form of transient drawdown response of the aquifer to pumping it does not relate to the laminar versus turbulent flow conditions as defined by the reynold number as mentioned by ferroud et al 2018 when applying a model which assumes a flow regime outside the bounds of the real flow regime observed during the pumping test this leads to an erroneous estimation of hydraulic properties these authors presented numerical examples where applying the theis model to interpret a derivative signal with a linear flow regime and a spherical flow regime respectively led to overestimating k by 89 and to underestimated k by 100 several pioneering publications bourdet et al 1983 chow 1952 tiab and kumar 1980a have introduced advances in the interpretation of transient tests by analyzing the drawdown log derivative time series ds dlogt more commonly referred to in the petroleum literature as the pressure derivative t dp dt the drawdown log derivative time series analysis was early recognized as a major improvement in pumping test interpretation due to its drastically enhanced sensibility to flow conditions allowing for the detection of various forms of non uniform heterogeneous or bounded reservoirs gringarten 2008 the gain in diagnostic potential is illustrated by the following theoretical examples where the derivative analysis makes it possible to avoid certain misinterpretations of hydraulic boundary which would have resulted from the use of the cooper jacob drawdown semi log plot approach ehlig economides 1988 i a linear flow regime succeeding a prior radial flow regime generates an increase of drawdown rate that may be misinterpreted as a no flow boundary ferroud et al 2018 ii an aquifer with an inclined substratum is or two contiguous aquifers both induce a strong decrease of drawdown rate after various durations of pumping time pseudo stabilisation that may be misinterpreted as a constant head boundary rafini et al 2017 numerous analytically derived predictive behavioral models have been proposed in the literature providing a panel of derivative type curves related to various forms of well and reservoir conditions the diagnostic plots approach renard 2005 calls upon these models to diagnose hydraulic conditions by means of a two step analysis 1 firstly a qualitative diagnosis where the appropriate conceptual model is selected based on the similarity between observed and theoretical signals and 2 secondly a quantitative diagnosis where the aquifer s specific hydraulic parameters are derived from matching the observed response to the selected model s type curves generally using best fitting codes gringarten 1987a kuusela lahtinen et al 2003 leveinen et al 1998 verbovšek 2009 this type curve matching approach as initially introduced by walton 1962 was criticized by mattar 1999 for its lack of precision mattar and tiab alternatively proposed a sequential analysis in which the derivative signal is decomposed into a sequence of straight lines that are interpreted separately from each other as successive flow regimes mattar 1999 tiab 1995 1994 1993a 1993b 1993c 1993d 1989 based on this sequential analysis approach the tiab s direct synthesis tds makes it possible to graphically estimate the hydraulic properties of the aquifer using the slopes intercepts starting and ending times of ds dlogt plot on a bilog graph on this graph a straight derivative response implies from a hydrodynamic standpoint that the flow dimension parameter n is constant since n is defined for drawdown recorded at the pumping well and after very short pumping times by n 2 1 p where p is the slope of ds dlogt on a bilog plot note that the term flow regime has a broader sense than the concept of flow dimension flow dimension does not apply to every type of flow regime for instance it does not apply to wellbore storage flow regimes fundamentally the flow dimension theory strictly applies to any stable flow regime where the barker s basic power law relationship is verified see below eq 2 finally in this paper some flow regimes with constant derivative slopes are transcribed into flow dimension values despite the fact that they do not satisfy this condition for the purpose of methodological consistency e g constant pressure boundary effect applying the flow dimension theory to mattar s straight derivative analysis provides us with a general hydrodynamic conceptual framework this framework stipulates that n at any time and space in the flow domain represents the transient evolution of the shape of the pressure front pulse that is diffusing throughout the aquifer during pumping barker 1988 doe 1991 note that this theory has been shown to be rather universal with validity ranges extending beyond the strict postulates of barkers grf model rafini et al 2017 rafini and larocque 2009 as explained in the following chapter any stabilization of the flow dimension reflects a hydrodynamic stabilization during the transient test which implies a spatial temporal window where hydraulic conditions are unchanging and the reservoir s governing parameters t and s are constant in natural media most derivative responses obtained from constant rate tests are composed of a sequence of several segments with stable flow dimensions as reported by ferroud et al 2018 from various geological environments when the values of the flow dimension change this reflects changing hydraulic conditions as the cross flow surface extends throughout the flow domain to a certain extent these changes provide a scan of aquifer conditions in heterogeneous aquifers complex signatures are produced whose interpretation is not necessarily possible using conventional type curve matching methods this article is a review of diverse analyses and interpretations of flow regimes proposed in both the petroleum and the hydrogeological literature the majority of oil and gas articles address the flow regime analysis by recognizing specific ds dlogt slopes without using the flow dimension parameter this review converts the flow regime slopes into flow dimension values and sorts these values into various hydrodynamic signatures emphasis is placed on considering the sequences of several flow regimes that when combined are predicted to represent various specific hydraulic conditions based on a review of petroleum engineering and hydrogeology research and authors we submit a catalog of certain specific conceptual flow models that have been associated with certain specific flow regimes or sequences of flow regimes the hydrodynamics of each conceptual model is explained in regards to the fundamental relationship between n and the transient geometry of the front pulse as it propagates into the flow domain this article is a current state of the art review of advanced analysis methodologies that combine the derivative signatures and the flow dimension sequences for the interpretation of aquifers however in this paper only the qualitative part of this substantial task is presented which amounts to cataloguing the conceptual models the quantitative part which consists in harmonizing the equations associated with these models is not within the scope of this article the submitted methodology is no more difficult to apply and does not require more data than a conventional pumping test analysis although it holds dramatically greater potential this article proposes the use of our methodology as a powerful diagnostic tool to improve accuracy in hydrogeological and petroleum studies first we describe and discuss in detail the concepts of flow dimension and sequential analysis we then review the known conceptual models distinguishing between mono and multi stage models finally we discuss the submitted methodology including advanced topics and limitations such as the issue of non unique interpretations 2 background 2 1 data processing and denoising of the derivative signal the interpretation of a derivative signal may be compromised by poor data quality nobakht and mattar 2009 roumboutsos and stewart 1988 since the time series is highly sensitive to any subtle drawdown variation it frequently appears noisy due to various factors including operational imprecision pumping rate fluctuations kuchuk 1990 wind effects earth tides barometric fluctuations or precipitation to cope with these problems and to avoid misinterpretations in the recognition of real flow regimes pre processing and smoothing of data are often required first it is suggested to remove the outliers nobakht and mattar 2009 secondly an algorithm is applied to correct the derivative signal for pumping rate adjustments and or wellbore storage various algorithms have been proposed to this end in the literature e g convolution deconvolution variational regularization multirate ideally the drawdown and the pumping rate are simultaneously measured in order to correct the derivative signal for pumping rate fluctuations convolution is a mathematical operation applied to two functions a flow rate function and an impulse response this produces a third function the wellbore pressure or drawdown the impulse response represents the theoretical pressure response for a specific conceptual model which is mostly based on a radial flow regime in other words the convolution integral produces the wellbore pressure as a forward problem using the measured flow rate data and the constant rate pressure behavior of the system based on the duhamel principle of superposition duhamel 1833 kuchuk et al 2010 various convolution algorithms are available in the literature for instance the pressure pressure convolution uses different pressure or drawdown data recorded at two different spatial locations in order to interpret a pressure signal lacking a flow rate measurement or with an unreliable flow rate denney 2003 onur et al 2004 the limit of the convolution method is that it needs to assume a conceptual model convolution overwhelmingly postulates a radial flow regime which is grossly suitable in most real world tests as explained above roumboutsos and stewart 1988 conversely deconvolution is an algorithm based process that aims at finding the solution of a convolution equation deconvolution is an inverse method that reconstructs an equivalent constant rate drawdown response in other words the variable rate drawdown is converted into an extrapolated equivalent constant rate drawdown this processing has the advantage that it does not need to assume a specific conceptual model the deconvolution method corrects the rate altered data and transforms it into constant rate data which makes more data available for the interpretation gringarten 2010 in addition the deconvolution process allows more accurate and unique interpretations it reduces the non uniqueness of a well test interpretation by reducing the uncertainties of observed data and also by reducing the multitude of possible derivative signatures that fit to observed noisy data cumming et al 2013 deconvolution also helps in identifying the conceptual model gringarten 2008 von schroeter et al 2001 and produces much better estimations of hydraulic properties and boundary conditions by producing clearer transformed derivative data gringarten 2008 in the time between the publication of the papers by kuchuk and ayestaran 1985 and stewart et al 1983 which introduced the process of deconvolution to the petroleum industry and today many deconvolution algorithms have been proposed in the petroleum literature using different operational techniques e g analytical deconvolutions discrete numerical deconvolution without measurement noise deconvolution with constraints nonlinear least squares pressure rate deconvolution among others obeahon et al 2014 onur and kuchuk 2012 pimonov et al 2010 von schroeter et al 2001 for more details about convolution and deconvolution codes the reader is invited to read the review of kuchuk et al 2010 it should be noted that deconvolution algorithms cannot reconstruct the drawdown data if the pumping test is influenced by some interferences from other wells nearby or if the aquifer is influenced by leakage effects wang 2010 various differentiation algorithms have been used to increase the signal noise ratio of derivative time series escobar et al 2004a b c evaluated the performance of seven algorithms bourdet clarck horne simons spline van golf racht first degree and second degree polynomials and concluded that the spline bourdet and horne functions are the most suitable to analyze derivative data recently ramos et al 2017 proposed a variational regularization method based on frequency filtering during a hydraulic test drawdown data may also be affected by other factors such as recharge atmospheric pressure changes tidal influences or interference from other pumping wells these hydraulic disturbances are more likely to be observed on drawdown signals during long term pumping tests various codes have been proposed in the literature to correct cyclic tide induced head fluctuations by using sinusoidal functions carr and van der kamp 1969 erskine 1991 ferris 1952 or the superposition principle chapuis et al 2006 because the groundwater level fluctuation of the taipei basin is induced by the periodic loading of the overlying river water caused by the tidal influence ni et al 2013 proposed to use the hilbert huang transform huang et al 1998 additionally various methods have been proposed to correct the barometric pressure effects on confined and unconfined aquifer datasets a review of these methods is proposed by spane 1999 in cases where several pumping wells are operated simultaneously the drawdown analysis must decipher their interferences by using the superposition principle and image wells theory such context is beyond the scope of this review which focuses on single pumping test responses finally the issue of head level variations induced by natural recharge during long duration pumping tests remains poorly assessed it may be forecasted that such effects exert an influence on the drawdown record and on the calculated flow dimension during very late time as the drawdown rate induced by pumping becomes very low and ultimately negligible drawdown stabilisation numerical modeling may help to address this issue in further works 2 2 background of the flow dimension sequential analysis 2 2 1 the log derivative analysis over the last three decades it has been routine practice for oil and gas theoreticians and practitioners to use the logarithmic derivative log derivative pressure time series to analyze flow conditions in natural reservoirs after pioneering works by bourdet et al 1983 mattar and zaoral 1992 and tiab and kumar 1980b the log derivative analysis was first introduced into the hydrogeology literature by chow 1952 and refined by karasaki et al 1988 spane and wurstner 1993 and spane 1993 and has since remained in the theoretical realm however a recently growing interest is to be noted avci et al 2013 beauheim et al 2004 bowman et al 2012 cheng and ni 2009 dewandel et al 2011 gringarten 2008 hammond and field 2014 onur et al 2007 ramos et al 2017 renard et al 2009 samani et al 2006 sun et al 2015 xiao and xu 2014 the bilogarithmic projection of the drawdown log derivative versus time makes it possible to distinguish between changes in flow regime caused by subtle variations in aquifer conditions e g issaka and ambastha 1999 changes that are less visible on drawdown only plots in fig 1 the late flow regime is identified and characterized by a change in the log derivative slope the drawdown only response only makes it possible to diagnose a departure from the early theis function or eventually to fit a theis function to the late stage which would be inappropriate as the derivative signal clearly indicates that this is a non radial flow regime the slope is different from 0 the change in flow regime reflects changes in aquifer conditions in a generic fashion at distance from the pumping well in this case this may be related to the influence of a fault or a variously fractured domain disconnected from the well the principle of universally interpreting various types of flow regimes from bilog plots of the drawdown log derivative vs time was formalized by bourdet et al 1983 other classic diagnostic plots include s log s or log ds dlog t vs log t 0 5 or log t 0 25 where distinct diagrams were used for identifying specific flow regimes for reviews on the approaches see bourdet 2002 gringarten 2008 kruseman and de ridder 1994 renard et al 2009 and verweij 1995 notably renard et al 2009 effectively promoted the analysis of the ds dlogt signal in hydrogeology by highlighting its helpfulness in providing more detailed aquifer interpretations recently some research works have submitted the β derivative signal which is the derivative of the logarithm of the drawdown with respect to the logarithm of time plotted on a bilog plot eq 1 hosseinpour zonoozi 2006 idorenyin et al 2011 ilk et al 2007 shahamat et al 2015 this β analysis is not expected to replace the derivative analysis but it is another tool that provides a unique characterization of flow regimes with a power law function such as wellbore storage reservoir boundaries with either a closed aquifer circle rectangle etc with 2 parallel faults or with 3 perpendicular faults or in fractured media with either an infinite conductivity vertical fracture or a finite conductivity vertical fracture hosseinpour zonoozi 2006 1 dlog s dlog t 1 s t ds dt 2 2 2 the sequential interpretation the sequential approach consists in identifying successive flow regimes occurring over the duration of a constant rate pumping test a critical issue is now raised what is the proper identification of what is called a flow regime at a given pumping time the derivative response may either reflect the occurrence of a real settled and constant flow regime in the aquifer or a transition between two successive flow regimes for instance the numerical modeling conducted by rafini and larocque 2012 showed that a non connected well located close to a vertical finite conductivity fault produces a derivative signal composed of several successive flow regimes appearing in this order radial transition bilinear the radial and bilinear flow regimes relate to the diffusion of the pressure front pulse throughout the matrix and the leaky fault while the transition stage does not reflect any of the properties of the aquifer strictly speaking in order to correctly identify a stable flow regime the derivative data must exhibit a straight line which implies that flow conditions are hydrodynamically stable under the influence of some hydraulic objects whose properties may be calculated a flow regime transition in most cases is a short time period during which several heterogeneities are interacting in an inconsistent manner thus generating unsettled hydrodynamic conditions we submit that the two following primary criteria are required to confidently derive a flow regime the stability of n derivative straight line and its duration which must be of at least one log cycle beauheim et al 2004 where derivative straight segments are shorter than one log cycle it is not possible to reliably infer unique hydraulic properties finally there remains the risk that some long duration transitional stages may still verify these criteria leading to misinterpretation however in our experience these long duration transitional stages generate characteristic sub linear or hyperspherical flow regimes the flow dimension theory barker 1988 corroborates tiab s and mattar s approach as it predicts that the slope of a pumping well drawdown derivative time series will stabilize after very early pumping time corresponding to the asymptotic portion of barker s grf model due to its homogeneous continuous and infinite acting flow idealization the grf predicts a unique constant slope segment in nature many cases produce a series of several straight segments ferroud et al 2018 the concept of flow dimension diagnostic plots was later introduced by beauheim et al 2004 and beauheim and roberts 1998 this concept merges the flow dimension theory with the straight line sequential analysis promoted by tiab and mattar pressure derivative time series are decomposed into sequences of flow regimes marked by constant flow dimensions that can be either sublinear n 1 linear n 1 bilinear n 1 5 radial n 2 spherical n 3 hyperspherical n 3 or fractional n is a non integer positive and negative unit slopes also are commonly identified which are classically interpreted as representing internal and external hydraulic boundaries rather than flow dimensions but may also represent transient behaviors theoretically unrestricted multi stage responses i e several successive distinct flow regimes can be analyzed and interpreted as a succession of stable hydraulic conditions occurring in the aquifer as the pulse scans through it these distinct conditions reflect the temporary predominance of various hydraulic objects boundaries non uniformities or any heterogeneities on the aquifer response the identification of a sequence of flow regimes essentially constitutes a hydraulic diagnosis for instance in fig 1 the n sequence is 2 1 18 the process of determining the sequence of flow regimes makes it possible to then proceed to a qualitative interpretation of these regimes this consists in selecting the appropriate conceptual flow model s considering the knowledge of the hydrogeological context in many cases the hydraulic properties associated with the successive aquifer conditions may then be quantified using the conceptual flow models that are reviewed in this article however this process presents two important limitations we lack understanding of several specific flow regimes and associations of flow regimes also certain conceptual models predict similar flow dimensions leading to the so called issue of non unique diagnostics this last problem is partially attenuated by studying the sequences of flow dimensions as a whole rather than separately 2 2 3 hydrodynamic framework of the flow dimension theory based on the grf model barker 1988 the flow dimension n represents the area a formed by the depressurization front pulse cross flow area through the following power law relationship eq 2 2 a r r n 1 where r is the distance traveled by the pressure front pulse starting from the source because r is a function of time t this equation can be written as a t α r t n 1 where r t refers to the diffusive regime under normal fickian diffusive conditions r α t 0 5 which yields a t α t n 1 2 as a premise our conception of the flow dimension is that from a hydrodynamic perspective it directly represents the temporal evolution of the cross flow area during the hydraulic test in such a manner that when the depressurization front around a pumping well expands outward over time it encounters hydraulic heterogeneities of various natures and topological dimensions irregularly shaped boundaries faults channels connections to other aquifers etc that modify flow conditions and that will influence the observed flow dimension this behavior is expected both in hard rock aquifers that typically consist of complex discontinuous geometries and in granular aquifers which are characterized by internal complexities and relatively short scale hydraulic compartmentalization e g fluvial and alluvial sediments corbett et al 2012 this conception of the flow dimension fundamentally diverges from the common premise that this parameter reflects some specific and non trivial scheme of scaling invariance of the hydraulic properties see discussion below in this section and in section 3 10 for multi well sets rafini 2008 submitted that a general homogeneous response may be sought by using bilog plots with grf normalized derivative data d s r 2 n dlogt versus standard normalized time t r 2 in systems inducing successive flow regimes with different flow dimensions these normalized plots must be analyzed independently for each flow regime a deeper explanation of the flow dimensional analysis of multi well datasets brings us to the complex issue of the spatial homogeneity of flow dimensions at the scale of a pumping field which is beyond the scope of this article flow regimes with n 1 linear flow represent one dimensional pressure transfers restricted to corridors in such a manner that the lateral propagation of the cross flow area a is prevented for instance parallel flow lines in a long and narrow system thus a remains constant a r 1 1 in the case of n 2 a radial flow the cross flow area proportionally varies with r the simplest radial flow case is the cylinder shaped cross flow area of the classical theis aquifer a 2πr note that radial flow does not necessarily imply a cylindrical theis type flow it simply means that a r any value of n different from 2 is referred to as non radial flow the case of n 3 corresponds to a spherical flow regime with the simplest form being a sphere shaped cross flow area a 4πr2 again a spherical flow regime does not automatically imply sphere shaped cross flow surfaces and a r2 may result from other flow conditions e g a variable thickness aquifer as explained below non integer values of the flow dimension are referred to as fractional flow behaviors which can be induced by any hydraulic or geometric structure where flow area changes by a non integer power of distance fig 2 presents a summary of published theoretical flow regimes and their associated flow dimensions n the flow dimension is not an intrinsic property of an aquifer because it results from the combined effects of aquifer conditions and the topological dimension of the source the source is cylindrical in conventional well test cases but spherical point source in packer test configurations or when the screen length is very short in comparison to the aquifer thickness escobar et al 2012a moncada et al 2005 in an ideal continuous homogeneous and infinite acting grf aquifer n is governed by the dimension of the source barker 1988 conversely even if the source is cylindrical the presence of many types of large scale heterogeneities generate flow regime changes whereby the flow dimension is modified not all heterogeneity types produce flow dimension changes in order for such a change to occur the fundamental power law relationship between the front pulse area and the distance it travels from the source eq 2 must be modified in a stable manner moreover the influence of heterogeneities on the drawdown response is equally tempered by the size of the heterogeneity and its distance to the pumping well a small scale discontinuity such as a single joint located near the pumping well can alter an aquifer s response to a pumping test as drastically as a major multi kilometer fault zone located far from the well the former case affects the early time response whereas the latter affects late time stages this phenomenon is governed by the heterogeneity scale relative to the volume of the depressurized portion of the aquifer supplying the well i e the size of the cone of depression when interpreting a conceptual model using drawdown data it is important to remember that the heterogeneity dimensions are directly related to the absolute log time of their occurrence on drawdown curves the most significant contribution of the grf model lies in the theory of the flow dimension which provides a universal formulation of the relationships between the expansion rate of the transmissive area a depressurization front and drawdown rate variations drawdown log derivative slope while analytical models based on the assumption of a radial flow regime imply a linear expansion mode and a constant drawdown log rate during the pumping test n 2 the flow dimension theory widens the pumping test interpretation to non linear expansion modes and non constant drawdown log rates n 2 and n 2 respectively represent flow regimes with increasing and decreasing drawdown log rates as a function of pumping time purely from the standpoint of groundwater management n 2 and n 2 hence reflect respectively poor potential and high potential aquifers the flow dimension analysis substantially expands the interpretative framework and diversity of real flow responses that can be modeled allowing for a lesser degree of idealization and a higher degree of accuracy in representing real aquifer complexity from a physical standpoint the grf model proposes a relatively restrictive vision of the flow dimension due to strong hydraulic and geometrical assumptions a grf aquifer is continuous homogeneous and laterally infinite and the flow geometry forms an n dimension symmetrical pattern around the source which is in itself n dimensional thus in theory n remains constant during the entire transient test although mathematically robust this model contains several physical paradoxes that have been subject to debate including the meaninglessness of non integer dimension sources which explains why the n parameter has seldom found a practical use despite its powerful potential it quickly became obvious that the flow dimension theory which posits a relationship between the drawdown rate at time t and the cross flow area expansion rate at distance r t from the pumping well is a rather universal law extending beyond the strict postulates stated by barker 1988 namely where the dimensionality of flow is not only governed by the dimensionality of the source beginning with doe 1991 several authors have explored this avenue for decades notably deciphering the use of n for drawdown interpretations in fractured network aquifers that were pumped via a conventional two dimensional source e g jourde et al 2002a b kuusela lahtinen et al 2003 leveinen 2000 leveinen et al 1998 more recently rafini and larocque 2009 noted the versatility of the flow dimension theory by quantitatively verifying that the n 1 5 fractional flow regime obtained from numerical flow simulations in a vertical conductive fault embedded in an aquifer occurred in accordance with the fundamental definition of n given in eq 2 although such discontinuum lies by definition outside of the grf assumptions rafini and larocque 2009 quantified the growth of the cross flow area a r induced by transient interactions between the hydraulic units the fault and the aquifer and confirmed that a r grows following a power law relationship with an exponent equal to 0 5 this value corresponds using eq 2 to a flow dimension equal to 1 5 thus corroborating the flow dimension as calculated from drawdown log derivative slope 0 25 expanding barker s concept doe 1991 found that the flow dimension relates to the evolution of the transmissivity as a function of distance r that may actually correspond either to a purely geometrical expansion of the cross flow surface restricted by the geometry of some constant conductivity conduits embedded into a no flow matrix non space filling case of doe 1991 or to a sole conductivity increase space filling case of doe 1991 or to a combination of both the former i e the power law increase of the cross flow section of some constant conductivity conduits was later numerically simulated by bowman et al 2012 the latter i e the power law conductivity increase case has long been debated through the grf derived fractal models acuna and yortsos 1995 chang and yortsos 1990 walker et al 2006 3 review of flow dimensions with known conceptual models the quality of the hydrodynamic analysis and the accuracy of the estimation of an aquifer s hydraulic properties depend on the relevance of the selection of an appropriate conceptual model to interpret the pumping test signatures this section presents an extensive catalog table 1 of conceptual flow models in various types of non uniform aquifers these models have been published by numerous authors over several decades of research in the fields of petroleum engineering and water resources the predicted theoretical behaviors are displayed in terms of flow dimension sequences the majority of these models were developed by analytically resolving the diffusivity problem according to various hydraulic and geometrical postulates the remaining minority are empirical models derived from numerical experiments in the opinion of the authors these approaches both are relevant for the theoretical investigation of predictive flow responses each has its respective strengths and weaknesses while the empirical numerical approach is criticized for its generalization that is deemed to be difficult to constrain it has the major advantage of allowing the representation of complex 3 dimensional flow systems in a realistic fashion i e weaker geometrical idealisation of flow on the contrary the analytical approach commonly involves strong simplifying premises on the flow problem for mathematical suitability purposes which also impact the generalization often poorly addressed in most cases these postulates come to either simplifying the geometry of flow and boundaries internal or external and or to splitting and recombining the complex flow problem into several solvable forms restricted to some time or space domains to conclude the manner with which the problem is formulated strongly commands in itself the flow response of the analytical model leading to models bounded by editorial choices rather than universal compiling these models made it possible to perform a thorough review and discussion of the different approaches used by the authors to conceptualize the hydrodynamics associated with the various flow regimes 3 1 the linear flow regime n 1 the flow dimension n 1 implies a cross flow area that remains practically constant as the pressure wave travels through the aquifer although commonly interpreted as the response produced by a fracture the linear regime can also take place in any channelized narrow alluvial or fractured context when diagnosed over very short time frames i e when the volume of depressurized aquifer is low meter scale a linear flow regime can represent a small scale measuring one meter or less conductive fracture in the close vicinity of the pumping well this is due to the high diffusivity of the fracture and the consequent rapid propagation of the depressurization front compared to the embedding matrix which is nearly non depressurized at very early stages here the matrix drawdown diffusion surrounding the fracture is so small compared with diffusion in the fracture that the cross flow area propagating into the matrix remains negligible compared to the fracture s section the total cross flow area a hence remains practically equal to the fracture s section generating a linear regime with respect to eq 2 the association commonly made between linear flow responses and larger aquifer scale vertical fractures embedded in a less conductive matrix is based on analytical solutions by gringarten et al 1974 and cinco ley and samaniego v 1981a however this interpretation is non unique as explained above the proper interpretation of an aquifer scale fault would require the association of this signal with a subsequent n 1 5 stage 1 1 5 sequence table 1 cell 9 which is a much more unequivocal response as explained in sections below two different types of linear flow regimes indicating the presence of a fracture have been proposed in the petroleum literature fig 3 a b gringarten et al 1974 solved a matrix related linear flow problem developing around a vertical fracture which is infinitely conductive fig 3b in this linear flow model the pressure along the fracture is constant and uniform leading to the fracture acting as a vertical planar source pressure gradients develop in the matrix surrounding the fracture and generate one directional flow perpendicular to the fracture afterwards cinco ley et al 1978 and cinco ley and samaniego v 1981a solved a fault related linear flow problem occurring prior to the bilinear n 1 5 see below flow regime into finite conductivity aquifer scale fractures or fault zones by contrast this linear flow regime posits that the depressurization practically is restricted to the vertical fracture or the fault zone and does penetrate the matrix only negligibly fig 3a this flow configuration is similar from a hydrodynamic standpoint to that described in the previous section for submetric fractures the cross flow area penetrating into the matrix is negligible in comparison to the fracture s section which therefore is the predominant cross flow area leading to the linear flow top and bottom limits must be reached such that drawdown propagation is strictly horizontal and one dimensional in the fracture such flow conditions may occur in natural cases where temporary flow restriction into the fracture occurs either due to a high diffusivity contrast i e a practically impermeable matrix or to a very strong skin effect delaying pressure transfers to the embedding matrix the latter could possibly be due to mineral precipitations on the fault s rock walls there are two different types of tectonically induced hydraulic objects occurring in hard rock aquifers i e fractures and faults and it is critical to distinguish between them within the scope of the interpretation of a reservoir it appears necessary to clarify semantical standards drawn from the research fields of hydrogeology hydraulics and hydrocarbon reservoirs in regards to the terminology used to describe structural geology in the conception of the classical literature of pumping tests numerous references in this chapter a fracture refers to a low thickness single discontinuity some models posit zero thickness with a finite lateral extension where laminar flow occurs between two parallel planar walls there is no pressure gradient across the fracture uniform pressure profile poiseuille fracture these objects are hydraulic drains and may be modelled singly rather than as a network when one fracture predominates in the response of the system which typically occurs at early times when the pumping test scale is small see further discussion in sections 4 1 and 4 2 by contrast hydrocarbon reservoir and regional hydrogeology modellers commonly refer to fault zones as hydraulic barriers or drains aydin 2000 bense et al 2013 knipe et al 1998 consisting of tabular objects with non negligible thickness often multi metric and a large lateral extension practically infinite on the scale of pumping test investigations their complex multilayered internal architecture dick et al 2016 faulkner et al 2010 jourde et al 2002a b produces a hydraulic compartmentalization where typically external layers damage zones are highly diffusive due to increased fracture density and core layers have a low diffusivity due to grain size reduction fault gouges e g micarelli et al 2006 the relative importance of these contrasting diffusivity layers is strongly variable in nature leading to a large spectrum of hydraulic properties of faults ranging from barriers to anisotropic drains barriers to isotropic drains antonellini and aydin 1994 aydin 2000 caine et al 1996 knipe et al 1998 in these statements the terms fault and fracture are both used in this paper to describe highly diffusive tabular darcyan flow domains however we favour the following terminological specifications fault refers to finite conductivity objects with a large extension on an aquifer scale and having a non negligible thickness these objects are filled with material and may be composed of variously diffusive subdomains some layers may bear fracture networks in themselves as explained above the pressure profile of the entire object can be non uniform in other words they do not validate the cubic law and the inside pressure transfers can be modelled in three dimensions opposing this the term fracture refers to finite or infinite conductivity void filled objects with a variable extension and a low to negligible thickness such that inside flow is either not represented or modelled by the cubic law uniform pressure profile finally the term fracture will be sporadically used herein outside these specifications but will be explained in compliance with the original published terminology of certain models from the standpoint of pumping test hydraulics it is questionable that any real fracture may validate gringarten s infinite conductivity assumption of uniform instantly equilibrated pressures into the discontinuity matrix related linear flow regime explained above early time solution of gringarten et al 1974 this is indeed inconsistent with both in situ measurements e g packer tests flow meter profiles inversion paillet 1998 paillet et al 1987 and laboratory experimental data durham and bonner 1994 engelder and scholz 2013 pyrack nolte et al 1987 raven and gale 1985 witherspoon et al 1980 however it is absolutely certain that this postulate is not applicable to fault zones on the other hand both cinco ley s early time linear and medium time bilinear solutions cinco ley and samaniego v 1981a explicitly solve the transient flow problem into a finite conductivity discontinuity since the discontinuity is represented as a tabular highly conductive darcyan flow domain in itself this conceptual model is likely applicable to both fully penetrating fractures and fault drains which exert a similar influence on the aquifer response to pumping tests rafini and larocque 2012 2009 it is likely that the above mentioned hydraulic compartmentalization in multilayered faults is significant in generating the early time linear flow regime due to the presence of impermeable layers fault related linear flow cinco ley et al 1978 cinco ley and samaniego v 1981a in the fracture case transitions from fracture to matrix related flow regimes during the pumping test may relate to the reaching of the fracture s finite extension as predicted by cinco ley et al 1978 and cinco ley and samaniego v 1981a however rafini and larocque 2009 explained that this transition naturally occurs irrespective of the finite or infinite extension of the discontinuity as a direct consequence of the diffusion slow down into the discontinuity see details below a linear flow regime may also be produced by a highly conductive channel one dimensional conduit into the fracture plane figueiredo et al 2016 or at the intersection of two conductive fractures gringarten 2008 table 1 cell 2 linear flow regimes also occur very frequently in granular aquifer contexts ferroud et al 2018 in an elongated aquifer such as an esker i e a grossly homogeneous isotropic aquifer laterally confined between two parallel impermeable or low conductive boundaries in such a manner that the flow is restricted to a corridor e g escobar et al 2004c escobar and montealegre 2006 escobar and montealegre m 2007 note that if the well is far from the lateral boundaries a radial flow regime would settle prior to the linear flow leading to the diagnostic sequence n 2 1 table 1 cell 2 additionally the linear response has been reported in highly channelized fluvial systems e g braided and or meandering systems corbett et al 2012 and deep sea fans escobar et al 2004c according to corbett et al 2012 a linear flow can be induced by a cross flow behavior namely a flow within a layer and not between layers table 1 cell 15 this flow behavior is presented under the name ramp effect and is explained below in section 3 5 finally the linear flow regime has also been reported within fractured corridors or large permeable veins dewandel et al 2011 in a previous study ferroud et al 2018 we analyzed a flow dimension database composed of 69 pumping tests and we observed that the linear flow regime is mostly observed in fractured crystalline rock aquifers when the rock is very sparsely fractured fig 4 a and in fluvio glacial deposits fig 4b in the case of the hydraulic signal of the crystalline rock displayed in fig 4a the documented occurrences of fractures reported in well logs combined with knowledge of the structural context suggest the presence of a steeply dipping and productive fault fracture corridor embedded in a slightly fractured matrix the linear flow regime observed in this fractured rock may hence adequately be interpreted using the vertical finite conductivity fault model the linear flow regime observed in the fluvio glacial deposit fig 4b may however reflect either a narrow aquifer escobar et al 2004c or a meandering and or braided environment corbett et al 2012 in this case more field investigations would be needed to distinguish between these models 3 2 multi linear combinations 3 2 1 sequence n 1 1 mijinyawa and gringarten 2008 proposed a conceptual model to reproduce the flow behavior in a deltaic environment river dominated deltas this environment is composed of a distributary channel system olariu and bhattacharya 2006 fig 5 according to olariu and bhattacharya 2006 these distributary channels represent channel bifurcations that have characteristic sedimentary structures of unidirectional effluent flow these network patterns may be formed in deep sea fans damuth et al 1983 posamentier and kolla 2003 alluvial fans and delta plains mijinyawa and gringarten 2008 proposed two conceptual models in the first case the model is composed of two perpendicular channels fig 5b while the second model is composed of two successive channels with a non equal diameter fig 5c in both cases fig 5a and b a second linear flow regime is observed when the diameter of the second channel is greater than the first one these numerical results emphasize the non uniqueness of the derivative signature because the two different configurations of the branches fig 5b and c produce similar responses the position of the second linear flow regime on a derivative signal plot depends on the ratio of diameters between the two branches as shown in table 1 cell 4 if the second channel is thicker than the first one its transmissivity will be greater and the line showing this second linear flow regime will be shown lower on the plot d in table 1 cell 4 if the second channel is thinner the second linear slope will be higher than the first b in table 1 cell 4 our database ferroud et al 2018 shows that the n sequence 1 1 has not been observed in alluvial deposits but rather in a crystalline fractured rock aquifer and a carbonate rock aquifer new more detailed conceptual models in fractured rock aquifers are thus needed in order to interpret the sequence n 1 1 the shift of the linear slope shown in fig 6 may reflect the moment when the pressure wave reaches another vertical fracture having greater hydraulic conductivity 3 3 the radial flow regime n 2 although far from being ubiquitous the radial flow regime remains the regime most frequently observed in natural media regardless of geological context ferroud et al 2018 it occurs as often in fractured as in granular media radial flow may correspond to the classic theis conditions also named infinite acting radial flow iarf but this is not the only possible interpretation because the confirmation of radial behavior only requires that the conditions of a r be verified this may not occur only in purely theis type cylindrical equipotential surfaces radial flow may also be produced in a wide range of aquifer configurations including discontinuous porosities dense euclidean fracture network aquifers corresponding for instance to the early radial stage of the so called dual porosity model aquifers cross cut by a horizontal or weakly inclined single conductive fault or fracture before the front pulse reaches the top and bottom boundaries gringarten et al 1974 rafini and larocque 2012 or a layer with fractures in an impermeable matrix fig 7 regardless of the aquifer conditions the radial flow model makes it possible to derive an apparent transmissivity tapp which is inversely proportional to the plateau elevation of the derivative signal a as given by cooper jacob solution tapp 2 3q 4πa the physical meaning of tapp however varies depending on the conceptual model as explained in this section radial flow also typically occurs at a very late pumping time when the cone of depression is so large that heterogeneities such as fractures and faults in bedrock aquifers are small compared to the volume of the depressurized aquifer numerical modelling works by meier et al 1998 and sánchez vila et al 1999 have validated the applicability of the cooper jacob solution in a heterogeneous domain producing a radial flow regime with diffuse transmissivity fields and concentric heterogeneous storage conditions since the effects of single heterogeneities are diluted the hydraulic properties calculated from such a late radial regime represent the bulk aquifer properties our flow dimension database ferroud et al 2018 emphasizes that most long term radial flow regimes are observed in carbonate rock aquifers this may indicate that the bedding plane fractures of the carbonate rock analysed in the database are well connected and contribute to the flow 3 4 multi radial combinations two successive radial flow regimes may be produced in a variety of different aquifer settings dual porosity unconfined aquifer impermeable frontiers leaky aquifers aquifers with variable transmissivity lateral flow domains transitional stage with a negative unit slope of ds dlogt multilayered aquifers or an aquifer cross cut by a weakly inclined finite conductivity fault or fracture fig 7a b these conceptual models are described in the following sections critical features for identifying appropriate conceptual models are whether the late plateau is higher or lower than the early plateau and the shape of the transitional stage 3 4 1 sequence n 2 2 with late plateau higher than the early plateau the most common interpretation of this sequence is a single linear impermeable barrier in this case the elevation of the late plateau is twice that of the early plateau equivalent to doubling the drawdown slope on a classic semi log plot table 1 cell 14 this is due to the fact that after reaching the frontier the pressure wave propagates into a space half the size of the full space i e the apparent transmissivity is halved compartmented aquifer models butler jr and liu 1991 dewandel et al 2014 rafini et al 2017 where the non pumped compartment is less transmissive than the pumped one generate responses similar to no flow boundary systems a limiting case when the diffusivity contrast between both compartments exceeds one order of magnitude from a practical standpoint rafini et al 2017 drawdown derivative sequences displaying two successive radial flow regimes with the second plateau greater than twice the early plateau are seldom reported in field investigations two distinct conceptual flow models associated with such a sequence have been submitted in the literature the multiple impermeable frontiers model and the weakly inclined finite conductivity model the derivative signature in a flow model with multiple impermeable vertical frontiers has been analysed by beauheim and roberts 1998 mijinyawa and gringarten 2008 and van poollen 1965 this signature presents a second plateau whose y intercept is higher than the y intercept of the first plateau it signals a decrease in the flowing surface after the pressure wave has reached one or several vertical no flow boundaries in such a generalized concept of multiple impermeable frontiers the ratio x which is greater than 2 between the levels of the second and the first plateaus reflects a decrease in the transmissive surface by an equal factor primarily this signature makes it possible to diagnose systems with two vertical frontiers forming a wedge with an angle β with β 360 tapp t where t is the real transmissivity of the aquifer as given by the early radial plateau and tapp is the apparent transmissivity given by the second radial plateau beauheim and roberts 1998 similarly mijinyawa and gringarten 2008 observed that the narrower the semi infinite channel with non parallel frontiers the greater the stabilization of the second plateau the derivative signature of a weakly inclined or horizontal fault embedded in an isotropic conductive matrix also induces two plateaus with the second plateau greater than double the elevation of the first plateau rafini and larocque 2012 the fault and the matrix are both connected to the pumping well the first plateau reflects a cylindrical radial flow within the fault which is much more transmissive than the matrix in a fashion grossly similar to that illustrated in fig 7a the second plateau occurs when the fault no longer exerts influence on the transient hydrodynamics and pressure diffusion into the entire system is governed by the matrix properties the elevations of the first and second plateaus are strictly related to the hydraulic transmissivities of the fault and the matrix the shape of the transition stage positive slope of the derivative signal relates to the fault inclination a criterion that may make it possible to distinguish between the multiple impermeable frontiers and the weakly inclined fault conceptual models may be the shape of the transitional stage between the two plateaus in the weakly inclined fault aquifer the transitional stage reflects a balancing flow period in which the signal of the fault is progressively masked by the signal of the matrix rafini and larocque 2012 demonstrated that due to transient hydrodynamic interactions between the fault and the surrounding matrix the less inclined the fault the higher the slope of the derivative during the transitional stage and the shorter its duration on the other hand in the model for multiple impermeable frontiers transitions may form prolonged stages over time as frontiers are successively reached one after another to conclude in many cases using the shape of the transitional stage to distinguish between both models is not a straightforward process knowledge of the geological context primarily fractured rock versus granular aquifer contexts remains the most valuable information for this purpose 3 4 2 sequence n 2 transition 2 with late plateau lower than the early plateau recently rafini et al 2017 analysed the pressure front pulse behavior in an aquifer composed of two linearly contiguous homogeneous domains with non equal hydraulic properties they showed that when the pumping well is located in the less transmissive media domain a the pressure wave will diffuse preferentially through the most transmissive domain domain b this flow behavior results in a derivative signal composed of 1 a first plateau n 2 representing the radial diffusion of the pressure wave in domain a 2 a transitional stage unit negative slope after the pressure wave reaches the vertical limit between both domains and 3 a late plateau controlled by the hydraulic transmissivity of the domain b table 1 cell 16 since the transmissivity of domain b is greater than the transmissivity of domain a the elevation of the second plateau is lower than that of the first 3 4 3 sequence n 2 transition 2 with both plateaus at the same elevation the dual porosity models proposed by barenblatt et al 1960 kazemi 1969 and warren and root 1963 represent fractured aquifers where the conductive matrix and the fracture network form two hydraulic continua the fractured aquifer is represented by an equivalent continuum in which there is no explicit fracture and the matrix blocks are contributing as local source terms these conceptual models are composed of two homogeneous hydraulic continua one with high conductivity and low storage reflecting the fracture network which is embedded in a low conductivity high storage material reflecting the conductive matrix the hydraulically active fractures in the network must be dense and sufficiently connective and their sizes must be small enough compared to the scale of investigation for the pressure to diffuse in a practically radial multi directional fashion and for the transient effects of individual fractures to be diluted in the bulk network radial response this model predicts type curves composed of two plateaus with equal elevations and presenting the same hydraulic transmissivity separated by a depression of the derivative signal which represents the interporosity flow function during which the pressures of each of the two media tend to balance each other out gringarten 1987b table 1 cell 19 note that the shape of this depression depends on the flow type between the matrix and the fracture gringarten 1987a illustrated that flow models with a pseudo steady state interporosity flow there is interporosity skin that restricts the flow between the matrix and the fractured media will induce a v shaped depression of the derivative signal warren and root 1963 whereas flow models with a transient interporosity flow will induce an open u shaped depression moench 1984 the u shaped depression reflects the contribution of the high storage matrix in a finite sized block system while the two same elevation plateaux before and after the u reflect the conductivity of the fractured network the interporosity flow coefficient is defined as the ratio of the permeability of the matrix to that of the fractures however the relevancy of the dual porosity model is deeply undermined by kuchuk and biryukov 2014 2013 2012 by combining semi analytical solutions kuchuk and biryukov 2013 2012 field data kuchuk and biryukov 2015 2014 and numerical modelling of flow through a discretely fractured and faulted reservoir containing arbitrary distributed discontinuities biryukov and kuchuk 2012 these authors point to a lack of validity of the dual porosity model as initially submitted by barenblatt et al 1960 and warren and root 1963 the dual porosity model assumes that the matrix is homogeneous and uniform throughout the entire system abdassah and ershaghi 1986 later revisited this restrictive assumption and introduced the triple porosity model in order to represent the fracture matrix flow behavior in a more realistic way this conceptual model considers two rather than one matrix domains with different properties interporosity and storage capacity the model assumes that the flow takes place in the fractures towards the well that no flow occurs between the two matrix domains and that the matrices act as sources to supply the fractures the well is not supplied by the matrices abdassah and ershaghi 1986 proposed two conceptual models horizontal matrix layers separated by fractures strata model and blocks which are uniformly distributed and separated by orthogonal fractures block model escobar et al 2004b adapted the derivative analysis to the triple porosity model by using tiab s method the type curve of this model shows two radial flow regimes separated by two humps table 1 cell 20 it should be noted however that if the relevancy of the dual porosity model is questionable the triple porosity model is even more debatable and doubtful neither the double porosity signature nor the triple porosity signature has been reported in our flow dimension database ferroud et al 2018 trinchero et al 2007 and copty et al 2008 developed a methodology to interpret pumping tests in leaky aquifers based on the analysis of the first and the second derivatives of the drawdown with respect to log time the derivative signal is composed of two plateaus with the same elevation separated by a positive concave hump the leaky aquifer system is composed of a semiconfined pumped aquifer that is fully intercepted and connected to an overlaying aquifer via an aquitard following hantush and jacob 1955 however copty et al 2008 refined hantush s model by positing that drawdown in the upper aquifer is non negligible and that transmissivity in both aquifers is represented by heterogeneous rather than homogeneous fields while the singular radial hump radial shape of the derivative response primary allows the detection of such non uniform aquifer configurations the leakage factor as well as each hydraulic property of the aquifer can be properly estimated from inflexion and multiple inflexion point methods copty et al 2008 3 5 linear radial combinations 3 5 1 sequence n 2 1 2 fluvial deposits e g braided and or meandering environments are systems which are formed by the transport and deposition of sediments in river channels this deposition creates layered systems in which the communication between layers controls the flow this type of environment produces a specific derivative signature if the communication between layers is laterally and vertically restricted a ramp effect signal may be observed table 1 cell 15 segment b this flow regime expresses a one directional flow within the layers in other words lateral micro cross flow within fluvial deposits produces a linear flow dimension observed over at least one log cycle when there is no vertical permeability and a poor lateral connectivity between facies a linear flow is observed because the transmissivity decreases laterally due to the heterogeneity of layers that constrains the flow in one direction corbett et al 2012 the late times radial flow dimension reflects the effective hydraulic conductivity when the entire heterogeneous system contributes the n sequence of this conceptual model is 2 1 2 table 1 cell 15 3 5 2 sequence n 2 1 the n sequence 2 1 is typically generated in a large corridor bounded by two parallel no flow lateral boundaries the early radial flow regime settles as the pressure front pulse increases radially around the pumping well while the linear regime starts after the lateral boundaries have been reached rafini 2008 p 76 table 1 cell 5 note that this sequence n 2 1 was commonly observed with a short duration early radial flow regime in our flow dimension database ferroud et al 2018 in fluvio glacial deposits this sequence is associated either with a narrow aquifer table 1 cell 5 or with the first portion of the ramp effect n 2 1 2 table 1 cell 15 proposed by corbett et al 2012 this n sequence has also been observed in granites by dewandel et al 2011 3 6 the bilinear flow regime n 1 5 the n 1 5 behavior commonly referred to as the so called bilinear flow regime is produced by a steeply inclined finite conductivity fault or fracture embedded into an aquifer as demonstrated analytically by cinco ley and samaniego v 1981a and numerically by rafini and larocque 2012 2009 the fact that the fault s conductivity is finite rather than infinite accounts for the pressure gradients in the fault this case contrasts with previously mentioned infinite conductivity fracture models where the water pressure in the fracture is approximated to be uniform in such a manner that it behaves as a planar source see matrix related linear flow regime in the preceding section the finite conductivity fault model describes transient flow into two darcyan flow domains i e the fault and the matrix and their interactions the authors showed that for reasons relating to flow geometry the n 1 5 flow regime occurs only if the diffusion into the fault is strictly one directional which means that the pressure front pulse must have reached the top and bottom boundaries in other words the entire vertical extension of the fault must be depressurized this explains why this flow regime is rarely produced by weakly inclined faults unless the embedding aquifer is very thin strictly speaking the n 1 5 regime is generated when there are transient interactions between a two dimensional fault fracture and a three dimensional matrix hydraulic object with contrasting properties the initial flow scheme associated with this conceptual model as submitted by cinco ley and samaniego v 1981a is depicted in fig 8 a it assumes two simultaneous one dimensional sets of stream lines one occurring in the fault and the other one in the embedding matrix perpendicularly to the fault although this idealization was analytically necessary because it reduces an unsolvable complex two dimensional problem into two one dimensional solvable problems it remains unrealistic because any pressure gradient into the fault would instantly cause stream lines into the matrix to be non parallel rafini 2008 a later numerical study rafini and larocque 2009 re examined in detail the hydrodynamics associated with the n 1 5 flow regime it demonstrated that this flow regime is not restricted to such idealized geometry of stream lines the flow regime occurring in the matrix is not a linear one nor is the flow geometry one dimensional as explained in fig 8b the hydrodynamic conditions indicated by n 1 5 consist in a slowing down of the diffusive regime r t in the fault as a consequence of water being supplied from the matrix rafini and larocque 2009 in such a case the front pulse evolves into the fault according to r t 0 25 rather than according to r t 0 5 as it would in a normal fickian diffusive regime the authors demonstrated that the simultaneous occurrence of normal and abnormal diffusive regimes in the matrix and in the fault respectively lead to an aquifer scale pressure front pulse surface a growing proportionally to r 0 5 which explains the flow dimension equal to 1 5 according to the definition of this parameter eq 1 our flow dimension database emphasizes that the bilinear flow regime n 1 5 is mostly observed in faulted rock aquifers where the matrix is highly fractured fig 9 which confirms the relevancy of the vertical leaky fault model cinco ley and samaniego v 1981a in accordance with this generalized conception the n 1 5 fractional regime may actually be produced by any steeply inclined tabular thin aquifer surrounded by a less conductive unit a fractured dyke embedded into a massive granite or a conductive layer in a verticalized sedimentary sequence etc recently valdes perez et al 2011 proposed a bilinear flow model with a transient interporosity transfer tit between the matrix which the authors refer to as the fractured bulk and which considers matrix vugs micro and meso fractures and the fault or the dominant fracture this conceptual model is composed of a well that intercepts a finite conductive vertical fracture in a double porosity aquifer with an interporosity skin fig 10 b the interporosity skin restricts the interaction between the fault and the matrix it may consist in a zone of damage with mineral filled fractures in this conceptual model the predicted early linear regime represents the restriction of flow in the fracture in a fashion similar to that explained in section 3 1 it is followed by a short transition hump reflecting the interactions between the fractured network and the dominant fracture and a late bilinear flow regime induced by the fault matrix transient interactions as explained in the previous section table 1 cell 11 butler jr and liu 1991 posited that a n 1 5 fractional regime occurring at very early pumping time indicates the presence of low conductivity vertical fractures however this was dispelled by the extensive numerical experiments conducted by rafini and larocque 2009 which determined that the moment in time when the n 1 5 regime begins depends exclusively on the ratio sf 2 km ssm this is due to the fact that the drawdown rate is independent of ssf a peculiar feature of the n 1 5 flow regime that corroborates the early works of cinco ley and samamiego 1981 for details see rafini 2008 rafini and larocque 2009 tiab 2005 these authors further confirmed that the prevailing hydraulic conditions required for the occurrence of n 1 5 are strictly high values of the fault matrix diffusivity ratio as previously submitted by cinco ley and samamiego 1981 and that the duration of the n 1 5 flow regime is governed by the ratio tf 2 km 3 in all circumstances the n 1 5 behaviour essentially and probably does not represent an infinite acting regime as it is due to the transient hydrodynamic interactions between hydraulic objects as explained above 3 6 1 sequence n 1 5 2 a late radial flow regime occurring after the n 1 5 corresponds to a matrix related flow regime cinco ley and samaniego v 1981a rafini and larocque 2009 strictly speaking it is established after the travelled distance of the pressure front pulse into the matrix has become greater than the travelled distance of the pressure front pulse into the fault in other words the fault becomes invisible from a hydrodynamic standpoint its effect is diluted into the large volume of depressurized aquifer rafini and larocque 2009 the apparent transmissivity given by the plateau elevation is strictly that of the matrix table 1 cell 7 3 6 2 sequence n 2 transition 1 5 abbaszadeh and cinco ley 1995 described the case of a finite conductivity fault matrix system in which the fault is not directly pumped as it is not intercepted by the wellbore this leads to the settlement of an early matrix related radial flow corresponding to the time before the fault is reached by the pressure front pulse rafini and larocque 2009 during this early stage the apparent transmissivity as derived by the plateau elevation is that of the matrix a transitional stage with a characteristic negative unit slope takes place between early radial and late n 1 5 flow regimes whose duration increases with the conductivity ratio between the fault and the matrix table 1 cell 8 3 6 3 sequence n 2 1 5 rafini and larocque 2012 concluded from numerical experiments that the n 1 5 flow regime may be generalized to inclined faults which would be reflected by the settlement of an early radial flow regime prior to the n 1 5 stage without any transitional negative unit slope stage this corresponds to the time lapse during which the pressure front pulse propagates into the fault in a radial fashion from the point of interception with the wellbore before reaching the aquifer s top and bottom boundaries in this case the early radial flow regime is fault related which means that the plateau elevation is inversely proportional to the fault s transmissivity table 1 cell 12 3 6 4 sequence n 1 1 5 1 3 lee and brockenbrough 1986 proposed an analytical solution that implements the trilinear flow regime n 1 3 to model the transient flow response of a finite conductivity vertical fracture connected to a pumping well table 1 cell 18 the geometrical and hydraulic properties of the fault and the matrix are similar to those of cinco ley and samaniego v 1981a however the flow domain is divided into three rather than two regions into which unidimensional flow occurs one into the fracture with flow lines parallel to the fracture one into the matrix with flow lines perpendicular to the fracture and restricted to a region directly surrounding the fracture and also one into the matrix occurring beyond the fractures s lateral extremities with flow lines parallel to the fracture lee and brockenbrough 1986 fig 10c while the first two unidimensional flow regions correspond to the configuration of cinco ley and samaniego v 1981a the third flow region introduces the trilinear flow regime the predicted flow response first reproduces the early sequence 1 1 5 previously introduced by cinco ley and samaniego v 1981a which corresponds to a transient flow depressurization in the fracture only n 1 then simultaneously in the fracture and the matrix as discussed in the previous section their original contribution though resides in the prediction of a subsequent n 1 3 flow regime referred to as the trilinear leading to the n sequence 1 1 5 1 3 this trilinear flow regime is of short duration and occurs before the late pseudoradial regime according to azari et al 1990 it more realistically reproduces the transition between the bilinear flow regime and the later pseudoradial flow regime they stated that the trilinear flow model has the advantage of smoothly linking the fracture flow regime to the pseudoradial flow regime finally the trilinear conceptual flow model is of a higher degree of idealization than the bilinear model which had previously been criticized by rafini and larocque 2009 and revised for its lack of realism fig 10 3 7 the sphercial flow regime conceptually the spherical flow regime is primarily attributed to a point source equipotential surfaces are spheres that grow outwards according to a r 4π r 2 leading to n 3 following eq 2 barker 1988 this occurs when the portion of borehole that is receiving groundwater is significantly shorter than the aquifer thickness the spherical flow regime is thus expected to be observed i in thick granular systems or thick fractured media where the pumping well partially penetrates the aquifer ii in partially completed aquifers iii during a packer test the pumping test is considered as a point source escobar et al 2012a moncada et al 2005 iv in a fractured aquifer where a well is pumping a partially penetrating finite extension fracture dewandel et al 2018 in these conceptual models the cross flow area diffuses as a sphere partially completed aquifer or point source or a hemisphere partially penetrated aquifer however rafini et al 2014 and ferroud et al 2016 showed that a spherical flow regime may also be produced in an aquifer with an increasing thickness inclined substratum or confining layer as explained in the section below in this conceptual model the cross flow area grows as a portion of a sphere it should be recalled that spherical flow regimes are associated with a slowdown of the drawdown rate as explained in section 2 2 3 3 8 radial spherical combinations 3 8 1 sequence n 2 3 2 when the spherical flow is associated with a later radial stage 3 2 sequence this may suggest a point source barker 1988 table 1 cell 22 the spherical or hemispherical flow regime is generated when pumping between packers gringarten and ramey 1975 national research council staff 1996 p 255 rafini 2008 or in cases of short screen partial completion and partial penetration wellbores fig 11 moncada et al 2005 razminia et al 2016 yildiz and bassiouni 1990 three dimensional pressure diffusion occurs before the horizontal top and bottom boundaries are reached leading to a n 3 flow regime fig 11 the late radial stage takes place after these boundaries have been reached due to the horizontal diffusion the ending time of spherical flow and transition to the late radial flow regime provide insights on the aquifer thickness moncada et al 2005 it should be noted that when the water receiving borehole height either screened or open remains significant from a practical standpoint more than a few meters a radial stage occurs at the earliest pumping time prior to the settlement of the spherical flow regime this early radial flow regime which is generally short and masked by the wellbore storage reflects the cylindrical radial diffusion of the pressure front pulse around the length of the open zone of the well in this model the spherical flow regime is short lived its duration depends on the ratio between the water receiving borehole height and the aquifer thickness it is very short in cases of partially completed wells with large screen or open borehole heights while it lasts much longer in the context of packer tests note that the vertical anisotropy has effects on the duration of the spherical flow regime finally it is worth noting that such a flow configuration can also occur when an external aquifer is connected to the pumped layer through a localized point like pathway bourdet 2002 as illustrated in fig 12 real world examples are a localized gap in the confining layer fig 12a a pumped hard rock aquifer connected to an overlying granular aquifer non pumped through a 1d hydraulic conduit intersection of two conductive fractures or conductive channel into a fault fig 12b or a conductive fault cross cutting a glacio fluvial channel at the base of the overlying sedimentary pile note that a late radial stage may also occur in such configurations fig 12a and b which has not been represented 3 8 2 sequence n 2 2 3 initially horne and temeng 1982 interpreted the spherical flow regime as being related to a conceptual model influenced by a pinch out boundary the upper and the lower confining beds form a wedge with an angle θ fig 13 in this conceptual model the derivative signal shows a short early radial flow dimension n 2 followed by a spherical flow regime n 3 more recently mijinyawa and gringarten 2008 remarked that this n sequence 2 3 is only observed if the well is close to the pinch out fig 13a table 1 cell 21 it should be noted that mijinyawa and gringarten 2008 observed that if the well is far away from the pinch out fig 13b the spherical regime will not be visible the derivative signal shows two plateaus sequence n 2 2 table 1 cell 14 the first plateau expresses the radial diffusion of the cross flow area in the constant thickness aquifer the second plateau which is double the first plateau is produced by the attainment of the pinch out boundary which acts as a single vertical no flow boundary more recently rafini et al 2014 and ferroud et al 2016 showed numerically confirmed the occurrence of spherical flow regimes in aquifers having an inclined substratum conversely to the partially penetrated completed aquifer with a n sequence 2 3 2 the 2 2 3 sequence reflects the signal of an aquifer of variable thickness inclined substratum or wedge aquifer ferroud et al 2016 rafini et al 2014 as illustrated in fig 14 the front pulse surface can be conceptually decomposed into the three components a1 a 1 and a2 due to the inclined substratum a portion of cylinder a1 loss is truncated a1 and a 1 grow in a normal radial fashion while a2 a portion α 360 of the sphere radius of r t grows in a spherical fashion in early times before the pressure front pulse reaches the corner fig 14a the equivalence between a1 loss and a2 and after the pressure wave reaches the corner fig 14b the predominance of a1 over a 2 leads to a sequence of two radial flow regimes once the surface area a2 becomes greater than a1 a truncated hemispherical flow regime n 3 occurs depending on the proximity of the pumping to the corner the early radial stage tends to be short lived the second radial stage depends on the well length the inclination of the substratum and the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer the late spherical flow regime is infinite acting as it lasts until the end of pumping or steady state attainment if no boundary is met note that the wedge like aquifer solution developed by hantush 1962 does not predict such spherical behavior due to the postulate that the shape of substratum s inclination follows an exponential function our flow dimension database emphasizes that the spherical flow regime has been commonly observed in thick granular aquifers fig 15 which confirms the relevancy of the partially penetrated completed model one pumping test also showed a spherical flow regime in an is aquifer context 3 9 linear spherical combinations 3 9 1 sequences n 2 1 3 and n 2 4 3 when associated with a previous linear flow dimension the spherical flow regime can represent a flow regime of a long and narrow elongated aquifer that is influenced by a constant head boundary sui et al 2007 the conceptual model is composed of an elongated aquifer bounded laterally by two no flow boundaries and one constant head boundary perpendicular to the elongated direction and a constant rate pumping well near the constant head boundary sui et al 2007 observed that the flow regime induced by a constant head boundary depends on the shape of the aquifer and on the position of the well in the model if the well is closest to the constant head boundary the pressure front pulse firstly grows radially inducing a radial flow regime iarf n 2 then reaches the constant head boundary inducing a dipolar flow regime unit negative derivative signal and then diffuses between the two lateral no flow boundaries inducing a dipole linear flow regime n 3 the dipolar flow regime results from the dipole represented by the well and its image with rate of opposite sign sui et al 2007 when this dipolar flow regime occurs in an elongated system inducing a linear flow it is called dipole linear flow regime the n sequence of this configuration is n 2 4 3 table 1 cell 23 if the distance between the well and the no flow boundaries is shorter than the distance between the well and the constant head boundary the derivative signal will show a radial flow regime n 2 followed by a linear flow regime n 1 followed by a dipole linear flow regime n 3 the n sequence of this configuration is n 2 1 3 when the pressure wave reaches the far constant head boundary the derivative signal drops to note that the linear n 1 and the dipolar n 4 flow regimes are not necessarily observed depending on the configuration of the system note that when the wellbore storage effect is observed the early radial flow regime may be masked 3 10 fractional flow regimes non integer n the non integer n values were initially interpreted as being related to fractal properties of the fractured media acuna and yortsos 1995 barker 1988 chang and yortsos 1990 however from a geological perspective the fractal theory applied to natural fracture networks is limited to restricted scale of ranges e g hardacre and cowie 2003 nicol et al 1996 and the finite limits of the hydraulic model noted by acuna and yortsos 1995 would hardly permit the fractional response to develop walker et al 2006 also submitted that fractional responses may relate to heterogeneity fields with fractal properties de dreuzy et al 2004 and de dreuzy and davy 2007 have observed fractional n values in models with local scaling of transmissivity in non stationary multifractal correlation patterns in 1991 doe extended the interpretation of fractional n values to non fractal geometries which are not space filling following this concept rafini and larocque 2009 numerically demonstrated how the n 1 5 fractional flow response was generated by an aquifer crosscut by a single leaky fault which is non fractal by definition based on our current knowledge fractional flow dimensions can only be reproduced by a slowing down of the drawdown diffusion regime r t either due to the fractal properties of the medium acuna and yortsos 1995 barker 1988 or to the transient interactions between faults and matrix hydraulic units real derivative signatures in fractured rock aquifers have shown successive integer and non integer n values which compromise the homogeneity assumption of the fractal model ferroud et al 2018 rafini 2008 fig 1 depicts a sequence of radial flow dimension and a fractional flow dimension the radial flow conditions during the first 103 s of pumping make it difficult to interpret the late fractional regime with a fractal model because it implies the presence of non fractal characteristic length scales furthermore the succession of different fractional flow regimes on a single response poses the issue of the spatial superposition of two infinite acting fractal continua which is conceptually inextricable in addition the flow dimension database compiled by ferroud et al 2018 emphasized fractional n values in alluvial deposits fig 16 which are by their very essence non fractured and non faulted implying that other avenues must be considered to interpret these non integer n values 3 11 boundary flow regimes a positive unit slope of the drawdown log derivative signal may represent wellbore storage effects e g tiab 2005 or impermeable boundaries in every direction also named closed reservoir or depleted reservoir gringarten 2008 mattar 1997 which occur respectively at the shortest and at the latest pumping time finally derivative signatures tending to zero or negative unit slopes represent constant head boundaries in the iarf model e g walker and roberts 2003 or represent a transitional time period rafini and larocque 2012 2009 sui et al 2007 4 discussion 4 1 the hydraulic significance of multi stage sequences in most cases the natural responses obtained from field investigations display successions of several time periods with different values of n ferroud et al 2018 rafini 2008 such as illustrated in fig 1 the typical temporal interpretation of pumping test data stipulates that early stage responses are controlled by wellbore storage and skin effects mid stage responses are an expression of the aquifer properties and late stage responses mark the boundary effects e g leveinen 2001 2000 although these principles remain generally true the sequential interpretations discussed here make it possible to state that aquifer properties frequently provide multistage responses in themselves this is due to the existence of various types of major or minor diffuse heterogeneities or non uniformities within the aquifer that successively exert a dominant influence on the macroscale flow regime over various time periods the terms major and minor diffuse here are time dependent attributions as they relate to the ratio between the size of heterogeneities and the investigation scale i e the volume of depressurized aquifer that increases as pumping persists diffuse minor heterogeneity fields typically conceptualized as an unknown k x y z distribution function are not likely to modify the flow dimension unless they follow a scale invariance statistic function which brings us to the long debated fractal models discussed above cello et al 2009 walker et al 2006 these fields likely behave like continua after a critical pumping time range this occurs where the investigation scale exceeds that of single heterogeneities by a greater enough amount for those heterogeneities situated into the depressurized volume of aquifer constituting a statistically representative sample of the distribution function in other words the bulk conductivity stabilizes with scale conversely at a given pumping time and space the macroscale aquifer behavior may be influenced by some major heterogeneities or non uniformities whose magnitude of size is more or less equal to or greater than the investigation scale and hence of restricted number in such cases non uniform flow will be generated and a non radial flow regime will eventually settle such heterogeneities may be finite conductivity hydraulic objects with a contrasting topological dimension patch conduit fault matrix region or boundaries linearly or irregularly shaped single or multiple finite or infinite conductivity substratum inclination pinchout boundary lateral lithological domain with variable thickness or conductivity localized connections to other aquifers partially leaky strata etc it is worth noting that short lived flow regimes are more likely produced by the former heterogeneity type while the latter is prone to generating infinite acting regimes numerical simulations have shown that hydraulic objects ranging in sizes exceeding a meter or a decameter are likely being considered major at least during the restricted time range during which they exert a singular influence on flow geometry before the pumping investigation scale grows much greater than their own size rafini and larocque 2012 2009 during that period of time when they deterministically impact the aquifer response hydraulic objects must be explicitly conceptualized in the flow model their influence may then evolve over time as the scale of the investigation increases and they will eventually be better represented as belonging to a minor diffuse heterogeneity field an example is the 1 2 flow dimension sequence obtained from a sub metric fractures network doe 2002 the early linear stage reflects the influence of a single fracture connected to the wellbore hence influencing the drawdown response as though it were a major heterogeneity whose properties can be explicitly calculated the late radial regime occurs when a large portion of the network is depressurized behaving like a radial continuum it is a general rule that early time flow regimes after wellbore storage effects reflect the minor scale hydraulic conditions since a restricted flow domain is sampled depressurized while late flow regimes are the expression of larger scale bulk aquifer properties commonly considered more reliable for practical purposes at the extreme and somewhat schematically the early times likely inform on the porosity conditions fracture or interstitial porosity while the late times investigate the aquifer geometrical conditions leakage connections to other flow domains boundaries etc indeed an early linear flow regime undoubtedly points to the presence of secondary type porosity dominated by fractures while late time linear flow regime may indicate an elongated aquifer fluvial channel tabular reservoir the latter conceptual interpretation is more robust though if a radial regime occurs prior to the late linear one leading to the sequence 2 1 due to the theissian cylindrical diffusion before the sides of the channel are reached it rises from this observation that two factors are meaningful at the conceptual interpretation stage the time at which the flow regime occurs and its duration as said above flow regimes produced by transient interactions between hydraulic objects are more likely generating short lived regimes following the previous example the linear flow regime settling into an elongated aquifer is infinite acting which is not the case of any fracture related linear flow regime moreover a fault related linear flow regime cannot occur in late time since it is unrealistic that the fault s cross sectional surface could be predominant over the cross flow area evolving in the rest of the flow domain unless it is impermeable successive flow regimes may also correspond to various expressions of the same hydraulic object at different pumping times and spatial scales an example already mentioned above is the 1 2 sequence that may be conceptually interpreted as an euclidean conductive fracture network with early linear flow regime expressing sub meter scale pressure diffusion into a single fracture without matrix depressurization and later radial stage occurring when the volume of investigation scale is sizeable over the length of the fractures i e the network behaves like a continuum theoretically changes in flow regimes that relate to the attainment of new non uniformities flow domain distal fault top or bottom borders new conditions far field water supply etc may be succeeding each other in a perfectly independent fashion until the occurrence of drawdown stabilization aquifer de saturation or the end of pumping this leads to multistage responses for which each regime or sequence may be analyzed independently hammond and field 2014 4 2 influence of hydraulic domains with non equal flow and topological dimensions successive flow regimes express flow domains or objects that succeed each other in exerting a sensitive and predominant control on the macroscale aquifer response they successively govern the global transient diffusion mode of the front pulse in other words the exponent of eq 2 power law relationship in the example of the fault or fracture matrix system producing the flow dimension sequence 1 5 2 both stages correspond to time periods during which the fault and the matrix respectively exert a dominant control on the aquifer s response the two successive flow regimes are caused by a change in interactive mode between the two flow units fault and matrix produce pressure front pulse envelopes with respectively a pseudo disc shape a1 and cylinder shape a2 diffusing in different modes a1 r 0 5 a2 r such that their respective flow dimensions are 1 5 and 2 the macroscale flow dimension of the aquifer recorded at the pumping well is 1 5 then 2 each value expressing a time period during which the total surface a a1 a2 is controlled successively by a1 and then by a2 hence changing the eq 2 power law exponent and the flow dimension see rafini and larocque 2009 for a deeper demonstration this conducts to the general result that where flow units with different dimensions are present in the aquifer and produce surfaces a n growing at different power law rates with r the polynomial form of atotal σi ai σi ci r ni 1 is such that a single surface an predominates over others at a given pumping time and space due to this polynomial form in no circumstances may the resulting exponent of atotal r power law relationship be a combination of individual exponents ai r in other words the aquifer flow dimension can never be a mathematical combination product average etc of flow dimensions produced by individual hydraulic objects contrary to what may have been stated the flow dimension that is measured on a derivative signal is an apparent value reflecting the predominant flow behavior rather than a mean value of the flow dimensions related to hydraulic objects in the aquifer finally it is worth noting that the position of the well relative to the aquifer configuration is essential and may significantly influence the derivative signal and the n sequence for instance sui et al 2007 showed that if a well is close to the constant head boundary of an elongated aquifer the n sequence 2 4 3 occurs while if the well is far from the constant head boundary and the pressure front pulse reaches the lateral impermeable boundaries of the elongated aquifer before the constant head boundary the n sequence 2 1 3 will be observed 4 3 limitations 4 3 1 issue of non unique interpretations analyzing the drawdown log derivative signal helps to improve the interpretation of pumping tests by reducing the non uniqueness of the drawdown signatures however it remains that different flow behaviors can produce the same flow dimension for instance ferroud et al 2018 reported that the same flow dimension value can be observed in various geological contexts such as carbonate rock aquifers crystalline rock aquifers and alluvial deposits for instance they observed a linear flow regime in both fractured rock aquifers and alluvial deposits this study with its catalogue of flow regimes also emphasizes the issue of non unicity because various conceptual models may produce an identical flow dimension value for instance the spherical flow regime n 3 can be produced in a partially penetrated aquifer escobar et al 2012a moncada et al 2005 in an aquifer of increasing thickness is aquifer ferroud et al 2016 rafini et al 2014 and in a narrow aquifer influenced by a constant head boundary sui et al 2007 similarly the linear flow regime is produced by 1 an infinite hydraulic conductivity fracture gringarten et al 1974 gringarten and ramey 1975 2 a finite hydraulic conductivity fault or fracture abbaszadeh and cinco ley 1995 cinco ley et al 1978 cinco ley and samaniego v 1981b 3 an elongated aquifer escobar et al 2004c 4 an alluvial system micro cross flow in the sediment corbett et al 2012 and 5 a deltaic environment distributary channel system mijinyawa and gringarten 2008 analysing the sequence of flow regimes helps to choose an appropriate conceptual model by countering the non unicity of the derivative signal for instance the n sequence 2 3 2 expresses a partially penetrated aquifer whereas the n sequence 2 2 3 refers to an aquifer with an inclined substratum finally it is worth noting that conducting a proper aquifer interpretation requires a comprehensive approach in which the derivative response is analysed with respect to the geological environment field knowledge typically from geological or geophysical surface or log surveys in many instances may prove helpful in selecting between several non unique flow models which all fit the observed data 4 3 2 issue of the quality of derivative data and the subjectivity of interpretations 4 3 2 1 noise in data as mentioned previously the relevancy of the selection of the conceptual model is based on the quality of the derivative signal if the signal is too noisy the determination of the flow regimes will be uncertain and therefore the selection of the conceptual model doubtful deconvolution convolution algorithms are available to reduce noise induced by flow rate variations while differentiation algorithms are deemed efficient to reduce gaussian noise instrumental noise random diffuse heterogeneity see section 2 1 4 3 2 2 duration of the pumping test the longer the pumping test the larger the volume of aquifer that is investigated and therefore the more likely that a larger number of flow regimes will be detected it should be kept in mind that unless the hydraulic boundaries are reached the derivative signature is possibly not complete indeed if the pumping test is not long enough to detect all the sequences of the type curve or if drawdown data are missing or too noisy only one portion of the theoretical type curve is observed or detected for instance with the sequence n 1 5 2 we cannot conclude that the well is connected to the fault or fracture however the sequence 2 negative unit slope 1 5 2 makes it possible to detect the effect of a leaky vertical fault or fracture that is non connected to the source it is thus important to combine the analysis of the derivative signal with all the available field information liang et al 2012 massonnat and bandiziol 1991 once the relevant conceptual model is chosen the hydraulic properties may be estimated 4 3 2 3 determination of the flow regimes the determination of flow dimensions by analysing straight lines in the derivative signal presents several challenges the derivative signal must attain a real stabilization in some cases transitional flow regimes may be observed over a long duration due for instance to a low hydraulic conductivity when aquifers are very heterogeneous it is possible that the derivative signal may never become stable thus expressing only transitional stages as stated by beauheim et al 2004 and rafini et al 2017 a proper estimation of the flow dimension should be determined from a constant straight line of the derivative signal that lasts at least one log cycle the interpretation of flow regimes uses successive linear regressions on derivative straight lines into several time windows the recognition of these time windows and the confidence these provide in the interpretation of flow dimensions remains a sensitive aspect of the approach that may in some cases still present some uncertainties if the effects of pumping rate changes have not been removed from the derivative signal a manual interpretation is recommended rather than any automated process that optimizes regression coefficients indeed the quality of regressions is not the only component of a proper interpretation of flow regimes a manual analysis of derivative data makes it possible to identify pumping rate interruptions or changes to award less weight or significance to certain noisy sections presenting obviously increased data instability either instrumental due to a localized highly diffuse heterogeneity field or other sources furthermore the manual interpreter may benefit from derivative differentiation without being misled by it in other words to stick to raw data we finally submit that a simultaneous fit on both s and ds dlogt significantly contributes to reducing the level of subjectivity when interpreting flow regimes 4 4 summary of the proposed methodology the proposed methodology consists in 1 pre processing the data in order to correct the variable rate drawdown into constant rate drawdown and to reduce the noise by using deconvolution convolution and or differentiation codes if data pre processing is not possible the recognition of various noise types such as pump arrests instabilities or imprecise drawdown manual measurement is recommended 2 identifying the flow regimes as successive straight lines on the log log plot of the derivative response specific attention must be paid to the stability of the slope and the critical duration of the slope stable segment it is important to keep in mind that as the pressure front pulse propagates the volume of depressurized aquifer increases and thus the scale of detected heterogeneity increases 3 fitting with real data the determination of the flow dimension is improved by simultaneously fitting the signal segments of s and ds dlogt respectively on a semi log and on a bi log plot this approach combines the advantages of both plots the semi log plot of s globally is less noisy whereas the bi log plot of ds dlogt is very sensitive to both pumping rate changes and flow regime variations this combined fitting of s and ds dlogt increases the objectivity of the flow dimension determination specifically when data pre processing is not efficient or the derivative signal is noisy for instance when the derivative signal is noisy it is sometimes difficult to confidently adjust the vertical position of the straight line in such cases adjusting the s signal on a semi log plot proves very helpful note that the combined approach may be assisted by manually or automatically optimizing the correlation coefficients independently into each segment and on both plots 4 choosing a conceptual model because several conceptual models may produce a same derivative signal it is important to have some information about the geological settings liang et al 2012 massonnat and bandiziol 1991 in addition as explained previously analysing the sequence of flow regimes will help to attenuate the non unicity of the derivative signal 5 doing extra geological studies if possible consider doing extra studies to determine the nature and the configuration of the heterogeneity such as geophysical surveys e g georadar time domain electromagnetic method seismic methods or drilling e g to investigate a buried esker etc 5 conclusion this contribution deciphers the methodology that consists in using the sequential analysis of flow dimensions for the interpretation of pumping test data in complex aquifers the relevance of performing hydraulic investigations in real aquifers using models with variable degrees of idealization has been discussed and the need for innovative tools able to model more complex flow conditions was mentioned our sequential interpretative methodology was described in detail this paper provides an exhaustive review of diagnostic responses and their associated conceptual models which have been published in the hydrogeology and petroleum industry literature ferroud et al 2018 demonstrated that non radial behaviors are generally predominant in natural aquifer responses to transient pump tests in various geological environments they noted that common drawdown interpretations are not capable of accurately representing the transient geometry of flow occurring in aquifers as non radial flow models remain seldom used and still insufficient to explain fractional flow behaviors such conclusions tell us that continued research efforts should be devoted to the flow dimension approach the fact that the flow dimension theory remains valid beyond grf aquifer conditions must now be considered a consensual premise in this view further works should focus on 1 identifying the multistage dimensional responses of various types of complex irregular and realistic aquifer conditions from numerical experiments on synthetic objects along with field verification 2 investigating flow dimensional responses from multi well datasets i e constraining the spatial distribution of this parameter in various types of heterogeneous flow configurations 3 last but not least understanding the still enigmatic fractional flow regimes which are extensively reported in nature ferroud et al 2018 rafini 2008 most research efforts focused on fractal approaches which remain unsatisfactory in many geological contexts and did not prove successful in providing conclusive outcomes in spite of the negative effects of this unfruitful avenue on the perceptions some researchers have had regarding flow dimension analysis we submit that this approach still has the potential of providing significant and substantial future advances in the field of interpretation of complex aquifers similar in significance to bourdet s breakthrough derivative approach published in the 1980 s this first contribution is a qualitative study first of all it aims at summarizing in the most exhaustive way conceptual models based on both analytical solutions and numerical frameworks codes available to interpret vertical constant rate pumping tests secondly it organizes the conceptual models around a single hydrodynamic and interpretative framework based on the flow dimension parameter a second contribution is forecasted this time in the form of a quantitative study with a review

8618,today it is still common practice to analyse pumping tests assuming theissian conditions resulting in interpretations that are at best grossly approximated if not erroneous with potentially negative impacts on the quality of water resource management over the last several decades numerous technological advances in hydrogeology have been developed that make it possible to perform more realistic analyses of heterogeneous non purely theissian flow systems e g aquifers with non uniform geometry and or hydraulic properties for this study a catalog of available behavioral flow models was compiled from the literature and consolidated into a unique interpretative scheme this is based on two first order flow modelling breakthrough developments derived from research works the derivative analysis bourdet et al 1983 and the flow dimension theory barker 1988 each derivative type curve is segmented and converted into a sequence of stable flow dimensions in order to integrate a large panel of models into a comprehensive conceptual hydrodynamic and interpretative framework this allowed us to conduct a thorough discussion on a range of different hydraulic conditions and their associated most common responses to constant rate pump tests namely the linear bilinear radial and spherical flow regimes and various sequential combinations of these elementary flow regimes the relevance of the catalogued behavioral flow models is examined based on the realism of their postulates and on their frequency of occurrence in the field the proposed diagnostic methodology makes it possible to further refine the interpretation of pumping tests and to routinely detect complex aquifer conditions keywords transient tests flow dimension diagnostic plots numerical modeling non theis aquifers 1 introduction groundwater resources are subjected to growing pressure due to increasing population industrial development and climate changes the decline in water quality and or quantity is becoming an issue of global concern behmel et al 2016 applied hydrogeology must cope with new scientific and environmental issues related to sustainability management of resources stricter water quality legislation and emerging industrial activities such as geothermal energy radionuclide in situ repositioning and carbon sequestration groundwater investigation tools are being called upon to respond to these new concerns they should have the capability of providing more precise routine assessments of the hydraulic properties of real aquifers this challenge in many instances requires an understanding of their complex heterogeneous non uniform or discontinuous nature it appears evident that more hydrogeology research is needed to develop more precise aquifer modeling tools for practitioners the issue is not only to improve the quantitative estimation of the bulk hydraulic properties of aquifers but also to develop realistic qualitative conceptualizations of heterogeneous flow conditions the analytical flow models that are commonly used today are overly simplified with a high degree of idealization which makes it impossible to realistically represent the complexity of aquifers in nature this leads to gross assessments of the hydraulic properties of aquifers although it appears that customary practices in modeling are slowly changing most hydrogeology practitioners are still interpreting most cases of constant rate pumping tests by matching theoretical type curves obtained from theis 1935 and theis derived models cooper and jacob 1946 merely by routinely fitting these type curves practitioners are positing that pumping tests produce a cylindrical radial flow regime in an infinite acting radial flow iarf model thus ignoring in most cases the flow regime that is really occurring within the aquifer indeed numerous studies audouin et al 2008 ferroud et al 2018 kuusela lahtinen et al 2003 leveinen 2000 lods and gouze 2004 maréchal et al 2004 odling et al 2013 verbovšek 2011 2009 have reported from field investigations that the flow regimes occurring in real media are actually much more complex and diversified than what is modeled by the simple theis derived cylindrical radial flow regime ferroud et al 2018 observed that 88 of 69 pumping tests exhibited multi stage derivative signatures and 69 of 121 interpreted flow regimes were non radial the database was composed of constant rate pumping tests performed in various geological settings despite this all of the compiled tests had been interpreted by practitioners using the theis cooper jacob cj models in cases where flow regimes are in actual fact non radial applying an overly idealized interpretation model would lead to serious consequences among which are the following ferroud 2018 ferroud et al 2018 le borgne et al 2004 rafini et al 2017 1 simplifying the behaviour of the system to an extreme degree and disregarding the real geometry of flow 2 ignoring the presence of several 1d 2d or 3d hydraulic objects with non equal properties which may actually be governing the aquifer s global hydrodynamics at various pumping times 3 in low conductivity contexts overestimating the hydraulic properties of the pumped domain and missing the presence of distal and or discrete conductive domains which may be exerting a predominant role in supplying water to the well over some pumping time windows 4 missing the presence of partial or non uniform boundaries or erroneously interpreting hydraulic frontiers that are non existent 5 globally dismissing most of the diagnostic potential of the time drawdown signal 6 poorly assessing the impact of the disruption that is applied to the aquifer leading to erroneous delineation of water productive wellhead protection areas erroneous estimates of sustainable pumping rates etc it should be noted that in this study the term flow regime refers to a specific form of transient drawdown response of the aquifer to pumping it does not relate to the laminar versus turbulent flow conditions as defined by the reynold number as mentioned by ferroud et al 2018 when applying a model which assumes a flow regime outside the bounds of the real flow regime observed during the pumping test this leads to an erroneous estimation of hydraulic properties these authors presented numerical examples where applying the theis model to interpret a derivative signal with a linear flow regime and a spherical flow regime respectively led to overestimating k by 89 and to underestimated k by 100 several pioneering publications bourdet et al 1983 chow 1952 tiab and kumar 1980a have introduced advances in the interpretation of transient tests by analyzing the drawdown log derivative time series ds dlogt more commonly referred to in the petroleum literature as the pressure derivative t dp dt the drawdown log derivative time series analysis was early recognized as a major improvement in pumping test interpretation due to its drastically enhanced sensibility to flow conditions allowing for the detection of various forms of non uniform heterogeneous or bounded reservoirs gringarten 2008 the gain in diagnostic potential is illustrated by the following theoretical examples where the derivative analysis makes it possible to avoid certain misinterpretations of hydraulic boundary which would have resulted from the use of the cooper jacob drawdown semi log plot approach ehlig economides 1988 i a linear flow regime succeeding a prior radial flow regime generates an increase of drawdown rate that may be misinterpreted as a no flow boundary ferroud et al 2018 ii an aquifer with an inclined substratum is or two contiguous aquifers both induce a strong decrease of drawdown rate after various durations of pumping time pseudo stabilisation that may be misinterpreted as a constant head boundary rafini et al 2017 numerous analytically derived predictive behavioral models have been proposed in the literature providing a panel of derivative type curves related to various forms of well and reservoir conditions the diagnostic plots approach renard 2005 calls upon these models to diagnose hydraulic conditions by means of a two step analysis 1 firstly a qualitative diagnosis where the appropriate conceptual model is selected based on the similarity between observed and theoretical signals and 2 secondly a quantitative diagnosis where the aquifer s specific hydraulic parameters are derived from matching the observed response to the selected model s type curves generally using best fitting codes gringarten 1987a kuusela lahtinen et al 2003 leveinen et al 1998 verbovšek 2009 this type curve matching approach as initially introduced by walton 1962 was criticized by mattar 1999 for its lack of precision mattar and tiab alternatively proposed a sequential analysis in which the derivative signal is decomposed into a sequence of straight lines that are interpreted separately from each other as successive flow regimes mattar 1999 tiab 1995 1994 1993a 1993b 1993c 1993d 1989 based on this sequential analysis approach the tiab s direct synthesis tds makes it possible to graphically estimate the hydraulic properties of the aquifer using the slopes intercepts starting and ending times of ds dlogt plot on a bilog graph on this graph a straight derivative response implies from a hydrodynamic standpoint that the flow dimension parameter n is constant since n is defined for drawdown recorded at the pumping well and after very short pumping times by n 2 1 p where p is the slope of ds dlogt on a bilog plot note that the term flow regime has a broader sense than the concept of flow dimension flow dimension does not apply to every type of flow regime for instance it does not apply to wellbore storage flow regimes fundamentally the flow dimension theory strictly applies to any stable flow regime where the barker s basic power law relationship is verified see below eq 2 finally in this paper some flow regimes with constant derivative slopes are transcribed into flow dimension values despite the fact that they do not satisfy this condition for the purpose of methodological consistency e g constant pressure boundary effect applying the flow dimension theory to mattar s straight derivative analysis provides us with a general hydrodynamic conceptual framework this framework stipulates that n at any time and space in the flow domain represents the transient evolution of the shape of the pressure front pulse that is diffusing throughout the aquifer during pumping barker 1988 doe 1991 note that this theory has been shown to be rather universal with validity ranges extending beyond the strict postulates of barkers grf model rafini et al 2017 rafini and larocque 2009 as explained in the following chapter any stabilization of the flow dimension reflects a hydrodynamic stabilization during the transient test which implies a spatial temporal window where hydraulic conditions are unchanging and the reservoir s governing parameters t and s are constant in natural media most derivative responses obtained from constant rate tests are composed of a sequence of several segments with stable flow dimensions as reported by ferroud et al 2018 from various geological environments when the values of the flow dimension change this reflects changing hydraulic conditions as the cross flow surface extends throughout the flow domain to a certain extent these changes provide a scan of aquifer conditions in heterogeneous aquifers complex signatures are produced whose interpretation is not necessarily possible using conventional type curve matching methods this article is a review of diverse analyses and interpretations of flow regimes proposed in both the petroleum and the hydrogeological literature the majority of oil and gas articles address the flow regime analysis by recognizing specific ds dlogt slopes without using the flow dimension parameter this review converts the flow regime slopes into flow dimension values and sorts these values into various hydrodynamic signatures emphasis is placed on considering the sequences of several flow regimes that when combined are predicted to represent various specific hydraulic conditions based on a review of petroleum engineering and hydrogeology research and authors we submit a catalog of certain specific conceptual flow models that have been associated with certain specific flow regimes or sequences of flow regimes the hydrodynamics of each conceptual model is explained in regards to the fundamental relationship between n and the transient geometry of the front pulse as it propagates into the flow domain this article is a current state of the art review of advanced analysis methodologies that combine the derivative signatures and the flow dimension sequences for the interpretation of aquifers however in this paper only the qualitative part of this substantial task is presented which amounts to cataloguing the conceptual models the quantitative part which consists in harmonizing the equations associated with these models is not within the scope of this article the submitted methodology is no more difficult to apply and does not require more data than a conventional pumping test analysis although it holds dramatically greater potential this article proposes the use of our methodology as a powerful diagnostic tool to improve accuracy in hydrogeological and petroleum studies first we describe and discuss in detail the concepts of flow dimension and sequential analysis we then review the known conceptual models distinguishing between mono and multi stage models finally we discuss the submitted methodology including advanced topics and limitations such as the issue of non unique interpretations 2 background 2 1 data processing and denoising of the derivative signal the interpretation of a derivative signal may be compromised by poor data quality nobakht and mattar 2009 roumboutsos and stewart 1988 since the time series is highly sensitive to any subtle drawdown variation it frequently appears noisy due to various factors including operational imprecision pumping rate fluctuations kuchuk 1990 wind effects earth tides barometric fluctuations or precipitation to cope with these problems and to avoid misinterpretations in the recognition of real flow regimes pre processing and smoothing of data are often required first it is suggested to remove the outliers nobakht and mattar 2009 secondly an algorithm is applied to correct the derivative signal for pumping rate adjustments and or wellbore storage various algorithms have been proposed to this end in the literature e g convolution deconvolution variational regularization multirate ideally the drawdown and the pumping rate are simultaneously measured in order to correct the derivative signal for pumping rate fluctuations convolution is a mathematical operation applied to two functions a flow rate function and an impulse response this produces a third function the wellbore pressure or drawdown the impulse response represents the theoretical pressure response for a specific conceptual model which is mostly based on a radial flow regime in other words the convolution integral produces the wellbore pressure as a forward problem using the measured flow rate data and the constant rate pressure behavior of the system based on the duhamel principle of superposition duhamel 1833 kuchuk et al 2010 various convolution algorithms are available in the literature for instance the pressure pressure convolution uses different pressure or drawdown data recorded at two different spatial locations in order to interpret a pressure signal lacking a flow rate measurement or with an unreliable flow rate denney 2003 onur et al 2004 the limit of the convolution method is that it needs to assume a conceptual model convolution overwhelmingly postulates a radial flow regime which is grossly suitable in most real world tests as explained above roumboutsos and stewart 1988 conversely deconvolution is an algorithm based process that aims at finding the solution of a convolution equation deconvolution is an inverse method that reconstructs an equivalent constant rate drawdown response in other words the variable rate drawdown is converted into an extrapolated equivalent constant rate drawdown this processing has the advantage that it does not need to assume a specific conceptual model the deconvolution method corrects the rate altered data and transforms it into constant rate data which makes more data available for the interpretation gringarten 2010 in addition the deconvolution process allows more accurate and unique interpretations it reduces the non uniqueness of a well test interpretation by reducing the uncertainties of observed data and also by reducing the multitude of possible derivative signatures that fit to observed noisy data cumming et al 2013 deconvolution also helps in identifying the conceptual model gringarten 2008 von schroeter et al 2001 and produces much better estimations of hydraulic properties and boundary conditions by producing clearer transformed derivative data gringarten 2008 in the time between the publication of the papers by kuchuk and ayestaran 1985 and stewart et al 1983 which introduced the process of deconvolution to the petroleum industry and today many deconvolution algorithms have been proposed in the petroleum literature using different operational techniques e g analytical deconvolutions discrete numerical deconvolution without measurement noise deconvolution with constraints nonlinear least squares pressure rate deconvolution among others obeahon et al 2014 onur and kuchuk 2012 pimonov et al 2010 von schroeter et al 2001 for more details about convolution and deconvolution codes the reader is invited to read the review of kuchuk et al 2010 it should be noted that deconvolution algorithms cannot reconstruct the drawdown data if the pumping test is influenced by some interferences from other wells nearby or if the aquifer is influenced by leakage effects wang 2010 various differentiation algorithms have been used to increase the signal noise ratio of derivative time series escobar et al 2004a b c evaluated the performance of seven algorithms bourdet clarck horne simons spline van golf racht first degree and second degree polynomials and concluded that the spline bourdet and horne functions are the most suitable to analyze derivative data recently ramos et al 2017 proposed a variational regularization method based on frequency filtering during a hydraulic test drawdown data may also be affected by other factors such as recharge atmospheric pressure changes tidal influences or interference from other pumping wells these hydraulic disturbances are more likely to be observed on drawdown signals during long term pumping tests various codes have been proposed in the literature to correct cyclic tide induced head fluctuations by using sinusoidal functions carr and van der kamp 1969 erskine 1991 ferris 1952 or the superposition principle chapuis et al 2006 because the groundwater level fluctuation of the taipei basin is induced by the periodic loading of the overlying river water caused by the tidal influence ni et al 2013 proposed to use the hilbert huang transform huang et al 1998 additionally various methods have been proposed to correct the barometric pressure effects on confined and unconfined aquifer datasets a review of these methods is proposed by spane 1999 in cases where several pumping wells are operated simultaneously the drawdown analysis must decipher their interferences by using the superposition principle and image wells theory such context is beyond the scope of this review which focuses on single pumping test responses finally the issue of head level variations induced by natural recharge during long duration pumping tests remains poorly assessed it may be forecasted that such effects exert an influence on the drawdown record and on the calculated flow dimension during very late time as the drawdown rate induced by pumping becomes very low and ultimately negligible drawdown stabilisation numerical modeling may help to address this issue in further works 2 2 background of the flow dimension sequential analysis 2 2 1 the log derivative analysis over the last three decades it has been routine practice for oil and gas theoreticians and practitioners to use the logarithmic derivative log derivative pressure time series to analyze flow conditions in natural reservoirs after pioneering works by bourdet et al 1983 mattar and zaoral 1992 and tiab and kumar 1980b the log derivative analysis was first introduced into the hydrogeology literature by chow 1952 and refined by karasaki et al 1988 spane and wurstner 1993 and spane 1993 and has since remained in the theoretical realm however a recently growing interest is to be noted avci et al 2013 beauheim et al 2004 bowman et al 2012 cheng and ni 2009 dewandel et al 2011 gringarten 2008 hammond and field 2014 onur et al 2007 ramos et al 2017 renard et al 2009 samani et al 2006 sun et al 2015 xiao and xu 2014 the bilogarithmic projection of the drawdown log derivative versus time makes it possible to distinguish between changes in flow regime caused by subtle variations in aquifer conditions e g issaka and ambastha 1999 changes that are less visible on drawdown only plots in fig 1 the late flow regime is identified and characterized by a change in the log derivative slope the drawdown only response only makes it possible to diagnose a departure from the early theis function or eventually to fit a theis function to the late stage which would be inappropriate as the derivative signal clearly indicates that this is a non radial flow regime the slope is different from 0 the change in flow regime reflects changes in aquifer conditions in a generic fashion at distance from the pumping well in this case this may be related to the influence of a fault or a variously fractured domain disconnected from the well the principle of universally interpreting various types of flow regimes from bilog plots of the drawdown log derivative vs time was formalized by bourdet et al 1983 other classic diagnostic plots include s log s or log ds dlog t vs log t 0 5 or log t 0 25 where distinct diagrams were used for identifying specific flow regimes for reviews on the approaches see bourdet 2002 gringarten 2008 kruseman and de ridder 1994 renard et al 2009 and verweij 1995 notably renard et al 2009 effectively promoted the analysis of the ds dlogt signal in hydrogeology by highlighting its helpfulness in providing more detailed aquifer interpretations recently some research works have submitted the β derivative signal which is the derivative of the logarithm of the drawdown with respect to the logarithm of time plotted on a bilog plot eq 1 hosseinpour zonoozi 2006 idorenyin et al 2011 ilk et al 2007 shahamat et al 2015 this β analysis is not expected to replace the derivative analysis but it is another tool that provides a unique characterization of flow regimes with a power law function such as wellbore storage reservoir boundaries with either a closed aquifer circle rectangle etc with 2 parallel faults or with 3 perpendicular faults or in fractured media with either an infinite conductivity vertical fracture or a finite conductivity vertical fracture hosseinpour zonoozi 2006 1 dlog s dlog t 1 s t ds dt 2 2 2 the sequential interpretation the sequential approach consists in identifying successive flow regimes occurring over the duration of a constant rate pumping test a critical issue is now raised what is the proper identification of what is called a flow regime at a given pumping time the derivative response may either reflect the occurrence of a real settled and constant flow regime in the aquifer or a transition between two successive flow regimes for instance the numerical modeling conducted by rafini and larocque 2012 showed that a non connected well located close to a vertical finite conductivity fault produces a derivative signal composed of several successive flow regimes appearing in this order radial transition bilinear the radial and bilinear flow regimes relate to the diffusion of the pressure front pulse throughout the matrix and the leaky fault while the transition stage does not reflect any of the properties of the aquifer strictly speaking in order to correctly identify a stable flow regime the derivative data must exhibit a straight line which implies that flow conditions are hydrodynamically stable under the influence of some hydraulic objects whose properties may be calculated a flow regime transition in most cases is a short time period during which several heterogeneities are interacting in an inconsistent manner thus generating unsettled hydrodynamic conditions we submit that the two following primary criteria are required to confidently derive a flow regime the stability of n derivative straight line and its duration which must be of at least one log cycle beauheim et al 2004 where derivative straight segments are shorter than one log cycle it is not possible to reliably infer unique hydraulic properties finally there remains the risk that some long duration transitional stages may still verify these criteria leading to misinterpretation however in our experience these long duration transitional stages generate characteristic sub linear or hyperspherical flow regimes the flow dimension theory barker 1988 corroborates tiab s and mattar s approach as it predicts that the slope of a pumping well drawdown derivative time series will stabilize after very early pumping time corresponding to the asymptotic portion of barker s grf model due to its homogeneous continuous and infinite acting flow idealization the grf predicts a unique constant slope segment in nature many cases produce a series of several straight segments ferroud et al 2018 the concept of flow dimension diagnostic plots was later introduced by beauheim et al 2004 and beauheim and roberts 1998 this concept merges the flow dimension theory with the straight line sequential analysis promoted by tiab and mattar pressure derivative time series are decomposed into sequences of flow regimes marked by constant flow dimensions that can be either sublinear n 1 linear n 1 bilinear n 1 5 radial n 2 spherical n 3 hyperspherical n 3 or fractional n is a non integer positive and negative unit slopes also are commonly identified which are classically interpreted as representing internal and external hydraulic boundaries rather than flow dimensions but may also represent transient behaviors theoretically unrestricted multi stage responses i e several successive distinct flow regimes can be analyzed and interpreted as a succession of stable hydraulic conditions occurring in the aquifer as the pulse scans through it these distinct conditions reflect the temporary predominance of various hydraulic objects boundaries non uniformities or any heterogeneities on the aquifer response the identification of a sequence of flow regimes essentially constitutes a hydraulic diagnosis for instance in fig 1 the n sequence is 2 1 18 the process of determining the sequence of flow regimes makes it possible to then proceed to a qualitative interpretation of these regimes this consists in selecting the appropriate conceptual flow model s considering the knowledge of the hydrogeological context in many cases the hydraulic properties associated with the successive aquifer conditions may then be quantified using the conceptual flow models that are reviewed in this article however this process presents two important limitations we lack understanding of several specific flow regimes and associations of flow regimes also certain conceptual models predict similar flow dimensions leading to the so called issue of non unique diagnostics this last problem is partially attenuated by studying the sequences of flow dimensions as a whole rather than separately 2 2 3 hydrodynamic framework of the flow dimension theory based on the grf model barker 1988 the flow dimension n represents the area a formed by the depressurization front pulse cross flow area through the following power law relationship eq 2 2 a r r n 1 where r is the distance traveled by the pressure front pulse starting from the source because r is a function of time t this equation can be written as a t α r t n 1 where r t refers to the diffusive regime under normal fickian diffusive conditions r α t 0 5 which yields a t α t n 1 2 as a premise our conception of the flow dimension is that from a hydrodynamic perspective it directly represents the temporal evolution of the cross flow area during the hydraulic test in such a manner that when the depressurization front around a pumping well expands outward over time it encounters hydraulic heterogeneities of various natures and topological dimensions irregularly shaped boundaries faults channels connections to other aquifers etc that modify flow conditions and that will influence the observed flow dimension this behavior is expected both in hard rock aquifers that typically consist of complex discontinuous geometries and in granular aquifers which are characterized by internal complexities and relatively short scale hydraulic compartmentalization e g fluvial and alluvial sediments corbett et al 2012 this conception of the flow dimension fundamentally diverges from the common premise that this parameter reflects some specific and non trivial scheme of scaling invariance of the hydraulic properties see discussion below in this section and in section 3 10 for multi well sets rafini 2008 submitted that a general homogeneous response may be sought by using bilog plots with grf normalized derivative data d s r 2 n dlogt versus standard normalized time t r 2 in systems inducing successive flow regimes with different flow dimensions these normalized plots must be analyzed independently for each flow regime a deeper explanation of the flow dimensional analysis of multi well datasets brings us to the complex issue of the spatial homogeneity of flow dimensions at the scale of a pumping field which is beyond the scope of this article flow regimes with n 1 linear flow represent one dimensional pressure transfers restricted to corridors in such a manner that the lateral propagation of the cross flow area a is prevented for instance parallel flow lines in a long and narrow system thus a remains constant a r 1 1 in the case of n 2 a radial flow the cross flow area proportionally varies with r the simplest radial flow case is the cylinder shaped cross flow area of the classical theis aquifer a 2πr note that radial flow does not necessarily imply a cylindrical theis type flow it simply means that a r any value of n different from 2 is referred to as non radial flow the case of n 3 corresponds to a spherical flow regime with the simplest form being a sphere shaped cross flow area a 4πr2 again a spherical flow regime does not automatically imply sphere shaped cross flow surfaces and a r2 may result from other flow conditions e g a variable thickness aquifer as explained below non integer values of the flow dimension are referred to as fractional flow behaviors which can be induced by any hydraulic or geometric structure where flow area changes by a non integer power of distance fig 2 presents a summary of published theoretical flow regimes and their associated flow dimensions n the flow dimension is not an intrinsic property of an aquifer because it results from the combined effects of aquifer conditions and the topological dimension of the source the source is cylindrical in conventional well test cases but spherical point source in packer test configurations or when the screen length is very short in comparison to the aquifer thickness escobar et al 2012a moncada et al 2005 in an ideal continuous homogeneous and infinite acting grf aquifer n is governed by the dimension of the source barker 1988 conversely even if the source is cylindrical the presence of many types of large scale heterogeneities generate flow regime changes whereby the flow dimension is modified not all heterogeneity types produce flow dimension changes in order for such a change to occur the fundamental power law relationship between the front pulse area and the distance it travels from the source eq 2 must be modified in a stable manner moreover the influence of heterogeneities on the drawdown response is equally tempered by the size of the heterogeneity and its distance to the pumping well a small scale discontinuity such as a single joint located near the pumping well can alter an aquifer s response to a pumping test as drastically as a major multi kilometer fault zone located far from the well the former case affects the early time response whereas the latter affects late time stages this phenomenon is governed by the heterogeneity scale relative to the volume of the depressurized portion of the aquifer supplying the well i e the size of the cone of depression when interpreting a conceptual model using drawdown data it is important to remember that the heterogeneity dimensions are directly related to the absolute log time of their occurrence on drawdown curves the most significant contribution of the grf model lies in the theory of the flow dimension which provides a universal formulation of the relationships between the expansion rate of the transmissive area a depressurization front and drawdown rate variations drawdown log derivative slope while analytical models based on the assumption of a radial flow regime imply a linear expansion mode and a constant drawdown log rate during the pumping test n 2 the flow dimension theory widens the pumping test interpretation to non linear expansion modes and non constant drawdown log rates n 2 and n 2 respectively represent flow regimes with increasing and decreasing drawdown log rates as a function of pumping time purely from the standpoint of groundwater management n 2 and n 2 hence reflect respectively poor potential and high potential aquifers the flow dimension analysis substantially expands the interpretative framework and diversity of real flow responses that can be modeled allowing for a lesser degree of idealization and a higher degree of accuracy in representing real aquifer complexity from a physical standpoint the grf model proposes a relatively restrictive vision of the flow dimension due to strong hydraulic and geometrical assumptions a grf aquifer is continuous homogeneous and laterally infinite and the flow geometry forms an n dimension symmetrical pattern around the source which is in itself n dimensional thus in theory n remains constant during the entire transient test although mathematically robust this model contains several physical paradoxes that have been subject to debate including the meaninglessness of non integer dimension sources which explains why the n parameter has seldom found a practical use despite its powerful potential it quickly became obvious that the flow dimension theory which posits a relationship between the drawdown rate at time t and the cross flow area expansion rate at distance r t from the pumping well is a rather universal law extending beyond the strict postulates stated by barker 1988 namely where the dimensionality of flow is not only governed by the dimensionality of the source beginning with doe 1991 several authors have explored this avenue for decades notably deciphering the use of n for drawdown interpretations in fractured network aquifers that were pumped via a conventional two dimensional source e g jourde et al 2002a b kuusela lahtinen et al 2003 leveinen 2000 leveinen et al 1998 more recently rafini and larocque 2009 noted the versatility of the flow dimension theory by quantitatively verifying that the n 1 5 fractional flow regime obtained from numerical flow simulations in a vertical conductive fault embedded in an aquifer occurred in accordance with the fundamental definition of n given in eq 2 although such discontinuum lies by definition outside of the grf assumptions rafini and larocque 2009 quantified the growth of the cross flow area a r induced by transient interactions between the hydraulic units the fault and the aquifer and confirmed that a r grows following a power law relationship with an exponent equal to 0 5 this value corresponds using eq 2 to a flow dimension equal to 1 5 thus corroborating the flow dimension as calculated from drawdown log derivative slope 0 25 expanding barker s concept doe 1991 found that the flow dimension relates to the evolution of the transmissivity as a function of distance r that may actually correspond either to a purely geometrical expansion of the cross flow surface restricted by the geometry of some constant conductivity conduits embedded into a no flow matrix non space filling case of doe 1991 or to a sole conductivity increase space filling case of doe 1991 or to a combination of both the former i e the power law increase of the cross flow section of some constant conductivity conduits was later numerically simulated by bowman et al 2012 the latter i e the power law conductivity increase case has long been debated through the grf derived fractal models acuna and yortsos 1995 chang and yortsos 1990 walker et al 2006 3 review of flow dimensions with known conceptual models the quality of the hydrodynamic analysis and the accuracy of the estimation of an aquifer s hydraulic properties depend on the relevance of the selection of an appropriate conceptual model to interpret the pumping test signatures this section presents an extensive catalog table 1 of conceptual flow models in various types of non uniform aquifers these models have been published by numerous authors over several decades of research in the fields of petroleum engineering and water resources the predicted theoretical behaviors are displayed in terms of flow dimension sequences the majority of these models were developed by analytically resolving the diffusivity problem according to various hydraulic and geometrical postulates the remaining minority are empirical models derived from numerical experiments in the opinion of the authors these approaches both are relevant for the theoretical investigation of predictive flow responses each has its respective strengths and weaknesses while the empirical numerical approach is criticized for its generalization that is deemed to be difficult to constrain it has the major advantage of allowing the representation of complex 3 dimensional flow systems in a realistic fashion i e weaker geometrical idealisation of flow on the contrary the analytical approach commonly involves strong simplifying premises on the flow problem for mathematical suitability purposes which also impact the generalization often poorly addressed in most cases these postulates come to either simplifying the geometry of flow and boundaries internal or external and or to splitting and recombining the complex flow problem into several solvable forms restricted to some time or space domains to conclude the manner with which the problem is formulated strongly commands in itself the flow response of the analytical model leading to models bounded by editorial choices rather than universal compiling these models made it possible to perform a thorough review and discussion of the different approaches used by the authors to conceptualize the hydrodynamics associated with the various flow regimes 3 1 the linear flow regime n 1 the flow dimension n 1 implies a cross flow area that remains practically constant as the pressure wave travels through the aquifer although commonly interpreted as the response produced by a fracture the linear regime can also take place in any channelized narrow alluvial or fractured context when diagnosed over very short time frames i e when the volume of depressurized aquifer is low meter scale a linear flow regime can represent a small scale measuring one meter or less conductive fracture in the close vicinity of the pumping well this is due to the high diffusivity of the fracture and the consequent rapid propagation of the depressurization front compared to the embedding matrix which is nearly non depressurized at very early stages here the matrix drawdown diffusion surrounding the fracture is so small compared with diffusion in the fracture that the cross flow area propagating into the matrix remains negligible compared to the fracture s section the total cross flow area a hence remains practically equal to the fracture s section generating a linear regime with respect to eq 2 the association commonly made between linear flow responses and larger aquifer scale vertical fractures embedded in a less conductive matrix is based on analytical solutions by gringarten et al 1974 and cinco ley and samaniego v 1981a however this interpretation is non unique as explained above the proper interpretation of an aquifer scale fault would require the association of this signal with a subsequent n 1 5 stage 1 1 5 sequence table 1 cell 9 which is a much more unequivocal response as explained in sections below two different types of linear flow regimes indicating the presence of a fracture have been proposed in the petroleum literature fig 3 a b gringarten et al 1974 solved a matrix related linear flow problem developing around a vertical fracture which is infinitely conductive fig 3b in this linear flow model the pressure along the fracture is constant and uniform leading to the fracture acting as a vertical planar source pressure gradients develop in the matrix surrounding the fracture and generate one directional flow perpendicular to the fracture afterwards cinco ley et al 1978 and cinco ley and samaniego v 1981a solved a fault related linear flow problem occurring prior to the bilinear n 1 5 see below flow regime into finite conductivity aquifer scale fractures or fault zones by contrast this linear flow regime posits that the depressurization practically is restricted to the vertical fracture or the fault zone and does penetrate the matrix only negligibly fig 3a this flow configuration is similar from a hydrodynamic standpoint to that described in the previous section for submetric fractures the cross flow area penetrating into the matrix is negligible in comparison to the fracture s section which therefore is the predominant cross flow area leading to the linear flow top and bottom limits must be reached such that drawdown propagation is strictly horizontal and one dimensional in the fracture such flow conditions may occur in natural cases where temporary flow restriction into the fracture occurs either due to a high diffusivity contrast i e a practically impermeable matrix or to a very strong skin effect delaying pressure transfers to the embedding matrix the latter could possibly be due to mineral precipitations on the fault s rock walls there are two different types of tectonically induced hydraulic objects occurring in hard rock aquifers i e fractures and faults and it is critical to distinguish between them within the scope of the interpretation of a reservoir it appears necessary to clarify semantical standards drawn from the research fields of hydrogeology hydraulics and hydrocarbon reservoirs in regards to the terminology used to describe structural geology in the conception of the classical literature of pumping tests numerous references in this chapter a fracture refers to a low thickness single discontinuity some models posit zero thickness with a finite lateral extension where laminar flow occurs between two parallel planar walls there is no pressure gradient across the fracture uniform pressure profile poiseuille fracture these objects are hydraulic drains and may be modelled singly rather than as a network when one fracture predominates in the response of the system which typically occurs at early times when the pumping test scale is small see further discussion in sections 4 1 and 4 2 by contrast hydrocarbon reservoir and regional hydrogeology modellers commonly refer to fault zones as hydraulic barriers or drains aydin 2000 bense et al 2013 knipe et al 1998 consisting of tabular objects with non negligible thickness often multi metric and a large lateral extension practically infinite on the scale of pumping test investigations their complex multilayered internal architecture dick et al 2016 faulkner et al 2010 jourde et al 2002a b produces a hydraulic compartmentalization where typically external layers damage zones are highly diffusive due to increased fracture density and core layers have a low diffusivity due to grain size reduction fault gouges e g micarelli et al 2006 the relative importance of these contrasting diffusivity layers is strongly variable in nature leading to a large spectrum of hydraulic properties of faults ranging from barriers to anisotropic drains barriers to isotropic drains antonellini and aydin 1994 aydin 2000 caine et al 1996 knipe et al 1998 in these statements the terms fault and fracture are both used in this paper to describe highly diffusive tabular darcyan flow domains however we favour the following terminological specifications fault refers to finite conductivity objects with a large extension on an aquifer scale and having a non negligible thickness these objects are filled with material and may be composed of variously diffusive subdomains some layers may bear fracture networks in themselves as explained above the pressure profile of the entire object can be non uniform in other words they do not validate the cubic law and the inside pressure transfers can be modelled in three dimensions opposing this the term fracture refers to finite or infinite conductivity void filled objects with a variable extension and a low to negligible thickness such that inside flow is either not represented or modelled by the cubic law uniform pressure profile finally the term fracture will be sporadically used herein outside these specifications but will be explained in compliance with the original published terminology of certain models from the standpoint of pumping test hydraulics it is questionable that any real fracture may validate gringarten s infinite conductivity assumption of uniform instantly equilibrated pressures into the discontinuity matrix related linear flow regime explained above early time solution of gringarten et al 1974 this is indeed inconsistent with both in situ measurements e g packer tests flow meter profiles inversion paillet 1998 paillet et al 1987 and laboratory experimental data durham and bonner 1994 engelder and scholz 2013 pyrack nolte et al 1987 raven and gale 1985 witherspoon et al 1980 however it is absolutely certain that this postulate is not applicable to fault zones on the other hand both cinco ley s early time linear and medium time bilinear solutions cinco ley and samaniego v 1981a explicitly solve the transient flow problem into a finite conductivity discontinuity since the discontinuity is represented as a tabular highly conductive darcyan flow domain in itself this conceptual model is likely applicable to both fully penetrating fractures and fault drains which exert a similar influence on the aquifer response to pumping tests rafini and larocque 2012 2009 it is likely that the above mentioned hydraulic compartmentalization in multilayered faults is significant in generating the early time linear flow regime due to the presence of impermeable layers fault related linear flow cinco ley et al 1978 cinco ley and samaniego v 1981a in the fracture case transitions from fracture to matrix related flow regimes during the pumping test may relate to the reaching of the fracture s finite extension as predicted by cinco ley et al 1978 and cinco ley and samaniego v 1981a however rafini and larocque 2009 explained that this transition naturally occurs irrespective of the finite or infinite extension of the discontinuity as a direct consequence of the diffusion slow down into the discontinuity see details below a linear flow regime may also be produced by a highly conductive channel one dimensional conduit into the fracture plane figueiredo et al 2016 or at the intersection of two conductive fractures gringarten 2008 table 1 cell 2 linear flow regimes also occur very frequently in granular aquifer contexts ferroud et al 2018 in an elongated aquifer such as an esker i e a grossly homogeneous isotropic aquifer laterally confined between two parallel impermeable or low conductive boundaries in such a manner that the flow is restricted to a corridor e g escobar et al 2004c escobar and montealegre 2006 escobar and montealegre m 2007 note that if the well is far from the lateral boundaries a radial flow regime would settle prior to the linear flow leading to the diagnostic sequence n 2 1 table 1 cell 2 additionally the linear response has been reported in highly channelized fluvial systems e g braided and or meandering systems corbett et al 2012 and deep sea fans escobar et al 2004c according to corbett et al 2012 a linear flow can be induced by a cross flow behavior namely a flow within a layer and not between layers table 1 cell 15 this flow behavior is presented under the name ramp effect and is explained below in section 3 5 finally the linear flow regime has also been reported within fractured corridors or large permeable veins dewandel et al 2011 in a previous study ferroud et al 2018 we analyzed a flow dimension database composed of 69 pumping tests and we observed that the linear flow regime is mostly observed in fractured crystalline rock aquifers when the rock is very sparsely fractured fig 4 a and in fluvio glacial deposits fig 4b in the case of the hydraulic signal of the crystalline rock displayed in fig 4a the documented occurrences of fractures reported in well logs combined with knowledge of the structural context suggest the presence of a steeply dipping and productive fault fracture corridor embedded in a slightly fractured matrix the linear flow regime observed in this fractured rock may hence adequately be interpreted using the vertical finite conductivity fault model the linear flow regime observed in the fluvio glacial deposit fig 4b may however reflect either a narrow aquifer escobar et al 2004c or a meandering and or braided environment corbett et al 2012 in this case more field investigations would be needed to distinguish between these models 3 2 multi linear combinations 3 2 1 sequence n 1 1 mijinyawa and gringarten 2008 proposed a conceptual model to reproduce the flow behavior in a deltaic environment river dominated deltas this environment is composed of a distributary channel system olariu and bhattacharya 2006 fig 5 according to olariu and bhattacharya 2006 these distributary channels represent channel bifurcations that have characteristic sedimentary structures of unidirectional effluent flow these network patterns may be formed in deep sea fans damuth et al 1983 posamentier and kolla 2003 alluvial fans and delta plains mijinyawa and gringarten 2008 proposed two conceptual models in the first case the model is composed of two perpendicular channels fig 5b while the second model is composed of two successive channels with a non equal diameter fig 5c in both cases fig 5a and b a second linear flow regime is observed when the diameter of the second channel is greater than the first one these numerical results emphasize the non uniqueness of the derivative signature because the two different configurations of the branches fig 5b and c produce similar responses the position of the second linear flow regime on a derivative signal plot depends on the ratio of diameters between the two branches as shown in table 1 cell 4 if the second channel is thicker than the first one its transmissivity will be greater and the line showing this second linear flow regime will be shown lower on the plot d in table 1 cell 4 if the second channel is thinner the second linear slope will be higher than the first b in table 1 cell 4 our database ferroud et al 2018 shows that the n sequence 1 1 has not been observed in alluvial deposits but rather in a crystalline fractured rock aquifer and a carbonate rock aquifer new more detailed conceptual models in fractured rock aquifers are thus needed in order to interpret the sequence n 1 1 the shift of the linear slope shown in fig 6 may reflect the moment when the pressure wave reaches another vertical fracture having greater hydraulic conductivity 3 3 the radial flow regime n 2 although far from being ubiquitous the radial flow regime remains the regime most frequently observed in natural media regardless of geological context ferroud et al 2018 it occurs as often in fractured as in granular media radial flow may correspond to the classic theis conditions also named infinite acting radial flow iarf but this is not the only possible interpretation because the confirmation of radial behavior only requires that the conditions of a r be verified this may not occur only in purely theis type cylindrical equipotential surfaces radial flow may also be produced in a wide range of aquifer configurations including discontinuous porosities dense euclidean fracture network aquifers corresponding for instance to the early radial stage of the so called dual porosity model aquifers cross cut by a horizontal or weakly inclined single conductive fault or fracture before the front pulse reaches the top and bottom boundaries gringarten et al 1974 rafini and larocque 2012 or a layer with fractures in an impermeable matrix fig 7 regardless of the aquifer conditions the radial flow model makes it possible to derive an apparent transmissivity tapp which is inversely proportional to the plateau elevation of the derivative signal a as given by cooper jacob solution tapp 2 3q 4πa the physical meaning of tapp however varies depending on the conceptual model as explained in this section radial flow also typically occurs at a very late pumping time when the cone of depression is so large that heterogeneities such as fractures and faults in bedrock aquifers are small compared to the volume of the depressurized aquifer numerical modelling works by meier et al 1998 and sánchez vila et al 1999 have validated the applicability of the cooper jacob solution in a heterogeneous domain producing a radial flow regime with diffuse transmissivity fields and concentric heterogeneous storage conditions since the effects of single heterogeneities are diluted the hydraulic properties calculated from such a late radial regime represent the bulk aquifer properties our flow dimension database ferroud et al 2018 emphasizes that most long term radial flow regimes are observed in carbonate rock aquifers this may indicate that the bedding plane fractures of the carbonate rock analysed in the database are well connected and contribute to the flow 3 4 multi radial combinations two successive radial flow regimes may be produced in a variety of different aquifer settings dual porosity unconfined aquifer impermeable frontiers leaky aquifers aquifers with variable transmissivity lateral flow domains transitional stage with a negative unit slope of ds dlogt multilayered aquifers or an aquifer cross cut by a weakly inclined finite conductivity fault or fracture fig 7a b these conceptual models are described in the following sections critical features for identifying appropriate conceptual models are whether the late plateau is higher or lower than the early plateau and the shape of the transitional stage 3 4 1 sequence n 2 2 with late plateau higher than the early plateau the most common interpretation of this sequence is a single linear impermeable barrier in this case the elevation of the late plateau is twice that of the early plateau equivalent to doubling the drawdown slope on a classic semi log plot table 1 cell 14 this is due to the fact that after reaching the frontier the pressure wave propagates into a space half the size of the full space i e the apparent transmissivity is halved compartmented aquifer models butler jr and liu 1991 dewandel et al 2014 rafini et al 2017 where the non pumped compartment is less transmissive than the pumped one generate responses similar to no flow boundary systems a limiting case when the diffusivity contrast between both compartments exceeds one order of magnitude from a practical standpoint rafini et al 2017 drawdown derivative sequences displaying two successive radial flow regimes with the second plateau greater than twice the early plateau are seldom reported in field investigations two distinct conceptual flow models associated with such a sequence have been submitted in the literature the multiple impermeable frontiers model and the weakly inclined finite conductivity model the derivative signature in a flow model with multiple impermeable vertical frontiers has been analysed by beauheim and roberts 1998 mijinyawa and gringarten 2008 and van poollen 1965 this signature presents a second plateau whose y intercept is higher than the y intercept of the first plateau it signals a decrease in the flowing surface after the pressure wave has reached one or several vertical no flow boundaries in such a generalized concept of multiple impermeable frontiers the ratio x which is greater than 2 between the levels of the second and the first plateaus reflects a decrease in the transmissive surface by an equal factor primarily this signature makes it possible to diagnose systems with two vertical frontiers forming a wedge with an angle β with β 360 tapp t where t is the real transmissivity of the aquifer as given by the early radial plateau and tapp is the apparent transmissivity given by the second radial plateau beauheim and roberts 1998 similarly mijinyawa and gringarten 2008 observed that the narrower the semi infinite channel with non parallel frontiers the greater the stabilization of the second plateau the derivative signature of a weakly inclined or horizontal fault embedded in an isotropic conductive matrix also induces two plateaus with the second plateau greater than double the elevation of the first plateau rafini and larocque 2012 the fault and the matrix are both connected to the pumping well the first plateau reflects a cylindrical radial flow within the fault which is much more transmissive than the matrix in a fashion grossly similar to that illustrated in fig 7a the second plateau occurs when the fault no longer exerts influence on the transient hydrodynamics and pressure diffusion into the entire system is governed by the matrix properties the elevations of the first and second plateaus are strictly related to the hydraulic transmissivities of the fault and the matrix the shape of the transition stage positive slope of the derivative signal relates to the fault inclination a criterion that may make it possible to distinguish between the multiple impermeable frontiers and the weakly inclined fault conceptual models may be the shape of the transitional stage between the two plateaus in the weakly inclined fault aquifer the transitional stage reflects a balancing flow period in which the signal of the fault is progressively masked by the signal of the matrix rafini and larocque 2012 demonstrated that due to transient hydrodynamic interactions between the fault and the surrounding matrix the less inclined the fault the higher the slope of the derivative during the transitional stage and the shorter its duration on the other hand in the model for multiple impermeable frontiers transitions may form prolonged stages over time as frontiers are successively reached one after another to conclude in many cases using the shape of the transitional stage to distinguish between both models is not a straightforward process knowledge of the geological context primarily fractured rock versus granular aquifer contexts remains the most valuable information for this purpose 3 4 2 sequence n 2 transition 2 with late plateau lower than the early plateau recently rafini et al 2017 analysed the pressure front pulse behavior in an aquifer composed of two linearly contiguous homogeneous domains with non equal hydraulic properties they showed that when the pumping well is located in the less transmissive media domain a the pressure wave will diffuse preferentially through the most transmissive domain domain b this flow behavior results in a derivative signal composed of 1 a first plateau n 2 representing the radial diffusion of the pressure wave in domain a 2 a transitional stage unit negative slope after the pressure wave reaches the vertical limit between both domains and 3 a late plateau controlled by the hydraulic transmissivity of the domain b table 1 cell 16 since the transmissivity of domain b is greater than the transmissivity of domain a the elevation of the second plateau is lower than that of the first 3 4 3 sequence n 2 transition 2 with both plateaus at the same elevation the dual porosity models proposed by barenblatt et al 1960 kazemi 1969 and warren and root 1963 represent fractured aquifers where the conductive matrix and the fracture network form two hydraulic continua the fractured aquifer is represented by an equivalent continuum in which there is no explicit fracture and the matrix blocks are contributing as local source terms these conceptual models are composed of two homogeneous hydraulic continua one with high conductivity and low storage reflecting the fracture network which is embedded in a low conductivity high storage material reflecting the conductive matrix the hydraulically active fractures in the network must be dense and sufficiently connective and their sizes must be small enough compared to the scale of investigation for the pressure to diffuse in a practically radial multi directional fashion and for the transient effects of individual fractures to be diluted in the bulk network radial response this model predicts type curves composed of two plateaus with equal elevations and presenting the same hydraulic transmissivity separated by a depression of the derivative signal which represents the interporosity flow function during which the pressures of each of the two media tend to balance each other out gringarten 1987b table 1 cell 19 note that the shape of this depression depends on the flow type between the matrix and the fracture gringarten 1987a illustrated that flow models with a pseudo steady state interporosity flow there is interporosity skin that restricts the flow between the matrix and the fractured media will induce a v shaped depression of the derivative signal warren and root 1963 whereas flow models with a transient interporosity flow will induce an open u shaped depression moench 1984 the u shaped depression reflects the contribution of the high storage matrix in a finite sized block system while the two same elevation plateaux before and after the u reflect the conductivity of the fractured network the interporosity flow coefficient is defined as the ratio of the permeability of the matrix to that of the fractures however the relevancy of the dual porosity model is deeply undermined by kuchuk and biryukov 2014 2013 2012 by combining semi analytical solutions kuchuk and biryukov 2013 2012 field data kuchuk and biryukov 2015 2014 and numerical modelling of flow through a discretely fractured and faulted reservoir containing arbitrary distributed discontinuities biryukov and kuchuk 2012 these authors point to a lack of validity of the dual porosity model as initially submitted by barenblatt et al 1960 and warren and root 1963 the dual porosity model assumes that the matrix is homogeneous and uniform throughout the entire system abdassah and ershaghi 1986 later revisited this restrictive assumption and introduced the triple porosity model in order to represent the fracture matrix flow behavior in a more realistic way this conceptual model considers two rather than one matrix domains with different properties interporosity and storage capacity the model assumes that the flow takes place in the fractures towards the well that no flow occurs between the two matrix domains and that the matrices act as sources to supply the fractures the well is not supplied by the matrices abdassah and ershaghi 1986 proposed two conceptual models horizontal matrix layers separated by fractures strata model and blocks which are uniformly distributed and separated by orthogonal fractures block model escobar et al 2004b adapted the derivative analysis to the triple porosity model by using tiab s method the type curve of this model shows two radial flow regimes separated by two humps table 1 cell 20 it should be noted however that if the relevancy of the dual porosity model is questionable the triple porosity model is even more debatable and doubtful neither the double porosity signature nor the triple porosity signature has been reported in our flow dimension database ferroud et al 2018 trinchero et al 2007 and copty et al 2008 developed a methodology to interpret pumping tests in leaky aquifers based on the analysis of the first and the second derivatives of the drawdown with respect to log time the derivative signal is composed of two plateaus with the same elevation separated by a positive concave hump the leaky aquifer system is composed of a semiconfined pumped aquifer that is fully intercepted and connected to an overlaying aquifer via an aquitard following hantush and jacob 1955 however copty et al 2008 refined hantush s model by positing that drawdown in the upper aquifer is non negligible and that transmissivity in both aquifers is represented by heterogeneous rather than homogeneous fields while the singular radial hump radial shape of the derivative response primary allows the detection of such non uniform aquifer configurations the leakage factor as well as each hydraulic property of the aquifer can be properly estimated from inflexion and multiple inflexion point methods copty et al 2008 3 5 linear radial combinations 3 5 1 sequence n 2 1 2 fluvial deposits e g braided and or meandering environments are systems which are formed by the transport and deposition of sediments in river channels this deposition creates layered systems in which the communication between layers controls the flow this type of environment produces a specific derivative signature if the communication between layers is laterally and vertically restricted a ramp effect signal may be observed table 1 cell 15 segment b this flow regime expresses a one directional flow within the layers in other words lateral micro cross flow within fluvial deposits produces a linear flow dimension observed over at least one log cycle when there is no vertical permeability and a poor lateral connectivity between facies a linear flow is observed because the transmissivity decreases laterally due to the heterogeneity of layers that constrains the flow in one direction corbett et al 2012 the late times radial flow dimension reflects the effective hydraulic conductivity when the entire heterogeneous system contributes the n sequence of this conceptual model is 2 1 2 table 1 cell 15 3 5 2 sequence n 2 1 the n sequence 2 1 is typically generated in a large corridor bounded by two parallel no flow lateral boundaries the early radial flow regime settles as the pressure front pulse increases radially around the pumping well while the linear regime starts after the lateral boundaries have been reached rafini 2008 p 76 table 1 cell 5 note that this sequence n 2 1 was commonly observed with a short duration early radial flow regime in our flow dimension database ferroud et al 2018 in fluvio glacial deposits this sequence is associated either with a narrow aquifer table 1 cell 5 or with the first portion of the ramp effect n 2 1 2 table 1 cell 15 proposed by corbett et al 2012 this n sequence has also been observed in granites by dewandel et al 2011 3 6 the bilinear flow regime n 1 5 the n 1 5 behavior commonly referred to as the so called bilinear flow regime is produced by a steeply inclined finite conductivity fault or fracture embedded into an aquifer as demonstrated analytically by cinco ley and samaniego v 1981a and numerically by rafini and larocque 2012 2009 the fact that the fault s conductivity is finite rather than infinite accounts for the pressure gradients in the fault this case contrasts with previously mentioned infinite conductivity fracture models where the water pressure in the fracture is approximated to be uniform in such a manner that it behaves as a planar source see matrix related linear flow regime in the preceding section the finite conductivity fault model describes transient flow into two darcyan flow domains i e the fault and the matrix and their interactions the authors showed that for reasons relating to flow geometry the n 1 5 flow regime occurs only if the diffusion into the fault is strictly one directional which means that the pressure front pulse must have reached the top and bottom boundaries in other words the entire vertical extension of the fault must be depressurized this explains why this flow regime is rarely produced by weakly inclined faults unless the embedding aquifer is very thin strictly speaking the n 1 5 regime is generated when there are transient interactions between a two dimensional fault fracture and a three dimensional matrix hydraulic object with contrasting properties the initial flow scheme associated with this conceptual model as submitted by cinco ley and samaniego v 1981a is depicted in fig 8 a it assumes two simultaneous one dimensional sets of stream lines one occurring in the fault and the other one in the embedding matrix perpendicularly to the fault although this idealization was analytically necessary because it reduces an unsolvable complex two dimensional problem into two one dimensional solvable problems it remains unrealistic because any pressure gradient into the fault would instantly cause stream lines into the matrix to be non parallel rafini 2008 a later numerical study rafini and larocque 2009 re examined in detail the hydrodynamics associated with the n 1 5 flow regime it demonstrated that this flow regime is not restricted to such idealized geometry of stream lines the flow regime occurring in the matrix is not a linear one nor is the flow geometry one dimensional as explained in fig 8b the hydrodynamic conditions indicated by n 1 5 consist in a slowing down of the diffusive regime r t in the fault as a consequence of water being supplied from the matrix rafini and larocque 2009 in such a case the front pulse evolves into the fault according to r t 0 25 rather than according to r t 0 5 as it would in a normal fickian diffusive regime the authors demonstrated that the simultaneous occurrence of normal and abnormal diffusive regimes in the matrix and in the fault respectively lead to an aquifer scale pressure front pulse surface a growing proportionally to r 0 5 which explains the flow dimension equal to 1 5 according to the definition of this parameter eq 1 our flow dimension database emphasizes that the bilinear flow regime n 1 5 is mostly observed in faulted rock aquifers where the matrix is highly fractured fig 9 which confirms the relevancy of the vertical leaky fault model cinco ley and samaniego v 1981a in accordance with this generalized conception the n 1 5 fractional regime may actually be produced by any steeply inclined tabular thin aquifer surrounded by a less conductive unit a fractured dyke embedded into a massive granite or a conductive layer in a verticalized sedimentary sequence etc recently valdes perez et al 2011 proposed a bilinear flow model with a transient interporosity transfer tit between the matrix which the authors refer to as the fractured bulk and which considers matrix vugs micro and meso fractures and the fault or the dominant fracture this conceptual model is composed of a well that intercepts a finite conductive vertical fracture in a double porosity aquifer with an interporosity skin fig 10 b the interporosity skin restricts the interaction between the fault and the matrix it may consist in a zone of damage with mineral filled fractures in this conceptual model the predicted early linear regime represents the restriction of flow in the fracture in a fashion similar to that explained in section 3 1 it is followed by a short transition hump reflecting the interactions between the fractured network and the dominant fracture and a late bilinear flow regime induced by the fault matrix transient interactions as explained in the previous section table 1 cell 11 butler jr and liu 1991 posited that a n 1 5 fractional regime occurring at very early pumping time indicates the presence of low conductivity vertical fractures however this was dispelled by the extensive numerical experiments conducted by rafini and larocque 2009 which determined that the moment in time when the n 1 5 regime begins depends exclusively on the ratio sf 2 km ssm this is due to the fact that the drawdown rate is independent of ssf a peculiar feature of the n 1 5 flow regime that corroborates the early works of cinco ley and samamiego 1981 for details see rafini 2008 rafini and larocque 2009 tiab 2005 these authors further confirmed that the prevailing hydraulic conditions required for the occurrence of n 1 5 are strictly high values of the fault matrix diffusivity ratio as previously submitted by cinco ley and samamiego 1981 and that the duration of the n 1 5 flow regime is governed by the ratio tf 2 km 3 in all circumstances the n 1 5 behaviour essentially and probably does not represent an infinite acting regime as it is due to the transient hydrodynamic interactions between hydraulic objects as explained above 3 6 1 sequence n 1 5 2 a late radial flow regime occurring after the n 1 5 corresponds to a matrix related flow regime cinco ley and samaniego v 1981a rafini and larocque 2009 strictly speaking it is established after the travelled distance of the pressure front pulse into the matrix has become greater than the travelled distance of the pressure front pulse into the fault in other words the fault becomes invisible from a hydrodynamic standpoint its effect is diluted into the large volume of depressurized aquifer rafini and larocque 2009 the apparent transmissivity given by the plateau elevation is strictly that of the matrix table 1 cell 7 3 6 2 sequence n 2 transition 1 5 abbaszadeh and cinco ley 1995 described the case of a finite conductivity fault matrix system in which the fault is not directly pumped as it is not intercepted by the wellbore this leads to the settlement of an early matrix related radial flow corresponding to the time before the fault is reached by the pressure front pulse rafini and larocque 2009 during this early stage the apparent transmissivity as derived by the plateau elevation is that of the matrix a transitional stage with a characteristic negative unit slope takes place between early radial and late n 1 5 flow regimes whose duration increases with the conductivity ratio between the fault and the matrix table 1 cell 8 3 6 3 sequence n 2 1 5 rafini and larocque 2012 concluded from numerical experiments that the n 1 5 flow regime may be generalized to inclined faults which would be reflected by the settlement of an early radial flow regime prior to the n 1 5 stage without any transitional negative unit slope stage this corresponds to the time lapse during which the pressure front pulse propagates into the fault in a radial fashion from the point of interception with the wellbore before reaching the aquifer s top and bottom boundaries in this case the early radial flow regime is fault related which means that the plateau elevation is inversely proportional to the fault s transmissivity table 1 cell 12 3 6 4 sequence n 1 1 5 1 3 lee and brockenbrough 1986 proposed an analytical solution that implements the trilinear flow regime n 1 3 to model the transient flow response of a finite conductivity vertical fracture connected to a pumping well table 1 cell 18 the geometrical and hydraulic properties of the fault and the matrix are similar to those of cinco ley and samaniego v 1981a however the flow domain is divided into three rather than two regions into which unidimensional flow occurs one into the fracture with flow lines parallel to the fracture one into the matrix with flow lines perpendicular to the fracture and restricted to a region directly surrounding the fracture and also one into the matrix occurring beyond the fractures s lateral extremities with flow lines parallel to the fracture lee and brockenbrough 1986 fig 10c while the first two unidimensional flow regions correspond to the configuration of cinco ley and samaniego v 1981a the third flow region introduces the trilinear flow regime the predicted flow response first reproduces the early sequence 1 1 5 previously introduced by cinco ley and samaniego v 1981a which corresponds to a transient flow depressurization in the fracture only n 1 then simultaneously in the fracture and the matrix as discussed in the previous section their original contribution though resides in the prediction of a subsequent n 1 3 flow regime referred to as the trilinear leading to the n sequence 1 1 5 1 3 this trilinear flow regime is of short duration and occurs before the late pseudoradial regime according to azari et al 1990 it more realistically reproduces the transition between the bilinear flow regime and the later pseudoradial flow regime they stated that the trilinear flow model has the advantage of smoothly linking the fracture flow regime to the pseudoradial flow regime finally the trilinear conceptual flow model is of a higher degree of idealization than the bilinear model which had previously been criticized by rafini and larocque 2009 and revised for its lack of realism fig 10 3 7 the sphercial flow regime conceptually the spherical flow regime is primarily attributed to a point source equipotential surfaces are spheres that grow outwards according to a r 4π r 2 leading to n 3 following eq 2 barker 1988 this occurs when the portion of borehole that is receiving groundwater is significantly shorter than the aquifer thickness the spherical flow regime is thus expected to be observed i in thick granular systems or thick fractured media where the pumping well partially penetrates the aquifer ii in partially completed aquifers iii during a packer test the pumping test is considered as a point source escobar et al 2012a moncada et al 2005 iv in a fractured aquifer where a well is pumping a partially penetrating finite extension fracture dewandel et al 2018 in these conceptual models the cross flow area diffuses as a sphere partially completed aquifer or point source or a hemisphere partially penetrated aquifer however rafini et al 2014 and ferroud et al 2016 showed that a spherical flow regime may also be produced in an aquifer with an increasing thickness inclined substratum or confining layer as explained in the section below in this conceptual model the cross flow area grows as a portion of a sphere it should be recalled that spherical flow regimes are associated with a slowdown of the drawdown rate as explained in section 2 2 3 3 8 radial spherical combinations 3 8 1 sequence n 2 3 2 when the spherical flow is associated with a later radial stage 3 2 sequence this may suggest a point source barker 1988 table 1 cell 22 the spherical or hemispherical flow regime is generated when pumping between packers gringarten and ramey 1975 national research council staff 1996 p 255 rafini 2008 or in cases of short screen partial completion and partial penetration wellbores fig 11 moncada et al 2005 razminia et al 2016 yildiz and bassiouni 1990 three dimensional pressure diffusion occurs before the horizontal top and bottom boundaries are reached leading to a n 3 flow regime fig 11 the late radial stage takes place after these boundaries have been reached due to the horizontal diffusion the ending time of spherical flow and transition to the late radial flow regime provide insights on the aquifer thickness moncada et al 2005 it should be noted that when the water receiving borehole height either screened or open remains significant from a practical standpoint more than a few meters a radial stage occurs at the earliest pumping time prior to the settlement of the spherical flow regime this early radial flow regime which is generally short and masked by the wellbore storage reflects the cylindrical radial diffusion of the pressure front pulse around the length of the open zone of the well in this model the spherical flow regime is short lived its duration depends on the ratio between the water receiving borehole height and the aquifer thickness it is very short in cases of partially completed wells with large screen or open borehole heights while it lasts much longer in the context of packer tests note that the vertical anisotropy has effects on the duration of the spherical flow regime finally it is worth noting that such a flow configuration can also occur when an external aquifer is connected to the pumped layer through a localized point like pathway bourdet 2002 as illustrated in fig 12 real world examples are a localized gap in the confining layer fig 12a a pumped hard rock aquifer connected to an overlying granular aquifer non pumped through a 1d hydraulic conduit intersection of two conductive fractures or conductive channel into a fault fig 12b or a conductive fault cross cutting a glacio fluvial channel at the base of the overlying sedimentary pile note that a late radial stage may also occur in such configurations fig 12a and b which has not been represented 3 8 2 sequence n 2 2 3 initially horne and temeng 1982 interpreted the spherical flow regime as being related to a conceptual model influenced by a pinch out boundary the upper and the lower confining beds form a wedge with an angle θ fig 13 in this conceptual model the derivative signal shows a short early radial flow dimension n 2 followed by a spherical flow regime n 3 more recently mijinyawa and gringarten 2008 remarked that this n sequence 2 3 is only observed if the well is close to the pinch out fig 13a table 1 cell 21 it should be noted that mijinyawa and gringarten 2008 observed that if the well is far away from the pinch out fig 13b the spherical regime will not be visible the derivative signal shows two plateaus sequence n 2 2 table 1 cell 14 the first plateau expresses the radial diffusion of the cross flow area in the constant thickness aquifer the second plateau which is double the first plateau is produced by the attainment of the pinch out boundary which acts as a single vertical no flow boundary more recently rafini et al 2014 and ferroud et al 2016 showed numerically confirmed the occurrence of spherical flow regimes in aquifers having an inclined substratum conversely to the partially penetrated completed aquifer with a n sequence 2 3 2 the 2 2 3 sequence reflects the signal of an aquifer of variable thickness inclined substratum or wedge aquifer ferroud et al 2016 rafini et al 2014 as illustrated in fig 14 the front pulse surface can be conceptually decomposed into the three components a1 a 1 and a2 due to the inclined substratum a portion of cylinder a1 loss is truncated a1 and a 1 grow in a normal radial fashion while a2 a portion α 360 of the sphere radius of r t grows in a spherical fashion in early times before the pressure front pulse reaches the corner fig 14a the equivalence between a1 loss and a2 and after the pressure wave reaches the corner fig 14b the predominance of a1 over a 2 leads to a sequence of two radial flow regimes once the surface area a2 becomes greater than a1 a truncated hemispherical flow regime n 3 occurs depending on the proximity of the pumping to the corner the early radial stage tends to be short lived the second radial stage depends on the well length the inclination of the substratum and the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer the late spherical flow regime is infinite acting as it lasts until the end of pumping or steady state attainment if no boundary is met note that the wedge like aquifer solution developed by hantush 1962 does not predict such spherical behavior due to the postulate that the shape of substratum s inclination follows an exponential function our flow dimension database emphasizes that the spherical flow regime has been commonly observed in thick granular aquifers fig 15 which confirms the relevancy of the partially penetrated completed model one pumping test also showed a spherical flow regime in an is aquifer context 3 9 linear spherical combinations 3 9 1 sequences n 2 1 3 and n 2 4 3 when associated with a previous linear flow dimension the spherical flow regime can represent a flow regime of a long and narrow elongated aquifer that is influenced by a constant head boundary sui et al 2007 the conceptual model is composed of an elongated aquifer bounded laterally by two no flow boundaries and one constant head boundary perpendicular to the elongated direction and a constant rate pumping well near the constant head boundary sui et al 2007 observed that the flow regime induced by a constant head boundary depends on the shape of the aquifer and on the position of the well in the model if the well is closest to the constant head boundary the pressure front pulse firstly grows radially inducing a radial flow regime iarf n 2 then reaches the constant head boundary inducing a dipolar flow regime unit negative derivative signal and then diffuses between the two lateral no flow boundaries inducing a dipole linear flow regime n 3 the dipolar flow regime results from the dipole represented by the well and its image with rate of opposite sign sui et al 2007 when this dipolar flow regime occurs in an elongated system inducing a linear flow it is called dipole linear flow regime the n sequence of this configuration is n 2 4 3 table 1 cell 23 if the distance between the well and the no flow boundaries is shorter than the distance between the well and the constant head boundary the derivative signal will show a radial flow regime n 2 followed by a linear flow regime n 1 followed by a dipole linear flow regime n 3 the n sequence of this configuration is n 2 1 3 when the pressure wave reaches the far constant head boundary the derivative signal drops to note that the linear n 1 and the dipolar n 4 flow regimes are not necessarily observed depending on the configuration of the system note that when the wellbore storage effect is observed the early radial flow regime may be masked 3 10 fractional flow regimes non integer n the non integer n values were initially interpreted as being related to fractal properties of the fractured media acuna and yortsos 1995 barker 1988 chang and yortsos 1990 however from a geological perspective the fractal theory applied to natural fracture networks is limited to restricted scale of ranges e g hardacre and cowie 2003 nicol et al 1996 and the finite limits of the hydraulic model noted by acuna and yortsos 1995 would hardly permit the fractional response to develop walker et al 2006 also submitted that fractional responses may relate to heterogeneity fields with fractal properties de dreuzy et al 2004 and de dreuzy and davy 2007 have observed fractional n values in models with local scaling of transmissivity in non stationary multifractal correlation patterns in 1991 doe extended the interpretation of fractional n values to non fractal geometries which are not space filling following this concept rafini and larocque 2009 numerically demonstrated how the n 1 5 fractional flow response was generated by an aquifer crosscut by a single leaky fault which is non fractal by definition based on our current knowledge fractional flow dimensions can only be reproduced by a slowing down of the drawdown diffusion regime r t either due to the fractal properties of the medium acuna and yortsos 1995 barker 1988 or to the transient interactions between faults and matrix hydraulic units real derivative signatures in fractured rock aquifers have shown successive integer and non integer n values which compromise the homogeneity assumption of the fractal model ferroud et al 2018 rafini 2008 fig 1 depicts a sequence of radial flow dimension and a fractional flow dimension the radial flow conditions during the first 103 s of pumping make it difficult to interpret the late fractional regime with a fractal model because it implies the presence of non fractal characteristic length scales furthermore the succession of different fractional flow regimes on a single response poses the issue of the spatial superposition of two infinite acting fractal continua which is conceptually inextricable in addition the flow dimension database compiled by ferroud et al 2018 emphasized fractional n values in alluvial deposits fig 16 which are by their very essence non fractured and non faulted implying that other avenues must be considered to interpret these non integer n values 3 11 boundary flow regimes a positive unit slope of the drawdown log derivative signal may represent wellbore storage effects e g tiab 2005 or impermeable boundaries in every direction also named closed reservoir or depleted reservoir gringarten 2008 mattar 1997 which occur respectively at the shortest and at the latest pumping time finally derivative signatures tending to zero or negative unit slopes represent constant head boundaries in the iarf model e g walker and roberts 2003 or represent a transitional time period rafini and larocque 2012 2009 sui et al 2007 4 discussion 4 1 the hydraulic significance of multi stage sequences in most cases the natural responses obtained from field investigations display successions of several time periods with different values of n ferroud et al 2018 rafini 2008 such as illustrated in fig 1 the typical temporal interpretation of pumping test data stipulates that early stage responses are controlled by wellbore storage and skin effects mid stage responses are an expression of the aquifer properties and late stage responses mark the boundary effects e g leveinen 2001 2000 although these principles remain generally true the sequential interpretations discussed here make it possible to state that aquifer properties frequently provide multistage responses in themselves this is due to the existence of various types of major or minor diffuse heterogeneities or non uniformities within the aquifer that successively exert a dominant influence on the macroscale flow regime over various time periods the terms major and minor diffuse here are time dependent attributions as they relate to the ratio between the size of heterogeneities and the investigation scale i e the volume of depressurized aquifer that increases as pumping persists diffuse minor heterogeneity fields typically conceptualized as an unknown k x y z distribution function are not likely to modify the flow dimension unless they follow a scale invariance statistic function which brings us to the long debated fractal models discussed above cello et al 2009 walker et al 2006 these fields likely behave like continua after a critical pumping time range this occurs where the investigation scale exceeds that of single heterogeneities by a greater enough amount for those heterogeneities situated into the depressurized volume of aquifer constituting a statistically representative sample of the distribution function in other words the bulk conductivity stabilizes with scale conversely at a given pumping time and space the macroscale aquifer behavior may be influenced by some major heterogeneities or non uniformities whose magnitude of size is more or less equal to or greater than the investigation scale and hence of restricted number in such cases non uniform flow will be generated and a non radial flow regime will eventually settle such heterogeneities may be finite conductivity hydraulic objects with a contrasting topological dimension patch conduit fault matrix region or boundaries linearly or irregularly shaped single or multiple finite or infinite conductivity substratum inclination pinchout boundary lateral lithological domain with variable thickness or conductivity localized connections to other aquifers partially leaky strata etc it is worth noting that short lived flow regimes are more likely produced by the former heterogeneity type while the latter is prone to generating infinite acting regimes numerical simulations have shown that hydraulic objects ranging in sizes exceeding a meter or a decameter are likely being considered major at least during the restricted time range during which they exert a singular influence on flow geometry before the pumping investigation scale grows much greater than their own size rafini and larocque 2012 2009 during that period of time when they deterministically impact the aquifer response hydraulic objects must be explicitly conceptualized in the flow model their influence may then evolve over time as the scale of the investigation increases and they will eventually be better represented as belonging to a minor diffuse heterogeneity field an example is the 1 2 flow dimension sequence obtained from a sub metric fractures network doe 2002 the early linear stage reflects the influence of a single fracture connected to the wellbore hence influencing the drawdown response as though it were a major heterogeneity whose properties can be explicitly calculated the late radial regime occurs when a large portion of the network is depressurized behaving like a radial continuum it is a general rule that early time flow regimes after wellbore storage effects reflect the minor scale hydraulic conditions since a restricted flow domain is sampled depressurized while late flow regimes are the expression of larger scale bulk aquifer properties commonly considered more reliable for practical purposes at the extreme and somewhat schematically the early times likely inform on the porosity conditions fracture or interstitial porosity while the late times investigate the aquifer geometrical conditions leakage connections to other flow domains boundaries etc indeed an early linear flow regime undoubtedly points to the presence of secondary type porosity dominated by fractures while late time linear flow regime may indicate an elongated aquifer fluvial channel tabular reservoir the latter conceptual interpretation is more robust though if a radial regime occurs prior to the late linear one leading to the sequence 2 1 due to the theissian cylindrical diffusion before the sides of the channel are reached it rises from this observation that two factors are meaningful at the conceptual interpretation stage the time at which the flow regime occurs and its duration as said above flow regimes produced by transient interactions between hydraulic objects are more likely generating short lived regimes following the previous example the linear flow regime settling into an elongated aquifer is infinite acting which is not the case of any fracture related linear flow regime moreover a fault related linear flow regime cannot occur in late time since it is unrealistic that the fault s cross sectional surface could be predominant over the cross flow area evolving in the rest of the flow domain unless it is impermeable successive flow regimes may also correspond to various expressions of the same hydraulic object at different pumping times and spatial scales an example already mentioned above is the 1 2 sequence that may be conceptually interpreted as an euclidean conductive fracture network with early linear flow regime expressing sub meter scale pressure diffusion into a single fracture without matrix depressurization and later radial stage occurring when the volume of investigation scale is sizeable over the length of the fractures i e the network behaves like a continuum theoretically changes in flow regimes that relate to the attainment of new non uniformities flow domain distal fault top or bottom borders new conditions far field water supply etc may be succeeding each other in a perfectly independent fashion until the occurrence of drawdown stabilization aquifer de saturation or the end of pumping this leads to multistage responses for which each regime or sequence may be analyzed independently hammond and field 2014 4 2 influence of hydraulic domains with non equal flow and topological dimensions successive flow regimes express flow domains or objects that succeed each other in exerting a sensitive and predominant control on the macroscale aquifer response they successively govern the global transient diffusion mode of the front pulse in other words the exponent of eq 2 power law relationship in the example of the fault or fracture matrix system producing the flow dimension sequence 1 5 2 both stages correspond to time periods during which the fault and the matrix respectively exert a dominant control on the aquifer s response the two successive flow regimes are caused by a change in interactive mode between the two flow units fault and matrix produce pressure front pulse envelopes with respectively a pseudo disc shape a1 and cylinder shape a2 diffusing in different modes a1 r 0 5 a2 r such that their respective flow dimensions are 1 5 and 2 the macroscale flow dimension of the aquifer recorded at the pumping well is 1 5 then 2 each value expressing a time period during which the total surface a a1 a2 is controlled successively by a1 and then by a2 hence changing the eq 2 power law exponent and the flow dimension see rafini and larocque 2009 for a deeper demonstration this conducts to the general result that where flow units with different dimensions are present in the aquifer and produce surfaces a n growing at different power law rates with r the polynomial form of atotal σi ai σi ci r ni 1 is such that a single surface an predominates over others at a given pumping time and space due to this polynomial form in no circumstances may the resulting exponent of atotal r power law relationship be a combination of individual exponents ai r in other words the aquifer flow dimension can never be a mathematical combination product average etc of flow dimensions produced by individual hydraulic objects contrary to what may have been stated the flow dimension that is measured on a derivative signal is an apparent value reflecting the predominant flow behavior rather than a mean value of the flow dimensions related to hydraulic objects in the aquifer finally it is worth noting that the position of the well relative to the aquifer configuration is essential and may significantly influence the derivative signal and the n sequence for instance sui et al 2007 showed that if a well is close to the constant head boundary of an elongated aquifer the n sequence 2 4 3 occurs while if the well is far from the constant head boundary and the pressure front pulse reaches the lateral impermeable boundaries of the elongated aquifer before the constant head boundary the n sequence 2 1 3 will be observed 4 3 limitations 4 3 1 issue of non unique interpretations analyzing the drawdown log derivative signal helps to improve the interpretation of pumping tests by reducing the non uniqueness of the drawdown signatures however it remains that different flow behaviors can produce the same flow dimension for instance ferroud et al 2018 reported that the same flow dimension value can be observed in various geological contexts such as carbonate rock aquifers crystalline rock aquifers and alluvial deposits for instance they observed a linear flow regime in both fractured rock aquifers and alluvial deposits this study with its catalogue of flow regimes also emphasizes the issue of non unicity because various conceptual models may produce an identical flow dimension value for instance the spherical flow regime n 3 can be produced in a partially penetrated aquifer escobar et al 2012a moncada et al 2005 in an aquifer of increasing thickness is aquifer ferroud et al 2016 rafini et al 2014 and in a narrow aquifer influenced by a constant head boundary sui et al 2007 similarly the linear flow regime is produced by 1 an infinite hydraulic conductivity fracture gringarten et al 1974 gringarten and ramey 1975 2 a finite hydraulic conductivity fault or fracture abbaszadeh and cinco ley 1995 cinco ley et al 1978 cinco ley and samaniego v 1981b 3 an elongated aquifer escobar et al 2004c 4 an alluvial system micro cross flow in the sediment corbett et al 2012 and 5 a deltaic environment distributary channel system mijinyawa and gringarten 2008 analysing the sequence of flow regimes helps to choose an appropriate conceptual model by countering the non unicity of the derivative signal for instance the n sequence 2 3 2 expresses a partially penetrated aquifer whereas the n sequence 2 2 3 refers to an aquifer with an inclined substratum finally it is worth noting that conducting a proper aquifer interpretation requires a comprehensive approach in which the derivative response is analysed with respect to the geological environment field knowledge typically from geological or geophysical surface or log surveys in many instances may prove helpful in selecting between several non unique flow models which all fit the observed data 4 3 2 issue of the quality of derivative data and the subjectivity of interpretations 4 3 2 1 noise in data as mentioned previously the relevancy of the selection of the conceptual model is based on the quality of the derivative signal if the signal is too noisy the determination of the flow regimes will be uncertain and therefore the selection of the conceptual model doubtful deconvolution convolution algorithms are available to reduce noise induced by flow rate variations while differentiation algorithms are deemed efficient to reduce gaussian noise instrumental noise random diffuse heterogeneity see section 2 1 4 3 2 2 duration of the pumping test the longer the pumping test the larger the volume of aquifer that is investigated and therefore the more likely that a larger number of flow regimes will be detected it should be kept in mind that unless the hydraulic boundaries are reached the derivative signature is possibly not complete indeed if the pumping test is not long enough to detect all the sequences of the type curve or if drawdown data are missing or too noisy only one portion of the theoretical type curve is observed or detected for instance with the sequence n 1 5 2 we cannot conclude that the well is connected to the fault or fracture however the sequence 2 negative unit slope 1 5 2 makes it possible to detect the effect of a leaky vertical fault or fracture that is non connected to the source it is thus important to combine the analysis of the derivative signal with all the available field information liang et al 2012 massonnat and bandiziol 1991 once the relevant conceptual model is chosen the hydraulic properties may be estimated 4 3 2 3 determination of the flow regimes the determination of flow dimensions by analysing straight lines in the derivative signal presents several challenges the derivative signal must attain a real stabilization in some cases transitional flow regimes may be observed over a long duration due for instance to a low hydraulic conductivity when aquifers are very heterogeneous it is possible that the derivative signal may never become stable thus expressing only transitional stages as stated by beauheim et al 2004 and rafini et al 2017 a proper estimation of the flow dimension should be determined from a constant straight line of the derivative signal that lasts at least one log cycle the interpretation of flow regimes uses successive linear regressions on derivative straight lines into several time windows the recognition of these time windows and the confidence these provide in the interpretation of flow dimensions remains a sensitive aspect of the approach that may in some cases still present some uncertainties if the effects of pumping rate changes have not been removed from the derivative signal a manual interpretation is recommended rather than any automated process that optimizes regression coefficients indeed the quality of regressions is not the only component of a proper interpretation of flow regimes a manual analysis of derivative data makes it possible to identify pumping rate interruptions or changes to award less weight or significance to certain noisy sections presenting obviously increased data instability either instrumental due to a localized highly diffuse heterogeneity field or other sources furthermore the manual interpreter may benefit from derivative differentiation without being misled by it in other words to stick to raw data we finally submit that a simultaneous fit on both s and ds dlogt significantly contributes to reducing the level of subjectivity when interpreting flow regimes 4 4 summary of the proposed methodology the proposed methodology consists in 1 pre processing the data in order to correct the variable rate drawdown into constant rate drawdown and to reduce the noise by using deconvolution convolution and or differentiation codes if data pre processing is not possible the recognition of various noise types such as pump arrests instabilities or imprecise drawdown manual measurement is recommended 2 identifying the flow regimes as successive straight lines on the log log plot of the derivative response specific attention must be paid to the stability of the slope and the critical duration of the slope stable segment it is important to keep in mind that as the pressure front pulse propagates the volume of depressurized aquifer increases and thus the scale of detected heterogeneity increases 3 fitting with real data the determination of the flow dimension is improved by simultaneously fitting the signal segments of s and ds dlogt respectively on a semi log and on a bi log plot this approach combines the advantages of both plots the semi log plot of s globally is less noisy whereas the bi log plot of ds dlogt is very sensitive to both pumping rate changes and flow regime variations this combined fitting of s and ds dlogt increases the objectivity of the flow dimension determination specifically when data pre processing is not efficient or the derivative signal is noisy for instance when the derivative signal is noisy it is sometimes difficult to confidently adjust the vertical position of the straight line in such cases adjusting the s signal on a semi log plot proves very helpful note that the combined approach may be assisted by manually or automatically optimizing the correlation coefficients independently into each segment and on both plots 4 choosing a conceptual model because several conceptual models may produce a same derivative signal it is important to have some information about the geological settings liang et al 2012 massonnat and bandiziol 1991 in addition as explained previously analysing the sequence of flow regimes will help to attenuate the non unicity of the derivative signal 5 doing extra geological studies if possible consider doing extra studies to determine the nature and the configuration of the heterogeneity such as geophysical surveys e g georadar time domain electromagnetic method seismic methods or drilling e g to investigate a buried esker etc 5 conclusion this contribution deciphers the methodology that consists in using the sequential analysis of flow dimensions for the interpretation of pumping test data in complex aquifers the relevance of performing hydraulic investigations in real aquifers using models with variable degrees of idealization has been discussed and the need for innovative tools able to model more complex flow conditions was mentioned our sequential interpretative methodology was described in detail this paper provides an exhaustive review of diagnostic responses and their associated conceptual models which have been published in the hydrogeology and petroleum industry literature ferroud et al 2018 demonstrated that non radial behaviors are generally predominant in natural aquifer responses to transient pump tests in various geological environments they noted that common drawdown interpretations are not capable of accurately representing the transient geometry of flow occurring in aquifers as non radial flow models remain seldom used and still insufficient to explain fractional flow behaviors such conclusions tell us that continued research efforts should be devoted to the flow dimension approach the fact that the flow dimension theory remains valid beyond grf aquifer conditions must now be considered a consensual premise in this view further works should focus on 1 identifying the multistage dimensional responses of various types of complex irregular and realistic aquifer conditions from numerical experiments on synthetic objects along with field verification 2 investigating flow dimensional responses from multi well datasets i e constraining the spatial distribution of this parameter in various types of heterogeneous flow configurations 3 last but not least understanding the still enigmatic fractional flow regimes which are extensively reported in nature ferroud et al 2018 rafini 2008 most research efforts focused on fractal approaches which remain unsatisfactory in many geological contexts and did not prove successful in providing conclusive outcomes in spite of the negative effects of this unfruitful avenue on the perceptions some researchers have had regarding flow dimension analysis we submit that this approach still has the potential of providing significant and substantial future advances in the field of interpretation of complex aquifers similar in significance to bourdet s breakthrough derivative approach published in the 1980 s this first contribution is a qualitative study first of all it aims at summarizing in the most exhaustive way conceptual models based on both analytical solutions and numerical frameworks codes available to interpret vertical constant rate pumping tests secondly it organizes the conceptual models around a single hydrodynamic and interpretative framework based on the flow dimension parameter a second contribution is forecasted this time in the form of a quantitative study with a review

8619,an innovative solution for groundwater velocity measurement in wells the direct velocity tool dvt is developed and tested the dvt allows measurement of darcy flux at centimeter scale vertical resolution requiring only a few minutes for each measurement typically 5 10 min results are generated in real time through the use of an equation the theoretical functional darcy flux range is between 1 and 40 cm day 1 for an aquifer with a hydraulic conductivity k less than 10 3 m s 1 laboratory tests showed a linear response between darcy flux imposed and darcy flux measured with the dvt with a high correlation coefficient r2 0 99 the dvt was tested for velocities ranging from 5 to 30 cm day 1 where a higher standard deviation was observed for higher velocity 6 46 cm day 1 for 30 cm day 1 at a hydraulically controlled field site tracer tests borehole dilutions passive flux meter pfm and dvt were tested under constant flow conditions the pfm tracer test and dvt technologies measured similar darcy flux ranging from 10 to 17 cm day 1 the dvt and pfm had uncertainties of 2 70 cm day 1 and 2 50 cm day 1 respectively at a contaminated field site velocities measured with the pfm range between 5 and 9 cm day 1 while the dvt provided velocities of 4 to 8 cm day 1 velocity measurement showed similar results at the contaminated field site between pfm and dvt the dvt offers an innovative solution for darcy flux measurement and can be deployed easily it provides the capability to characterize the vertical distribution of the horizontal velocity for a well in a period of 1 2

laboratory and field comparison innovative 1 introduction velocity measurements are useful for a number of purposes in hydrogeological studies these measurements can be used to quantify recharge estimate clean up times design permeable reactive barriers characterize both groundwater and contaminant movement in aquifer systems devlin et al 2009 velocity can be represented by the darcy flux q as an apparent groundwater velocity or pore water velocity both are quite important for site management the velocity referenced in this study corresponds to the darcy flux darcy flux measurements have been increasingly used for the calculation of contamination mass flux at polluted sites and provide an important metric to understanding the transport mechanisms near source zones and to support remedial design serdp 2010 darcy flux can be calculated using darcy s law based on hydraulic conductivity k l t 1 the hydraulic gradient i dimensionless however a large uncertainty remains on the value of hydraulic conductivity and the spatial distribution of k ballard 1996 the most direct method for quantifying groundwater velocity estimation is a tracer test with this method several wells or monitoring points are necessary to observe tracer migration in order to estimate groundwater velocity this approach sees limited application due to the time and cost required labaky et al 2009 for the reasons stated above several tools and methods have been developed for darcy flux measurement at a single point in well or direct push the first method based on in well measurement found in the literature is the borehole dilution test drost et al 1968 halevy et al 1968 where the undisturbed groundwater flow in the aquifer is quantified based on the dilution of a tracer introduced into a screened well assuming steady groundwater flow and a homogeneous distribution of the tracer in the well a dilution rate is calculated in this approach the presence of vertical water flow in the well can disturb the mixing between tracer and groundwater thus maintaining a reliable measure of tracer concentration declines without disturbing the flow field is challenging drost et al 1968 a borehole dilution test was developed in an isolated section of a well in order to avoid the influence of vertical flow palmer 1993 and keeping the section well mixed due to the difficulties and limits of the borehole dilution test brouyère et al 2008 proposed a new method based on a tracer dilution called the finite volume point dilution method fvpdm the fvpdm is easy to implement in the field and the method can be conducted to provide temporal monitoring of darcy flux jamin et al 2015 compared the fvpdm to the basic borehole dilution test in a fractured aquifer they showed that the borehole dilution test provided a good darcy flux estimation if the mixing volume was precisely known the fvpdm method gave a better measurement of the darcy flux but required a longer duration measurement in the literature other in well tools with a direct darcy flux measurement of groundwater have been developed including the geoflometer kerfoot and massard 1985 which is based on thermal transmission in the open portion of the well screen the tool creates a heat pulse in the center of the well screen and movement of water induces a thermal signal proportional to the darcy flux the unit is best deployed with velocities greater than 50 cm day 1 the colloidal borescope kearl 1997 kearl et al 1999 is a tool employing direct observation of particles in the well screen these measured velocities are averaged to obtain a mean darcy flux the colloidal borescope is more effective for high velocities from the centimeter per day scale up to 2400 m day 1 kearl et al 1992 1999 kearl 1997 korte et al 2000 the laser doppler velocimeter momii et al 1993 measures the particle movement at the crossing point of two laser beams the velocity range is similar to the geoflometer geoflometer colloidal borescope and laser doppler velocimeter have a variable measurement range from 1 cm day 1 to 100 000 cm day 1 but have limitations at low velocity particularly due to vertical currents in the well similar to the borehole dilution test the passive flux meter hatfield et al 2004 pfm is a permeable cylinder that sorbs dissolved organic and inorganic contaminant and intercepts groundwater flow the detailed principle of the pfm will be presented later the pfm requires an exposure time in the field that can last from 1 to 4 weeks depending on the well diameter and groundwater velocity regarding in well measurements according to our best knowledge currently the most widely employed tools are the borehole dilution test to quantify darcy flux the pfm is increasing in use with more focus on measuring contaminant mass fluxes other tools do not require the installation of a well since the velocity is measured through direct contact with the aquifer material during a direct push investigation the in situ permeable flow sensor ballard et al 1996 uses a thermal perturbation technique this tool is a cylindrical heated device that is in contact with the porous media at the velocity measurement point if the water flux is uniform in the porous media groundwater fluxes causes a temperature distribution on the surface of the cylinder varying as a function of the direction and magnitude of groundwater flow velocity range from 0 5 to 90 cm day 1 the point velocity probe pvp devlin et al 2009 labaky et al 2007 2009 is composed of two half cylinders one is hollow and contains the injection detection system the other one half is solid and contains a groove to stabilize the injection line a small volume of tracer is introduced through the injection system and the velocity of the tracer is estimated based on arrival of the tracer at a detector one limit of the direct push methods is compaction of the aquifer materiel during installation changing the natural characteristic of the porous media also penetration of the tool could be difficult depending on the type of aquifer material a new device has been developed for applications in screened wells osorno and devlin 2017 and is called the in well point velocity probe iw pvp labaky et al 2009 compared the pvp with other tools for groundwater measurement the different tests were carried out in a natural aquifer confined by a sheet pile wall bounded cell applied darcy flux of 20 cm day 1 four methods were compared pvp geoflometer colloidal borescope and the borehole dilution test the intercomparison showed that the pvp and geoflometer had similar measurement results with a better value for the pvp the challenges noted with the pvp measurement were due to porous medium alteration during hammering installation that caused a negative bias for groundwater velocity measurement the borehole dilution experiment and colloidal borescope overestimated the groundwater velocity by an order of magnitude or more both methods are useful at higher velocities the main objective of this paper is to present an innovative tool for groundwater velocity measurement the direct velocity tool dvt which intends to provide an in well test a measurement without limitation due to vertical currents a direct natural gradient velocity measurement for relatively heterogeneous rates that are common in alluvial aquifers 5 cm day 1 to 100 cm day 1 a short measurement time of 5 10 min in this paper the dvt principle and method of application are first described the tool is then validated in the laboratory in a small 3d test box the tool is then compared to a tracer test a pfm and a borehole dilution test at a small scale field site test finally several measurements conducted at contaminated field sites are compared to pfm data 2 dvt development and validation 2 1 theory the dvt principle is based on measuring a combined homogeneously mixed flow of a known tracer solution and the natural gradient groundwater flux the dvt is constructed using a pvc tube reduced down to one third of the tube circumference that is pushed in close contact with the well screen through the use of pneumatic actuators fig 1 a b thus creating an intake window isolating a portion of the well screen more specifically the intake window is created using a thicker neoprene seal dark part on the dvt in fig 1b which is the only part pressed against the well screen the intake window makes it possible i to isolate a portion of the screen for measurement and ii to focus the groundwater flow toward the measurement sensor fig 2 to optimise the dvt measurement the screen must be located in the well however it s difficult to have this information so at first the dvt is oriented upgradient relative to the natural gradient flow direction four directions north east south and west are recommended for testing in order to estimate the highest darcy flux measurement 2 1 1 mixing principle as shown in fig 2 water from the aquifer flows through the intake window and exits at point a the groundwater flow travels through a short section of tubing before exiting at point b near the tubing inlet an injection port is installed at point c where groundwater is mixed with an injected tracer solution the mixed solution is then measured at the exit point b adopting a simple mass conservation and assuming the two flow streams are homogeneously mixed the flow of water from the aquifer can be calculated 1 q aquifer c aquifer q tracer c tracer q aquifer q tracer c mixing where q is flow rate l3 t 1 c is concentration or electrical conductivity if the tracer is a saline solution m l3 or µs cm 2 q aquifer can be calculated as c aquifer is measured before the test c tracer and q tracer are known and c mixing is measured during the test q tracer is very low between 2 and 4 ml min 1 to avoid a counterbalancing of q tracer in q aquifer depending on the site calibration of the tracer flux is modified when the outlet electrical conductivity is too close to that in the aquifer 2 1 2 physical configuration the dvt is composed of a one third section of pvc tube 63 mm diameter with two separate parts i the convex part which faces against the screen and includes a rubber layer around the perimeter in order to create the intake window and ii the concave part which forms the inlet system and device for velocity measurement employing an electrical conductivity sensor the intake window has a surface of 101 cm2 and a thickness of 2 mm the exit of the intake window is directly connected to the inlet of the tube component of the system the tube system was designed to produce a homogeneous tracer mixture which is measured at the end of the system from the top of the well casing the tracer solution is injected continuously using a peristaltic pump through a thin tube 4 mm inner diameter until the system reaches a steady state mixed concentration measured with an electrical conductivity meter thus allowing aquifer flow rate calculation eq 2 2 q d v t q t r a c e r c m i x i n g c t r a c e r c a q u i f e r c m i x i n g q d v t s i n t a k e w i n d o w where q dvt is the darcy flux from the dvt l t 1 and s is the intake window area l2 2 2 accuracy of the dvt 2 2 1 concept of flow distortion for a homogeneous permeable circular element in a locally homogeneous aquifer the contrast of hydraulic conductivity leads to a convergence or divergence of the aquifer flow strack and haitjema 1981 as an example the contrast in k between a pfm and the aquifer can produce converging flow through the well and the relation between the darcy flux in the pfm q pfm and the undisturbed aquifer darcy flux q aquifer can be defined annable et al 2005 3 q pfm q aquifer 2 k pfm k pfm k aquifer α where k aquifer is the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and k pfm the hydraulic conductivity of the pfm l t 1 this relationship between apparent darcy flux and undisturbed darcy flux is the factor α defined by drost et al 1968 this factor takes into consideration the flow field distortion by the well as influenced by the tool inserted into the well 2 2 2 dvt flow distortion modelling the flow distortion around the well was modelled with modflow usg unstructured grid using a triangular mesh parameters and description of the models are presented in the supporting information appendix a and b 2 2 2 1 distortion comparison for three cases the distortion created by an empty well screen a well screen with a pfm present and a well screen with a dvt installed was compared using the model with an aquifer k of 10 4 m s 1 and a darcy flux equal to 11 cm day 1 model results are presented in fig 3 the simulation shows that the dvt creates a distortion higher than both the pfm and the empty well screen calculation of the distortion considers the complete diameter of the well screen for the empty well and the pfm cases for the dvt the distortion considers the width of the intake window indeed the flux measured in the dvt is related to the size of the intake window 2 2 2 2 distortion calibration of the dvt different tests with the dvt were modelled in order to assess the limitations of the tool fig 4 shows the distribution of the dvt distortion for a range of darcy flux in function hydraulic conductivity an empirical fit was developed using the following equation where k is hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer l t 1 for a darcy flux range between 5 and 40 cm day 1 4 distortion c o e f f i c i e n t 0 7 exp 2300 k 200 k 1 2 this equation was used for the calculation of the dvt distortion with these results the dvt has limited application when the distortion is less than 1 so for an aquifer with a hydraulic conductivity higher than 2 10 3 m s 1 the distortion coefficient decreases rapidly which may limit the accuracy of the darcy flux measurement 2 3 dvt calibration in laboratory tests 2 3 1 background the dvt was first tested in a sand tank a 68 cm long 12 cm wide and 50 cm height fig 5 an 80 mm diameter screened well was installed in the centre of the sand box the box was packed with zones upstream and downstream using a gravel material to create constant head boundaries the main portion of the box was filled with coarse sand two clay zones were added between the box walls and the well screen in order to avoid water deviation around the well corresponding to an absence of distortion indeed in the sand box there is no distortion between the applied darcy flux and measured darcy flux in the well thus dvt calibration is not required using a peristaltic pump different flow rates were imposed in the system producing a homogeneous darcy flux dvt measurements were compared to the imposed darcy flux through the porous medium another calibration was conducted in a second laboratory tank system b 100 cm long 50 cm wide and 50 cm height at only two imposed velocities 16 cm day 1 and 26 cm day 1 to provide a comparison between pvp and dvt 2 3 2 results several flow rates were imposed in the laboratory sand tank a to provide a range of darcy fluxes six rates were tested with the dvt from 5 to 30 cm day 1 fig 6 as shown in fig 6 measurements are repeatable and proportional to the flow rate imposed for the six rates tested however for the higher darcy fluxes imposed the measurements had a higher standard deviation with no simple explanation in the second sand tank measured values by pvp were 23 2 3 and 30 3 cm day 1 porosity 0 40 for an imposed darcy flux of 16 and 26 cm day 1 while the dvt velocities were 25 6 1 and 31 6 cm day 1 for the same imposed darcy flux this additional comparison generally supports measurements between pvp and dvt 3 dvt field applications 3 1 controlled flow in a natural aquifer background for validation the dvt was deployed in a natural unconfined aquifer for comparison with other velocity methods this aquifer is localised in bordeaux france on a plio quaternary formation with a thickness of 6 m this formation is composed of variable medium sands the bottom of the aquifer is delimited by a clay aquitard and the water level was measured at 2 80 m below ground surface the test was conducted using several wells shown in fig 7 p1 p2 p4 and p5 are screened over a depth of 5 6 m with the bottom at the clay layer the measurement point p3 is screened from 5 to 5 60 m depth pumping in p5 and injection in p1 was imposed in order to have a controlled flow field the flow rate for the controlled zone was 75 l h 1 and was imposed continuously during the three weeks period of testing tracer test borehole dilution test pfm and dvt p3 was used for measurements in the center of the imposed flow 3 1 1 tracer test for the tracer test a nacl solution of 1 g l 1 was used two tracer tests pulses 40 l and 20 l were injected for different durations 5 and 2 50 min for comparison the saline solution was injected at the bottom of the piezometer p2 at a flow rate of 8 l min 1 a continuous low recirculation was set in p3 using a peristaltic pump in order to homogenise the concentration and continuously measure the electrical conductivity of the water consort multiparameter c3010 3 1 2 pfm setup the pfm is a cylinder composed of granular activated carbon gac and provides both contaminant mass flux and darcy flux measurements the pfm is inserted into a well and allows groundwater flux through the device after an exposure time from 1 to 4 weeks the pfm is removed and sampled for analysis the pfm activated carbon is initially impregnated with five alcohols and their loss ratio is proportional to groundwater flux and provides darcy flux through calculation the mass of all contaminant intercepted by the sorbent is also analysed and contaminant mass flux is calculated for this study only the resident alcohols are used for darcy flux estimation a pfm with a length of 15 cm and diameter of 6 8 cm was constructed for the field tests the pfm parameters and design were implemented based on hatfield et al 2004 for the experimental design four alcohol were used methanol ethanol isopropyl alcohol and n hexanol to produce a 15 cm long pfm more than 200 g of activated carbon was prepared an initial sample of the activated carbon was taken in order to compare with samples exposed to groundwater flow after pfm exposure the relative mass is calculated for darcy flux estimation the pfm was inserted in p3 at 5 40 m depth for a period of 6 days all the gac was recovered and mixed to homogenize the samples initial and final gac samples were analysed using gcms with a 5 sil ms column isopropyl alcohol was analysed for this test on four identical samples the relative mass calculated with isopropyl alcohol was higher than 0 3 µg l 1 µg l 1 which allows use of the simplified form for darcy flux calculation annable et al 2005 5 q aquifer 1 67 r θ r d 1 m r α t where q aquifer is darcy flux l t 1 r l is radius of the pfm cylinder θ is the water content in the pfm dimensionless r d is the retardation factor of the resident tracer used isopropyl alcohol in this case dimensionless m r is relative mass of tracer remaining in the pfm sorbent m α the distortion coefficient and t is pfm time of exposure t 3 1 3 borehole dilution test the borehole dilution approach is based on a simple assumption that the decreasing tracer concentration injected in the test interval is proportional to the apparent velocity and directly to the darcy flux this method requires i a steady state flow ii a homogeneous mix between the tracer and the water tested iii no density gradient induced by the tracer piccinini et al 2016 in the well after homogeneous mixing the tracer concentration c decreases according to freeze and cherry 1979 6 dc dt a v a c w where a is the cross section of the groundwater flow l2 v a the apparent velocity l t 1 and w the dilution volume l3 the velocity in the aquifer is calculated using an appropriate α as the pfm or dvt in this case the conditions of the controlled field sand lead to a converging factor of 2 drost et al 1968 in general the borehole dilution test is conducted within a single isolated section here the piezometer used for the dilution test p3 has a single screen with a length of 60 cm and 68 mm diameter therefore the test satisfy this criterium a nacl solution was used as a tracer with a concentration of 1 g l 1 and an injected volume of 500 ml during 350 min in order to increase the salinity in the well from 50 to 200 the solution was injected at low flow into the screened section and a recirculation was imposed continuously during the test at a rate of 1 l min 1 corresponding to 1 screen well bore volume per min lamontagne et al 2002 conductivity of the section was recorded with the consort multiparameter c3010 3 2 controlled flow in a natural aquifer results 3 2 1 tracer test the results of the two tracer tests are presented in fig 8 for the two tests peaks were observed at 19 h after the injection the distance between p2 and p3 is 38 5 cm the software trac was used in order to estimate the porosity and darcy flux gutierrez et al 2013 the comparison between modelled and measured value is shown in fig 8 and table 1 the presence of coarse sand and the calibration suggest that the range of porosity may be about 20 estimated by the software trac thus the mean of the darcy flux estimated is equal to 14 5 cm day 1 with an estimated standard deviation of 1 8 cm day 1 3 2 2 pfm results the hydraulic conductivity of the pfm granular activated carbon was measured at 3 5 10 3 m s 1 hatfield et al 2004 an aquifer pump test was conducted at the controlled field site using the cooper jacob calculation the aquifer k was estimated at 6 3 10 4 m s 1 eq 3 permits the calculation of the α coefficient equal to 1 69 the real darcy flux mean calculated in the controlled environment was 10 25 cm day 1 see parameters value in table 2 the standard deviation calculated from the four identical samples is 0 97 cm day 1 in an earlier field test annable et al 2005 reported uncertainty of 25 using this value for the comparison yields an error estimate of 2 5 cm day 1 fig 10 3 2 3 borehole dilution test the borehole dilution test is considered completed when a value lower than 25 of the initial added concentration is reached this value is represented by the sharp change of slope observed in fig 9 prior to the break in slope a continuous decrease is visible from 0 to 60 min and is used in the calculation of darcy flux a curve fit gave a slope of 0 04 min 1 equal to the value 2 v a π r the apparent velocity calculated was 290 cm day 1 with an α of 2 the darcy flux measured in p3 with the borehole dilution is estimated at 145 cm day 1 brouyère 2003 and brouyère et al 2008 defined qin and qcr in order to know the critical injection flow rate of tracer where qin is the tracer injection and qcr the critical flow rate if qcr q i n the dilution test is not valid and the transit flow rate is cancelled jamin et al 2015 7 qcr π q t where qt is the darcy flux estimated related to the flow section in our case the flow section corresponds to the screen length 60 cm and the well diameter 6 8 cm if we consider a darcy flux equal to 15 cm day 1 qcr is close to 1 l h 1 for the borehole dilution test 500 ml of tracer was injected over 350 min so the test is valid with regard to this point the high results of darcy flux with borehole dilution test might be explained by tracer density effects in the well 3 2 4 direct velocity tool with a permeability of 6 3 10 4 m s 1 for the controlled field site the coefficient alpha is equal to 1 54 for the dvt the mean darcy flux calculated using the dvt was 17 8 2 70 cm day 1 fig 10 the standard deviation was calculated using four identical dvt tests 3 3 contaminated site test background the dvt and pfm were field tested for comparison the field site selected presents a semi confined alluvial aquifer from the quaternary composed of i heterogeneous sand deposits from coarse to fine sand and ii local clay lenses the water table was measured 4 m below ground surface a clay unit was located from 7 50 to 9 50 m below surface and defined the bottom of the alluvial aquifer a pumping test showed a low hydraulic conductivity with an average of 5 10 6 m s 1 four wells with the same characteristics screened over a depth of 5 8 m and an 80 mm diameter were tested at this site wa1 wa2 wa3 and wa4 in fig 11 3 4 contaminated site test results at the contaminated study site six pfms each 1 m long were used to provide a vertical distribution of darcy flux two pfms were inserted in each of the wa1 and wa4 wells and one was inserted in each of the wa2 and wa3 wells in fig 12 pfm results are presented with the vertical distribution of darcy flux for each well the velocity ranges from 4 to 13 cm day 1 with a higher mean for wa1 9 cm day 1 and a lower for wa2 5 3 cm day 1 the piezometer wa1 had a high variation from 5 50 to 7 50 m with a higher velocity at a depth of 7 m dvt measurements were done only for one depth 6 50 7 00 m deep in order to test the repeatability k of the zone was estimated at 5 10 6 m s 1 so dvt and pfm had respectively an α coefficient equal to 1 89 and 2 dvt and pfm data were compared at the same depth between 6 50 and 7 00 m the dvt measured darcy flux varied from 4 to 8 1 0 cm day 1 standard deviation of 3 measurements at the same depth at the field site one sample for each depth was analysed thus an uncertainty of 25 was considered appropriate for these data annable et al 2005 the pfm measured darcy flux from 5 to 9 1 8 cm day 1 4 summary and discussion the direct velocity tool described in this paper is an innovative solution for groundwater measurement in wells dvt allows measurement of the magnitude of groundwater velocity at the centimetre per day scale and can be done at multiple depths in a single well measurements take 5 to 10 min for one measurement and the results are immediate no chemical analysis or substantial computer calculations contaminated sites are often located in heterogeneous zones with low velocity and k thus this limit is not considered an issue for many field applications the first tests conducted in the laboratory sand tank showed a linear response between darcy flux imposed and the darcy flux measured with a high correlation coefficient r2 0 990 the dvt was tested for velocities ranging from 5 to 30 cm day 1 and a higher standard deviation was observed for the higher velocities 6 46 cm day 1 for 30 cm day 1 also pvp and dvt was compared on a second sand tank and both showed close results in the controlled field tracer test borehole dilution pfm and dvt were tested under the same conditions results are summarized in table 3 for the controlled field site with an estimated k of 6 3 10 4 m s 1 pfm tracer test and dvt measured respectively velocities equal to 10 25 cm day 1 14 5 cm day 1 and 17 8 cm day 1 dvt and pfm have respectively an uncertainty of 2 70 cm day 1 and 2 50 cm day 1 which is close to the one given by the tracer test 1 8 cm day 1 the borehole dilution test overestimated the velocity by an order of magnitude 145 cm day 1 vs 10 15 cm day 1 labaky et al 2009 presented a velocity measurement comparison between pvp and other tools and the borehole dilution results showed a similar overestimation of the velocity this gap is probably due to i the density flow induced during the injection of the tracer and ii a inhomogeneous mixture between the tracer and groundwater the use of a peristaltic pump might not have provided sufficient mixing for the contaminated field site with an estimated hydraulic conductivity of 5 10 6 m s 1 pfm measured velocities of 5 9 cm day 1 dvt measured velocities of 4 8 cm day 1 the uncertainties of dvt and pfm velocity measurements were 1 0 and 1 8 cm day 1 respectively velocity measurement showed similar results in the controlled field test with pfm dvt and tracer tests and at the contaminated site with pfm and dvt table 3 although the measurement range tested covers a portion of the velocities expected under field site conditions brooks et al 2008 measurements will be conducted at other sites to evaluate an extend the darcy flux range and thus the capabilities of the dvt technique measurement at other sites will evaluate the robustness of the dvt and its application under different conditions dvt distortion simulation improved the definition of the limitations of the tool for an aquifer with a high hydraulic conductivity more than 2 10 3 m s 1 uncertainties will be greater further research is needed to evaluate the inlet system head loss in order to adapt the dvt for a higher range of darcy flux measurement additionally measurement using an alternate tracer could be a solution to avoid potential density effects in the well the dvt presents an interesting solution for darcy flux measurement in a well screen and can potentially provide a vertical distribution of horizontal darcy flux which is an important characteristic for better contaminant site management conflict of interest the authors declare no conflict of

8619,an innovative solution for groundwater velocity measurement in wells the direct velocity tool dvt is developed and tested the dvt allows measurement of darcy flux at centimeter scale vertical resolution requiring only a few minutes for each measurement typically 5 10 min results are generated in real time through the use of an equation the theoretical functional darcy flux range is between 1 and 40 cm day 1 for an aquifer with a hydraulic conductivity k less than 10 3 m s 1 laboratory tests showed a linear response between darcy flux imposed and darcy flux measured with the dvt with a high correlation coefficient r2 0 99 the dvt was tested for velocities ranging from 5 to 30 cm day 1 where a higher standard deviation was observed for higher velocity 6 46 cm day 1 for 30 cm day 1 at a hydraulically controlled field site tracer tests borehole dilutions passive flux meter pfm and dvt were tested under constant flow conditions the pfm tracer test and dvt technologies measured similar darcy flux ranging from 10 to 17 cm day 1 the dvt and pfm had uncertainties of 2 70 cm day 1 and 2 50 cm day 1 respectively at a contaminated field site velocities measured with the pfm range between 5 and 9 cm day 1 while the dvt provided velocities of 4 to 8 cm day 1 velocity measurement showed similar results at the contaminated field site between pfm and dvt the dvt offers an

laboratory and field comparison innovative 1 introduction velocity measurements are useful for a number of purposes in hydrogeological studies these measurements can be used to quantify recharge estimate clean up times design permeable reactive barriers characterize both groundwater and contaminant movement in aquifer systems devlin et al 2009 velocity can be represented by the darcy flux q as an apparent groundwater velocity or pore water velocity both are quite important for site management the velocity referenced in this study corresponds to the darcy flux darcy flux measurements have been increasingly used for the calculation of contamination mass flux at polluted sites and provide an important metric to understanding the transport mechanisms near source zones and to support remedial design serdp 2010 darcy flux can be calculated using darcy s law based on hydraulic conductivity k l t 1 the hydraulic gradient i dimensionless however a large uncertainty remains on the value of hydraulic conductivity and the spatial distribution of k ballard 1996 the most direct method for quantifying groundwater velocity estimation is a tracer test with this method several wells or monitoring points are necessary to observe tracer migration in order to estimate groundwater velocity this approach sees limited application due to the time and cost required labaky et al 2009 for the reasons stated above several tools and methods have been developed for darcy flux measurement at a single point in well or direct push the first method based on in well measurement found in the literature is the borehole dilution test drost et al 1968 halevy et al 1968 where the undisturbed groundwater flow in the aquifer is quantified based on the dilution of a tracer introduced into a screened well assuming steady groundwater flow and a homogeneous distribution of the tracer in the well a dilution rate is calculated in this approach the presence of vertical water flow in the well can disturb the mixing between tracer and groundwater thus maintaining a reliable measure of tracer concentration declines without disturbing the flow field is challenging drost et al 1968 a borehole dilution test was developed in an isolated section of a well in order to avoid the influence of vertical flow palmer 1993 and keeping the section well mixed due to the difficulties and limits of the borehole dilution test brouyère et al 2008 proposed a new method based on a tracer dilution called the finite volume point dilution method fvpdm the fvpdm is easy to implement in the field and the method can be conducted to provide temporal monitoring of darcy flux jamin et al 2015 compared the fvpdm to the basic borehole dilution test in a fractured aquifer they showed that the borehole dilution test provided a good darcy flux estimation if the mixing volume was precisely known the fvpdm method gave a better measurement of the darcy flux but required a longer duration measurement in the literature other in well tools with a direct darcy flux measurement of groundwater have been developed including the geoflometer kerfoot and massard 1985 which is based on thermal transmission in the open portion of the well screen the tool creates a heat pulse in the center of the well screen and movement of water induces a thermal signal proportional to the darcy flux the unit is best deployed with velocities greater than 50 cm day 1 the colloidal borescope kearl 1997 kearl et al 1999 is a tool employing direct observation of particles in the well screen these measured velocities are averaged to obtain a mean darcy flux the colloidal borescope is more effective for high velocities from the centimeter per day scale up to 2400 m day 1 kearl et al 1992 1999 kearl 1997 korte et al 2000 the laser doppler velocimeter momii et al 1993 measures the particle movement at the crossing point of two laser beams the velocity range is similar to the geoflometer geoflometer colloidal borescope and laser doppler velocimeter have a variable measurement range from 1 cm day 1 to 100 000 cm day 1 but have limitations at low velocity particularly due to vertical currents in the well similar to the borehole dilution test the passive flux meter hatfield et al 2004 pfm is a permeable cylinder that sorbs dissolved organic and inorganic contaminant and intercepts groundwater flow the detailed principle of the pfm will be presented later the pfm requires an exposure time in the field that can last from 1 to 4 weeks depending on the well diameter and groundwater velocity regarding in well measurements according to our best knowledge currently the most widely employed tools are the borehole dilution test to quantify darcy flux the pfm is increasing in use with more focus on measuring contaminant mass fluxes other tools do not require the installation of a well since the velocity is measured through direct contact with the aquifer material during a direct push investigation the in situ permeable flow sensor ballard et al 1996 uses a thermal perturbation technique this tool is a cylindrical heated device that is in contact with the porous media at the velocity measurement point if the water flux is uniform in the porous media groundwater fluxes causes a temperature distribution on the surface of the cylinder varying as a function of the direction and magnitude of groundwater flow velocity range from 0 5 to 90 cm day 1 the point velocity probe pvp devlin et al 2009 labaky et al 2007 2009 is composed of two half cylinders one is hollow and contains the injection detection system the other one half is solid and contains a groove to stabilize the injection line a small volume of tracer is introduced through the injection system and the velocity of the tracer is estimated based on arrival of the tracer at a detector one limit of the direct push methods is compaction of the aquifer materiel during installation changing the natural characteristic of the porous media also penetration of the tool could be difficult depending on the type of aquifer material a new device has been developed for applications in screened wells osorno and devlin 2017 and is called the in well point velocity probe iw pvp labaky et al 2009 compared the pvp with other tools for groundwater measurement the different tests were carried out in a natural aquifer confined by a sheet pile wall bounded cell applied darcy flux of 20 cm day 1 four methods were compared pvp geoflometer colloidal borescope and the borehole dilution test the intercomparison showed that the pvp and geoflometer had similar measurement results with a better value for the pvp the challenges noted with the pvp measurement were due to porous medium alteration during hammering installation that caused a negative bias for groundwater velocity measurement the borehole dilution experiment and colloidal borescope overestimated the groundwater velocity by an order of magnitude or more both methods are useful at higher velocities the main objective of this paper is to present an innovative tool for groundwater velocity measurement the direct velocity tool dvt which intends to provide an in well test a measurement without limitation due to vertical currents a direct natural gradient velocity measurement for relatively heterogeneous rates that are common in alluvial aquifers 5 cm day 1 to 100 cm day 1 a short measurement time of 5 10 min in this paper the dvt principle and method of application are first described the tool is then validated in the laboratory in a small 3d test box the tool is then compared to a tracer test a pfm and a borehole dilution test at a small scale field site test finally several measurements conducted at contaminated field sites are compared to pfm data 2 dvt development and validation 2 1 theory the dvt principle is based on measuring a combined homogeneously mixed flow of a known tracer solution and the natural gradient groundwater flux the dvt is constructed using a pvc tube reduced down to one third of the tube circumference that is pushed in close contact with the well screen through the use of pneumatic actuators fig 1 a b thus creating an intake window isolating a portion of the well screen more specifically the intake window is created using a thicker neoprene seal dark part on the dvt in fig 1b which is the only part pressed against the well screen the intake window makes it possible i to isolate a portion of the screen for measurement and ii to focus the groundwater flow toward the measurement sensor fig 2 to optimise the dvt measurement the screen must be located in the well however it s difficult to have this information so at first the dvt is oriented upgradient relative to the natural gradient flow direction four directions north east south and west are recommended for testing in order to estimate the highest darcy flux measurement 2 1 1 mixing principle as shown in fig 2 water from the aquifer flows through the intake window and exits at point a the groundwater flow travels through a short section of tubing before exiting at point b near the tubing inlet an injection port is installed at point c where groundwater is mixed with an injected tracer solution the mixed solution is then measured at the exit point b adopting a simple mass conservation and assuming the two flow streams are homogeneously mixed the flow of water from the aquifer can be calculated 1 q aquifer c aquifer q tracer c tracer q aquifer q tracer c mixing where q is flow rate l3 t 1 c is concentration or electrical conductivity if the tracer is a saline solution m l3 or µs cm 2 q aquifer can be calculated as c aquifer is measured before the test c tracer and q tracer are known and c mixing is measured during the test q tracer is very low between 2 and 4 ml min 1 to avoid a counterbalancing of q tracer in q aquifer depending on the site calibration of the tracer flux is modified when the outlet electrical conductivity is too close to that in the aquifer 2 1 2 physical configuration the dvt is composed of a one third section of pvc tube 63 mm diameter with two separate parts i the convex part which faces against the screen and includes a rubber layer around the perimeter in order to create the intake window and ii the concave part which forms the inlet system and device for velocity measurement employing an electrical conductivity sensor the intake window has a surface of 101 cm2 and a thickness of 2 mm the exit of the intake window is directly connected to the inlet of the tube component of the system the tube system was designed to produce a homogeneous tracer mixture which is measured at the end of the system from the top of the well casing the tracer solution is injected continuously using a peristaltic pump through a thin tube 4 mm inner diameter until the system reaches a steady state mixed concentration measured with an electrical conductivity meter thus allowing aquifer flow rate calculation eq 2 2 q d v t q t r a c e r c m i x i n g c t r a c e r c a q u i f e r c m i x i n g q d v t s i n t a k e w i n d o w where q dvt is the darcy flux from the dvt l t 1 and s is the intake window area l2 2 2 accuracy of the dvt 2 2 1 concept of flow distortion for a homogeneous permeable circular element in a locally homogeneous aquifer the contrast of hydraulic conductivity leads to a convergence or divergence of the aquifer flow strack and haitjema 1981 as an example the contrast in k between a pfm and the aquifer can produce converging flow through the well and the relation between the darcy flux in the pfm q pfm and the undisturbed aquifer darcy flux q aquifer can be defined annable et al 2005 3 q pfm q aquifer 2 k pfm k pfm k aquifer α where k aquifer is the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and k pfm the hydraulic conductivity of the pfm l t 1 this relationship between apparent darcy flux and undisturbed darcy flux is the factor α defined by drost et al 1968 this factor takes into consideration the flow field distortion by the well as influenced by the tool inserted into the well 2 2 2 dvt flow distortion modelling the flow distortion around the well was modelled with modflow usg unstructured grid using a triangular mesh parameters and description of the models are presented in the supporting information appendix a and b 2 2 2 1 distortion comparison for three cases the distortion created by an empty well screen a well screen with a pfm present and a well screen with a dvt installed was compared using the model with an aquifer k of 10 4 m s 1 and a darcy flux equal to 11 cm day 1 model results are presented in fig 3 the simulation shows that the dvt creates a distortion higher than both the pfm and the empty well screen calculation of the distortion considers the complete diameter of the well screen for the empty well and the pfm cases for the dvt the distortion considers the width of the intake window indeed the flux measured in the dvt is related to the size of the intake window 2 2 2 2 distortion calibration of the dvt different tests with the dvt were modelled in order to assess the limitations of the tool fig 4 shows the distribution of the dvt distortion for a range of darcy flux in function hydraulic conductivity an empirical fit was developed using the following equation where k is hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer l t 1 for a darcy flux range between 5 and 40 cm day 1 4 distortion c o e f f i c i e n t 0 7 exp 2300 k 200 k 1 2 this equation was used for the calculation of the dvt distortion with these results the dvt has limited application when the distortion is less than 1 so for an aquifer with a hydraulic conductivity higher than 2 10 3 m s 1 the distortion coefficient decreases rapidly which may limit the accuracy of the darcy flux measurement 2 3 dvt calibration in laboratory tests 2 3 1 background the dvt was first tested in a sand tank a 68 cm long 12 cm wide and 50 cm height fig 5 an 80 mm diameter screened well was installed in the centre of the sand box the box was packed with zones upstream and downstream using a gravel material to create constant head boundaries the main portion of the box was filled with coarse sand two clay zones were added between the box walls and the well screen in order to avoid water deviation around the well corresponding to an absence of distortion indeed in the sand box there is no distortion between the applied darcy flux and measured darcy flux in the well thus dvt calibration is not required using a peristaltic pump different flow rates were imposed in the system producing a homogeneous darcy flux dvt measurements were compared to the imposed darcy flux through the porous medium another calibration was conducted in a second laboratory tank system b 100 cm long 50 cm wide and 50 cm height at only two imposed velocities 16 cm day 1 and 26 cm day 1 to provide a comparison between pvp and dvt 2 3 2 results several flow rates were imposed in the laboratory sand tank a to provide a range of darcy fluxes six rates were tested with the dvt from 5 to 30 cm day 1 fig 6 as shown in fig 6 measurements are repeatable and proportional to the flow rate imposed for the six rates tested however for the higher darcy fluxes imposed the measurements had a higher standard deviation with no simple explanation in the second sand tank measured values by pvp were 23 2 3 and 30 3 cm day 1 porosity 0 40 for an imposed darcy flux of 16 and 26 cm day 1 while the dvt velocities were 25 6 1 and 31 6 cm day 1 for the same imposed darcy flux this additional comparison generally supports measurements between pvp and dvt 3 dvt field applications 3 1 controlled flow in a natural aquifer background for validation the dvt was deployed in a natural unconfined aquifer for comparison with other velocity methods this aquifer is localised in bordeaux france on a plio quaternary formation with a thickness of 6 m this formation is composed of variable medium sands the bottom of the aquifer is delimited by a clay aquitard and the water level was measured at 2 80 m below ground surface the test was conducted using several wells shown in fig 7 p1 p2 p4 and p5 are screened over a depth of 5 6 m with the bottom at the clay layer the measurement point p3 is screened from 5 to 5 60 m depth pumping in p5 and injection in p1 was imposed in order to have a controlled flow field the flow rate for the controlled zone was 75 l h 1 and was imposed continuously during the three weeks period of testing tracer test borehole dilution test pfm and dvt p3 was used for measurements in the center of the imposed flow 3 1 1 tracer test for the tracer test a nacl solution of 1 g l 1 was used two tracer tests pulses 40 l and 20 l were injected for different durations 5 and 2 50 min for comparison the saline solution was injected at the bottom of the piezometer p2 at a flow rate of 8 l min 1 a continuous low recirculation was set in p3 using a peristaltic pump in order to homogenise the concentration and continuously measure the electrical conductivity of the water consort multiparameter c3010 3 1 2 pfm setup the pfm is a cylinder composed of granular activated carbon gac and provides both contaminant mass flux and darcy flux measurements the pfm is inserted into a well and allows groundwater flux through the device after an exposure time from 1 to 4 weeks the pfm is removed and sampled for analysis the pfm activated carbon is initially impregnated with five alcohols and their loss ratio is proportional to groundwater flux and provides darcy flux through calculation the mass of all contaminant intercepted by the sorbent is also analysed and contaminant mass flux is calculated for this study only the resident alcohols are used for darcy flux estimation a pfm with a length of 15 cm and diameter of 6 8 cm was constructed for the field tests the pfm parameters and design were implemented based on hatfield et al 2004 for the experimental design four alcohol were used methanol ethanol isopropyl alcohol and n hexanol to produce a 15 cm long pfm more than 200 g of activated carbon was prepared an initial sample of the activated carbon was taken in order to compare with samples exposed to groundwater flow after pfm exposure the relative mass is calculated for darcy flux estimation the pfm was inserted in p3 at 5 40 m depth for a period of 6 days all the gac was recovered and mixed to homogenize the samples initial and final gac samples were analysed using gcms with a 5 sil ms column isopropyl alcohol was analysed for this test on four identical samples the relative mass calculated with isopropyl alcohol was higher than 0 3 µg l 1 µg l 1 which allows use of the simplified form for darcy flux calculation annable et al 2005 5 q aquifer 1 67 r θ r d 1 m r α t where q aquifer is darcy flux l t 1 r l is radius of the pfm cylinder θ is the water content in the pfm dimensionless r d is the retardation factor of the resident tracer used isopropyl alcohol in this case dimensionless m r is relative mass of tracer remaining in the pfm sorbent m α the distortion coefficient and t is pfm time of exposure t 3 1 3 borehole dilution test the borehole dilution approach is based on a simple assumption that the decreasing tracer concentration injected in the test interval is proportional to the apparent velocity and directly to the darcy flux this method requires i a steady state flow ii a homogeneous mix between the tracer and the water tested iii no density gradient induced by the tracer piccinini et al 2016 in the well after homogeneous mixing the tracer concentration c decreases according to freeze and cherry 1979 6 dc dt a v a c w where a is the cross section of the groundwater flow l2 v a the apparent velocity l t 1 and w the dilution volume l3 the velocity in the aquifer is calculated using an appropriate α as the pfm or dvt in this case the conditions of the controlled field sand lead to a converging factor of 2 drost et al 1968 in general the borehole dilution test is conducted within a single isolated section here the piezometer used for the dilution test p3 has a single screen with a length of 60 cm and 68 mm diameter therefore the test satisfy this criterium a nacl solution was used as a tracer with a concentration of 1 g l 1 and an injected volume of 500 ml during 350 min in order to increase the salinity in the well from 50 to 200 the solution was injected at low flow into the screened section and a recirculation was imposed continuously during the test at a rate of 1 l min 1 corresponding to 1 screen well bore volume per min lamontagne et al 2002 conductivity of the section was recorded with the consort multiparameter c3010 3 2 controlled flow in a natural aquifer results 3 2 1 tracer test the results of the two tracer tests are presented in fig 8 for the two tests peaks were observed at 19 h after the injection the distance between p2 and p3 is 38 5 cm the software trac was used in order to estimate the porosity and darcy flux gutierrez et al 2013 the comparison between modelled and measured value is shown in fig 8 and table 1 the presence of coarse sand and the calibration suggest that the range of porosity may be about 20 estimated by the software trac thus the mean of the darcy flux estimated is equal to 14 5 cm day 1 with an estimated standard deviation of 1 8 cm day 1 3 2 2 pfm results the hydraulic conductivity of the pfm granular activated carbon was measured at 3 5 10 3 m s 1 hatfield et al 2004 an aquifer pump test was conducted at the controlled field site using the cooper jacob calculation the aquifer k was estimated at 6 3 10 4 m s 1 eq 3 permits the calculation of the α coefficient equal to 1 69 the real darcy flux mean calculated in the controlled environment was 10 25 cm day 1 see parameters value in table 2 the standard deviation calculated from the four identical samples is 0 97 cm day 1 in an earlier field test annable et al 2005 reported uncertainty of 25 using this value for the comparison yields an error estimate of 2 5 cm day 1 fig 10 3 2 3 borehole dilution test the borehole dilution test is considered completed when a value lower than 25 of the initial added concentration is reached this value is represented by the sharp change of slope observed in fig 9 prior to the break in slope a continuous decrease is visible from 0 to 60 min and is used in the calculation of darcy flux a curve fit gave a slope of 0 04 min 1 equal to the value 2 v a π r the apparent velocity calculated was 290 cm day 1 with an α of 2 the darcy flux measured in p3 with the borehole dilution is estimated at 145 cm day 1 brouyère 2003 and brouyère et al 2008 defined qin and qcr in order to know the critical injection flow rate of tracer where qin is the tracer injection and qcr the critical flow rate if qcr q i n the dilution test is not valid and the transit flow rate is cancelled jamin et al 2015 7 qcr π q t where qt is the darcy flux estimated related to the flow section in our case the flow section corresponds to the screen length 60 cm and the well diameter 6 8 cm if we consider a darcy flux equal to 15 cm day 1 qcr is close to 1 l h 1 for the borehole dilution test 500 ml of tracer was injected over 350 min so the test is valid with regard to this point the high results of darcy flux with borehole dilution test might be explained by tracer density effects in the well 3 2 4 direct velocity tool with a permeability of 6 3 10 4 m s 1 for the controlled field site the coefficient alpha is equal to 1 54 for the dvt the mean darcy flux calculated using the dvt was 17 8 2 70 cm day 1 fig 10 the standard deviation was calculated using four identical dvt tests 3 3 contaminated site test background the dvt and pfm were field tested for comparison the field site selected presents a semi confined alluvial aquifer from the quaternary composed of i heterogeneous sand deposits from coarse to fine sand and ii local clay lenses the water table was measured 4 m below ground surface a clay unit was located from 7 50 to 9 50 m below surface and defined the bottom of the alluvial aquifer a pumping test showed a low hydraulic conductivity with an average of 5 10 6 m s 1 four wells with the same characteristics screened over a depth of 5 8 m and an 80 mm diameter were tested at this site wa1 wa2 wa3 and wa4 in fig 11 3 4 contaminated site test results at the contaminated study site six pfms each 1 m long were used to provide a vertical distribution of darcy flux two pfms were inserted in each of the wa1 and wa4 wells and one was inserted in each of the wa2 and wa3 wells in fig 12 pfm results are presented with the vertical distribution of darcy flux for each well the velocity ranges from 4 to 13 cm day 1 with a higher mean for wa1 9 cm day 1 and a lower for wa2 5 3 cm day 1 the piezometer wa1 had a high variation from 5 50 to 7 50 m with a higher velocity at a depth of 7 m dvt measurements were done only for one depth 6 50 7 00 m deep in order to test the repeatability k of the zone was estimated at 5 10 6 m s 1 so dvt and pfm had respectively an α coefficient equal to 1 89 and 2 dvt and pfm data were compared at the same depth between 6 50 and 7 00 m the dvt measured darcy flux varied from 4 to 8 1 0 cm day 1 standard deviation of 3 measurements at the same depth at the field site one sample for each depth was analysed thus an uncertainty of 25 was considered appropriate for these data annable et al 2005 the pfm measured darcy flux from 5 to 9 1 8 cm day 1 4 summary and discussion the direct velocity tool described in this paper is an innovative solution for groundwater measurement in wells dvt allows measurement of the magnitude of groundwater velocity at the centimetre per day scale and can be done at multiple depths in a single well measurements take 5 to 10 min for one measurement and the results are immediate no chemical analysis or substantial computer calculations contaminated sites are often located in heterogeneous zones with low velocity and k thus this limit is not considered an issue for many field applications the first tests conducted in the laboratory sand tank showed a linear response between darcy flux imposed and the darcy flux measured with a high correlation coefficient r2 0 990 the dvt was tested for velocities ranging from 5 to 30 cm day 1 and a higher standard deviation was observed for the higher velocities 6 46 cm day 1 for 30 cm day 1 also pvp and dvt was compared on a second sand tank and both showed close results in the controlled field tracer test borehole dilution pfm and dvt were tested under the same conditions results are summarized in table 3 for the controlled field site with an estimated k of 6 3 10 4 m s 1 pfm tracer test and dvt measured respectively velocities equal to 10 25 cm day 1 14 5 cm day 1 and 17 8 cm day 1 dvt and pfm have respectively an uncertainty of 2 70 cm day 1 and 2 50 cm day 1 which is close to the one given by the tracer test 1 8 cm day 1 the borehole dilution test overestimated the velocity by an order of magnitude 145 cm day 1 vs 10 15 cm day 1 labaky et al 2009 presented a velocity measurement comparison between pvp and other tools and the borehole dilution results showed a similar overestimation of the velocity this gap is probably due to i the density flow induced during the injection of the tracer and ii a inhomogeneous mixture between the tracer and groundwater the use of a peristaltic pump might not have provided sufficient mixing for the contaminated field site with an estimated hydraulic conductivity of 5 10 6 m s 1 pfm measured velocities of 5 9 cm day 1 dvt measured velocities of 4 8 cm day 1 the uncertainties of dvt and pfm velocity measurements were 1 0 and 1 8 cm day 1 respectively velocity measurement showed similar results in the controlled field test with pfm dvt and tracer tests and at the contaminated site with pfm and dvt table 3 although the measurement range tested covers a portion of the velocities expected under field site conditions brooks et al 2008 measurements will be conducted at other sites to evaluate an extend the darcy flux range and thus the capabilities of the dvt technique measurement at other sites will evaluate the robustness of the dvt and its application under different conditions dvt distortion simulation improved the definition of the limitations of the tool for an aquifer with a high hydraulic conductivity more than 2 10 3 m s 1 uncertainties will be greater further research is needed to evaluate the inlet system head loss in order to adapt the dvt for a higher range of darcy flux measurement additionally measurement using an alternate tracer could be a solution to avoid potential density effects in the well the dvt presents an interesting solution for darcy flux measurement in a well screen and can potentially provide a vertical distribution of horizontal darcy flux which is an important characteristic for better contaminant site management conflict of interest the authors declare no conflict of
