3130,chloride cl based tracing methods are popular for deep drainage or potential groundwater recharge estimation in the unsaturated zone but uncertainties in various such methods have rarely been investigated we collected 1827 samples from 24 soil profiles under plants with shallow or deep root systems in the thick unsaturated loess deposits of china and measured soil water cl and tritium contents with the drainage estimated with the tritium peak method as reference we evaluated the applicability of several cl based approaches for drainage estimation under shallow and deep rooted plants including the chloride mass balance method cmb chloride storage method cs chloride peak method cp and chloride water mass balance method cwmb the estimated deep drainages varied with methods and the uncertainties were large with a coefficient of variation of 0 71 compared to the drainage obtained from tritium based methods 33 6 11 2 and 9 6 14 5 mm year 1 under shallow and deep rooted plants respectively cmb and cs 38 0 16 6 and 36 7 17 6 mm year 1 performed better than cp 23 2 17 8 mm year 1 under shallow rooted plants while cwmb 7 6 13 9 mm year 1 performed better under deep

induced soil water depletion can enrich soil cl concentration and greatly influence cmb and cp our findings provide insights for how to estimate deep drainage through appropriate methods keywords deep drainage estimation tritium peak method chloride based tracing methods different vegetation types deep loess profiles data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction deep drainage can largely influence the sustainability of groundwater resources however estimating deep drainage is challenging and urgent eckhardt and ulbrich 2003 reinecke et al 2021 rushton and ward 1979 chloride cl with its high solubility and stability is a good tracer in investigating hydrological processes in the unsaturated and saturated zones allison and hughes 1978 cl based tracing methods have been widely used to track soil water movement groundwater recharge and hydroclimatic reconstruction in dry regions cheng et al 2021 edmunds and tyler 2002 scanlon et al 2007 focusing on the process in the unsaturated or saturated zones the drainage potentially or actually reaching the water table can be investigated huang et al 2019 scanlon et al 2002 the evolution of deep drainage can also be monitored to observe the effects of environmental changes e g vegetation or climate cook et al 1992 deng et al 2017 tan et al 2017 despite the wide range of applications cl based tracing methods yield large uncertainties in estimated deep drainage scanlon 2000 scanlon et al 2002 and should be further refined to more accurately estimate deep drainage cl based tracing methods for the saturated zone consider the cl mass balance between different input sources and groundwater and can estimate actual groundwater recharge through two or three component mass balance methods huang et al 2019 li et al 2017 however cl based tracing for the unsaturated zone is much more complicated since there are multiple methods with different theoretical backgrounds and these methods are sensitive to variations in environmental factors they comprise two main methodological groups the first group of methods calculates deep drainage based on the mass balance of cl records within the unsaturated zone i e input output and residue and includes the chloride mass balance method cmb guan et al 2013 scanlon et al 2007 chloride storage method cs tyler et al 1996 and chloride water mass balance method cwmb zhang et al 2018 cheng et al 2021 the other group emphasizes the transport or displacement of cl with soil water through the unsaturated zone and includes the chloride peak method cp huang et al 2016 huang et al 2019 and chloride front displacement method cfd scanlon et al 2007 walker et al 1991 although cl based tracing methods are popular for estimating deep drainage in the unsaturated zone few studies have investigated the uncertainties associated with them the scarce comparison of results across different methods over different regions hinders the application of cl based tracing technology huang et al 2017 in particular some methods are applied in the same way to estimate deep drainage under differing vegetation types ignoring differences in root water uptake and its effects on water infiltration and solute transport for example the conversion from shallow to deep rooted plants may increase soil water consumption and enrich cl concentrations ginn and murphy 1997 which decreases the estimation accuracy of using cl based methods however few studies have systematically evaluated the suitability of cl based methods in estimating deep drainage under different vegetation types the other limitation in uncertainty evaluation is the lack of reliable standards by which to compare results from different methods tritium 3h an isotopic tracer contained in water that tracks the movement of water suess 1969 can directly estimate drainage without precipitation dependency or being subject to the limitations of exogenous cl inputs cook et al 1994 li et al 2019c morgenstern et al 2010 with isotopic signals from nuclear bomb testing 3h deposited in soils has been widely used to investigate soil water movement and historical deep drainage records cartwright et al 2017 cook et al 1994 li and si 2018 however 3h profiles cannot be found in most areas of the world now firstly the soils in most regions have limited depths and the 3h deposition from nuclear bomb testing has already been flushed out secondly the decay of radioactive tritium 12 3 years has resulted in the tritium kurtosis closing to background levels as such the current presence of 3h kurtosis gradients in the unsaturated zone from historical nuclear bombing is limited in most regions and will keep decreasing fortunately the clear 3h profiles reported in the loess deposits of china in recent years provide a good opportunity to trace hydrological processes and evaluate the uncertainties of cl based methods in drainage estimation lin and wei 2006 which will provide useful information for method selection this study aims to evaluate the uncertainties of various cl based tracing approaches in estimating deep drainage in the unsaturated zones by using cl and 3h records in the loess deposit in china with the thickest loess deposits up to 350 m the loess buffer zone greatly delays the response of groundwater to rainfall and stores large amount of historical cl and 3h signatures li et al 2019c lin and wei 2006 which provides a good platform for investigating soil hydrological processes specifically we will focus on the following questions i how uncertain is the estimated deep drainage from soil records using the various cl based tracing approaches ii why do these levels of uncertainty exist in the cl based tracing methods iii how to select appropriate methods for drainage estimation under different vegetation types to our knowledge this is the first study that systematically evaluates the uncertainties and applicability of various cl based tracing methods in drainage estimation which will provide technical support to other studies related to soil hydrological processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is china s loess plateau fig 1 a along the northwest southeast direction the climate transitions from arid to subhumid with annual mean rainfall ranging between 140 and 680 mm year 1 soil types vary from coarse sand to fine clay zhu et al 1983 the quaternary loess composed of malan lishi and wucheng loess from top to bottom hierarchically covers the horizontal neogene mudstone beds huang et al 2016 the tableland defined as a flat elevated part of the broader plateau region is deeply cut by gullies to the bedrock and thus undergoes relatively simple hydrological processes without lateral inputs from rivers rainfall is the only source of groundwater recharge in non irrigated areas li et al 2017 and the largest depth to the groundwater table is 100 m this study selected five typical loess tablelands along the west east direction located in the counties of haiyuan hiy dingbian db changwu cw luochuan lc and daning dn respectively for the five locations the elevation range is 1017 1950 m and the mean annual precipitations and temperatures are 359 622 mm and 7 7 11 0 respectively table s1 the main vegetation types are farmland and apple orchard malus pumila mill in cw lc and dn while they are farmland grassland apricot orchards armeniaca sibirica l poplars populus l and salix salix cheilophila in db and hiy the fertilizers applied in the farmlands and apple orchards include urea compound fertilizers and organic fertilizers of which potassium chloride kcl fertilizer was applied starting in 1993 huang et al 2016 as typical rainfed agricultural areas all sampling sites have flat topography without irrigation and runoff can be ignored 2 2 sample collection and analysis soil samples were collected at each location under various vegetation types in 2015 2020 table s1 in total 1827 samples from 24 soil profiles up to a depth of 10 20 m were obtained by using a hollow stem hand auger at a 20 cm interval for each location shallow and deep rooted plants were both considered specifically the shallow rooted plants root length 2 m include farmlands and grasslands while the deep rooted plants with different stand ages of 8 51 years include woodlands such as apple apricot and peach orchards poplar and shrublands such as salix and caragana despite the differences in growing rates of deep rooted plants the root depths overall increase with stand ages song et al 2018 we defined 2 m as the lower threshold root depth for deep rooted plants in accordance with previous studies song et al 2018 børja et al 2008 li et al 2021 li et al 2019a wang et al 2019 however the definition of the deepest root depth for deep rooted plants would not influence this study the impacts of the rooting systems will be examined by comparing the soil water profiles under shallow and deep rooted plants to ensure that the assumptions of method are satisfied the distances between sampling sites in the same location are 100 m to ensure similar climactic soil and geological conditions soil samples were used to determine gravimetric soil water content using the oven drying method and to determine tritium contents in soil water after the soil water was extracted with a vacuum condensation extraction system li 2100 china the dried soil samples were further used to measure cl content in the soil pore water through extraction of a 1 5 ratio of soil to deionized water ion chromatography ics 1100 thermal fisher scientific usa and low background liquid scintillation counter quantulus 1220 perkinelmer singapore were employed to measure cl and 3h contents respectively 2 3 estimating deep drainage 2 3 1 estimating drainage under shallow rooted plants assuming that piston flow characterizes the downward infiltration of soil water and dissolved cl the average drainage can be obtained through three methods under shallow rooted plants grassland or farmland chloride mass balance method cmb chloride storage method cs and chloride peak method cp table 1 the methods based on mass balance theory i e cmb and cs require the quantification of each cl input source such as the atmospheric cl deposition and cl fertilizer application and the unknown inputs should be excluded as the application rate of fertilizer was not easy to be obtained we attempted to exclude the impact of fertilizer application on cmb and cs by using the profiles below a certain depth that should not contain any cl from fertilizer fig 2 to do this we first used the tritium peak method tp to estimate the main infiltration rates and then determined the ages of soil water at different depths under fertilized sites after getting the depth zc of water from the 1993 precipitation i e the year starting kcl fertilizer application only the profiles below that depth were studied in order to eliminate the impact of fertilizer application fig 2c the aforementioned methods for estimating deep drainage are detailed as follows the result of the tritium peak method tp is used as a reference to evaluate the cl based tracing methods in the case of soil water infiltration as piston flow soil water storage above the 3h peak depth is recorded as precipitation input since 1963 allison and hughes 1978 tp can be used to obtain the average drainage since 1963 according to the distance za zb and time t1 of 3h peak movement and the average volumetric soil water content θ during t1 eq 1 fig 2 the chloride mass balance method cmb was originally used to calculate soil water flux and recharge eriksson and khunakasem 1969 based on cl mass balance between atmospheric inputs p clp and soil leaching r cls eq 2 fig 2 it uses several assumptions 1 atmospheric deposition including wet and dry deposition is the only source of cl input 2 transport of cl is one dimensional vertical and steady state and 3 cl is geochemically unreactive and hardly adsorbed if the exogenous cl inputs are known then assumption 1 is unnecessary for the chloride storage method cs the cumulative curves of soil water content wt and cl content cst vary with depths tyler et al 1996 if the atmospheric cl flux p clp is known the time t for cl or soil water accumulation can be calculated through dividing cumulative cl in the unsaturated zone by atmospheric cl flux then deep drainage can be estimated with eq 3 cs uses the same assumptions as cmb the chloride peak method cp has a similar theoretical background as tp huang et al 2016 si and de jong 2007 deep drainage can be estimated via the distance zc za and time t1 t2 of cl peak displacement since 1993 and the average volumetric soil water content θ eq 4 fig 2 cp is widely used to estimate drainage in fertilized land as the cl peak can be easily obtained 2 3 2 estimating drainage under deep rooted plants mass balance methods for drainage estimation may be inaccurate if significant root uptake water occurs thus it is difficult to directly employ such methods under deep rooted plants we obtained the reference drainage amounts by combining the tritium peak method with water balance method tp wb eq 5 table 1 i e extracting the drainage amount under shallow rooted plants using tp by the mean change in soil water storage induced by root water uptake rs ss sd t fig 3 similarly another combination of chloride mass balance with water balance method cwmb eq 6 was developed which extracts the drainage amount under shallow rooted plants using cmb by the mean reduction in soil water storage from land use change the three methods for shallow rooted plants were also used i e cmb cs and cp for deep rooted plants but the depth profile was carefully selected to exclude the impact of root uptake accounting to soil water profiles 2 3 3 atmospheric chloride deposition acd concentration evaluating the long term average acd is essential for the use of cl based tracing methods in recharge estimation but difficult due to limited observational data even though data are available at a few sites for a few years they cannot represent the long term average davies and crosbie 2018 to solve this problem we inversely estimated these values with the information recorded by the deep soil profiles according to the conceptual model in fig 2 briefly the tritium peak depth was used to partition the soil profiles into two sub profiles i e the upper profile from soil surface to peak depth and the lower profile from peak depth to sampling depth the upper profile contains the acd from 1963 to the sampling year and can be used to estimate the flux and concentration of acd from 1963 to the sampling year specifically the cl stored in the upper profile can be directly used to estimate the annual average acd flux by dividing by the period length subsequently the acd concentration can be estimated through dividing the average flux by average precipitation with this method all depositions dry or wet are considered the reconstructed acd at lc cw dn db and hiy were 0 45 0 63 0 47 2 69 and 2 68 mg l 1 respectively table s1 they are close to the ranges found by the limited observations during recent several years i e 1 4 0 3 0 7 0 1 0 9 0 5 3 2 0 5 and 3 4 0 3 mg l 1 respectively which supports the reliability of the reconstructed long term average acd concentration 2 4 uncertainty analysis the uncertainties of estimating deep drainage can be attributed to two aspects i e model uncertainty and parameter uncertainty the first source of uncertainty stems from differences between methods as mentioned above the tritium based methods i e tp for shallow rooted plants and tp wb for deep rooted plants were used as references to evaluate the uncertainties of the cl based tracing methods specifically direct comparison and analysis of variance anova were applied to explore the difference of the various methods the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse and root mean square error rmse were employed to evaluate model performance relative to reference a nse value closer to 1 0 suggests a model with larger predictive value while a lower rmse value indicates a better fit to the reference the second source of uncertainty originates from model parameters specifically the variables in eq 1 6 can introduce errors because of temporal variability in annual precipitation vertical variability in soil water and cl content we use the following error propagation analysis to quantify the uncertainties eq 7 8 7 σ y f x 1 2 σ x 1 2 f x 2 2 σ x 2 2 f x n 2 σ xn 2 if f x i a i i 1 2 n then 8 σ y a 1 2 σ x 1 2 a 2 2 σ x 2 2 a n 2 σ xn 2 where σ is the uncertainty of the related variation standard deviation ai is the parameter of the error propagation 3 results 3 1 soil profiles the vertical variability of soil water cl and 3h contents were shown in fig 4 soil water contents varied with depth because of climate effects in the shallow layers while vegetation and soil texture affect in deep layers sándor et al 2021 wang et al 2013 soil water contents were similarly distributed under shallow rooted plants with an average of 0 26 0 03 0 25 0 02 0 18 0 04 0 14 0 05 and 0 18 0 03 cm3 cm 3 in lc cw dn db and hiy respectively under deep rooted plants the average soil water contents were 0 21 0 02 0 22 0 02 0 13 0 03 0 12 0 05 and 0 10 0 04 cm3 cm 3 respectively the water contents under deep rooted plants were much lower than those under shallow rooted plants in particular the conversion from shallow to deep rooted plants decreased soil water storage by 8 51 the cl profiles resembled parabolic curves under different vegetation types fig 4 cl contents peaked between 0 and 6 m and stabilized below 6 m with an average of 19 0 10 0 mg l 1 for each location cl contents in the stable layers followed the order of 17 4 8 0 mg l 1 lc 19 7 9 7 mg l 1 cw 20 7 12 2 mg l 1 dn 24 7 7 7 mg l 1 db 38 7 15 7 mg l 1 hiy which appears to increase with drier climates the 3h profiles had obvious dispersion peaks at depths contents of 8 5 m 57 2 tu 7 2 m 45 1 tu 8 8 m 74 4 tu 22 m 91 3 tu and 7 3 m 65 4 tu for lc cw dn db and hiy respectively the clear peaks and steady states in deep layers for cl and 3h profiles suggest that rainfall infiltration was predominantly characterized by piston flow which supports the reliability of applying 3h and cl based tracing methods to estimate deep drainage 3 2 deep drainage estimation the estimated deep drainage were 0 50 1 0 68 1 0 33 9 4 0 55 0 and 0 34 7 mm year 1 in lc cw dn db and hiy accounting for 0 8 1 0 11 6 0 7 3 1 2 17 0 and 0 9 7 of mean annual precipitation respectively table s2 the estimated drainage varied with the various methods fig 5 specifically the values from tp tp wb cmb cs cp and cwmb were 0 55 0 9 0 68 1 6 8 66 3 3 9 61 7 and 0 68 1 mm year 1 with averages of 18 6 17 7 27 6 14 6 25 9 15 5 22 2 15 3 and 19 0 21 0 mm year 1 respectively deep drainage varied with vegetation types fig 5 table s2 for shallow rooted plants drainage estimates obtained from cmb and cs 38 0 16 6 and 36 7 17 6 mm year 1 were close to those from tp 33 6 11 2 mm year 1 but were higher than those from cp 23 2 17 8 mm year 1 table s2 however the results estimated by the three cl based methods had no significant difference from tp p 0 05 with regard to deep rooted plants the average drainage estimation was 9 6 14 5 mm year 1 using tp wb which was reduced by 71 relative to that under shallow rooted plants the average estimations from cmb cs cp and cwmb were 21 3 8 9 19 5 10 0 21 6 14 2 and 7 6 13 9 mm year 1 respectively the results estimated with tp wb were not significantly different from those of cwmb p 0 05 but were significantly different from the other three methods p 0 01 3 3 method performance with tp tp wb as reference cwmb 19 0 21 0 mm year 1 gave results close to tp tp wb 18 6 17 7 mm year 1 with r2 and nse larger than 0 72 and 0 62 but rmse smaller than 10 7 fig 6 the estimated deep drainages from the other three methods i e cmb and cs and cp 27 6 14 6 and 25 9 15 5 and 22 2 15 3 mm year 1 were much larger than tp tp wb the results of cmb and cs were significantly related to that of tp tp wb r2 0 42 p 0 01 however the lower rmse and higher nse of cs 15 3 and 0 22 implied that it performed better than cmb nevertheless the results of cp had insignificant correlations with the reference method p 0 05 with r2 and nse of 0 14 and 0 89 respectively for different plants the highest nse and lowest rmse were obtained with cmb for shallow rooted plant i e 0 27 and 9 6 and cwmb for deep rooted plants i e 0 87 and 4 8 which suggests that depending on vegetation types cmb or cwmb may be the most accurate methods for deep drainage estimation 4 discussion 4 1 why do the estimated drainage vary with method the various cl based tracing methods yielded quite different results with a coefficient of variation cv of 0 71 particularly the variability was stronger under deep rooted plants cv 0 75 than that under shallow rooted plants cv 0 52 the discrepancy in the estimation is mainly attributed to the extent of each method meeting the methodological theory the peak displacement methods are suitable for estimating deep drainage under shorter time scales since they depend on the historical information of tracer application si and de jong 2007 however the methods emphasizing cl mass balance is more suitable for longer time scales since they need to sample long periods to cover the variability of atmospheric deposition allison et al 1994 feth 1981 kaandorp et al 2021 therefore the time scales of representation can introduce larger uncertainties to the peak displacement methods in this study the peak displacement methods i e cp were able to yield results covering the period from 1963 3h or 1993 cl to the sampling years but the mass balance methods i e cmb cs and cwmb presented results of a period dating back to hundreds or thousands of years fig 2 the realized extent of climate variability differs depending on the length of the period being studied and shorter time periods may result in larger uncertainties the large discrepancy of the peak displacement method i e cp relative to the reference may also stem from tracer characteristics the tp tp wb methods can effectively estimate the average deep drainage between 1963 and the sampling year because tritium is a composition of water subject to less perturbation than cl in comparison cp depends on the shape of cl profile formed during the transport process walker et al 1991 cl is transported with water as a solute so the shape of the cl profile can be influenced by various environmental factors e g climate soil vegetation and anthropogenic activities for example precipitation in china from 1984 to 2009 was mostly lower than the long term average value while the temperature increased along an upward trend peng et al 2019 the resulting drier climate may alter the atmospheric chloride concentration li et al 2019b li et al 2015 causing some discrepancies when estimating drainage using cl tracers furthermore compared with 3h tracers anion exclusion may introduce some uncertainties gvirtzman and gorelick 1991 james and rubin 1986 mcmahon and thomas 1974 si and de jong 2007 for example the cl peak depths from observation or inversely calculated by the 3h peak method are different in the same profiles in this study 1 0 5 2 m vs 4 2 10 4 m in this study the cl based methods are sensitive to exogenous cl sources e g kcl fertilizer application cmb cs and cwmb should be used only if atmospheric cl depositions and exogenous cl inputs are known walker et al 1991 in this study fertilizer effects were excluded by dating the soil water age and the estimated deep drainages from these three methods were thus close to tp tp wb under different vegetation types especially cwmb figs 5 6 however cp is applicable to fertilized sites as it tracks the cl peak established in 1993 huang et al 2016 scanlon et al 2007 walker et al 1991 for example under shallow rooted plants the estimations of cp were relatively close to those of tp at lc cw dn and hiy only farmland fig 7 a 4 2 how does vegetation type influence the accuracy of cl based methods in this study the deep drainages under shallow higher and deep rooted lower plants were significantly different p 0 05 fig 5 table s2 the change from shallow to deep rooted plants decreased the drainage by 71 44 47 7 and 80 using tp tp wb cmb cs cp and cwmb respectively the impacts of vegetation change on deep drainage can be attributed to the plant soil interaction huang et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 li et al 2022 the conversion to deep rooted plants enhances plant transpiration which reduces soil water storage because of their more developed root systems knighton et al 2020 maxwell and condon 2016 shi et al 2021 subsequently the soil water depletion increases the soil cl concentration which violates the underlying assumptions of these methods and affects the accuracy of cmb and cp for example cmb can effectively estimate deep drainage under shallow rooted plants with results similar to tp 38 0 16 6 vs 33 6 11 2 mm year 1 fig 5 table s2 however under deep rooted plants although we tried to exclude the upper part of the low soil water profile that contains high cl contents using only the deeper layers under steady state wood 1999 it still resulted in a significant difference from tp wb 21 3 8 9 vs 9 6 14 5 mm year 1 these results suggest that root water uptake occurs at deeper depths than expected by contrast cwmb considers the soil water depletion from root water uptake it combines the cmb based estimation under shallow rooted plants with the effects of decreased water storage under deep rooted plants figs 3 8 which greatly reduce the uncertainty of estimation results due to root effect zhang et al 2018 this comparison suggests that the direct application of cmb and cp to drainage estimation under deep rooted plants should be done with caution 4 3 selecting the appropriate method although cl based tracing methods can provide historical climatic or hydrological information on various time scales cook et al 1992 the various methodological uncertainties should be considered firstly deep drainage derived from cl based tracing methods may be controlled by climate soil and or vegetation at different periods specifically cp estimates the average for the recent 30 years in this study while the other three methods estimate the average over a longer period fig 2 thus combining cp and cmb or directly using cs or cwmb can reveal temporal variations in deep drainage however it should be noted that the mixing effect of percolated water in adjacent layers cannot represent the drainage at the expected time deng et al 2015 edmunds and gaye 1994 in particular in semi arid regions with high evaporation and low infiltration a short soil profile may record a long period of water infiltration which complicates the age dating processes ginn and murphy 1997 as such it is better to estimate the average drainage over long time scales second the effects of vegetation on the various methods for quantifying deep drainage should be considered in this study deep drainage was the highest in db regardless of vegetation types shallow or deep rooted even though it has low precipitation table s2 this may be attributed to several aspects such as faster water infiltration in sandy soil and higher acd leading to an overestimation of the recharge in arid regions li et al 2015 ritsema et al 1993 however although the point based drainage estimates are various at the different locations the effects of vegetation are consistent specifically for the shallow rooted plants cmb and cs performed better than cp in estimating long term drainage for the deep rooted plants cmb and cp cannot be used to estimate drainage because of cl enrichment by root water uptake while cwmb is the best method since it excludes the impacts of root system on cl therefore it is more appropriate to employ cmb and cwmb for shallow and deep rooted plants respectively thirdly our samples cover different climates soils and vegetations e g rainfall of 185 0 622 0 mm year 1 sand content of 13 8 40 1 deep and shallow rooted plants thus the recommended methods have wide applicability in other regions with similar climate soil or vegetation conditions however it should be noted that these methods are most applicable to flat areas where rainfall is the only source of groundwater recharge in other landscapes e g sloped areas more environmental factors need to be fully considered such as runoff and or river seepage 5 conclusion quantifying deep drainage is critical for the management of groundwater resources many cl based tracing methods have been developed for this purpose however the differences and discrepancies between these methods are poorly understood here we evaluated the uncertainties of the cl based methods cmb cs cp and cwmb by using 3h based tracing as references tp and tp wb within thick soil profiles under different vegetation types the discrepancy of the various methods is mainly attributed to the various extents to which their underlying assumptions are satisfied by the actual environmental conditions that affect cl deposition removal and transport cmb and cwmb performed better than other cl based methods for estimating deep drainage under shallow and deep rooted plants respectively this study highlights the importance of appropriate method selection in drainage estimation and provides additional understanding on the mechanisms of soil hydrological processes

3130,chloride cl based tracing methods are popular for deep drainage or potential groundwater recharge estimation in the unsaturated zone but uncertainties in various such methods have rarely been investigated we collected 1827 samples from 24 soil profiles under plants with shallow or deep root systems in the thick unsaturated loess deposits of china and measured soil water cl and tritium contents with the drainage estimated with the tritium peak method as reference we evaluated the applicability of several cl based approaches for drainage estimation under shallow and deep rooted plants including the chloride mass balance method cmb chloride storage method cs chloride peak method cp and chloride water mass balance method cwmb the estimated deep drainages varied with methods and the uncertainties were large with a coefficient of variation of 0 71 compared to the drainage obtained from tritium based methods 33 6 11 2 and 9 6 14 5 mm year 1 under shallow and deep rooted

drainage can largely influence the sustainability of groundwater resources however estimating deep drainage is challenging and urgent eckhardt and ulbrich 2003 reinecke et al 2021 rushton and ward

have been widely used to track soil water movement groundwater recharge and hydroclimatic reconstruction in dry regions cheng et al 2021 edmunds and tyler 2002 scanlon et al 2007 focusing on the process in the unsaturated or saturated zones the drainage potentially or actually reaching the water table can be investigated huang et al 2019 scanlon et al 2002 the evolution of deep drainage can also be monitored to observe the effects of environmental changes e g vegetation or climate cook et al 1992 deng et al 2017 tan et al 2017 despite the wide range of applications cl based tracing methods yield large uncertainties in estimated deep drainage scanlon 2000 scanlon et al 2002 and should be further refined to more accurately estimate deep drainage cl based tracing methods for the saturated zone consider the cl mass balance between different input sources and groundwater and can estimate actual groundwater recharge through two or three component mass balance methods huang et al 2019 li et al 2017 however cl based tracing for the unsaturated zone is much more complicated since there are multiple methods with different theoretical backgrounds and these methods are sensitive to variations in environmental factors they comprise two main methodological groups the first group of methods calculates deep drainage based on the mass balance of cl records within the unsaturated zone

cwmb zhang et al 2018 cheng et al 2021 the other group emphasizes the transport or displacement of cl with soil water through the unsaturated zone and includes the chloride peak method cp huang et al 2016 huang et al 2019 and chloride front displacement method cfd scanlon et al 2007 walker et al 1991 although cl based tracing methods are popular for estimating deep drainage in the unsaturated zone few studies have investigated the uncertainties associated with them the scarce comparison of results across different methods over different regions hinders the application of cl based tracing technology huang et al 2017 in particular some methods are applied in the same way to estimate deep drainage under differing vegetation types ignoring differences in root water uptake and its effects on water infiltration and solute transport for example the conversion from shallow to deep rooted plants may increase soil water consumption and enrich cl concentrations ginn and murphy 1997 which decreases the estimation accuracy of using cl based methods however few studies have systematically evaluated the suitability of cl based methods in estimating deep drainage under different vegetation types the other limitation in uncertainty evaluation is the lack of reliable standards by which to compare results from different methods tritium 3h an isotopic tracer contained in water that tracks the movement of water suess 1969 can directly estimate drainage without precipitation dependency or being subject to the limitations of exogenous cl inputs cook et al 1994 li et al 2019c morgenstern et al 2010 with isotopic signals from nuclear bomb testing 3h deposited in soils has been widely used to investigate soil water movement and historical deep drainage records cartwright et al 2017 cook et al 1994 li and si 2018 however 3h profiles cannot be found in most areas of the world now firstly the soils in most regions have limited depths and the 3h deposition from nuclear bomb testing has already been flushed out secondly the decay of radioactive tritium 12 3 years has resulted in the tritium kurtosis closing to background levels as such the current presence of 3h kurtosis gradients in the unsaturated zone from historical nuclear bombing is limited in most regions and will keep decreasing fortunately the clear 3h profiles reported in the loess deposits of china in recent years provide a good opportunity to trace hydrological processes and evaluate the uncertainties of cl based methods in drainage estimation lin and wei 2006 which will provide useful information for method selection this study aims to evaluate the uncertainties of various cl based tracing approaches in estimating deep drainage in the unsaturated zones by using cl and 3h records in the loess deposit in china with the thickest loess deposits up to 350 m the loess buffer zone greatly delays the response of groundwater to rainfall and stores large amount of historical cl and 3h signatures li et al 2019c lin and wei 2006 which provides a good platform for investigating soil hydrological processes specifically we will focus on the following questions i how uncertain is the estimated deep drainage from soil records using the various cl based tracing approaches ii why do these levels of uncertainty exist in the cl based tracing methods iii how to select appropriate methods for drainage estimation under different vegetation types to our knowledge this is the first study that systematically evaluates the uncertainties and applicability of various cl based tracing methods in drainage estimation which will provide technical support to other studies related to soil hydrological processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is china s loess plateau fig 1 a along the northwest southeast direction the climate transitions from arid to subhumid with annual mean rainfall ranging between 140 and 680 mm year 1 soil types vary from coarse sand to fine clay zhu et al 1983 the quaternary loess composed of malan lishi and wucheng loess from top to bottom hierarchically covers the horizontal neogene mudstone beds huang et al 2016 the tableland defined as a flat elevated part of the broader plateau region is deeply cut by gullies to the bedrock and thus undergoes relatively simple hydrological processes without lateral inputs from rivers rainfall is the only source of groundwater recharge in non irrigated areas li et al 2017 and the largest depth to the groundwater table is 100 m this study selected five typical loess tablelands along the west east direction located in the counties of haiyuan hiy dingbian db changwu cw luochuan lc and daning dn respectively for the five locations the elevation range is 1017 1950 m and the mean annual precipitations and temperatures are 359 622 mm and 7 7 11 0 respectively table s1 the main vegetation types are farmland and apple orchard malus pumila mill in cw lc and dn while they are farmland grassland apricot orchards armeniaca sibirica l poplars populus l and salix salix cheilophila in db and hiy the fertilizers applied in the farmlands and apple orchards include urea compound fertilizers and organic fertilizers of which potassium chloride kcl fertilizer was applied starting in 1993 huang et al 2016 as typical rainfed agricultural areas all sampling sites have flat topography without irrigation and runoff can be ignored 2 2 sample collection and analysis soil samples were collected at each location under various vegetation types in 2015 2020 table s1 in total 1827 samples from 24 soil profiles up to a depth of 10 20 m were obtained by using a hollow stem hand auger at a 20 cm interval for each location shallow and deep rooted plants were both considered specifically the shallow rooted plants root length 2 m include farmlands and grasslands while the deep rooted plants with different stand ages of 8 51 years include woodlands such as apple apricot and peach orchards poplar and shrublands such as salix and caragana despite the differences in growing rates of deep rooted plants the root depths overall increase with stand ages song et al 2018 we defined 2 m as the lower threshold root depth for deep rooted plants in accordance with previous studies song et al 2018 børja et al 2008 li et al 2021 li et al 2019a wang et al 2019 however the definition of the deepest root depth for deep rooted plants would not influence this study the impacts of the rooting systems will be examined by comparing the soil water profiles under shallow and deep rooted plants to ensure that the assumptions of method are satisfied the distances between sampling sites in the same location are 100 m to ensure similar climactic soil and geological conditions soil samples were used to determine gravimetric soil water content using the oven drying method and to determine tritium contents in soil water after the soil water was extracted with a vacuum condensation extraction system li 2100 china the dried soil samples were further used to measure cl content in the soil pore water through extraction of a 1 5 ratio of soil to deionized water ion chromatography ics 1100 thermal fisher scientific usa and low background liquid scintillation counter quantulus 1220 perkinelmer singapore were employed to measure cl and 3h contents respectively 2 3 estimating deep drainage 2 3 1 estimating drainage under shallow rooted plants assuming that piston flow characterizes the downward infiltration of soil water and dissolved cl the average drainage can be obtained through three methods under shallow rooted plants grassland or farmland chloride mass balance method cmb chloride storage method cs and chloride peak method cp table 1 the methods based on mass balance theory i e cmb and cs require the quantification of each cl input source such as the atmospheric cl deposition and cl fertilizer application and the unknown inputs should be excluded as the application rate of fertilizer was not easy to be obtained we attempted to exclude the impact of fertilizer application on cmb and cs by using the profiles below a certain depth that should not contain any cl from fertilizer fig 2 to do this we first used the tritium peak method tp to estimate the main infiltration rates and then determined the ages of soil water at different depths under fertilized sites after getting the depth zc of water from the 1993 precipitation i e the year starting kcl fertilizer application only the profiles below that depth were studied in order to eliminate the impact of fertilizer application fig 2c the aforementioned methods for estimating deep drainage are detailed as follows the result of the tritium peak method tp is used as a reference to evaluate the cl based tracing methods in the case of soil water infiltration as piston flow soil water storage above the 3h peak depth is recorded as precipitation input since 1963 allison and hughes 1978 tp can be used to obtain the average drainage since 1963 according to the distance za zb and time t1 of 3h peak movement and the average volumetric soil water content θ during t1 eq 1 fig 2 the chloride mass balance method cmb was originally used to calculate soil water flux and recharge eriksson and khunakasem 1969 based on cl mass balance between atmospheric inputs p clp and soil leaching r cls eq 2 fig 2 it uses several assumptions 1 atmospheric deposition including wet and dry deposition is the only source of cl input 2 transport of cl is one dimensional vertical and steady state and 3 cl is geochemically unreactive and hardly adsorbed if the exogenous cl inputs are known then assumption 1 is unnecessary for the chloride storage method cs the cumulative curves of soil water content wt and cl content cst vary with depths tyler et al 1996 if the atmospheric cl flux p clp is known the time t for cl or soil water accumulation can be calculated through dividing cumulative cl in the unsaturated zone by atmospheric cl flux then deep drainage can be estimated with eq 3 cs uses the same assumptions as cmb the chloride peak method cp has a similar theoretical background as tp huang et al 2016 si and de jong 2007 deep drainage can be estimated via the distance zc za and time t1 t2 of cl peak displacement since 1993 and the average volumetric soil water content θ eq 4 fig 2 cp is widely used to estimate drainage in fertilized land as the cl peak can be easily obtained 2 3 2 estimating drainage under deep rooted plants mass balance methods for drainage estimation may be inaccurate if significant root uptake water occurs thus it is difficult to directly employ such methods under deep rooted plants we obtained the reference drainage amounts by combining the tritium peak method with water balance method tp wb eq 5 table 1 i e extracting the drainage amount under shallow rooted plants using tp by the mean change in soil water storage induced by root water uptake rs ss sd t fig 3 similarly another combination of chloride mass balance with water balance method cwmb eq 6 was developed which extracts the drainage amount under shallow rooted plants using cmb by the mean reduction in soil water storage from land use change the three methods for shallow rooted plants were also used i e cmb cs and cp for deep rooted plants but the depth profile was carefully selected to exclude the impact of root uptake accounting to soil water profiles 2 3 3 atmospheric chloride deposition acd concentration evaluating the long term average acd is essential for the use of cl based tracing methods in recharge estimation but difficult due to limited observational data even though data are available at a few sites for a few years they cannot represent the long term average davies and crosbie 2018 to solve this problem we inversely estimated these values with the information recorded by the deep soil profiles according to the conceptual model in fig 2 briefly the tritium peak depth was used to partition the soil profiles into two sub profiles i e the upper profile from soil surface to peak depth and the lower profile from peak depth to sampling depth the upper profile contains the acd from 1963 to the sampling year and can be used to estimate the flux and concentration of acd from 1963 to the sampling year specifically the cl stored in the upper profile can be directly used to estimate the annual average acd flux by dividing by the period length subsequently the acd concentration can be estimated through dividing the average flux by average precipitation with this method all depositions dry or wet are considered the reconstructed acd at lc cw dn db and hiy were 0 45 0 63 0 47 2 69 and 2 68 mg l 1 respectively table s1 they are close to the ranges found by the limited observations during recent several years i e 1 4 0 3 0 7 0 1 0 9 0 5 3 2 0 5 and 3 4 0 3 mg l 1 respectively which supports the reliability of the reconstructed long term average acd concentration 2 4 uncertainty analysis the uncertainties of estimating deep drainage can be attributed to two aspects i e model uncertainty and parameter uncertainty the first source of uncertainty stems from differences between methods as mentioned above the tritium based methods i e tp for shallow rooted plants and tp wb for deep rooted plants were used as references to evaluate the uncertainties of the cl based tracing methods specifically direct comparison and analysis of variance anova were applied to explore the difference of the various methods the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse and root mean square error rmse were employed to evaluate model performance relative to reference a nse value closer to 1 0 suggests a model with larger predictive value while a lower rmse value indicates a better fit to the reference the second source of uncertainty originates from model parameters specifically the variables in eq 1 6 can introduce errors because of temporal variability in annual precipitation vertical variability in soil water and cl content we use the following error propagation analysis to quantify the uncertainties eq 7 8 7 σ y f x 1 2 σ x 1 2 f x 2 2 σ x 2 2 f x n 2 σ xn 2 if f x i a i i 1 2 n then 8 σ y a 1 2 σ x 1 2 a 2 2 σ x 2 2 a n 2 σ xn 2 where σ is the uncertainty of the related variation standard deviation ai is the parameter of the error propagation 3 results 3 1 soil profiles the vertical variability of soil water cl and 3h contents were shown in fig 4 soil water contents varied with depth because of climate effects in the shallow layers while vegetation and soil texture affect in deep layers sándor et al 2021 wang et al 2013 soil water contents were similarly distributed under shallow rooted plants with an average of 0 26 0 03 0 25 0 02 0 18 0 04 0 14 0 05 and 0 18 0 03 cm3 cm 3 in lc cw dn db and hiy respectively under deep rooted plants the average soil water contents were 0 21 0 02 0 22 0 02 0 13 0 03 0 12 0 05 and 0 10 0 04 cm3 cm 3 respectively the water contents under deep rooted plants were much lower than those under shallow rooted plants in particular the conversion from shallow to deep rooted plants decreased soil water storage by 8 51 the cl profiles resembled parabolic curves under different vegetation types fig 4 cl contents peaked between 0 and 6 m and stabilized below 6 m with an average of 19 0 10 0 mg l 1 for each location cl contents in the stable layers followed the order of 17 4 8 0 mg l 1 lc 19 7 9 7 mg l 1 cw 20 7 12 2 mg l 1 dn 24 7 7 7 mg l 1 db 38 7 15 7 mg l 1 hiy which appears to increase with drier climates the 3h profiles had obvious dispersion peaks at depths contents of 8 5 m 57 2 tu 7 2 m 45 1 tu 8 8 m 74 4 tu 22 m 91 3 tu and 7 3 m 65 4 tu for lc cw dn db and hiy respectively the clear peaks and steady states in deep layers for cl and 3h profiles suggest that rainfall infiltration was predominantly characterized by piston flow which supports the reliability of applying 3h and cl based tracing methods to estimate deep drainage 3 2 deep drainage estimation the estimated deep drainage were 0 50 1 0 68 1 0 33 9 4 0 55 0 and 0 34 7 mm year 1 in lc cw dn db and hiy accounting for 0 8 1 0 11 6 0 7 3 1 2 17 0 and 0 9 7 of mean annual precipitation respectively table s2 the estimated drainage varied with the various methods fig 5 specifically the values from tp tp wb cmb cs cp and cwmb were 0 55 0 9 0 68 1 6 8 66 3 3 9 61 7 and 0 68 1 mm year 1 with averages of 18 6 17 7 27 6 14 6 25 9 15 5 22 2 15 3 and 19 0 21 0 mm year 1 respectively deep drainage varied with vegetation types fig 5 table s2 for shallow rooted plants drainage estimates obtained from cmb and cs 38 0 16 6 and 36 7 17 6 mm year 1 were close to those from tp 33 6 11 2 mm year 1 but were higher than those from cp 23 2 17 8 mm year 1 table s2 however the results estimated by the three cl based methods had no significant difference from tp p 0 05 with regard to deep rooted plants the average drainage estimation was 9 6 14 5 mm year 1 using tp wb which was reduced by 71 relative to that under shallow rooted plants the average estimations from cmb cs cp and cwmb were 21 3 8 9 19 5 10 0 21 6 14 2 and 7 6 13 9 mm year 1 respectively the results estimated with tp wb were not significantly different from those of cwmb p 0 05 but were significantly different from the other three methods p 0 01 3 3 method performance with tp tp wb as reference cwmb 19 0 21 0 mm year 1 gave results close to tp tp wb 18 6 17 7 mm year 1 with r2 and nse larger than 0 72 and 0 62 but rmse smaller than 10 7 fig 6 the estimated deep drainages from the other three methods i e cmb and cs and cp 27 6 14 6 and 25 9 15 5 and 22 2 15 3 mm year 1 were much larger than tp tp wb the results of cmb and cs were significantly related to that of tp tp wb r2 0 42 p 0 01 however the lower rmse and higher nse of cs 15 3 and 0 22 implied that it performed better than cmb nevertheless the results of cp had insignificant correlations with the reference method p 0 05 with r2 and nse of 0 14 and 0 89 respectively for different plants the highest nse and lowest rmse were obtained with cmb for shallow rooted plant i e 0 27 and 9 6 and cwmb for deep rooted plants i e 0 87 and 4 8 which suggests that depending on vegetation types cmb or cwmb may be the most accurate methods for deep drainage estimation 4 discussion 4 1 why do the estimated drainage vary with method the various cl based tracing methods yielded quite different results with a coefficient of variation cv of 0 71 particularly the variability was stronger under deep rooted plants cv 0 75 than that under shallow rooted plants cv 0 52 the discrepancy in the estimation is mainly attributed to the extent of each method meeting the methodological theory the peak displacement methods are suitable for estimating deep drainage under shorter time scales since they depend on the historical information of tracer application si and de jong 2007 however the methods emphasizing cl mass balance is more suitable for longer time scales since they need to sample long periods to cover the variability of atmospheric deposition allison et al 1994 feth 1981 kaandorp et al 2021 therefore the time scales of representation can introduce larger uncertainties to the peak displacement methods in this study the peak displacement methods i e cp were able to yield results covering the period from 1963 3h or 1993 cl to the sampling years but the mass balance methods i e cmb cs and cwmb presented results of a period dating back to hundreds or thousands of years fig 2 the realized extent of climate variability differs depending on the length of the period being studied and shorter time periods may result in larger uncertainties the large discrepancy of the peak displacement method i e cp relative to the reference may also stem from tracer characteristics the tp tp wb methods can effectively estimate the average deep drainage between 1963 and the sampling year because tritium is a composition of water subject to less perturbation than cl in comparison cp depends on the shape of cl profile formed during the transport process walker et al 1991 cl is transported with water as a solute so the shape of the cl profile can be influenced by various environmental factors e g climate soil vegetation and anthropogenic activities for example precipitation in china from 1984 to 2009 was mostly lower than the long term average value while the temperature increased along an upward trend peng et al 2019 the resulting drier climate may alter the atmospheric chloride concentration li et al 2019b li et al 2015 causing some discrepancies when estimating drainage using cl tracers furthermore compared with 3h tracers anion exclusion may introduce some uncertainties gvirtzman and gorelick 1991 james and rubin 1986 mcmahon and thomas 1974 si and de jong 2007 for example the cl peak depths from observation or inversely calculated by the 3h peak method are different in the same profiles in this study 1 0 5 2 m vs 4 2 10 4 m in this study the cl based methods are sensitive to exogenous cl sources e g kcl fertilizer application cmb cs and cwmb should be used only if atmospheric cl depositions and exogenous cl inputs are known walker et al 1991 in this study fertilizer effects were excluded by dating the soil water age and the estimated deep drainages from these three methods were thus close to tp tp wb under different vegetation types especially cwmb figs 5 6 however cp is applicable to fertilized sites as it tracks the cl peak established in 1993 huang et al 2016 scanlon et al 2007 walker et al 1991 for example under shallow rooted plants the estimations of cp were relatively close to those of tp at lc cw dn and hiy only farmland fig 7 a 4 2 how does vegetation type influence the accuracy of cl based methods in this study the deep drainages under shallow higher and deep rooted lower plants were significantly different p 0 05 fig 5 table s2 the change from shallow to deep rooted plants decreased the drainage by 71 44 47 7 and 80 using tp tp wb cmb cs cp and cwmb respectively the impacts of vegetation change on deep drainage can be attributed to the plant soil interaction huang et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 li et al 2022 the conversion to deep rooted plants enhances plant transpiration which reduces soil water storage because of their more developed root systems knighton et al 2020 maxwell and condon 2016 shi et al 2021 subsequently the soil water depletion increases the soil cl concentration which violates the underlying assumptions of these methods and affects the accuracy of cmb and cp for example cmb can effectively estimate deep drainage under shallow rooted plants with results similar to tp 38 0 16 6 vs 33 6 11 2 mm year 1 fig 5 table s2 however under deep rooted plants although we tried to exclude the upper part of the low soil water profile that contains high cl contents using only the deeper layers under steady state wood 1999 it still resulted in a significant difference from tp wb 21 3 8 9 vs 9 6 14 5 mm year 1 these results suggest that root water uptake occurs at deeper depths than expected by contrast cwmb considers the soil water depletion from root water uptake it combines the cmb based estimation under shallow rooted plants with the effects of decreased water storage under deep rooted plants figs 3 8 which greatly reduce the uncertainty of estimation results due to root effect zhang et al 2018 this comparison suggests that the direct application of cmb and cp to drainage estimation under deep rooted plants should be done with caution 4 3 selecting the appropriate method although cl based tracing methods can provide historical climatic or hydrological information on various time scales cook et al 1992 the various methodological uncertainties should be considered firstly deep drainage derived from cl based tracing methods may be controlled by climate soil and or vegetation at different periods specifically cp estimates the average for the recent 30 years in this study while the other three methods estimate the average over a longer period fig 2 thus combining cp and cmb or directly using cs or cwmb can reveal temporal variations in deep drainage however it should be noted that the mixing effect of percolated water in adjacent layers cannot represent the drainage at the expected time deng et al 2015 edmunds and gaye 1994 in particular in semi arid regions with high evaporation and low infiltration a short soil profile may record a long period of water infiltration which complicates the age dating processes ginn and murphy 1997 as such it is better to estimate the average drainage over long time scales second the effects of vegetation on the various methods for quantifying deep drainage should be considered in this study deep drainage was the highest in db regardless of vegetation types shallow or deep rooted even though it has low precipitation table s2 this may be attributed to several aspects such as faster water infiltration in sandy soil and higher acd leading to an overestimation of the recharge in arid regions li et al 2015 ritsema et al 1993 however although the point based drainage estimates are various at the different locations the effects of vegetation are consistent specifically for the shallow rooted plants cmb and cs performed better than cp in estimating long term drainage for the deep rooted plants cmb and cp cannot be used to estimate drainage because of cl enrichment by root water uptake while cwmb is the best method since it excludes the impacts of root system on cl therefore it is more appropriate to employ cmb and cwmb for shallow and deep rooted plants respectively thirdly our samples cover different climates soils and vegetations e g rainfall of 185 0 622 0 mm year 1 sand content of 13 8 40 1 deep and shallow rooted plants thus the recommended methods have wide applicability in other regions with similar climate soil or vegetation conditions however it should be noted that these methods are most applicable to flat areas where rainfall is the only source of groundwater recharge in other landscapes e g sloped areas more environmental factors need to be fully considered such as runoff and or river seepage 5 conclusion quantifying deep drainage is critical for the management of groundwater resources many cl based tracing methods have been developed for this purpose however the differences and discrepancies between these methods are poorly understood here we evaluated the uncertainties of the cl based methods cmb cs cp and cwmb by using 3h based tracing as references tp and tp wb within thick soil profiles under different vegetation types the discrepancy of the various methods is mainly attributed to the various extents to which their underlying assumptions are satisfied by the actual environmental conditions that affect cl deposition removal and transport cmb and cwmb performed better than other cl based methods for estimating deep drainage under shallow and deep rooted plants respectively this study highlights the importance of appropriate method selection in drainage estimation and provides additional understanding on the mechanisms of soil hydrological processes

3131,the contaminant transport processes in karst water systems have a direct impact on the quality and utilization of karst water resources the storage and release of contaminants or conservative solutes during the solute transport process is a common phenomenon in karst aquifers the impact of the storage and release is more prevalent after focused recharge events in this study laboratory experimental and numerical studies were conducted to quantify the storage and release processes of conservative solute the results showed that conduit water recharges into fissures under high water head conditions and the fissure water drains back into the conduit while the hydraulic gradient reverse the conservative solute storage release process controlled by hydrodynamic conditions produces strong asymmetry long tailing or bi peak in the breakthrough curves btcs the btcs change from single peak to bi peak with enhanced hydrodynamics under focused recharge conditions the dual heterogeneous domain model was calibrated to simulate the long tailing of the btcs and their noticeably bimodal characteristics the flow velocity and dispersion coefficient are the major variables that regulate the bimodal structure of the btcs which also control the solute storage release differences between the conduit and fissures the bimodal structure of the btcs becomes more pronounced for large discrepancies in flow velocities the total btcs are a superposition of solute transport in the conduit path and storage release path a method to evaluate the mass of conservative solute transport in storage release paths was proposed by segmenting the transport curve in the conduit from the total btcs thus quantifying the effects of the groundwater storage release mechanism on the solute transport process in the karst water system keywords karst water system conduit and fissures conservative solute storage release laboratory experiment data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction karst aquifers cover approximately 20 of the world s land area and are an important source of drinking water for approximately 25 of the global population ford and williams 2013 despite the significance of karst water resources there are a growing number of contamination incidences in karst aquifers worldwide henry and suk 2018 it is well known that strong karstification not only creates a special karst landscape on the surface but also creates a multi layer structure on both the surface and underground the surface karst has rapid infiltration with very low filtration and storage capacity making the karst aquifer extremely vulnerable to the surface related contaminants goeppert and goldscheider 2019 lu et al 2013 lasagna et al 2013 more importantly contamination can intensively get into the karst aquifers through surface runoff or overland flow that confluences in negative terrains such as karst depressions dolines and sinkholes fig 1 guo et al 2010 jakada et al 2019 vadillo and ojeda 2022 white et al 2018 in many instances the impact of such focused recharge on karst groundwater quality remains poorly understood and the risk of groundwater contamination is widely underestimated because of the fast flow into aquifers hao et al 2021 medici and west 2021 it is also common for residents to use karst depressions and sinkholes as refuse dumps resulting in unfiltered short lived contamination into karst aquifer causing catastrophic groundwater pollution jakada et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 furthermore extreme weather events have led to more frequent and intense flooding events in karst areas wang and chen 2021 these phenomena make it difficult to prevent sudden pollution incidents caused by short term pulses of contamination input zhang et al 2020 previous studies have revealed that focused recharge is the primary reason for widespread rapid transport of contaminants into the karst groundwater hartmann et al 2021 conservative solutes are those that do not react chemically or biologically during solute transport process khosronejad et al 2016 lamberti and hauer 2017 quantitative conservative tracer tests have been widely employed to analyze hydraulic characteristics and identify contaminant sources in karst aquifers bailly comte and pistre 2021 benischke 2021 goldscheider and drew 2007 mohammadi et al 2021a schiperski et al 2022 these conservative tracer tests showed that aquifer heterogeneity generates anomalous transport goeppert et al 2020 molinari et al 2015 consequently the tracer transport process and its accompanying morphology of btcs are complicated and variable making the interpretation of results ambiguous and requiring multiple solutions for example most previous studies have attributed the observed single peak tailing btcs to the interactions with pools or immobile zones along the main conduit dewaide et al 2016 goldscheider 2008 wu et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 meanwhile the bi peak tailing btcs generated by a single recharge event have been interpreted with reference to underground lakes auxiliary conduits multiple conduit configurations or aquifer medium types and have been verified by laboratory experiments and numerical simulations cen et al 2021 chu et al 2021 dewaide et al 2018 field and leij 2012 goldscheider et al 2008 perrin and luetscher 2008 tinet et al 2019 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2021 however there is also the possibility that the inversion of the hydraulic gradient between the conduit and the fissure s network could produce anomalous transport of conservative solutes faulkner et al 2009 goeppert et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 while this process has not been verified due to the complex field conditions and many influencing factors richter et al 2022 sivelle and labat 2019 how does groundwater storage and release processes affect the transport of conservative solutes under focused recharge conditions what will be the morphology of btcs at the outlet of karst springs these are important questions that should be addressed therefore it is important to critically study the behavior of conservative solutes in karst groundwater under focused recharge conditions to better understand the processes of solute transport storage and release here we evaluated the mechanisms of field scale storage and release of solutes under high and low flow conditions with focused recharge laboratory scale models were employed to allow better insights into groundwater flow and solute transport under controlled conditions mohammadi et al 2021b in this work a laboratory scale physical model was employed to investigate the solute transport in a conduit fissure system under high and low flow conditions with focused recharge existing solute transport models cannot capture both the heterogeneity in mobile domains and the bi peak characterized by the long tailing of btcs observed in complex media solute transport experiments for example the advection dispersion equation model ade has been used for approximately five decades to model solute transport in karst water system li et al 2020 however the ade model fails to characterize bi peak btcs and is not suited to capture the mass transfer process between immobile zones such as pools or eddies and conduits recently goeppert et al 2020 applied the continuous time random walk ctrw theory to account for the long tailed breakthrough behaviors found in karst water system to integrate the effect of auxiliary conduits in generating multi peaks btcs field and leij 2012 have proposed a dual advection dispersion equation dade that efficiently reproduces multi peaks btcs however this model does not allow for discreet allocation of the conduits along with the flow or combine the two exchange advective dispersive zones with a storage area wang et al 2020 reexamined the ability of the dade model to reproduce btcs with a single peak and bi peak in a dual conduit structure and they discovered that the model did not reproduce the skewness of some parts of the slower peaks to characterize the conservative solute transport process a solute transport model that can capture the heterogeneity in mobile domains exhibiting bi peaks and characterized by late time tails was calibrated this model was applied to elucidate the characteristics of conservative solute transport in a heterogeneous karst water system the high resolution of laboratory scale tracer tests and the reliability of the simulation results allow us to provide new insights into the conservative solute transport generated by groundwater storage and release processes in karst water systems these outcomes provide a scientific basis for the better development and utilization of karst water resources as well as the protection and conservation of its ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 conceptual model of solute storage and release in field scale in highly karstified area surface water and groundwater are always connected through sinkholes and karst conduits those karst aquifers with conduits and fissures and the conduits lie over an aquitard which are very common in sedimentary stratiform karst aquifers in south china fig 1 fig 2 after rainstorms quick hydrological responses will occur in karst springs leading to rapid increases in the water level of the underground river channels or karst conduits runoff accumulates when it reaches the sinkholes as the karst network becomes fully saturated and its drainage capacity is surpassed resulting in in situ flooding luo et al 2016 gil márquez et al 2019 naughton et al 2018 in such situations groundwater borne solutes are transported rapidly through a network of karst conduits undergoing frequent and rapid exchanges with fissures in response to the hydraulic gradient binet et al 2017 shu et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 as shown in fig 2a during short interval rainstorms the conduit rapidly recharges via sinkholes given the limited drainage capacity of the conduit water levels increase rapidly reaching levels higher than those in fissures which would drive the conduit borne solutes both in the unsaturated and saturated zone flowing into the surrounding fissures for storage when the rainfall ceases the conduit s hydraulic head diminishes due to the recharge recession and becomes inverted thereby mobilizing the groundwater stored in fissures pushing the stored solutes from fissures into conduits fig 2b chang et al 2021 faulkner et al 2009 kalantari and rouhi 2019 li et al 2008 shirafkan et al 2021 2 2 construction of the laboratory scale physical model according to the field scale model fig 2 the conceptual model of this experiment is based on the hydrological conditions in the field the simplified conceptual model presented in this work represents those karst aquifers with conduits and fissures the special hydrogeological structure makes the transport paths of solutes injected through the sinkholes after rainstorms which can be presented in two categories 1 solutes directly transported from the sinkhole to spring outlet along the conduit without exchange with the surrounding fissures 2 solutes are stored in the fissures during high flow conditions and released back into the conduit during low flow conditions in this study a two dimensional experiment apparatus was constructed based on this summarized conceptual model fig 3 the experiment apparatus consists of three units the focused recharge and tracer injection system the conduit and fissure system and the data monitoring and acquisition system the focused recharge unit is a cube tank 36 cm length 36 cm width 45 cm height with a vertical circular conduit connected to the bottom of the tank to simulate a depressional catchment and sinkhole the vertical conduit is connected to the tracer injection unit which also regulates the focused recharge water and tracer injection flow rate via control valves a rectangular plexiglass box was used to create a filling slot with dimensions of 100 cm 15 cm 40 cm length width height for the conduit and fissure system the horizontal circular conduit with a length of 100 cm and an inner diameter of 4 cm is placed at the bottom of the plexiglass box 840 boreholes 8 rows of 105 each are drilled above the halfway point along the horizontal conduit the boreholes are 3 mm inner diameter and 9 mm apart to provide water exchange channels between the conduit and fissures the conduit was sealed at other points to the fissures to avoid for circulations at the border between fissures and conduit to mimic a karst conduit and fissures system in which conduits lie on an aquitard a fissure is made of concrete blocks overlying the conduit occupying the remaining space of the filling slot the fissures with width of 3 to 6 mm were made between the blocks and the block surface is rough and contains lots of pores the void volume of the fissures and pores accounts for 25 of the entire volume of the plexiglass box on the bottom and back of the filling slot 40 piezometers are inserted at various locations the piezometers are used to measure the water head pressure at a specific point and the flow meter can monitor the recharge of the input conduit and fissure system 2 3 tracer test the experiment apparatus fig 3 is used to conduct tracer tests and characterize the solute storage release process control valve 4 was set as a smaller aperture than valve 2 to guarantee that the hydraulic gradient drives the conduit water into fissure for storage in the early stages and the fissure water can be released back into conduit at a later time nacl was used as a conservative solute do not react chemically or biologically to conduct the tracer tests at the start of the experiment a specific volume of tap water e g 9 0 l 11 0 l 13 0 l 19 5 l 26 0 l and 32 5 l and equal volume 0 25 l and equal mass concentration 60 g l of nacl solution were placed in the tap water tank and the salty water tank respectively for each group of tracer tests the tap water was drained by opening control valve 2 then control valve 1 was also opened and the injection of 0 25 l nacl with concentration of 60 g l was completed in 50 s with an average injection velocity of 0 1 m s the total duration times of each group tracer tests were completed in 780 to 1730 s the tracer was injected at the beginning of each group tracer test within 50 s so the tracer injection is considered as an instantaneous input compared to the much longer duration time after the entire tap water tank was wholly drained additional water was added to the tap water tank which acted as a base flow to maintain the conduit be full of water during the entire experiment duration the tracer concentration was measured indirectly by an electrical conductivity ec instrument ltc m10 solinst canada that was placed at the outlet with a resolution of 0 1 μs cm and a recording interval of 5 s the concentration of nacl was converted by ec values using the linear equation the ec of the tap water is 300 μs cm and this value was deducted in the calibration process the influence of different focused recharge volumes frvs on the solute storage release process between the conduit and fissures was investigated using six groups of tracer experiments to validate the experimental results each tracer experiment was replicated three times that reaches the error analysis better than 5 and one group of the typical btcs was chosen for the following analysis 2 4 modelling and calculation the transport phenomenon of conservative solutes in karst aquifers after a focused recharge event is complex particularly part of the solute directly transports through the main conduit with a high flow velocity with no exchange with the surrounding fissures while other parts of the solutes are stored in fissures or matrix and released at a later time due to the change in hydraulic gradient there are two different flow paths simultaneously operating during solute transport in karst aquifers solute retention may also be a factor due to the immobile zone can be composed of disconnected fissures porous rock matrix or other stagnant water zones e g pool volumes adjacent to the conduits in the natural karst aquifer in the laboratory experiment pores between blocks with rough surface can mimic the complex fissure network include the dead end fissures in the karst aquifer additionally there are lots of pores in the blocks that can act as immobile zone during solute transport fig 4 to capture such a bimodal sub diffusion process the dual heterogeneous domain model dhdm was augmented in this study initially proposed by yin et al 2020 1a c 1 t β 1 γ 1 c 1 t γ 1 l 1 x c 1 k φ 1 c 2 c 1 1b c 2

the operator l i x v i x d i 2 x 2 and v i lt 1 is the effective velocity in the i th domain v i is typically called the average linear velocity or seepage velocity for groundwater in the hydrogeology

fractional capacity coefficient in the i th domain and γ i dimensionless is the time index representing the degree of time nonlocality for solute transport in the i th domain the anomalous transport induced by groundwater storage release is quite complex with high transition and difficult to attain entire simulation after focused recharge and solute injection in the tracer test the solute particles may transport along two different paths additionally an immobile zone may exist and cause solute retention during solute transport through two paths as shown in equation 1 dhdm conceptualizes the aquifer into two mobile domains with different velocities and hydraulic dispersions to capture solute transport in the two path system the time fractional derivative in equation 1 enables dhdm the capacity for simulation of solute retention induced by immobile zone for simplicity and applicability constant flow velocity and dispersion coefficient were used as effective parameters in the dhdm an explicit lagrange scheme can be used to solve equation 1 the details for solving scheme for equation 1 are documented by yin et al 2020 consistent with the tracer experiment free flux conditions are used at the upstream and downstream boundaries for our scheme the instantaneous release of solute at the beginning was used to simulate the injection of tracers and the mass flux density at the outlet was calculated by 2 c f x τ p n total t 1 t 2 δ x x p t d t n total where c f x τ dimenionless is the normalized mass flux from time t 1 to t 2 δ is a dirac delta function and x p t is the location of particle p at time t n total dimenionless is the total number of particles in the domains the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the root mean square error rmse was selected as the criteria for observations and dhdm simulation comparison which were defined respectively as 3 nse 1 i 1 n y o i y s i 2 i 1 n y o i y 2 4 rmse 1 n i 1 n y o i y s i 2 where y o i and y s i are the observed and simulated mass flux at the time t i respectively and y is the mean observed mass flux under this criterion the optimum score of nse is 1 if nse 0 5 the simulation can be considered acceptable if nse 0 65 the model is deemed satisfactory if nse 0 75 the model is considered to perform optimally morales et al 2007 the optimum score of rmse is equal to 0 when the simulated values robustly capture the observed values e g the best model 3 results and discussion 3 1 development in shape of conservative solute btcs the observed btcs with different focused recharge volumes frvs are depicted in fig 5 a the base flow is 22 0 ml s before the inflow of focused recharge a small frv e g 9 0l exhibits a single broad peak with a relatively truncated tailing and asymmetrical form in the btc note that the btc exhibits a development to a bi peak shape with an frv of 11 0l the corresponding btcs are all bi peak curves with the frvs larger than 11 0l a comparison of the four bi peak curves shows that as the frv increases the first peak displays more symmetry followed by a lag by the second peak and thereafter the two peaks become increasingly separated fig 5a as the frv increases the btc s shapes change from a single peak to bi peak the first peak and the second peak concentration values c p e a k 1 and c p e a k 2 show a downward trend the shape of the second peak curve is flatter and wider compared to the first peak curve and all the btcs present a noticeable tailing phenomenon the solute recovery rates r range from 80 to 95 indicating the quality loss of some solutes fig 5b further data regarding the tracer experiments are given in table 1 3 2 water storage and release processes in fissures the unitary hydrograph at the conduit outlet is a comprehensive response to the single recharge episodes from tap water the groundwater flow and solute transport process could be explained quantitatively by analyzing the hydrographs and associated tracer btcs the calculation for average reynolds number re is documented by wang et al 2020 the re of all experiments are larger than 2000 indicating the turbulent flow conditions while it is well known that turbulent flow often occurs in natural karst systems worthington and soley 2017 the pressure head variations in the tap water tank and conduit as well as the outlet discharge processes were observed in all the experiments fig 6 and fig 7 a the hydrological process curves are illustrative of the salient impacts of hydrodynamic conditions on solute storage release processes based on the temporal turning points of the hydraulic head and outlet discharge variations it is feasible to differentiate between the periods when water is stored and released from the fissures the outlet discharge process follows a similar pattern and can be separated into three stages as shown in fig 7 the outlet discharge increases steadily after focused recharge release at stage i fig 7b considerable focused recharge water creates a rapid pressurized flow in the conduit besides a limited outlet aperture size induces parts of the water in conduit store into the fissures due to higher hydraulic head in conduit than that of fissures this process increases the water volume in the conduit fissures system and the remainder of the water is discharged through the conduit outlet for instance when frv is changed drastically from 9 0 to 32 5 l the water head h in the fissures also increases from 8 6 to 29 2 cm concurrently the hydraulic head in the conduit and fissure are superimposed and transferred to the outlet triggering the discharge to reach its peak values at the outlet therefore an increase in hydrodynamic conditions clearly causes an increase in the storage time and outlet discharge at stage i e g the flow rate of peak discharge q peak increases from 31 2 to 36 5 l s the storage time of fissures gets water from conduit t i increases from 75 to 185 s as shown in fig 7a and table 1 in stage ii the conduit hydraulic head diminishes due to the focused recharge recession fig 6a during this period the hydraulic gradients reversed with the hydraulic gradients in fissures being larger than the conduit subsequently the outlet discharges steadily decreased after reaching its peak at this instance the focused recharge is not yet finished and the outlet discharge mainly consumes the focused recharge water data in table 1 and table 2 clearly indicate that when the frv is small e g 9 0 l the hydraulic head of the conduit is insufficient to sustain more water storage in the fissure resulting in less water e g the water volume stored in the fissures v s 2 8 l and solutes entering the fissures causing the hydraulic head in the conduit to have a shorter duration e g the total time of focused recharge t fr 85 s so the solute retention time e g t ii 10 s in the fissures is also relatively short the velocity of solute transport in conduit is relatively slow for the 9 0 l frv compared to other scenarios hence there occurred the mixing processes of solute released by the storage release path and conduit transport path resulting in a single peak tailing curve however when the frv is larger the volume of water flowing into the fissure increases the hydraulic head in the conduit is maintained and extended by strong hydrodynamic conditions which can cause solute retention in the fissures for a longer time e g t ii increases from 25 to 405 s before being released furthermore this phenomenon makes the average flow velocity decline gradually thus prolonging the time that it takes for the solute to discharge from an outlet ultimately with the lagged arrival of the second peak the two peaks become progressively separated and c p e a k 2 tend to decrease due to the influence of mechanical dispersion and the solute dilution as for the release of fissure water following the termination of focused recharge occurring in stage iii during the recession storage water is released from the fissures and back into the conduit similarly the conduit acts as the water transmission channel at this point the outlet discharge consumes only the initial storage water in the fissures the outlet discharge gradually decreases until the base flow as the storage water is gradually discharged from the fissures recession curves are typically plotted in log q t space to illustrate the division of sub recession curves and calculate the recession coefficient sub recession curves are plotted as straight lines in log q t space when the spring discharge decreases exponentially amit et al 2002 tang et al 2016 the calculations demonstrate that the recession process of outlet discharge follows an exponential recessing law fig 7b with a relatively stable recession coefficient α ranging from 1 079 10 4 to 1 379 10 4 table 2 the outlet discharge recession time t iii increases from 695 to 1140 s as the frvs increases according to the water balance theory the results show that as the frv increases both the water volume released from the fissures v r and the volume of water transported only via conduit v c rise from 2 5 to 9 3 l and 6 3 to 22 3 l respectively table 2 the v s v r and v c with increased focused recharge show significant linear positive relationships fig 8 a however there is an interesting phenomenon that the proportions of both frvs are essentially steady with v r accounting for 27 v r f r v of the frvs on average while v c accounts for 70 v c f r v of the frvs implying that the conduit dominates flow transport fig 8b these results are compatible with the natural karst water systems that conduits are the main pathways of groundwater flow furthermore 3 v l f r v of water volume is lost during the tests owing to the capillary action that retains capillary water at the interface of the concrete block pores and the plexiglass box when the water level in the fissure domain lowers fig 8b 3 3 simulation of solute storage and release processes the dhdm was calibrated to simulate the btcs quantitatively to characterize the storage release process generating anomalous transport the simulated results of the dhdm model display that the dhdm robustly captured the skewness of long tailing and bimodal characteristics of the observed btcs fig 9 this is also confirmed quantitatively by the higher nse and lower rmse computed respectively the best fitted parameters of the dhdm for all tracer experiments are listed in table 3 as the frv increases from 9 0 to 32 5 l the best fitted velocity of the conduit domain v 1 increases from 1 10 to 1 40 m s which approximates the average velocity in conduit v 1 25 1 40 m s whereas the best fitted velocity of the fissure domain v 2 decreases from 0 90 to 0 13 m s the average flow velocity in the conduit and the fissures show a negative relationship with the conduit having a substantially higher flow velocity than that of the fissures table 3 as the frv increases the first peak emerges earlier whereas the second peak emerges later the bimodal structure of the btcs becomes more apparent with larger discrepancies in the velocity between different domains this implies that when solute transport in both domains is dominated by advection a larger discrepancy or contrast between velocities can further separate the two concentration peaks these results confirm that the solute storage release process is induced by hydrodynamic conditions which agree with the results of section 3 2 the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient in the conduit domain d 1 is larger than in the fissure domain d 2 and is caused by the significant flow velocity in the conduit domain morales et al 2010 taken collectively the corresponding d 1 did not change considerably and are in the same order of magnitude d 2 decreases response to a reduction in flow velocity in the fissure domain produced by an increase in retention time however the parameters capturing time nonlocality γ 1 and γ 2 as well as the fractional capacity coefficient β 1 of conduit domain remain stable since the conduit fissures structure remains maintained the fissure domain s fractional volume coefficient β 2 drops from 0 27 to 0 08 indicating a relatively weaker impact of solute retention on solute transport after a larger amount of recharge the enhanced hydrodynamic conditions drive the volume of storage water in fissures giving further impetus to the total volume of fissure domain and immobile zone to increase simultaneously nevertheless the volume of the immobile zone in the fissure domain increases at a slower rate as compared to the total volume meanwhile with the tracer injection condition remaining the same a larger φ 2 means more solute being trapped by the fissure domain whereas the opposite is found for the conduit domain table 3 3 4 quantitative analysis of solute in different flow paths the dhdm simulation reveals that advection controls conservative solute transport in the two domains combined with the analysis of the solute storage release processes in fissures it shows that the total btcs are the superposition of the solute transport in the conduit and storage release paths therefore the process of solute storage release in fissures could be considered as a relatively independent slow transport pathway consequently we utilized the best fitted parameters of equation 1a table 3 to represent the solute transport process in the conduit the solute transport process in the storage release path is obtained by subtracting the conduit transport curve from the total btcs a quantitative estimate of the mass of solute transport in the conduit and storage release paths was conducted by integrating the product of the envelope area of solute transport curves in the conduit and fissures with the total injected mass fig 10 the results elucidated that the enhanced hydrodynamic conditions initially push more solutes to be stored in fissures table 4 leading to gradual decrease in solute transport mass in the conduit as frv increases from 9 0 to 32 5 l the solute storage mass m s in the fissures also increases from 8 3 to 11 5 g simultaneously the solute release mass m r increases from 7 5 to 8 5 g while the solute transport mass m c in conduit decreases from 6 7 to 3 5 g fig 11 a accordingly the proportion of solute transport in the release path gradually increases from 50 to 57 m r m and decreases from 45 to 23 m c m in the conduit as the frv increases fig 11b it should be noted that the solute recovery rates are approximately 80 under higher hydrodynamic conditions e g 32 5 l and over 90 under weaker hydrodynamic conditions e g 9 0 l as discussed above with the conduit water entering the fissures the volume of the immobile zone in the fissure also increases and the capillary action retains and traps solute in the immobile zone resulting in a partial loss of solutes hence the proportion of solute mass loss m l increases from 5 to 20 as the hydrodynamic conditions increase fig 11 it is shown that due to the high flow velocity in the conduit solutes can be transported from the conduit to more distant fissure networks and immobile zones for storage through this process up to 77 of solutes enter the fissure storage 20 of solutes can be stored in the system without being released and this part of solutes may likely be released in the next stronger focused recharge event table 4 that way the focused recharge may result in an underestimated and widespread risk to usable groundwater volumes furthermore when slow and diffuse flows predominate during fissure release after focused recharge solutes can be released slowly and steadily into the conduit thereby maintaining a longer release time of solutes in karst aquifer 3 5 application and limitations of the laboratory analog karst groundwater is highly vulnerable owing to the focused recharge through sinkholes due to the high speed and turbulent flows in the conduit solute transport is usually a transitory process vadillo and ojeda 2022 however rapid transport continues to be a major problem as high concentrations of solutes could reach the system outlet more rapidly without being able to foresee the event which increases the uncertainty about their movement due to the random distribution of aquifer medium networks this implies that the pollution risk of groundwater is much larger than expected where focused recharge occurs also the slow release of storage solutes and pollutants or even flush out again by later recharge events is a big challenge for groundwater self purification in karst aquifers consequently the proposed method for quantifying conservative solute mass may be helpful in guiding karst groundwater pollution prevention remediation and management the physical and laboratory scale modeling of karst aquifers is an effective approach to gain insights into the mechanisms controlling karst groundwater flow and solute transport shu et al 2020 previous work has used geometric kinematic and mechanical similarities to scale up or down site scale conditions to laboratory scale mohammadi et al 2021b notably scale effects are the main problems faced by laboratory scale physical models the following limitations might occur in the present work 1 although the flow regime in the experiments is turbulent the reynolds number can be greater in site scale tracer tests 2 due to scale effects flow rates in site scale are typically much larger than laboratory scale which can affect tracer velocities and dispersive dhdm transport parameters 3 portraying the solute transport process in dual media with variable flow rates and volume ratios is complex in subsequent studies it s worthwhile to develop more realistic models such as simulating solute transport processes in karst aquifers by considering the spatial and temporal variation of flow velocities 4 summary and conclusion this paper evaluated the influences of focused recharge volumes frvs on the storage release process and btcs by performing experimental instantaneous tracer tests through conduit and fissure systems a dual heterogeneous domain model dhdm was successfully calibrated to simulate the transport process of conservative solute and quantitatively calculate the mass of the solute under focused recharge conditions the findings and conclusions of this study are summarized as follows 1 the magnitude of the focused recharge determines the strength of the hydrodynamic conditions the stronger the hydrodynamic conditions the greater the amount of water transported in the conduit alone and the amount of water stored in the fissures but the proportions of both to the frvs remain essentially constant 2 the hydrodynamic conditions strongly control the solute storage release process associated with anomalous transport and determine the solute retention time in the fissure domain these conditions produce strong asymmetry long tailing or bi peaks in the btcs as hydrodynamic conditions increase the btcs shift from a single peak to a bi peak and the separation of the first and second peaks become more apparent 3 the dhdm model can robustly capture the long tailing in btcs including the bimodal characteristics of the observed btcs specifically the flow velocity and dispersion coefficient are the major variables that regulate the bimodal structure of the btcs and the solute storage release differences between the conduit and fissure domains the bimodal structure of the btcs becomes more apparent for larger discrepancies in flow velocity 4 a method to quantify the solute mass in storage release paths by segmenting the solute transport curve in the conduit from the total btcs was proposed under strong hydrodynamic conditions the solute mass proportion of conduit transport was less than 23 in comparison the solute mass proportion of fissure storage was up to 77 due to the large hydraulic gradients but 20 of solutes were stored in the system without being released during the subsequent fissure release process these outcomes provide enhanced and improved insights into the impact of hydrodynamic conditions on storage and release of conservative solute between karst conduit and fissures medium in karst aquifer further these

3131,the contaminant transport processes in karst water systems have a direct impact on the quality and utilization of karst water resources the storage and release of contaminants or conservative solutes during the solute transport process is a common phenomenon in karst aquifers the impact of the storage and release is more prevalent after focused recharge events in this study laboratory experimental and numerical studies were conducted to quantify the storage and release processes of conservative solute the results showed that conduit water recharges into fissures under high water head conditions and the fissure water drains back into the conduit while the hydraulic gradient reverse the conservative solute storage release process controlled by hydrodynamic conditions produces strong asymmetry long tailing or bi peak in the breakthrough curves btcs the btcs change from single peak to bi peak with enhanced hydrodynamics under focused recharge conditions the dual heterogeneous domain model was calibrated to simulate the long tailing of the btcs and their noticeably bimodal characteristics the flow velocity and dispersion coefficient are the major variables that regulate the bimodal structure of the btcs which also control the solute storage release differences between the conduit and fissures the bimodal structure of the btcs becomes more pronounced for large discrepancies in flow velocities the total btcs are a superposition of solute transport in the conduit path and storage release path a method to evaluate the mass of conservative solute transport in storage release paths was proposed by segmenting the transport curve in the conduit from the total btcs thus quantifying the effects of the groundwater storage release mechanism on the solute transport process in the karst water system keywords karst water system conduit and fissures conservative solute storage release laboratory experiment data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction karst aquifers cover approximately 20 of the world s land area and are an important source of drinking water for approximately 25 of the global population ford and williams 2013 despite the significance of karst water resources there are a growing number of contamination incidences in karst aquifers worldwide henry and suk 2018 it is well known that strong karstification not only creates a special karst landscape on the surface but also creates a multi layer structure on both the surface and underground the surface karst has rapid infiltration with very low filtration and storage capacity making the karst aquifer extremely vulnerable to the surface related contaminants goeppert and goldscheider 2019 lu et al 2013 lasagna et al 2013 more importantly contamination can intensively get into the karst aquifers through surface runoff or overland flow that confluences in negative terrains such as karst depressions dolines and sinkholes fig 1 guo et al 2010 jakada et al 2019 vadillo and ojeda 2022 white et al 2018 in many instances the impact of such focused recharge on karst groundwater quality remains poorly understood and the risk of groundwater contamination is widely underestimated because of the fast flow into aquifers hao et al 2021 medici and west 2021 it is also common for residents to use karst depressions and sinkholes as refuse dumps resulting in unfiltered short lived contamination into karst aquifer causing catastrophic groundwater pollution jakada et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 furthermore extreme weather events have led to more frequent and intense flooding events in karst areas wang and chen 2021 these phenomena make it difficult to prevent sudden pollution incidents caused by short term pulses of contamination input zhang et al 2020 previous studies have revealed that focused recharge is the primary reason for widespread rapid transport of contaminants into the karst groundwater hartmann et al 2021 conservative solutes are those that do not react chemically or biologically during solute transport process khosronejad et al 2016 lamberti and hauer 2017 quantitative conservative tracer tests have been widely employed to analyze hydraulic characteristics and identify contaminant sources in karst aquifers bailly comte and pistre 2021 benischke 2021 goldscheider and drew 2007 mohammadi et al 2021a schiperski et al 2022 these conservative tracer tests showed that aquifer heterogeneity generates anomalous transport goeppert et al 2020 molinari et al 2015 consequently the tracer transport process and its accompanying morphology of btcs are complicated and variable making the interpretation of results ambiguous and requiring multiple solutions for example most previous studies have attributed the observed single peak tailing btcs to the interactions with pools or immobile zones along the main conduit dewaide et al 2016 goldscheider 2008 wu et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 meanwhile the bi peak tailing btcs generated by a single recharge event have been interpreted with reference to underground lakes auxiliary conduits multiple conduit configurations or aquifer medium types and have been verified by laboratory experiments and numerical simulations cen et al 2021 chu et al 2021 dewaide et al 2018 field and leij 2012 goldscheider et al 2008 perrin and luetscher 2008 tinet et al 2019 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2021 however there is also the possibility that the inversion of the hydraulic gradient between the conduit and the fissure s network could produce anomalous transport of conservative solutes faulkner et al 2009 goeppert et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 while this process has not been verified due to the complex field conditions and many influencing factors richter et al 2022 sivelle and labat 2019 how does groundwater storage and release processes affect the transport of conservative solutes under focused recharge conditions what will be the morphology of btcs at the outlet of karst springs these are important questions that should be addressed therefore it is important to critically study the behavior of conservative solutes in karst groundwater under focused recharge conditions to better understand the processes of solute transport storage and release here we evaluated the mechanisms of field scale storage and release of solutes under high and low flow conditions with focused recharge laboratory scale models were employed to allow better insights into groundwater flow and solute transport under controlled conditions mohammadi et al 2021b in this work a laboratory scale physical model was employed to investigate the solute transport in a conduit fissure system under high and low flow conditions with focused recharge existing solute transport models cannot capture both the heterogeneity in mobile domains and the bi peak characterized by the long tailing of btcs observed in complex media solute transport experiments for example the advection dispersion equation model ade has been used for approximately five decades to model solute transport in karst water system li et al 2020 however the ade model fails to characterize bi peak btcs and is not suited to capture the mass transfer process between immobile zones such as pools or eddies and conduits recently goeppert et al 2020 applied the continuous time random walk ctrw theory to account for the long tailed breakthrough behaviors found in karst water system to integrate the effect of auxiliary conduits in generating multi peaks btcs field and leij 2012 have proposed a dual advection dispersion equation dade that efficiently reproduces multi peaks btcs however this model does not allow for discreet allocation of the conduits along with the flow or combine the two exchange advective dispersive zones with a storage area wang et al 2020 reexamined the ability of the dade model to reproduce btcs with a single peak and bi peak in a dual conduit structure and they discovered that the model did not reproduce the skewness of some parts of the slower peaks to characterize the conservative solute transport process a solute transport model that can capture the heterogeneity in mobile domains exhibiting bi peaks and characterized by late time tails was calibrated this model was applied to elucidate the characteristics of conservative solute transport in a heterogeneous karst water system the high resolution of laboratory scale tracer tests and the reliability of the simulation results allow us to provide new insights into the conservative solute transport generated by groundwater storage and release processes in karst water systems these outcomes provide a scientific basis for the better development and utilization of karst water resources as well as the protection and conservation of its ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 conceptual model of solute storage and release in field scale in highly karstified area surface water and groundwater are always connected through sinkholes and karst conduits those karst aquifers with conduits and fissures and the conduits lie over an aquitard which are very common in sedimentary stratiform karst aquifers in south china fig 1 fig 2 after rainstorms quick hydrological responses will occur in karst springs leading to rapid increases in the water level of the underground river channels or karst conduits runoff accumulates when it reaches the sinkholes as the karst network becomes fully saturated and its drainage capacity is surpassed resulting in in situ flooding luo et al 2016 gil márquez et al 2019 naughton et al 2018 in such situations groundwater borne solutes are transported rapidly through a network of karst conduits undergoing frequent and rapid exchanges with fissures in response to the hydraulic gradient binet et al 2017 shu et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 as shown in fig 2a during short interval rainstorms the conduit rapidly recharges via sinkholes given the limited drainage capacity of the conduit water levels increase rapidly reaching levels higher than those in fissures which would drive the conduit borne solutes both in the unsaturated and saturated zone flowing into the surrounding fissures for storage when the rainfall ceases the conduit s hydraulic head diminishes due to the recharge recession and becomes inverted thereby mobilizing the groundwater stored in fissures pushing the stored solutes from fissures into conduits fig 2b chang et al 2021 faulkner et al 2009 kalantari and rouhi 2019 li et al 2008 shirafkan et al 2021 2 2 construction of the laboratory scale physical model according to the field scale model fig 2 the conceptual model of this experiment is based on the hydrological conditions in the field the simplified conceptual model presented in this work represents those karst aquifers with conduits and fissures the special hydrogeological structure makes the transport paths of solutes injected through the sinkholes after rainstorms which can be presented in two categories 1 solutes directly transported from the sinkhole to spring outlet along the conduit without exchange with the surrounding fissures 2 solutes are stored in the fissures during high flow conditions and released back into the conduit during low flow conditions in this study a two dimensional experiment apparatus was constructed based on this summarized conceptual model fig 3 the experiment apparatus consists of three units the focused recharge and tracer injection system the conduit and fissure system and the data monitoring and acquisition system the focused recharge unit is a cube tank 36 cm length 36 cm width 45 cm height with a vertical circular conduit connected to the bottom of the tank to simulate a depressional catchment and sinkhole the vertical conduit is connected to the tracer injection unit which also regulates the focused recharge water and tracer injection flow rate via control valves a rectangular plexiglass box was used to create a filling slot with dimensions of 100 cm 15 cm 40 cm length width height for the conduit and fissure system the horizontal circular conduit with a length of 100 cm and an inner diameter of 4 cm is placed at the bottom of the plexiglass box 840 boreholes 8 rows of 105 each are drilled above the halfway point along the horizontal conduit the boreholes are 3 mm inner diameter and 9 mm apart to provide water exchange channels between the conduit and fissures the conduit was sealed at other points to the fissures to avoid for circulations at the border between fissures and conduit to mimic a karst conduit and fissures system in which conduits lie on an aquitard a fissure is made of concrete blocks overlying the conduit occupying the remaining space of the filling slot the fissures with width of 3 to 6 mm were made between the blocks and the block surface is rough and contains lots of pores the void volume of the fissures and pores accounts for 25 of the entire volume of the plexiglass box on the bottom and back of the filling slot 40 piezometers are inserted at various locations the piezometers are used to measure the water head pressure at a specific point and the flow meter can monitor the recharge of the input conduit and fissure system 2 3 tracer test the experiment apparatus fig 3 is used to conduct tracer tests and characterize the solute storage release process control valve 4 was set as a smaller aperture than valve 2 to guarantee that the hydraulic gradient drives the conduit water into fissure for storage in the early stages and the fissure water can be released back into conduit at a later time nacl was used as a conservative solute do not react chemically or biologically to conduct the tracer tests at the start of the experiment a specific volume of tap water e g 9 0 l 11 0 l 13 0 l 19 5 l 26 0 l and 32 5 l and equal volume 0 25 l and equal mass concentration 60 g l of nacl solution were placed in the tap water tank and the salty water tank respectively for each group of tracer tests the tap water was drained by opening control valve 2 then control valve 1 was also opened and the injection of 0 25 l nacl with concentration of 60 g l was completed in 50 s with an average injection velocity of 0 1 m s the total duration times of each group tracer tests were completed in 780 to 1730 s the tracer was injected at the beginning of each group tracer test within 50 s so the tracer injection is considered as an instantaneous input compared to the much longer duration time after the entire tap water tank was wholly drained additional water was added to the tap water tank which acted as a base flow to maintain the conduit be full of water during the entire experiment duration the tracer concentration was measured indirectly by an electrical conductivity ec instrument ltc m10 solinst canada that was placed at the outlet with a resolution of 0 1 μs cm and a recording interval of 5 s the concentration of nacl was converted by ec values using the linear equation the ec of the tap water is 300 μs cm and this value was deducted in the calibration process the influence of different focused recharge volumes frvs on the solute storage release process between the conduit and fissures was investigated using six groups of tracer experiments to validate the experimental results each tracer experiment was replicated three times that reaches the error analysis better than 5 and one group of the typical btcs was chosen for the following analysis 2 4 modelling and calculation the transport phenomenon of conservative solutes in karst aquifers after a focused recharge event is complex particularly part of the solute directly transports through the main conduit with a high flow velocity with no exchange with the surrounding fissures while other parts of the solutes are stored in fissures or matrix and released at a later time due to the change in hydraulic gradient there are two different flow paths simultaneously operating during solute transport in karst aquifers solute retention may also be a factor due to the immobile zone can be composed of disconnected fissures porous rock matrix or other stagnant water zones e g pool volumes adjacent to the conduits in the natural karst aquifer in the laboratory experiment pores between blocks with rough surface can mimic the complex fissure network include the dead end fissures in the karst aquifer additionally there are lots of pores in the blocks that can act as immobile zone during solute transport fig 4 to capture such a bimodal sub diffusion process the dual heterogeneous domain model dhdm was augmented in this study initially proposed by yin et al 2020 1a c 1 t β 1 γ 1 c 1 t γ 1 l 1 x c 1 k φ 1 c 2 c 1 1b c 2

the operator l i x v i x d i 2 x 2 and v i lt 1 is the effective velocity in the i th domain v i is typically called the average linear velocity or seepage velocity for groundwater in the hydrogeology

fractional capacity coefficient in the i th domain and γ i dimensionless is the time index representing the degree of time nonlocality for solute transport in the i th domain the anomalous transport induced by groundwater storage release is quite complex with high transition and difficult to attain entire simulation after focused recharge and solute injection in the tracer test the solute particles may transport along two different paths additionally an immobile zone may exist and cause solute retention during solute transport through two paths as shown in equation 1 dhdm conceptualizes the aquifer into two mobile domains with different velocities and hydraulic dispersions to capture solute transport in the two path system the time fractional derivative in equation 1 enables dhdm the capacity for simulation of solute retention induced by immobile zone for simplicity and applicability constant flow velocity and dispersion coefficient were used as effective parameters in the dhdm an explicit lagrange scheme can be used to solve equation 1 the details for solving scheme for equation 1 are documented by yin et al 2020 consistent with the tracer experiment free flux conditions are used at the upstream and downstream boundaries for our scheme the instantaneous release of solute at the beginning was used to simulate the injection of tracers and the mass flux density at the outlet was calculated by 2 c f x τ p n total t 1 t 2 δ x x p t d t n total where c f x τ dimenionless is the normalized mass flux from time t 1 to t 2 δ is a dirac delta function and x p t is the location of particle p at time t n total dimenionless is the total number of particles in the domains the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the root mean square error rmse was selected as the criteria for observations and dhdm simulation comparison which were defined respectively as 3 nse 1 i 1 n y o i y s i 2 i 1 n y o i y 2 4 rmse 1 n i 1 n y o i y s i 2 where y o i and y s i are the observed and simulated mass flux at the time t i respectively and y is the mean observed mass flux under this criterion the optimum score of nse is 1 if nse 0 5 the simulation can be considered acceptable if nse 0 65 the model is deemed satisfactory if nse 0 75 the model is considered to perform optimally morales et al 2007 the optimum score of rmse is equal to 0 when the simulated values robustly capture the observed values e g the best model 3 results and discussion 3 1 development in shape of conservative solute btcs the observed btcs with different focused recharge volumes frvs are depicted in fig 5 a the base flow is 22 0 ml s before the inflow of focused recharge a small frv e g 9 0l exhibits a single broad peak with a relatively truncated tailing and asymmetrical form in the btc note that the btc exhibits a development to a bi peak shape with an frv of 11 0l the corresponding btcs are all bi peak curves with the frvs larger than 11 0l a comparison of the four bi peak curves shows that as the frv increases the first peak displays more symmetry followed by a lag by the second peak and thereafter the two peaks become increasingly separated fig 5a as the frv increases the btc s shapes change from a single peak to bi peak the first peak and the second peak concentration values c p e a k 1 and c p e a k 2 show a downward trend the shape of the second peak curve is flatter and wider compared to the first peak curve and all the btcs present a noticeable tailing phenomenon the solute recovery rates r range from 80 to 95 indicating the quality loss of some solutes fig 5b further data regarding the tracer experiments are given in table 1 3 2 water storage and release processes in fissures the unitary hydrograph at the conduit outlet is a comprehensive response to the single recharge episodes from tap water the groundwater flow and solute transport process could be explained quantitatively by analyzing the hydrographs and associated tracer btcs the calculation for average reynolds number re is documented by wang et al 2020 the re of all experiments are larger than 2000 indicating the turbulent flow conditions while it is well known that turbulent flow often occurs in natural karst systems worthington and soley 2017 the pressure head variations in the tap water tank and conduit as well as the outlet discharge processes were observed in all the experiments fig 6 and fig 7 a the hydrological process curves are illustrative of the salient impacts of hydrodynamic conditions on solute storage release processes based on the temporal turning points of the hydraulic head and outlet discharge variations it is feasible to differentiate between the periods when water is stored and released from the fissures the outlet discharge process follows a similar pattern and can be separated into three stages as shown in fig 7 the outlet discharge increases steadily after focused recharge release at stage i fig 7b considerable focused recharge water creates a rapid pressurized flow in the conduit besides a limited outlet aperture size induces parts of the water in conduit store into the fissures due to higher hydraulic head in conduit than that of fissures this process increases the water volume in the conduit fissures system and the remainder of the water is discharged through the conduit outlet for instance when frv is changed drastically from 9 0 to 32 5 l the water head h in the fissures also increases from 8 6 to 29 2 cm concurrently the hydraulic head in the conduit and fissure are superimposed and transferred to the outlet triggering the discharge to reach its peak values at the outlet therefore an increase in hydrodynamic conditions clearly causes an increase in the storage time and outlet discharge at stage i e g the flow rate of peak discharge q peak increases from 31 2 to 36 5 l s the storage time of fissures gets water from conduit t i increases from 75 to 185 s as shown in fig 7a and table 1 in stage ii the conduit hydraulic head diminishes due to the focused recharge recession fig 6a during this period the hydraulic gradients reversed with the hydraulic gradients in fissures being larger than the conduit subsequently the outlet discharges steadily decreased after reaching its peak at this instance the focused recharge is not yet finished and the outlet discharge mainly consumes the focused recharge water data in table 1 and table 2 clearly indicate that when the frv is small e g 9 0 l the hydraulic head of the conduit is insufficient to sustain more water storage in the fissure resulting in less water e g the water volume stored in the fissures v s 2 8 l and solutes entering the fissures causing the hydraulic head in the conduit to have a shorter duration e g the total time of focused recharge t fr 85 s so the solute retention time e g t ii 10 s in the fissures is also relatively short the velocity of solute transport in conduit is relatively slow for the 9 0 l frv compared to other scenarios hence there occurred the mixing processes of solute released by the storage release path and conduit transport path resulting in a single peak tailing curve however when the frv is larger the volume of water flowing into the fissure increases the hydraulic head in the conduit is maintained and extended by strong hydrodynamic conditions which can cause solute retention in the fissures for a longer time e g t ii increases from 25 to 405 s before being released furthermore this phenomenon makes the average flow velocity decline gradually thus prolonging the time that it takes for the solute to discharge from an outlet ultimately with the lagged arrival of the second peak the two peaks become progressively separated and c p e a k 2 tend to decrease due to the influence of mechanical dispersion and the solute dilution as for the release of fissure water following the termination of focused recharge occurring in stage iii during the recession storage water is released from the fissures and back into the conduit similarly the conduit acts as the water transmission channel at this point the outlet discharge consumes only the initial storage water in the fissures the outlet discharge gradually decreases until the base flow as the storage water is gradually discharged from the fissures recession curves are typically plotted in log q t space to illustrate the division of sub recession curves and calculate the recession coefficient sub recession curves are plotted as straight lines in log q t space when the spring discharge decreases exponentially amit et al 2002 tang et al 2016 the calculations demonstrate that the recession process of outlet discharge follows an exponential recessing law fig 7b with a relatively stable recession coefficient α ranging from 1 079 10 4 to 1 379 10 4 table 2 the outlet discharge recession time t iii increases from 695 to 1140 s as the frvs increases according to the water balance theory the results show that as the frv increases both the water volume released from the fissures v r and the volume of water transported only via conduit v c rise from 2 5 to 9 3 l and 6 3 to 22 3 l respectively table 2 the v s v r and v c with increased focused recharge show significant linear positive relationships fig 8 a however there is an interesting phenomenon that the proportions of both frvs are essentially steady with v r accounting for 27 v r f r v of the frvs on average while v c accounts for 70 v c f r v of the frvs implying that the conduit dominates flow transport fig 8b these results are compatible with the natural karst water systems that conduits are the main pathways of groundwater flow furthermore 3 v l f r v of water volume is lost during the tests owing to the capillary action that retains capillary water at the interface of the concrete block pores and the plexiglass box when the water level in the fissure domain lowers fig 8b 3 3 simulation of solute storage and release processes the dhdm was calibrated to simulate the btcs quantitatively to characterize the storage release process generating anomalous transport the simulated results of the dhdm model display that the dhdm robustly captured the skewness of long tailing and bimodal characteristics of the observed btcs fig 9 this is also confirmed quantitatively by the higher nse and lower rmse computed respectively the best fitted parameters of the dhdm for all tracer experiments are listed in table 3 as the frv increases from 9 0 to 32 5 l the best fitted velocity of the conduit domain v 1 increases from 1 10 to 1 40 m s which approximates the average velocity in conduit v 1 25 1 40 m s whereas the best fitted velocity of the fissure domain v 2 decreases from 0 90 to 0 13 m s the average flow velocity in the conduit and the fissures show a negative relationship with the conduit having a substantially higher flow velocity than that of the fissures table 3 as the frv increases the first peak emerges earlier whereas the second peak emerges later the bimodal structure of the btcs becomes more apparent with larger discrepancies in the velocity between different domains this implies that when solute transport in both domains is dominated by advection a larger discrepancy or contrast between velocities can further separate the two concentration peaks these results confirm that the solute storage release process is induced by hydrodynamic conditions which agree with the results of section 3 2 the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient in the conduit domain d 1 is larger than in the fissure domain d 2 and is caused by the significant flow velocity in the conduit domain morales et al 2010 taken collectively the corresponding d 1 did not change considerably and are in the same order of magnitude d 2 decreases response to a reduction in flow velocity in the fissure domain produced by an increase in retention time however the parameters capturing time nonlocality γ 1 and γ 2 as well as the fractional capacity coefficient β 1 of conduit domain remain stable since the conduit fissures structure remains maintained the fissure domain s fractional volume coefficient β 2 drops from 0 27 to 0 08 indicating a relatively weaker impact of solute retention on solute transport after a larger amount of recharge the enhanced hydrodynamic conditions drive the volume of storage water in fissures giving further impetus to the total volume of fissure domain and immobile zone to increase simultaneously nevertheless the volume of the immobile zone in the fissure domain increases at a slower rate as compared to the total volume meanwhile with the tracer injection condition remaining the same a larger φ 2 means more solute being trapped by the fissure domain whereas the opposite is found for the conduit domain table 3 3 4 quantitative analysis of solute in different flow paths the dhdm simulation reveals that advection controls conservative solute transport in the two domains combined with the analysis of the solute storage release processes in fissures it shows that the total btcs are the superposition of the solute transport in the conduit and storage release paths therefore the process of solute storage release in fissures could be considered as a relatively independent slow transport pathway consequently we utilized the best fitted parameters of equation 1a table 3 to represent the solute transport process in the conduit the solute transport process in the storage release path is obtained by subtracting the conduit transport curve from the total btcs a quantitative estimate of the mass of solute transport in the conduit and storage release paths was conducted by integrating the product of the envelope area of solute transport curves in the conduit and fissures with the total injected mass fig 10 the results elucidated that the enhanced hydrodynamic conditions initially push more solutes to be stored in fissures table 4 leading to gradual decrease in solute transport mass in the conduit as frv increases from 9 0 to 32 5 l the solute storage mass m s in the fissures also increases from 8 3 to 11 5 g simultaneously the solute release mass m r increases from 7 5 to 8 5 g while the solute transport mass m c in conduit decreases from 6 7 to 3 5 g fig 11 a accordingly the proportion of solute transport in the release path gradually increases from 50 to 57 m r m and decreases from 45 to 23 m c m in the conduit as the frv increases fig 11b it should be noted that the solute recovery rates are approximately 80 under higher hydrodynamic conditions e g 32 5 l and over 90 under weaker hydrodynamic conditions e g 9 0 l as discussed above with the conduit water entering the fissures the volume of the immobile zone in the fissure also increases and the capillary action retains and traps solute in the immobile zone resulting in a partial loss of solutes hence the proportion of solute mass loss m l increases from 5 to 20 as the hydrodynamic conditions increase fig 11 it is shown that due to the high flow velocity in the conduit solutes can be transported from the conduit to more distant fissure networks and immobile zones for storage through this process up to 77 of solutes enter the fissure storage 20 of solutes can be stored in the system without being released and this part of solutes may likely be released in the next stronger focused recharge event table 4 that way the focused recharge may result in an underestimated and widespread risk to usable groundwater volumes furthermore when slow and diffuse flows predominate during fissure release after focused recharge solutes can be released slowly and steadily into the conduit thereby maintaining a longer release time of solutes in karst aquifer 3 5 application and limitations of the laboratory analog karst groundwater is highly vulnerable owing to the focused recharge through sinkholes due to the high speed and turbulent flows in the conduit solute transport is usually a transitory process vadillo and ojeda 2022 however rapid transport continues to be a major problem as high concentrations of solutes could reach the system outlet more rapidly without being able to foresee the event which increases the uncertainty about their movement due to the random distribution of aquifer medium networks this implies that the pollution risk of groundwater is much larger than expected where focused recharge occurs also the slow release of storage solutes and pollutants or even flush out again by later recharge events is a big challenge for groundwater self purification in karst aquifers consequently the proposed method for quantifying conservative solute mass may be helpful in guiding karst groundwater pollution prevention remediation and management the physical and laboratory scale modeling of karst aquifers is an effective approach to gain insights into the mechanisms controlling karst groundwater flow and solute transport shu et al 2020 previous work has used geometric kinematic and mechanical similarities to scale up or down site scale conditions to laboratory scale mohammadi et al 2021b notably scale effects are the main problems faced by laboratory scale physical models the following limitations might occur in the present work 1 although the flow regime in the experiments is turbulent the reynolds number can be greater in site scale tracer tests 2 due to scale effects flow rates in site scale are typically much larger than laboratory scale which can affect tracer velocities and dispersive dhdm transport parameters 3 portraying the solute transport process in dual media with variable flow rates and volume ratios is complex in subsequent studies it s worthwhile to develop more realistic models such as simulating solute transport processes in karst aquifers by considering the spatial and temporal variation of flow velocities 4 summary and conclusion this paper evaluated the influences of focused recharge volumes frvs on the storage release process and btcs by performing experimental instantaneous tracer tests through conduit and fissure systems a dual heterogeneous domain model dhdm was successfully calibrated to simulate the transport process of conservative solute and quantitatively calculate the mass of the solute under focused recharge conditions the findings and conclusions of this study are summarized as follows 1 the magnitude of the focused recharge determines the strength of the hydrodynamic conditions the stronger the hydrodynamic conditions the greater the amount of water transported in the conduit alone and the amount of water stored in the fissures but the proportions of both to the frvs remain essentially constant 2 the hydrodynamic conditions strongly control the solute storage release process associated with anomalous transport and determine the solute retention time in the fissure domain these conditions produce strong asymmetry long tailing or bi peaks in the btcs as hydrodynamic conditions increase the btcs shift from a single peak to a bi peak and the separation of the first and second peaks become more apparent 3 the dhdm model can robustly capture the long tailing in btcs including the bimodal characteristics of the observed btcs specifically the flow velocity and dispersion coefficient are the major variables that regulate the bimodal structure of the btcs and the solute storage release differences between the conduit and fissure domains the bimodal structure of the btcs becomes more apparent for larger discrepancies in flow velocity 4 a method to quantify the solute mass in storage release paths by segmenting the solute transport curve in the conduit from the total btcs was proposed under strong hydrodynamic conditions the solute mass proportion of conduit transport was less than 23 in comparison the solute mass proportion of fissure storage was up to 77 due to the large hydraulic gradients but 20 of solutes were stored in the system without being released during the subsequent fissure release process these outcomes provide enhanced and improved insights into the impact of hydrodynamic conditions on storage and release of conservative solute between karst conduit and fissures medium in karst aquifer further these findings might be essential for better understanding solute transport in karst aquifers credit authorship contribution statement huaisong ji conceptualization formal analysis methodology software

3132,climate change and urbanization put stress on urban stormwater systems triggering hydraulic overloading and urban flooding increase low impact development lid techniques have a high potential to mitigate their impacts this study investigates the consequences of climate change and urbanization on the urban runoff in the risvollan catchment in trondheim norway and the effects of lid implementation and the influence of lid spatial distributions on their performance a swmm model of risvollan was implemented along with different scenarios of urbanization and climate change the performance of various spatial distributions of lid infrastructures in the catchment was investigated using the outflow volume and the peak runoff at the outfall as indicators the rainfall event based simulation results confirmed the negative effects of urbanization and climate change on urban runoff these effects were partially mitigated by a homogenous lid implementation the different spatial distributions of lid had little impact on volume reduction but targeting the most downstream zones of the model was more efficient in reducing the peaks at the catchment s outlet these findings confirm that the spatial configuration of lid might be a determinant parameter towards an efficient design of lid infrastructure in urban settings depending on the local stakes and criteria of urban water management keywords low impact development lid implementation scenarios climate change adaptation swmm sensitivity analysis 1 introduction in norway rainfall intensity and amount are expected to increase in the future due to climate change sorteberg et al 2018 on the other hand urbanization alters runoff formation by sealing permeable surfaces thus limiting infiltration and evaporation of water shuster et al 2005 and increasing stormwater runoff the combined effect of climate change and rapid urbanization will increase the volume and intensity of stormwater in the future consequently many stormwater management systems are at risk of increased overflow frequency with the associated urban flooding and sewage overflow skougaard kaspersen et al 2017 which will have significant economic zhou et al 2012 health han he 2021 and environmental semadeni davies et al 2008 consequences in the last few decades low impact development lid infrastructures have been regarded as sustainable stormwater solutions that mitigate climate change and rapid urbanization lid techniques increase permeability and vegetation cover of urban catchments which enhance evapotranspiration and infiltration and reduce the amount of stormwater runoff flowing to the drainage network eckart et al 2017 among the lid infrastructures green roofs and permeable pavements have the potential to reduce stormwater volumes permanently additionally they attenuate and delay the drainage outflows due to water s temporal storage and routing which is beneficial for stormwater management for green roofs volume reduction due to evapotranspiration was found to vary between 11 and 59 of the annual precipitation in cold and wet climatic regions bengtsson et al 2005 johannessen et al 2018 stovin 2010 furthermore green roofs were found to attenuate drainage outflows by 59 90 johannessen et al 2018 palla et al 2011 stovin et al 2012 these are significant figures for stormwater management considering that building roofs account for up to 50 of impervious areas in densely urbanized catchments dunnett kingsbury 2004 on the other hand permeable pavements provide high volume reduction due to infiltration drake et al 2013 significant volume reduction can also be obtained even when permeable pavements are constructed over soils with low permeability dreelin et al 2006 furthermore permeable pavements were found to detain the drainage flow effectively with an average peak reduction of around 80 braswell et al 2018 winston et al 2018 and average peak delay between 15 mins to 4 h fassman blackbourn 2010 støvring et al 2018 numerous studies have investigated the catchment scale implementation of lid infrastructure to identify the density of lid measures needed to achieve desirable hydrological performances for instance palla gnecco 2015 concluded that at least 5 of impervious surfaces should be converted into lid measures to obtain noticeable hydrological benefits at the catchment scale hamouz et al 2020 stated that retrofitting 11 of the building with green roofs would substantially reduce the maximum flow at the catchment outlet hernes et al 2020 presented the effect of different lid densities on the resulting combined sewer overflow at the catchment outlet skaugen et al 2020 concluded that for their study case an urban catchment with 500 houses 60 rain gardens unit area of 10 m2 are needed to reduce the peak flow by 10 recently the spatial configuration of lid measures in urban catchments has been regarded as an impactful parameter for the efficiency of stormwater management at the catchment scale giacomoni joseph 2017 however only a few studies have been found to investigate this topic for instance yao et al 2020 examined different spatial configurations of green roofs and found that retrofitting roofs directly connected to the drainage network achieves higher hydrological benefits likewise liang et al 2020 concluded that a higher peak reduction could be achieved at the catchment outlet by implementing lid measures in areas directly connected to the drainage network hou et al 2020 found that placing lid measures near areas sensitive to flooding and pollution is the most cost effective strategy similarly ercolani et al 2018 recommend placing lid measures near portions of the drainage network that are prone to overflowing giacomoni joseph 2017 found placing lid measures at the downstream portion of the catchment to yield better peak reduction at the outlet while placing lid measures at the upstream reduces the surface flooding at the downstream areas hydrological models are essential tools for studies that aim to evaluate lid implementation scenarios at the catchment scale the epa s storm water management model swmm is perhaps the most common tool for these studies however most of these studies applied swmm catchment models without calibration liang et al 2020 yao et al 2020 indeed this is a limitation as uncalibrated swmm models might yield unsatisfactory modelling performances peng stovin 2017 which could alter the findings of such studies on the other hand many scholars have attempted to calibrate swmm catchment models by altering physical properties such as the percentage of imperviousness hamouz et al 2020 this practice is questionable since lid implementation scenarios would also involve changing the degree of imperviousness and hence abolishing the calibration setup there is a clear need for a proper sensitivity analysis to identify the most influential swmm catchment model parameters for calibration without changing the physical properties such as the degree of imperviousness the motivation for this study was to investigate the influence of the spatial distribution and density of lid measures on runoff mitigation and provide insights to improve the robustness of implementation strategies of lid infrastructures within an urban catchment this work implemented the swmm model for an urban catchment in trondheim norway and several urbanizations and climate change scenarios lid techniques integration at different spatial locations and densities was also implemented this paper addresses the following i identification of the most sensitive parameters of the swmm modelling approach ii modelling of the combined impact of climate change and urbanization on runoff mitigation iii comparison of different spatial configurations for lid implementation 2 methods 2 1 study site and data the study area is an urban catchment risvollan in trondheim city norway a separate stormwater management system drains water over 20 6 ha in the residential area of risvollan in the south east of the city where the elevation varies between 85 and 134 m a s l this study used the gis spatial data subcatchments delineation and stormwater network data from hailegeorgis alfredsen 2018 study the catchment was considered 27 impervious area with 14 roofs 9 roads and 4 sidewalks and 73 pervious area including grasslands vegetated areas and some built up zones most of the land cover delineations were done using aerial photos and local land use maps while the sidewalk areas were obtained by 1 m buffering around the road zones the catchment was subdivided into 55 subcatchments on average of 0 39 ha linked together by a stormwater network comprised of 78 manholes 78 conduits and one outlet fig 1 presents a map of the area including subcatchment delineation land cover delineation and an outline of the stormwater network a measure station next to the outlet provides several decades of 1 min precipitation and temperature data precipitation was measured with an unshielded lambrecht tipping bucket with 0 1 mm per tip stormwater flow data at the outfall of the catchment was also collected with a 1 min resolution missing stormwater flow data was interpolated linearly and time periods with significant missing data were excluded from the study 2 2 model and model setup the study system and area are modelled in the epa s storm water management model swmm an open source model first developed in 1971 and widely used for planning design and analysis of stormwater systems this study used the version 5 1 that incorporates lid modelling for various types of green infrastructure such as green roofs and permeable pavements rossman 2015 the model set up from gis data as well as all future manipulations for calibration sensitivity study and scenarios exploration were done in r programming language using the swmmr package leutnant et al 2019 in this study the swmm catchment model simulates the rainfall runoff process using the green ampt equation for infiltration and kinematic wave formula for runoff routing rossman 2015 all simulations were event based hence evaporation was ignored in this study both permeable pavements and green roofs were implemented in this study using the internal lid module in swmm rossman 2015 this module simulates the hydrological processes of green roofs using green ampt equation for surface infiltration to the soil layer darcy s equation for percolation to the drainage layer and manning formula for drainage layer outflow for permeable pavement the water infiltrates from the surface directly to the soil layer the bedding layer limited by the permeability of the surface layer the percolation from the bedding layer to the base layer is determined following darcy s equations and the drainage flow is determined by an empirical power equation rossman 2015 the green roof type implemented consisted of a 30 mm vegetation mat over a 10 mm textile retention fabric and was designed for sloped roofs all green roofs implemented had the same unit area of 15 m2 and the same unit width of 7 5 m their parameters for the surface soil and drainage layers in the swmm model were obtained from johannessen et al 2019 a permeable pavement with a bottom liner was implemented in the study it comprises of an interlocking pavement of 80 mm thickness with 10 mm joints that allows water to infiltrate into a 30 mm bedding layer the base layer was 100 mm thick and made of coarse materials and the subbase layer was 250 mm thick the pavement was lined with an impermeable geotextile all permeable pavements implemented had the same unit area of 100 m2 and the same unit width of 8 m the parameters for the swmm implementation of the permeable pavements were obtained from abdalla et al 2021 2 3 calibration and validation rainfall runoff events were extracted for calibration and validation from the precipitation and the stormwater runoff data of the recent years 2016 to 2019 to account for recent urbanization and land use change in the catchment the start of events was defined at the first rainfall measurement and the end was defined when the flow returns to the minimum measured value of 0 001 m3 s to eliminate too small events only those with an accumulated precipitation greater than 3 mm were considered this yielded several dozens of events for the four years the physical model parameters such as subcatchment width area slope imperviousness degree as well as manholes and pipes geometric characteristics were extracted from hailegeorgis alfredsen 2018 study in their study they developed a distributed hydrological model for the risvollan catchment with high spatial resolution to account for variability of land use and land cover of the catchment they found a grid size of 5 5 m to be sufficient for accounting for the spatial variability accordingly and through gis analysis they divided the catchment into 55 subcatchments that are connected with a network of pipes and manholes their model achieves satisfactory results indicating that the spatial discretization was adequate therefore we decided to use the spatial discretization from their study another reason to use spatial discretization from hailegeorgis alfredsen 2018 study is the fact that swmm is a semi distributed hydrological model hence spatial discretization with high resolution is needed to analyse and compare different spatial configurations of lid measures at a catchment scale the manning s roughness for the impervious zones was set to 0 013 in impervious zones and 0 15 in pervious zones in accordance with the values provided in the swmm user manual rossman 2015 the subcatchments were divided into two categories depending on their impervious rate a threshold of 30 of imperviousness was selected to separate pervious and impervious subcatchments this denomination criterion was carried on for the relevant model parameters it differentiated between the subcatchments containing mainly open grassland and vegetation and those comprising a more significant part of human constructions and built up areas the calibrated parameters were the parameters of green ampt infiltration equation i e saturated hydraulic conductivity and suction head attributed to each subcatchment category initial moisture deficit for pervious and impervious sub catchments depression storage volumes for both pervious and impervious zones in all subcatchments the seepage loss rate in the pipe network and manning s roughness of pipes as well as the baseflow of the drainage pipes for a total for 11 calibrated parameters the baseflow is related to processes that were not included in the model such as leakage from the drinking water system and connections to the wastewater system the boundaries for the infiltration depression storage and seepage rate were set using the swmm user manual rossman 2015 and the baseflow boundaries were set around the minimal measured outflow the pipe roughness was calibrated outside its recommended range in the swmm manual to account for model delays and network irregularities e g obstructions singular energy losses points or unforeseen leakages the summary of the boundaries for each parameter is visible in table 1 the calibration was performed using the differential evolution algorithm storn price 1997 using the deoptim library in r mullen et al 2011 initially the algorithm creates a population of random solutions by selecting model parameters from given ranges each of the solutions is evaluated based on the value of the objective function then the algorithm creates a new population in a way that each solution is either improved or remains the same this process continues for a number of iterations 100 in this study and the best solution in the last population is selected as the optimal the calibration process used kling gupta efficiency kge as the objective function gupta et al 2009 to evaluate the goodness of fit of the modelled output compared to the measurements of outflow seven events were chosen for calibration by excluding winter events and aiming for variety in rainfall hyetograph shapes table 2 the time step for modelling was selected as 10 min and hence rainfall and runoff data were aggregated accordingly the calibration was performed in three steps as follows 1 one selected event c3 was calibrated 2 the initial soil moisture deficits of each of the seven calibrated events were optimized this was achieved after fixing all other parameters to the values of the optimal parameter set of c3 3 the depression storages are fixed to the optimal value of c3 and the optimal initial saturation of each event are fixed then the remining model parameters were optimized for each event separately this process resulted in a different parameter set for each of the seven calibrated events these parameter sets were considered for ensemble simulation in which each parameter set yields different flow simulation the results of ensemble simulations are combined to provide a measure of uncertainty due to model parameters six validation events were extracted from 2016 to 2019 data in the same fashion as the calibration events and are presented in table 2 the calibrated models of the ensemble were applied to provide flow simulations for those events the model performance was evaluated against the average of the ensemble using kge equation 1 1 k g e 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 r is the correlation between simulations and observation α is the measure of flow variability error and β is the measure of the volumetric error percentage bias 2 4 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis of the parameters was carried out to screen the parameters of the model this approach can also constitute a first analysis of the uncertainty of the simulation results the applied method was derived from the glue methodology beven binley 1992 implemented in a similar fashion to krebs et al 2016 also referred to as monte carlo filtering saltelli et al 2007 this method relies on monte carlo simulations with a filtering method to distinguish behavioural and non behavioural parameter sets the behavioural parameter sets are defined as parameter sets leading to performance higher than a specific threshold value of the objective function the initial distribution of parameter sets is considered as a prior while the filtered distribution stand for a posterior distribution the sensitivity is evaluated by computing the kolmogorov smirnov ks distance between the prior and posterior distribution of each parameter the distance associated to each parameter is then screened to select the most behavioural parameter i e the parameters with the largest statistical distance between prior and posterior the sobol sequence sobol 2001 was chosen to sample 65 000 sets of the 11 parameters the model was run with event c3 table 2 for each of the parameter sets the performance was evaluated with three objectives functions equations 1 2 and 3 the kge threshold used to separate behavioural and non behavioural parameters was 0 58 to evaluate the results of the glue based sensitivity screening the method was confirmed using another sensitivity analysis method the rbd fast method random balance design fourier amplitude sensitivity test tarantola et al 2006 and sobol 1st order and total effect indices sobol 2001 for this purpose the sensitivity analysis was also applied to the kge nse and the pbias with glue and the rbd fast different thresholds were chosen for the glue methodology to ensure that the filtered dataset include 15 5 and 1 of the sampled parameter in addition pearson correlation coefficients were determined between the behavioural parameters to evaluate correlations between model parameters 2 n s e 1 q o b s q s i m 2 q o b s q o b s 2 3 pbias 100

demonstrated that the performance of green roofs is influenced by the rainfall intensity and shape of the hyetograph eckart et al 2017 yao et al 2020 in this work real recorded rainfall events of different durations were chosen from historical data with a 1 min resolution byscreening for extreme events as well as events whose return periods are around the usual design return periods for stormwater systems the european standard bs en752 2008 recommends a design storm return period of 1 year for rural areas 2 years for residential areas 5 years for city centres without flooding checks and up to 10 years for areas with underground railways butler et al 2018 finally three events of different durations referred as e1 e2 and e3 were extracted from the historical data with return periods ranging from 5 to 20 years the highest event ever recorded in trondheim from august 2007 was included referred to as e4 with a return period of more than 100 years this extreme rainfall event was accompanied by flash floods and extreme flooding triggering damage in the city table 2 presents those events and their estimated return periods as has been done in a previous study shuster et al 2005 the catchment runoff descriptors used were the total outflow volume made of the sum of the outflow volume and the flooding volume and the peak runoff value the peak flooding value was also extracted from the simulations output for each manhole the flooding in swmm is the overflow from manhole when the drainage pipe is surcharged it is calculated when the pipe and manhole reached their full capacity rossman 2015 the results for those indicators are presented both in raw values and in variation rates the respective references for the evolution rates are given in the relevant sections 2 5 2 urbanization the catchment had an initial impervious rate including roofs sidewalks and road of 27 based on this reference scenario nref seven urbanization scenarios were developed with different imperviousness rate ranging from 30 to 90 each scenario was named nx where x was the target impervious rate the scenarios were developed as follow i newly impervious areas were distributed in order to favour lowly impervious areas first and aim for homogenized imperviousness of each subcatchments but keeping the initial bias of scenario nref for each scenarios ii the maximum imperviousness rates was set to 95 for each urbanization scenario the model parameters were updated using the impervious pervious boundary defined during the calibration process scenarios nref n60 and n90 are studied more in detail in the later results 2 5 3 lid implementation the ten most impervious subcatchments in the current state of the risvollan catchment with an average of 51 roofs 37 roads and 12 pavements for the impervious areas were the reference for the breakdown of impervious area in all scenarios the lid infrastructures were implemented by addition of unit components with an area of 15 m2 for green roofs and 100 m2 for permeable pavements until the total area of lid obtained by the product of the target density and the available area was reached in each target subcatchment each lid implementation scenario was defined by the density of lid among the impervious area and the strategy of implementation of lid i e the type of subcatchment where lid were implemented six implementation strategies were developed and are visible in fig 1 i homogeneous as a reference scenario ii left zone and iii right zone to study the impact of intense implementation without favouring a distance to the outlet iv upstream v downstream1 and vi downstream2 to study the influence of the distance to the outlet for the first scenario of homogenous lid spatial configurations they were implemented in each subcatchment with the given density for the following scenarios the lid units were distributed randomly within the corresponding target subcatchments until the target overall lid density was reached or until the target zone was saturated in lid s i e when all available pavements and roofs had been equipped with permeable pavements or green roofs respectively 2 5 4 climate change to account for the expected increase in heavy precipitation intensity climate change factors were used in this study to compare the behaviour of the model for the different rainfall events and the different scenarios given the durations and the return periods of the chosen events 2 factors were used in this study 1 for the historical events without climate change and 1 4 to study those same events accounting for climate change dyrrdal and førland 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 model parametrization 3 1 1 calibration and validation results it is a common practice to calibrate the impervious rate of subcatchments in swmm models the imperviousness degree is part of what liong et al 1991 calls non traditional parameters contrary to the traditional parameters i e infiltration parameters or depression storages non traditional parameters can technically be measured or interpreted from measures but due to model limitations relative errors and complex measurement procedures they are often included in the calibration process and have relatively dominant effects for example sangal bonema 1994 recommends the determination of the impervious rate to be the first step of the calibration using a storm in which the rainfall intensity does not exceed the infiltration capacity of the pervious areas more generally with current automated calibration processes this parameter is often included within the calibration parameter set see for example hernes et al 2020 panos et al 2018 temprano et al 2007 among many others however this method was not applicable here as the future urbanization scenarios would involve manipulations of the impervious rate the calibration resulted in kge values ranging from 0 705 to 0 898 fig 2 for the seven calibrated events kouchi et al 2017 reports that a kge 0 75 defines a good model performance and kge 0 5 defines a satisfactory model performance this indicates a good to satisfactory calibration results the model provides a satisfactory outflow timing and shape in most of the simulated events however the modelled peak values were underestimated for some events the optimized parameter values are presented in table 1 fig 3 presents the performance of the calibrated swmm models on the six validation events by comparing the average of the ensemble with the observation three events yielded simulation with satisfactory kge values kge greater than 0 5 this means that for certain events v1 v2 and v4 the model performance was unsatisfactory when only the mean of the ensemble is considered however the peak values of most of the validations events laid within the bounds of the ensemble except for v1 hence the swmm model with the ensemble simulation is considered valuable for evaluating the effect of lid implementation on high flow values therefore it was decided to apply the ensemble simulations for investigating scenarios of lid implementation 3 1 2 sensitivity analysis results glue has been applied to the risvollan model as an assessment of uncertainty to estimate the relative sensitivity of the parameters and screen the most behavioural ones after the filtering of the 65 000 parameter sets with kge of 0 58 as a threshold value separating behavioural and non behavioural parameters 682 parameter sets were found to be behavioural representing 1 of the generated datasets fig 4 presents the bivariate and the univariate kernel density kde plots of the 5 most sensitive parameters of this swmm model baseflow depstoper ksatper ksatimp seepage the two predominantly sensitive parameters the baseflow and the depression storage in pervious area highlight the characteristic of lowly urbanized catchment there is a lot of uncertainty in the natural area behaviour and inflow going in the network the hydraulic conductivities and to a lesser extent the pipe seepage rate absorb model irregularities and unmodelled hydrological processes in this model e g interaction with groundwater and smoothen the output the use of rbd fast method and sobol 1st order and total effect indices fig 5 led to a similar screening however the glue based sensitivity is sensitive to the threshold used in terms of ranking it should also be noted that the ranking depends on the objective function chosen according to rbd fast and sobol indices the depression storage in pervious area is more sensitive than the baseflow in terms of nse and pbias the ranking differ for nse with the glue based approach those results confirm that the glue methodology can be applied for screening behavioural and non behavioural parameters if used carefully despite the flexibility of the glue method it does not allow to achieve similar ranking as the one achieved with the rbd fast or sobol indices the sizes of the filtered dataset can also influence the results so the threshold should be carefully selected brunetti et al 2016 the review from salvadore et al 2015 that concluded that in many swmm modelling studies the most sensitive parameters are the manning s roughness coefficient of pipes and the impervious rate in the current approach due to the use of baseflow the roughness had a lower influence due to the necessary hypothesis for lid implementation scenario the impervious rate was not considered as a calibrated parameter krebs et al 2013 found that for their model the depression storage in impervious zones was the most sensitive parameter similarly to the current study where it ranks 2nd the correlation between the most sensitive parameters is displayed on fig 4 with a maximum absolute value of 0 35 it appears that there is no strong correlation between any of the parameters indicating an adequate independence of the parameters this is reflected in total effect sobol indices where the ranking remain unchanged from 1st order indices 3 2 scenarios exploration results 3 2 1 effects of urbanization and climate change on current catchment the results of the first simulations aiming at evaluating the influence of urban growth and climate change on the study area are presented in fig 6 without accounting for climate change the increase of urbanization already has a high impact on the flow indicators for e4 the peak flooding increase by 100 and the total volume outflow by 20 between the initial situation nref and the n90 urbanization scenario the peak discharge stay stable since the maximum capacity of the outflow pipe is reached during the simulation hence a stable peak discharge does not mean no effect the total volume and the peak of flooding can still increase e g for event e4 with a climate factor of 1 4 with up to 62 increase of total volume outflow and 260 increase of peak flooding while the linear increase of precipitation resulted in a linear increase in the total outflow volume it appears that the increase of peak runoff is non linear e2 e3 and e4 display an identical maximum peak value around 0 038 mm for several urbanization scenarios this peak value most likely corresponds to the maximum outlet capacity of the network likewise ercolani et al 2018 observed a non linear peak reduction with respect to a catchment scale green roof implementation the authors attributed this non linearity to drainage network being close to its maximum capacity the peak flooding values continue to increase linearly for e1 e2 and e3 fig 7 shows the spatial impact of an intense urbanization scenario 90 on the spatial flooding values at risvollan intense precipitation events especially e4 and e2 triggered flooding from different manholes at risvollan under this intense urbanization scenario it can be seen from fig 7 that some manholes experienced higher flooding values especially at the downstream parts of risvollan additionally the results showed that flooding from sewer manholes is triggered by rainfall intensity and not by the rainfall amount for instance e2 return period 2 y caused more flooding than e1 even though e1 has more amount and higher return period return period 5 y as summarized in table 2 3 2 2 effects of homogenous lid this section presents and discusses the results of homogenous lid implementation on all subcatchments the variations of indicators induced by 100 implementation of homogeneous lid for the different urbanization scenarios are presented in fig 8 under the current climate for events e1 e2 and e3 the peak discharge tends to decrease its variation ranging from 0 to 22 it means that the more the city gets urbanized the more effective the lid gets however for e2 and e4 the maximum outlet flow i e the capacity of the drainage network is attained as shown in fig 8 obscuring the performance of the lid implementation however the evolution of peak flooding reflects the lid mitigation action as it is very consistently reduced by large rates between around 50 for n90 and event e2 and e3 event e4 the most extreme event out of the 4 with a return period of 100 years yielded more erratic results than other events when it comes to peak reduction this might be due the fact that the maximum pipe capacity is reached in addition the nature of this event short and intense triggers the complexity of the system and lead to more unforeseen peaks the behaviour of the system was not investigated further regarding this matter however the peak flooding tends to decrease with presence of lid the results in fig 9 show the variation of peak discharge and flooding with the scenario nref no lid as a reference the scenario homogeneous 100 and no lid are displayed it shows for no lid the increase of the indicators except peak discharge when the pipe capacity is reached the range corresponding to homogeneous scenario showed that it is possible to compensate urbanization in most of the events e1 e2 and e3 however when climate change is considered it is not possible to come back to performance without climate factor and without urbanization it is nonetheless possible to contain the effect of climate change with high urbanization the total outflow variation fig 8 c appears to be almost linearly decreasing with lid density for all rainfall scenarios with some outlier values appearing for e4 at n90 the reduction rate ranges between 12 and 46 when comparing these values to the pre urbanization volumes fig 9 it appears that it is not possible to compensate completely the imperviousness increase for all events and all model in the ensemble however the volume increase can be limited and often it can even decrease e g for e3 the volume vary between 5 and 45 without lid and 10 to 20 with lid which evidently reduces the stress on the stormwater system the range of the ensemble encompass model uncertainty and initial conditions variation this approach shows the value of ensemble modelling with multiple events to cope with climate and condition variability when considering climate change the effect on the total volume outflow of the system is the most prevalent which is expected since the volume of the rainfall increases on fig 8 the values of total volume and flooding are shifted according to the climate factor the peak discharge variation is only positive for e1 since the maximum capacity of the system was not reached the lid implementation occupying 100 of available surfaces cannot compensate both effect of urbanization and climate change fig 9 however it can compensate the effect of urbanization since the variation of total volume outflow stay stable with increasing urbanization when compared to nref without lid or climate factor overall homogenous lid implementation over the catchment was found to be an effective strategy to cope with increased urban runoff with increased urbanization and climate effects for peak runoff peak flooding and total outflow volume the lid implementation could partly compensate either urbanization or climate change but can not fully compensate for the combination of the two 3 2 3 influence of the spatial configurations of lid measures the variation of performance between the homogenous distribution and the five scenarios of spatial distribution of lid were evaluated fig 10 and fig 11 presents the effects of lid implementation scenarios on peak discharge and total volume outflow variation respectively for three urbanization scenarios nref n60 and n90 in terms of total outflow volume and peak flooding the left branch and right branch scenarios yielded similar results to those of the homogenous distribution they were not found to be effective to reduce peak runoff this indicates that there is no topographical or network difference that triggers a major behaviour difference in lid performance in those two zones the results for peak discharge variation indicate that the downstream scenarios can reach the same peak reduction levels as the homogenous lid with a smaller lid density around 40 for the first downstream scenario and 20 for the second in contrast upstream implementation has little effect on the peak discharge downstream however when it comes to outflow volume the different lid distributions perform the same as the homogenous distribution the spatial location of lid was found to influence the flooding from manholes to demonstrate this finding the six implementation scenarios were compared at a similar catchment scale lid density which correspond to 100 of lid in the target area of downstream2 the limiting scenario corresponding to 23 of the full catchment for homogeneous scenario the other lid densities within their respective target area were 48 left 51 right 47 upstream and 45 downstream1 these scenarios were investigated on event e4 and urbanization n90 and by using one parameter set from the ensemble these results are presented in fig 12 the homogenous configuration was found to be the least effective in reducing flooding peaks from manholes distributing lid at the upstream of the catchment resulted in flooding peak reductions in both the upstream and downstream manholes even with the short concentration time of the risvollan catchment of around 10 15 min skaugen et al 2020 the runoff from the upstream subcatchments has a lesser contribution to the peak flow due to the travelling processes both overland and in the pipe network nevertheless these results along with the s shape of the curves in fig 10 suggests that subcatchments close to a measurement point have higher influence on peaks this implies the existence of critical subcatchments located downstream and close to the outlet of interest that control most of the peak outflow and that must be targeted to control it therefore given a vulnerable outlet if peak runoff is considered the most relevant indicator for the stress level put on the stormwater network it seems possible to achieve the same performance as homogenous lid in a much more cost time and resources efficient way by targeting the critical subcatchments situated downstream near the vulnerable outlet however the performance in terms of total volume reduction is the same for all lid spatial distributions to compare these results with the findings of some studies around the same issues giacomoni joseph 2017 found placing lid at the downstream of the catchment to yield better peak reduction at the outlet which is similar to the finding of this study hou et al 2020 who developed an adaptive differential evolution algorithm to optimize the spatial priority scheme of various lid techniques in yichuan china recommended to place lid solutions near areas that are sensitive to flooding and pollution for achieving the most cost effective stormwater management plan liang et al 2020 found that peak flow reduction was most sensitive to the reduction of directly connected impervious areas dcia indeed for a similar lid implementation the results were better with less dcia zellner et al 2016 found that with an increase in precipitation and in areas suitable for green infrastructures implementation patterns that followed the flow paths and the accumulation of water also became more effective which resonate with the results of this study ercolani et al 2018 concluded that the urban system in the metropolitan city of milan italy responded non linearly to green roof density in terms of peak runoff reduction at the outfall they related this non linearity to the stormwater system being close to its conveyance capability they studied a targeted green roof implementation that concentrated them on areas where conduits were prone to filling this scenario showed a better performance than a homogenous implementation in terms of peak flow reduction at the outlet this is coherent with the results of this study as downstream pipes are more vulnerable to filling as ending points of the entire network with respect to flooding zellner et al 2016 found that spatially dispersed green infrastructure was more efficient to reduce flooding than clustered arrangements which is different from the results observed in this study it could be explained by the higher slopes in the current study especially clustered approaches were found to have more effective local effects 3 3 implications this study examined the impacts of urbanization and climate change on the urban runoff response for the risvollan catchment as well as different lid implementation scenarios and their mitigating capacities our results highlight that climate change and urbanization put the current stormwater system under stress and that lid infrastructures can participate in the mitigation of their effects these results may constitute useful insight for municipalities firstly in this study it appears that depending on the target indicator to be reduced the spatial distribution of lids can be an important factor for an effective design indeed if the priority is to reduce the volume at the outfall of the catchment the distribution of lid has little influence whereas if the priority is the reduction of the outfall peak it will be more resources and cost efficient to target the critical downstream subcatchments this highlights an important aspect of green infrastructure implementation the phasing of green infrastructure implementation if the total outflow volume is not influenced by the strategy the peak runoff in one location or local flooding is influenced by the implementation in its neighbourhood therefore when it comes to prioritize implementation with limited resources those results suggest that critical area should be directly prioritized more precisely the highly influential areas of the area of interest should be identified and prioritized the use of model ensemble despite showing similar trends in most of the case shows the deep level of uncertainty associated with limited data and knowledge linked to a specific catchment secondly the comparison of the lid performance for different rain events suggests that peak attenuation should be combined to return period to evaluate the bandwidth of lid performance indeed the implemented lid infrastructure in this study was able to mitigate a 12 h event with a 20 years return period and a relatively low peak better than it could mitigate our 2 other events with a 5 year return period moreover the inclusion of a 100 year precipitation event in the rainfall scenarios provided erratic and inconclusive results indicating the inadequacy of the method used for this case this effect is interwined with the fact that our model was not calibrated for extreme events and thus probably does not perform well in those cases this highlights the need for further research to explore the behaviour of lid infrastructure under extreme events 3 4 limitations firstly the rainfall input was event based which limits the ability to explore the behaviour of lid infrastructure under other types of rainfall than the four used here for reference qin et al 2013 described the performance difference of various lid infrastructures for different hydrograph shapes moreover many studies have suggested more robust approaches to investigate lid performance based on continuous rainfalls i e long term simulations stovin et al 2017 secondly the calibration method used might have triggered unforeseen effects of the adopted high pipe roughness further research might be needed to understand better the limitations of this method finally this study used an aggregation of identical unit lid structures whereas a more realistic study might need to precisely retrofit existing roofs and pavements 4 conclusion this study implemented a swmm model of the risvollan catchment in trondheim norway and investigated the impacts of various urbanization and climate change scenarios for 4 different rainfall events different lid densities were implemented with varying spatial distributions and their performances in mitigating the effects of climate change and urbanization were explored the main results were as follows i the most sensitive parameters of the model were the baseflow of drainage pipes the depression storage of pervious areas and the hydraulic conductivity ii climate change and urbanization will deeply affect the catchment response to rainfall up to 260 increase in peak flooding and 75 increase in volume flow iii the chosen lid infrastructure has demonstrated its ability to mitigate the effects of urbanization and climate change with a varying performance depending among other factors on rainfall however they cannot completely compensate their effects iv the volume reduction performance of the lid infrastructures does not depend on spatial location but the peak discharge at the outlet is more efficient if the lid structures are located downstream close to the outfall therefore given resources for a limited number of lid the phasing of their implementation matters lids located close to a vulnerable area should be implemented first overall urbanization and climate change put a high level of stress on the stormwater system and lid techniques can help to mitigate that stress their spatial distribution may be a significant criterion to be accounted for when aiming for effective design

3132,climate change and urbanization put stress on urban stormwater systems triggering hydraulic overloading and urban flooding increase low impact development lid techniques have a high potential to mitigate their impacts this study investigates the consequences of climate change and urbanization on the urban runoff in the risvollan catchment in trondheim norway and the effects of lid implementation and the influence of lid spatial distributions on their performance a swmm model of risvollan was implemented along with different scenarios of urbanization and climate change the performance of various spatial distributions of lid infrastructures in the catchment was investigated using the outflow volume and the peak runoff at the outfall as indicators the rainfall event based simulation results confirmed the negative effects of urbanization and climate change on urban runoff these effects were partially mitigated by a homogenous lid implementation the different spatial distributions of lid had little impact on volume reduction but targeting the most downstream zones of the model was more efficient in reducing the peaks at the catchment s outlet these findings confirm that the spatial configuration of lid might be a determinant parameter towards an efficient design of lid infrastructure in urban settings depending on the local stakes and criteria of urban water management keywords low impact development lid implementation scenarios climate change adaptation swmm sensitivity analysis 1 introduction in norway rainfall intensity and amount are expected to increase in the future due to climate change sorteberg et al 2018 on the other hand urbanization alters runoff formation by sealing permeable surfaces thus limiting infiltration and evaporation of water shuster et al 2005 and increasing stormwater runoff the combined effect of climate change and rapid urbanization will increase the volume and intensity of stormwater in the future consequently many stormwater management systems are at risk of increased overflow frequency with the associated urban flooding and sewage overflow skougaard kaspersen et al 2017 which will have significant economic zhou et al 2012 health han he 2021 and environmental semadeni davies et al 2008 consequences in the last few decades low impact development lid infrastructures have been regarded as sustainable stormwater solutions that mitigate climate change and rapid urbanization lid techniques increase permeability and vegetation cover of urban catchments which enhance evapotranspiration and infiltration and reduce the amount of stormwater runoff flowing to the drainage network eckart et al 2017 among the lid infrastructures green roofs and permeable pavements have the potential to reduce stormwater volumes permanently additionally they attenuate and delay the drainage outflows due to water s temporal storage and routing which is beneficial for stormwater management for green roofs volume reduction due to evapotranspiration was found to vary between 11 and 59 of the annual precipitation in cold and wet climatic regions bengtsson et al 2005 johannessen et al 2018 stovin 2010 furthermore green roofs were found to attenuate drainage outflows by 59 90 johannessen et al 2018 palla et al 2011 stovin et al 2012 these are significant figures for stormwater management considering that building roofs account for up to 50 of impervious areas in densely urbanized catchments dunnett kingsbury 2004 on the other hand permeable pavements provide high volume reduction due to infiltration drake et al 2013 significant volume reduction can also be obtained even when permeable pavements are constructed over soils with low permeability dreelin et al 2006 furthermore permeable pavements were found to detain the drainage flow effectively with an average peak reduction of around 80 braswell et al 2018 winston et al 2018 and average peak delay between 15 mins to 4 h fassman blackbourn 2010 støvring et al 2018 numerous studies have investigated the catchment scale implementation of lid infrastructure to identify the density of lid measures needed to achieve desirable hydrological performances for instance palla gnecco 2015 concluded that at least 5 of impervious surfaces should be converted into lid measures to obtain noticeable hydrological benefits at the catchment scale hamouz et al 2020 stated that retrofitting 11 of the building with green roofs would substantially reduce the maximum flow at the catchment outlet hernes et al 2020 presented the effect of different lid densities on the resulting combined sewer overflow at the catchment outlet skaugen et al 2020 concluded that for their study case an urban catchment with 500 houses 60 rain gardens unit area of 10 m2 are needed to reduce the peak flow by 10 recently the spatial configuration of lid measures in urban catchments has been regarded as an impactful parameter for the efficiency of stormwater management at the catchment scale giacomoni joseph 2017 however only a few studies have been found to investigate this topic for instance yao et al 2020 examined different spatial configurations of green roofs and found that retrofitting roofs directly connected to the drainage network achieves higher hydrological benefits likewise liang et al 2020 concluded that a higher peak reduction could be achieved at the catchment outlet by implementing lid measures in areas directly connected to the drainage network hou et al 2020 found that placing lid measures near areas sensitive to flooding and pollution is the most cost effective strategy similarly ercolani et al 2018 recommend placing lid measures near portions of the drainage network that are prone to overflowing giacomoni joseph 2017 found placing lid measures at the downstream portion of the catchment to yield better peak reduction at the outlet while placing lid measures at the upstream reduces the surface flooding at the downstream areas hydrological models are essential tools for studies that aim to evaluate lid implementation scenarios at the catchment scale the epa s storm water management model swmm is perhaps the most common tool for these studies however most of these studies applied swmm catchment models without calibration liang et al 2020 yao et al 2020 indeed this is a limitation as uncalibrated swmm models might yield unsatisfactory modelling performances peng stovin 2017 which could alter the findings of such studies on the other hand many scholars have attempted to calibrate swmm catchment models by altering physical properties such as the percentage of imperviousness hamouz et al 2020 this practice is questionable since lid implementation scenarios would also involve changing the degree of imperviousness and hence abolishing the calibration setup there is a clear need for a proper sensitivity analysis to identify the most influential swmm catchment model parameters for calibration without changing the physical properties such as the degree of imperviousness the motivation for this study was to investigate the influence of the spatial distribution and density of lid measures on runoff mitigation and provide insights to improve the robustness of implementation strategies of lid infrastructures within an urban catchment this work implemented the swmm model for an urban catchment in trondheim norway and several urbanizations and climate change scenarios lid techniques integration at different spatial locations and densities was also implemented this paper addresses the following i identification of the most sensitive parameters of the swmm modelling approach ii modelling of the combined impact of climate change and urbanization on runoff mitigation iii comparison of different spatial configurations for lid implementation 2 methods 2 1 study site and data the study area is an urban catchment risvollan in trondheim city norway a separate stormwater management system drains water over 20 6 ha in the residential area of risvollan in the south east of the city where the elevation varies between 85 and 134 m a s l this study used the gis spatial data subcatchments delineation and stormwater network data from hailegeorgis alfredsen 2018 study the catchment was considered 27 impervious area with 14 roofs 9 roads and 4 sidewalks and 73 pervious area including grasslands vegetated areas and some built up zones most of the land cover delineations were done using aerial photos and local land use maps while the sidewalk areas were obtained by 1 m buffering around the road zones the catchment was subdivided into 55 subcatchments on average of 0 39 ha linked together by a stormwater network comprised of 78 manholes 78 conduits and one outlet fig 1 presents a map of the area including subcatchment delineation land cover delineation and an outline of the stormwater network a measure station next to the outlet provides several decades of 1 min precipitation and temperature data precipitation was measured with an unshielded lambrecht tipping bucket with 0 1 mm per tip stormwater flow data at the outfall of the catchment was also collected with a 1 min resolution missing stormwater flow data was interpolated linearly and time periods with significant missing data were excluded from the study 2 2 model and model setup the study system and area are modelled in the epa s storm water management model swmm an open source model first developed in 1971 and widely used for planning design and analysis of stormwater systems this study used the version 5 1 that incorporates lid modelling for various types of green infrastructure such as green roofs and permeable pavements rossman 2015 the model set up from gis data as well as all future manipulations for calibration sensitivity study and scenarios exploration were done in r programming language using the swmmr package leutnant et al 2019 in this study the swmm catchment model simulates the rainfall runoff process using the green ampt equation for infiltration and kinematic wave formula for runoff routing rossman 2015 all simulations were event based hence evaporation was ignored in this study both permeable pavements and green roofs were implemented in this study using the internal lid module in swmm rossman 2015 this module simulates the hydrological processes of green roofs using green ampt equation for surface infiltration to the soil layer darcy s equation for percolation to the drainage layer and manning formula for drainage layer outflow for permeable pavement the water infiltrates from the surface directly to the soil layer the bedding layer limited by the permeability of the surface layer the percolation from the bedding layer to the base layer is determined following darcy s equations and the drainage flow is determined by an empirical power equation rossman 2015 the green roof type implemented consisted of a 30 mm vegetation mat over a 10 mm textile retention fabric and was designed for sloped roofs all green roofs implemented had the same unit area of 15 m2 and the same unit width of 7 5 m their parameters for the surface soil and drainage layers in the swmm model were obtained from johannessen et al 2019 a permeable pavement with a bottom liner was implemented in the study it comprises of an interlocking pavement of 80 mm thickness with 10 mm joints that allows water to infiltrate into a 30 mm bedding layer the base layer was 100 mm thick and made of coarse materials and the subbase layer was 250 mm thick the pavement was lined with an impermeable geotextile all permeable pavements implemented had the same unit area of 100 m2 and the same unit width of 8 m the parameters for the swmm implementation of the permeable pavements were obtained from abdalla et al 2021 2 3 calibration and validation rainfall runoff events were extracted for calibration and validation from the precipitation and the stormwater runoff data of the recent years 2016 to 2019 to account for recent urbanization and land use change in the catchment the start of events was defined at the first rainfall measurement and the end was defined when the flow returns to the minimum measured value of 0 001 m3 s to eliminate too small events only those with an accumulated precipitation greater than 3 mm were considered this yielded several dozens of events for the four years the physical model parameters such as subcatchment width area slope imperviousness degree as well as manholes and pipes geometric characteristics were extracted from hailegeorgis alfredsen 2018 study in their study they developed a distributed hydrological model for the risvollan catchment with high spatial resolution to account for variability of land use and land cover of the catchment they found a grid size of 5 5 m to be sufficient for accounting for the spatial variability accordingly and through gis analysis they divided the catchment into 55 subcatchments that are connected with a network of pipes and manholes their model achieves satisfactory results indicating that the spatial discretization was adequate therefore we decided to use the spatial discretization from their study another reason to use spatial discretization from hailegeorgis alfredsen 2018 study is the fact that swmm is a semi distributed hydrological model hence spatial discretization with high resolution is needed to analyse and compare different spatial configurations of lid measures at a catchment scale the manning s roughness for the impervious zones was set to 0 013 in impervious zones and 0 15 in pervious zones in accordance with the values provided in the swmm user manual rossman 2015 the subcatchments were divided into two categories depending on their impervious rate a threshold of 30 of imperviousness was selected to separate pervious and impervious subcatchments this denomination criterion was carried on for the relevant model parameters it differentiated between the subcatchments containing mainly open grassland and vegetation and those comprising a more significant part of human constructions and built up areas the calibrated parameters were the parameters of green ampt infiltration equation i e saturated hydraulic conductivity and suction head attributed to each subcatchment category initial moisture deficit for pervious and impervious sub catchments depression storage volumes for both pervious and impervious zones in all subcatchments the seepage loss rate in the pipe network and manning s roughness of pipes as well as the baseflow of the drainage pipes for a total for 11 calibrated parameters the baseflow is related to processes that were not included in the model such as leakage from the drinking water system and connections to the wastewater system the boundaries for the infiltration depression storage and seepage rate were set using the swmm user manual rossman 2015 and the baseflow boundaries were set around the minimal measured outflow the pipe roughness was calibrated outside its recommended range in the swmm manual to account for model delays and network irregularities e g obstructions singular energy losses points or unforeseen leakages the summary of the boundaries for each parameter is visible in table 1 the calibration was performed using the differential evolution algorithm storn price 1997 using the deoptim library in r mullen et al 2011 initially the algorithm creates a population of random solutions by selecting model parameters from given ranges each of the solutions is evaluated based on the value of the objective function then the algorithm creates a new population in a way that each solution is either improved or remains the same this process continues for a number of iterations 100 in this study and the best solution in the last population is selected as the optimal the calibration process used kling gupta efficiency kge as the objective function gupta et al 2009 to evaluate the goodness of fit of the modelled output compared to the measurements of outflow seven events were chosen for calibration by excluding winter events and aiming for variety in rainfall hyetograph shapes table 2 the time step for modelling was selected as 10 min and hence rainfall and runoff data were aggregated accordingly the calibration was performed in three steps as follows 1 one selected event c3 was calibrated 2 the initial soil moisture deficits of each of the seven calibrated events were optimized this was achieved after fixing all other parameters to the values of the optimal parameter set of c3 3 the depression storages are fixed to the optimal value of c3 and the optimal initial saturation of each event are fixed then the remining model parameters were optimized for each event separately this process resulted in a different parameter set for each of the seven calibrated events these parameter sets were considered for ensemble simulation in which each parameter set yields different flow simulation the results of ensemble simulations are combined to provide a measure of uncertainty due to model parameters six validation events were extracted from 2016 to 2019 data in the same fashion as the calibration events and are presented in table 2 the calibrated models of the ensemble were applied to provide flow simulations for those events the model performance was evaluated against the average of the ensemble using kge equation 1 1 k g e 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 r is the correlation between simulations and observation α is the measure of flow variability error and β is the measure of the volumetric error percentage bias 2 4 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis of the parameters was carried out to screen the parameters of the model this approach can also constitute a first analysis of the uncertainty of the simulation results the applied method was derived from the glue methodology beven binley 1992 implemented in a similar fashion to krebs et al 2016 also referred to as monte carlo filtering saltelli et al 2007 this method relies on monte carlo simulations with a filtering method to distinguish behavioural and non behavioural parameter sets the behavioural parameter sets are defined as parameter sets leading to performance higher than a specific threshold value of the objective function the initial distribution of parameter sets is considered as a prior while the filtered distribution stand for a posterior distribution the sensitivity is evaluated by computing the kolmogorov smirnov ks distance between the prior and posterior distribution of each parameter the distance associated to each parameter is then screened to select the most behavioural parameter i e the parameters with the largest statistical distance between prior and posterior the sobol sequence sobol 2001 was chosen to sample 65 000 sets of the 11 parameters the model was run with event c3 table 2 for each of the parameter sets the performance was evaluated with three objectives functions equations 1 2 and 3 the kge threshold used to separate behavioural and non behavioural parameters was 0 58 to evaluate the results of the glue based sensitivity screening the method was confirmed using another sensitivity analysis method the rbd fast method random balance design fourier amplitude sensitivity test tarantola et al 2006 and sobol 1st order and total effect indices sobol 2001 for this purpose the sensitivity analysis was also applied to the kge nse and the pbias with glue and the rbd fast different thresholds were chosen for the glue methodology to ensure that the filtered dataset include 15 5 and 1 of the sampled parameter in addition pearson correlation coefficients were determined between the behavioural parameters to evaluate correlations between model parameters 2 n s e 1 q o b s q s i m 2 q o b s q o b s 2 3 pbias 100 q sim q obs q obs q obs and q sim are the observed and simulated runoff respectively 2 5 urbanization climate and lid scenarios 2 5 1 rainfall runoff analysis and runoff descriptors it has been demonstrated that the performance of green roofs is influenced by the rainfall intensity and shape of the hyetograph eckart et al 2017 yao et al 2020 in this work real recorded rainfall events of different durations were chosen from historical data with a 1 min resolution byscreening for extreme events as well as events whose return periods are around the usual design return periods for stormwater systems the european standard bs en752 2008 recommends a design storm return period of 1 year for rural areas 2 years for residential areas 5 years for city centres without flooding checks and up to 10 years for areas with underground railways butler et al 2018 finally three events of different durations referred as e1 e2 and e3 were extracted from the historical data with return periods ranging from 5 to 20 years the highest event ever recorded in trondheim from august 2007 was included referred to as e4 with a return period of more than 100 years this extreme rainfall event was accompanied by flash floods and extreme flooding triggering damage in the city table 2 presents those events and their estimated return periods as has been done in a previous study shuster et al 2005 the catchment runoff descriptors used were the total outflow volume made of the sum of the outflow volume and the flooding volume and the peak runoff value the peak flooding value was also extracted from the simulations output for each manhole the flooding in swmm is the overflow from manhole when the drainage pipe is surcharged it is calculated when the pipe and manhole reached their full capacity rossman 2015 the results for those indicators are presented both in raw values and in variation rates the respective references for the evolution rates are given in the relevant sections 2 5 2 urbanization the catchment had an initial impervious rate including roofs sidewalks and road of 27 based on this reference scenario nref seven urbanization scenarios were developed with different imperviousness rate ranging from 30 to 90 each scenario was named nx where x was the target impervious rate the scenarios were developed as follow i newly impervious areas were distributed in order to favour lowly impervious areas first and aim for homogenized imperviousness of each subcatchments but keeping the initial bias of scenario nref for each scenarios ii the maximum imperviousness rates was set to 95 for each urbanization scenario the model parameters were updated using the impervious pervious boundary defined during the calibration process scenarios nref n60 and n90 are studied more in detail in the later results 2 5 3 lid implementation the ten most impervious subcatchments in the current state of the risvollan catchment with an average of 51 roofs 37 roads and 12 pavements for the impervious areas were the reference for the breakdown of impervious area in all scenarios the lid infrastructures were implemented by addition of unit components with an area of 15 m2 for green roofs and 100 m2 for permeable pavements until the total area of lid obtained by the product of the target density and the available area was reached in each target subcatchment each lid implementation scenario was defined by the density of lid among the impervious area and the strategy of implementation of lid i e the type of subcatchment where lid were implemented six implementation strategies were developed and are visible in fig 1 i homogeneous as a reference scenario ii left zone and iii right zone to study the impact of intense implementation without favouring a distance to the outlet iv upstream v downstream1 and vi downstream2 to study the influence of the distance to the outlet for the first scenario of homogenous lid spatial configurations they were implemented in each subcatchment with the given density for the following scenarios the lid units were distributed randomly within the corresponding target subcatchments until the target overall lid density was reached or until the target zone was saturated in lid s i e when all available pavements and roofs had been equipped with permeable pavements or green roofs respectively 2 5 4 climate change to account for the expected increase in heavy precipitation intensity climate change factors were used in this study to compare the behaviour of the model for the different rainfall events and the different scenarios given the durations and the return periods of the chosen events 2 factors were used in this study 1 for the historical events without climate change and 1 4 to study those same events accounting for climate change dyrrdal and førland 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 model parametrization 3 1 1 calibration and validation results it is a common practice to calibrate the impervious rate of subcatchments in swmm models the imperviousness degree is part of what liong et al 1991 calls non traditional parameters contrary to the traditional parameters i e infiltration parameters or depression storages non traditional parameters can technically be measured or interpreted from measures but due to model limitations relative errors and complex measurement procedures they are often included in the calibration process and have relatively dominant effects for example sangal bonema 1994 recommends the determination of the impervious rate to be the first step of the calibration using a storm in which the rainfall intensity does not exceed the infiltration capacity of the pervious areas more generally with current automated calibration processes this parameter is often included within the calibration parameter set see for example hernes et al 2020 panos et al 2018 temprano et al 2007 among many others however this method was not applicable here as the future urbanization scenarios would involve manipulations of the impervious rate the calibration resulted in kge values ranging from 0 705 to 0 898 fig 2 for the seven calibrated events kouchi et al 2017 reports that a kge 0 75 defines a good model performance and kge 0 5 defines a satisfactory model performance this indicates a good to satisfactory calibration results the model provides a satisfactory outflow timing and shape in most of the simulated events however the modelled peak values were underestimated for some events the optimized parameter values are presented in table 1 fig 3 presents the performance of the calibrated swmm models on the six validation events by comparing the average of the ensemble with the observation three events yielded simulation with satisfactory kge values kge greater than 0 5 this means that for certain events v1 v2 and v4 the model performance was unsatisfactory when only the mean of the ensemble is considered however the peak values of most of the validations events laid within the bounds of the ensemble except for v1 hence the swmm model with the ensemble simulation is considered valuable for evaluating the effect of lid implementation on high flow values therefore it was decided to apply the ensemble simulations for investigating scenarios of lid implementation 3 1 2 sensitivity analysis results glue has been applied to the risvollan model as an assessment of uncertainty to estimate the relative sensitivity of the parameters and screen the most behavioural ones after the filtering of the 65 000 parameter sets with kge of 0 58 as a threshold value separating behavioural and non behavioural parameters 682 parameter sets were found to be behavioural representing 1 of the generated datasets fig 4 presents the bivariate and the univariate kernel density kde plots of the 5 most sensitive parameters of this swmm model baseflow depstoper ksatper ksatimp seepage the two predominantly sensitive parameters the baseflow and the depression storage in pervious area highlight the characteristic of lowly urbanized catchment there is a lot of uncertainty in the natural area behaviour and inflow going in the network the hydraulic conductivities and to a lesser extent the pipe seepage rate absorb model irregularities and unmodelled hydrological processes in this model e g interaction with groundwater and smoothen the output the use of rbd fast method and sobol 1st order and total effect indices fig 5 led to a similar screening however the glue based sensitivity is sensitive to the threshold used in terms of ranking it should also be noted that the ranking depends on the objective function chosen according to rbd fast and sobol indices the depression storage in pervious area is more sensitive than the baseflow in terms of nse and pbias the ranking differ for nse with the glue based approach those results confirm that the glue methodology can be applied for screening behavioural and non behavioural parameters if used carefully despite the flexibility of the glue method it does not allow to achieve similar ranking as the one achieved with the rbd fast or sobol indices the sizes of the filtered dataset can also influence the results so the threshold should be carefully selected brunetti et al 2016 the review from salvadore et al 2015 that concluded that in many swmm modelling studies the most sensitive parameters are the manning s roughness coefficient of pipes and the impervious rate in the current approach due to the use of baseflow the roughness had a lower influence due to the necessary hypothesis for lid implementation scenario the impervious rate was not considered as a calibrated parameter krebs et al 2013 found that for their model the depression storage in impervious zones was the most sensitive parameter similarly to the current study where it ranks 2nd the correlation between the most sensitive parameters is displayed on fig 4 with a maximum absolute value of 0 35 it appears that there is no strong correlation between any of the parameters indicating an adequate independence of the parameters this is reflected in total effect sobol indices where the ranking remain unchanged from 1st order indices 3 2 scenarios exploration results 3 2 1 effects of urbanization and climate change on current catchment the results of the first simulations aiming at evaluating the influence of urban growth and climate change on the study area are presented in fig 6 without accounting for climate change the increase of urbanization already has a high impact on the flow indicators for e4 the peak flooding increase by 100 and the total volume outflow by 20 between the initial situation nref and the n90 urbanization scenario the peak discharge stay stable since the maximum capacity of the outflow pipe is reached during the simulation hence a stable peak discharge does not mean no effect the total volume and the peak of flooding can still increase e g for event e4 with a climate factor of 1 4 with up to 62 increase of total volume outflow and 260 increase of peak flooding while the linear increase of precipitation resulted in a linear increase in the total outflow volume it appears that the increase of peak runoff is non linear e2 e3 and e4 display an identical maximum peak value around 0 038 mm for several urbanization scenarios this peak value most likely corresponds to the maximum outlet capacity of the network likewise ercolani et al 2018 observed a non linear peak reduction with respect to a catchment scale green roof implementation the authors attributed this non linearity to drainage network being close to its maximum capacity the peak flooding values continue to increase linearly for e1 e2 and e3 fig 7 shows the spatial impact of an intense urbanization scenario 90 on the spatial flooding values at risvollan intense precipitation events especially e4 and e2 triggered flooding from different manholes at risvollan under this intense urbanization scenario it can be seen from fig 7 that some manholes experienced higher flooding values especially at the downstream parts of risvollan additionally the results showed that flooding from sewer manholes is triggered by rainfall intensity and not by the rainfall amount for instance e2 return period 2 y caused more flooding than e1 even though e1 has more amount and higher return period return period 5 y as summarized in table 2 3 2 2 effects of homogenous lid this section presents and discusses the results of homogenous lid implementation on all subcatchments the variations of indicators induced by 100 implementation of homogeneous lid for the different urbanization scenarios are presented in fig 8 under the current climate for events e1 e2 and e3 the peak discharge tends to decrease its variation ranging from 0 to 22 it means that the more the city gets urbanized the more effective the lid gets however for e2 and e4 the maximum outlet flow i e the capacity of the drainage network is attained as shown in fig 8 obscuring the performance of the lid implementation however the evolution of peak flooding reflects the lid mitigation action as it is very consistently reduced by large rates between around 50 for n90 and event e2 and e3 event e4 the most extreme event out of the 4 with a return period of 100 years yielded more erratic results than other events when it comes to peak reduction this might be due the fact that the maximum pipe capacity is reached in addition the nature of this event short and intense triggers the complexity of the system and lead to more unforeseen peaks the behaviour of the system was not investigated further regarding this matter however the peak flooding tends to decrease with presence of lid the results in fig 9 show the variation of peak discharge and flooding with the scenario nref no lid as a reference the scenario homogeneous 100 and no lid are displayed it shows for no lid the increase of the indicators except peak discharge when the pipe capacity is reached the range corresponding to homogeneous scenario showed that it is possible to compensate urbanization in most of the events e1 e2 and e3 however when climate change is considered it is not possible to come back to performance without climate factor and without urbanization it is nonetheless possible to contain the effect of climate change with high urbanization the total outflow variation fig 8 c appears to be almost linearly decreasing with lid density for all rainfall scenarios with some outlier values appearing for e4 at n90 the reduction rate ranges between 12 and 46 when comparing these values to the pre urbanization volumes fig 9 it appears that it is not possible to compensate completely the imperviousness increase for all events and all model in the ensemble however the volume increase can be limited and often it can even decrease e g for e3 the volume vary between 5 and 45 without lid and 10 to 20 with lid which evidently reduces the stress on the stormwater system the range of the ensemble encompass model uncertainty and initial conditions variation this approach shows the value of ensemble modelling with multiple events to cope with climate and condition variability when considering climate change the effect on the total volume outflow of the system is the most prevalent which is expected since the volume of the rainfall increases on fig 8 the values of total volume and flooding are shifted according to the climate factor the peak discharge variation is only positive for e1 since the maximum capacity of the system was not reached the lid implementation occupying 100 of available surfaces cannot compensate both effect of urbanization and climate change fig 9 however it can compensate the effect of urbanization since the variation of total volume outflow stay stable with increasing urbanization when compared to nref without lid or climate factor overall homogenous lid implementation over the catchment was found to be an effective strategy to cope with increased urban runoff with increased urbanization and climate effects for peak runoff peak flooding and total outflow volume the lid implementation could partly compensate either urbanization or climate change but can not fully compensate for the combination of the two 3 2 3 influence of the spatial configurations of lid measures the variation of performance between the homogenous distribution and the five scenarios of spatial distribution of lid were evaluated fig 10 and fig 11 presents the effects of lid implementation scenarios on peak discharge and total volume outflow variation respectively for three urbanization scenarios nref n60 and n90 in terms of total outflow volume and peak flooding the left branch and right branch scenarios yielded similar results to those of the homogenous distribution they were not found to be effective to reduce peak runoff this indicates that there is no topographical or network difference that triggers a major behaviour difference in lid performance in those two zones the results for peak discharge variation indicate that the downstream scenarios can reach the same peak reduction levels as the homogenous lid with a smaller lid density around 40 for the first downstream scenario and 20 for the second in contrast upstream implementation has little effect on the peak discharge downstream however when it comes to outflow volume the different lid distributions perform the same as the homogenous distribution the spatial location of lid was found to influence the flooding from manholes to demonstrate this finding the six implementation scenarios were compared at a similar catchment scale lid density which correspond to 100 of lid in the target area of downstream2 the limiting scenario corresponding to 23 of the full catchment for homogeneous scenario the other lid densities within their respective target area were 48 left 51 right 47 upstream and 45 downstream1 these scenarios were investigated on event e4 and urbanization n90 and by using one parameter set from the ensemble these results are presented in fig 12 the homogenous configuration was found to be the least effective in reducing flooding peaks from manholes distributing lid at the upstream of the catchment resulted in flooding peak reductions in both the upstream and downstream manholes even with the short concentration time of the risvollan catchment of around 10 15 min skaugen et al 2020 the runoff from the upstream subcatchments has a lesser contribution to the peak flow due to the travelling processes both overland and in the pipe network nevertheless these results along with the s shape of the curves in fig 10 suggests that subcatchments close to a measurement point have higher influence on peaks this implies the existence of critical subcatchments located downstream and close to the outlet of interest that control most of the peak outflow and that must be targeted to control it therefore given a vulnerable outlet if peak runoff is considered the most relevant indicator for the stress level put on the stormwater network it seems possible to achieve the same performance as homogenous lid in a much more cost time and resources efficient way by targeting the critical subcatchments situated downstream near the vulnerable outlet however the performance in terms of total volume reduction is the same for all lid spatial distributions to compare these results with the findings of some studies around the same issues giacomoni joseph 2017 found placing lid at the downstream of the catchment to yield better peak reduction at the outlet which is similar to the finding of this study hou et al 2020 who developed an adaptive differential evolution algorithm to optimize the spatial priority scheme of various lid techniques in yichuan china recommended to place lid solutions near areas that are sensitive to flooding and pollution for achieving the most cost effective stormwater management plan liang et al 2020 found that peak flow reduction was most sensitive to the reduction of directly connected impervious areas dcia indeed for a similar lid implementation the results were better with less dcia zellner et al 2016 found that with an increase in precipitation and in areas suitable for green infrastructures implementation patterns that followed the flow paths and the accumulation of water also became more effective which resonate with the results of this study ercolani et al 2018 concluded that the urban system in the metropolitan city of milan italy responded non linearly to green roof density in terms of peak runoff reduction at the outfall they related this non linearity to the stormwater system being close to its conveyance capability they studied a targeted green roof implementation that concentrated them on areas where conduits were prone to filling this scenario showed a better performance than a homogenous implementation in terms of peak flow reduction at the outlet this is coherent with the results of this study as downstream pipes are more vulnerable to filling as ending points of the entire network with respect to flooding zellner et al 2016 found that spatially dispersed green infrastructure was more efficient to reduce flooding than clustered arrangements which is different from the results observed in this study it could be explained by the higher slopes in the current study especially clustered approaches were found to have more effective local effects 3 3 implications this study examined the impacts of urbanization and climate change on the urban runoff response for the risvollan catchment as well as different lid implementation scenarios and their mitigating capacities our results highlight that climate change and urbanization put the current stormwater system under stress and that lid infrastructures can participate in the mitigation of their effects these results may constitute useful insight for municipalities firstly in this study it appears that depending on the target indicator to be reduced the spatial distribution of lids can be an important factor for an effective design indeed if the priority is to reduce the volume at the outfall of the catchment the distribution of lid has little influence whereas if the priority is the reduction of the outfall peak it will be more resources and cost efficient to target the critical downstream subcatchments this highlights an important aspect of green infrastructure implementation the phasing of green infrastructure implementation if the total outflow volume is not influenced by the strategy the peak runoff in one location or local flooding is influenced by the implementation in its neighbourhood therefore when it comes to prioritize implementation with limited resources those results suggest that critical area should be directly prioritized more precisely the highly influential areas of the area of interest should be identified and prioritized the use of model ensemble despite showing similar trends in most of the case shows the deep level of uncertainty associated with limited data and knowledge linked to a specific catchment secondly the comparison of the lid performance for different rain events suggests that peak attenuation should be combined to return period to evaluate the bandwidth of lid performance indeed the implemented lid infrastructure in this study was able to mitigate a 12 h event with a 20 years return period and a relatively low peak better than it could mitigate our 2 other events with a 5 year return period moreover the inclusion of a 100 year precipitation event in the rainfall scenarios provided erratic and inconclusive results indicating the inadequacy of the method used for this case this effect is interwined with the fact that our model was not calibrated for extreme events and thus probably does not perform well in those cases this highlights the need for further research to explore the behaviour of lid infrastructure under extreme events 3 4 limitations firstly the rainfall input was event based which limits the ability to explore the behaviour of lid infrastructure under other types of rainfall than the four used here for reference qin et al 2013 described the performance difference of various lid infrastructures for different hydrograph shapes moreover many studies have suggested more robust approaches to investigate lid performance based on continuous rainfalls i e long term simulations stovin et al 2017 secondly the calibration method used might have triggered unforeseen effects of the adopted high pipe roughness further research might be needed to understand better the limitations of this method finally this study used an aggregation of identical unit lid structures whereas a more realistic study might need to precisely retrofit existing roofs and pavements 4 conclusion this study implemented a swmm model of the risvollan catchment in trondheim norway and investigated the impacts of various urbanization and climate change scenarios for 4 different rainfall events different lid densities were implemented with varying spatial distributions and their performances in mitigating the effects of climate change and urbanization were explored the main results were as follows i the most sensitive parameters of the model were the baseflow of drainage pipes the depression storage of pervious areas and the hydraulic conductivity ii climate change and urbanization will deeply affect the catchment response to rainfall up to 260 increase in peak flooding and 75 increase in volume flow iii the chosen lid infrastructure has demonstrated its ability to mitigate the effects of urbanization and climate change with a varying performance depending among other factors on rainfall however they cannot completely compensate their effects iv the volume reduction performance of the lid infrastructures does not depend on spatial location but the peak discharge at the outlet is more efficient if the lid structures are located downstream close to the outfall therefore given resources for a limited number of lid the phasing of their implementation matters lids located close to a vulnerable area should be implemented first overall urbanization and climate change put a high level of stress on the stormwater system and lid techniques can help to mitigate that stress their spatial distribution may be a significant criterion to be accounted for when aiming for effective design

3133,hydraulic fracturing is an important means to develop unconventional resources fracture diagnosis techniques have been emerged in recent years which can evaluate hydraulic stimulated fractures after stimulation treatment fracture geometry evaluation is an important part of hydraulic fracturing diagnosis the fracture geometry evaluation techniques based on water hammer signal has the advantages of high economic efficiency easy implementation and high timeliness previously a model that couples the wellbore and the fracture rci model had been proposed which could calculate the fracture geometry however this model was mainly based on the assumption of a single fracture with a pair of double wings and there was no research on the calculation of the geometry of multi fractures in this paper a new model for calculating the geometry of multi fractures was proposed first a new factor the stress interference between the various fractures was considered in the model second based on the conservation of the total volume of fractures the rationality of the volume equivalent relationship of multiple fractures was proved third a new method was proposed to allow the new factor to

b however these resources are reserved in formation with low permeability and poor connectivity scanlon et al 2014 song et al 2017 to enhance recovery rate it is an effective method to stimulate the reservoir through hydraulic fracturing treatment daneshy 2010 guo et al 2014 rahm 2011 zhang 2014 the geometry of the fracture after fracturing affects the final production of the unconventional reservoir therefore to obtain a higher recovery rate after hydraulic fracturing the evaluation of the fracture geometry of hydraulic fracturing is very important in hydraulic fracturing diagnosis cipolla and wright 2002 however hydraulic fracturing fractures are formed underground it is impossible to directly obtain the geometry of hydraulic fracturing fractures through observation therefore an economical and efficient method for evaluating fracture geometry is necessary the fracture geometry diagnosis techniques based on water hammer pressure signal is a potential method which has the advantages of high economic efficiency easy implementation and high timeliness parkhonyuk et al 2018 many literatures have proved the feasibility of diagnosing the fracture geometry through pressure waves holzhausen 1985 estimated the fracture impedance by artificially exciting the pressure wave at the wellhead and fitting it with the pressure wave reflection received at the wellhead through trial and error calculating the geometry of the fracture holzhausen and egan 1986 paige 1992 1995 yew and ashour 1994 and other scholars carried out some field scale tests for this method which verified the adaptability of holzhausen s model patzek and de 2000 proposed a lossy transmission line model to describe the wellbore and fracture geometry which could consider energy loss mondal 2010 established a semi analytical model for the continuity and momentum equations of a wellbore containing micro compressible single phase fluids using the method of characteristic moc and mondal defines a fracture model rci model which used some parameters r c and i to represent a single double wing fracture method of characteristic moc and the fracture model rci were combined to simulate and match the water hammer pressure signal through the above mentioned mondal model the length height and width of the fracture under the assumption of a single double wing fracture could be estimated carey 2015 proposed the relationship between multiple fractures and mondal s equivalent single fracture carey 2016 compared the fracture geometry diagnosis method based on water hammer pressure signal with the micro seismic diagnostics he found that there was a strong correlation between the fracture length calculated by the rci model and the fracture length measured by the micro seismic data hwang 2017 studied the effect of each parameter in the rci model on the waveform of the water hammer pressure signal and calculated the geometry of the fractures through the rci model and solved multiple fractures according to the same geometry haustveit 2017 compared the results of electromagnetic imaging micro seismic pressure interference testing fracture simulation and water hammer pressure diagnosis haustveit pointed out that the fracture length estimated by the water hammer rci model was longer than the fracture length estimated by other methods and was comparable to the fracture length derived from the micro seismic in this method the water hammer pressure diagnostic simulation assumed that there was only one effective fracture at each stimulation stage thus the actual fracture length in the fracture network was expected to be shorter than the simulated water hammer pressure signal fracture length ma et al 2019 proposed a new expression of water hammer pressure boundary conditions based on the rci model including pressure leakage perforation friction and internal fracture friction for this boundary condition the circuit simulation system was abandoned and the friction equations in the fractures were used instead dung et al 2021 discussed factors affecting fracturing related water hammer behavior and presented a field study that correlates water hammer characteristics with fracture intensity and wellbore productivity based on the basic theory of fluid mechanics a simulator was developed to treatment water hammer characteristics however the main limitation of the diagnosis of fracture geometry by water hammer pressure signal is that the model only considered a single fracture in the water hammer pressure diagnostics when multiple fractures existed the geometry of each fracture cannot be effectively expressed in addition it is simply defined that each fracture propagation uniformly with the same geometry this assumption does not correspond to reality in fact multiple fractures have stress interference the fracture geometry is not the same therefore how to correctly characterize the geometry of multiple fractures in the field of fracturing is a challenging task in this study a new water hammer diagnostics model is proposed to calculate the geometry of the multiple fractures first a new factor is considered in the model which is the stress interference between the multiple fractures according to the effect of stress interference the maximum fracture width constraining each fracture is calculated second based on the conservation of the total volume of fractures the rationality of the volume equivalent relationship of multiple fractures is proved third a new method is proposed to allow influencing factors to be added to the model reasonably base on volume conservation through this method the characteristic parameters of each fracture r c and i can be defined more reasonably the geometrical parameters of each fracture can be calculated additionally the model is validated based on four cases after that the relationship between fracture half length and fracture width the effect of the number of fractures and fracture spacing on the fracture geometry and the effect of fracture volume changes on the water hammer pressure signal are analyzed furthermore based on the field micro seismic data a comparative analysis of the fracture geometry calculated by our model and the micro seismic interpretation geometry is conducted this study provides a new multi fracture geometry diagnosis model based on the water hammer pressure signal 2 model establishment in order to allow readers to have a simpler and clearer understanding of the hydraulic fracturing process and the modeling process of the model this paper briefly describes the hydraulic fracturing process through the fig 1 after the wellbore construction are completed the perforating gun needs to be placed at the bottom of the wellbore and shoots through the wellbore wellbore is connected to the formation this step is called perforating and the distance between perforation cluster is called fracture spacing then high pressure fluid is pumped from the wellhead and the rock at the perforation is broken by high pressure to form fractures as the pump stop at the end of hydraulic fracturing water hammer will generate in the wellbore fracture system then the numerical simulation method and boundary conditions are selected for solving the water hammer pressure signal among all numerical solutions the method of characteristic moc proves to be the most popular method ghidaoui et al 2005 the method of characteristic is often used to solve the initial value problem of the first order hyperbolic partial differential equation this method can transform the partial differential equation into an ordinary differential equation by integrating along the characteristic line since the equation of water hammer is a first order partial differential equation many researchers use this method to conduct research on transient flow problems first the values of equivalent single fracture parameters r c and i should be obtained the characteristic method is used to control the flow change in the closed pipeline through the motion equation and the continuity equation the equivalent single fracture characteristic parameters r c and i are adjusted to match the water hammer pressure signal second according to the stress interference between fractures each fracture geometry can be calculated the stress interference between fractures are calculated by fracture spacing and the number of fractures the effect of stress interference is introduced into the previously calculated equivalent single fracture characteristic parameters r c and i then the geometry of each fracture can be calculated the flowchart is shown in fig 2 2 1 mathematical model establishment wellbore flow model this paper uses the method of characteristic to describe the flow in the wellbore this model is mainly controlled by the equation of motion and the continuity equation chaudhury proposed the general expression of the equation of motion as chaudhry 2014 1 v t v v x 1 ρ p x g sin θ fv v 2 d 0 wherein v is the flow velocity m s in the pipe t is the time s x is the coordinate axis along the axis of the pipe m ρ is the fluid density kg m 3 p is the pressure pa and d is the pipe diameter m f is the friction coefficient g is the acceleration of gravity m s 2 and θ is the inclination of the pipe to the horizontal ground for the low mach number unsteady flow the term v v x can be ignored so the motion equation 1 can be simplified to 2 v t 1 ρ p x g sin θ fv v 2 d 0 in addition chaudhury proposed the general expression form of the continuity equation as chaudhry 2014 3 1 ρ d ρ dt 1 a da dt v x 0 wherein a is the cross sectional area of the wellbore m 2 v is the flow velocity m s assuming that the elastic pipe is filled with a slightly compressible fluid eq 3 could be simplified as 4 p t v p x ρ a 2 v x 0 wherein a is the wave speed m s v is the flow velocity m s a can be calculated by eq 5 chaudhry 2014 5 a k ρ 1 dk ee wherein k is the bulk modulus pa e is the young s modulus of elasticity of the pipe pa e is the pipe wall thickness m similarly the term v p x is small compared to the other terms so the continuity eq 4 can be simplified as 6 p t ρ a 2 v x 0 wherein v is the flow velocity m s in the analysis of pipeline flow velocity v and pressure p are usually represented by flow rate q m 3 s and pressure head h m 7 q v a 8 h p ρ g z wherein z is the elevation of the reference datum v is the flow velocity m s in the above eq 2 and 6 can be represented by h and q as shown in eq 9 and eq 10 9 q t g a h x fq q 2 d a 0 10 h t a 2 ga q x 0 according to the above equation of motion eq 9 and the continuity equation eq 10 the simulated water hammer pressure can be calculated in addition the boundary conditions can be calculated by the rci multi fractures model rci multi fractures model the multi fracture model proposes in this paper includes three parts in the first part through the equivalent single fracture model rci and the wellbore flow model moc the fracture parameters r c and i are used to match the water hammer pressure signal to find a total value of r c and i in the second part in the fracture geometry diagnosis technology based on water hammer pressure signal the effect of stress interference among multiple fractures are considered for the first time the maximum fracture width of each fracture is calculated based on the stress interference between multiple fractures in the third part based on the conservation of fracture volume a method to considering the effect of stress interference into the fracture model rci is proposed for the first time that is the ratio of each maximum fracture width is brought into the equivalent relationship of each fracture then the values can be calculated for each fracture geometry this chapter will describe each part in detail in the first part the single fracture model is an rci model proposed by mondal this model equates the well bottom fracture into a circuit form and uses the resistance r the capacitance c and the inductance i to characterize the well bottom fracture shape and the net pressure of the fracture δ p 0 wherein δ p 0 p f s h min p f is the average fluid pressure in the fracture s h min is the minimum formation stress and δ p 0 represents the stress difference between the fluid pressure in the fracture and the stress of the formation fig 3 a shows a hydraulic fracture of a horizontal well and fig 3 b shows the equivalent circuit representation in particular the fracture should have double wings in this paper but in order to save space of the paper only one wing of the fracture is shown in figs 3 and 4 and the other wing is similar to it the detailed fracture geometry will be described in fig 5 any fracture can be represented by r c and i and these parameters are defined as follows resistance r is the constant of proportionality between the flow rate q to maintain the fracture and the required potential energy difference which can be expressed as eq 11 schönfeld 1954 11 δ p r q wherein δ p is pressure drop pa the capacitance c is defined as the ratio of the fracture volume change every time the liquid pressure changes which can be expressed as eq 12 holzhausen and gooch 1985a b 12 c δ v δ p wherein δ v is the change of fracture volume m 3 the inductance i is related to the quality of the fluid in the system and is potential difference required to accelerate or decelerate the discharge q in the absence of friction the inductance i is equivalent to the inductance in the circuit which can be expressed as eq 13 schönfeld 1954 13 δ p i dq dt the potential difference at the well bottom boundary condition defines as the sum of the individual r c and i potential differences which can be shown as below in eq 14 carey et al 2015 14 ρ g δ h r q 1 c qdt i dq dt wherein δ h can be considered as a head corresponding to the near wellbore friction pressure drop δ p nwf and the average net pressure of the fracture δ p 0 for rci model mondal first made the following assumptions to simplify the calculation of fracture geometry mondal 2010 1 during the water hammer duration only the fracture width changes with the pressure pulse after the water hammer stops the fracture geometry is unchanged 2 fractures generated by hydraulic fracturing can be considered as an equivalent single plane fracture 3 during the water hammer duration the model ignores the fluid loss of the fracture which means the fluid will not flow into the formation but will surge in the fracture 4 during the water hammer duration the model ignores the friction along the fracture length but considers the near wellbore friction because the fracture length friction pressure drop is much smaller than the near wellbore friction pressure drop the near wellbore friction pressure drop can be expressed as δ p nwf 5 the surface pressure is used to calculate the average near well pressure and the near wellbore frictional resistance is used to express the fracture frictional resistance the friction resistance of the near wellbore can be represented by the resistance r and the connectivity of the well and fracture can be quantified by the value of r r is mainly affected by the perforation and wellbore fracture connectivity considering the fracture geometry into eqs 11 14 the relationship between the fracture geometry and the well bottom pressure boundary can be obtained in eqs 15 22 the near wellbore friction pressure drop δ p nwf as shown in eq 15 the smaller the value of r the lower the near wellbore friction pressure drop carey et al 2015 15 r δ p nwf q 0 wherein δ p nwf is the near wellbore friction pressure drop pa δ p nwf meant the press drop of the fluid from the perforation to the fracture the values of r c and i can be obtained based on the matching of the water hammer pressure signal according to the appropriate r c and i values the length width height and net pressure of the fracture can be calculated the average net pressure δ p 0 can be obtained by eq 16 carey et al 2015 16 δ p 0 p bh δ p nwf s h min wherein p bh is the well bottom pressure pa and s h min is the minimum formation stress pa δ p nwf can be solved by r and q 0 in eq 15 the relationship between the pressure parameters is shown in the fig 4 according to eq 16 when the average net pressure δ p 0 of the fracture and the near wellbore friction pressure drop δ p nwf is calculated the well bottom pressure p bh can be calculated by combining the parameters of the minimum formation stress s h min the calculated well bottom pressure is used as the boundary condition of the fracture in the wellbore flow to simulate the water hammer pressure signal when the pump is stopped according to different forms fractures can be divided into two types shylapobersky defined short fractures as when 2 l f h f 1 and long fractures when 2 l f h f 1 shlyapobersky et al 1998 the fracture geometry for short fractures and long fractures is shown in fig 5 the fracture half length is perpendicular to the wellbore and is the main propagation direction the fracture height is parallel to the wellbore direction the fracture width is perpendicular to the fracture length and fracture height the fracture length and fracture height are in meters and the fracture width is in millimeters the fracture width is drawn larger than the actual scale in order to be clearly marked in fig 5 the average net pressure of fractures can be calculated by eq 17 carey et al 2015 17 δ p o 4 π 2 e 1 v 2 e m w max 1 l f 2 h f wherein v is poisson s ratio w is the average fracture width mm e is young s modulus pa l f is the half length of the fracture m h f is the height of the fracture m e m can be calculated by eq 18 carey et al 2015 18 e m 0 π 2 1 m 2 sin 2 θ d θ 0 1 1 m 2 t 2 1 t 2 d t eq 18 can be approximated as carey et al 2015 19 e 1 x 1 a 1 x a 2 x 2 b 1 x b 2 x 2 log 1 x wherein a 1 0 4630151 a 2 0 2452727 b 1 0 1077812 b 2 0 0412496 m is defined as carey et al 2015 m 1 min l f h f 2 max l f h f 2 2 at the same time the fracture geometry can be estimated according to eqs 20 22 carey et al 2015 20 l f ci δ p 0 ρ 21 h f 4 e e m c π 2 l f 2 short fracture 4 e e m c π 2 l f long fracture 22 w ρ l f i h f wherein e e 1 v 2 v is poisson s ratio according to the above formula and the r c and i values the fracture geometry can be calculated through the above calculation method eqs 15 22 the near wellbore friction pressure drop δ p nwf the average net pressure δ p 0 and the well bottom pressure p bh can be calculated to simulate water hammer and the signal fracture half length width and height can be calculated then the fracture length fracture width fracture height and net pressure of the equivalent single fracture can be calculated the model proposed by mondal is based on the plane double wing single fractures assumptions since the current hydraulic fracturing process is based on multiple fractures fracturing mode in each fracturing stage the multiple fractures fracturing method can improve the fracturing efficiency and increase the recovery ratio in multiple fractures case mondal model can only calculate the equivalent single fracture geometry so the geometry of multiple fractures cannot be accurately calculated therefore carey believed that the equivalent fracture length and width calculated by the mondal model could be considered as the combination of all fractures connected to the wellbore carey et al 2015 consider a fracturing stage that consists of n perforation clusters that create n transverse fractures the multi fracture equivalent circuit relationship is shown in fig 6 through the rci circuit the capacitance of each fracture is connected in parallel so the capacitance of n fractures can be expressed as 23 c t i 1 n c i wherein c t is the total capacitance r t is the total resistance and i t is the total inductance at the equivalent single fracture therefore the half length of each fracture can be expressed as 24 l f e c t i t δ p 0 ρ i 1 n c i i t δ p 0 i ρ i t ρ i 1 n c i δ p 0 i wherein l f e is the half length of the equivalent total fracture from eq 24 the equivalent single fracture half length can be written as the sum of each fracture and the fracture half length conversion formula can be expressed as 25 l f e i 1 n l i 2 similarly the average fracture width of each fracture can also be expressed as 26 w e ρ h fe i t i 1 n c i δ p 0 i wherein w e is the fracture width of the equivalent total fracture h fe is the fracture height of the equivalent single fracture which can be calculated by the equivalent single fracture parameters r t c t and i t from eq 26 the equivalent single fracture width could be written as the sum of each fracture the fracture width conversion formula could be expressed as 27 w e i 1 n w i 2 according to the assumption that the initiating fractures are all equal height fractures the height of each fracture can be defined as 28 h fe h fi i 1 2 n hwang calculated the length of multiple fractures according to the above mentioned multi fracture and total fracture equivalent method hwang et al 2017 in hwang s calculation all fractures are considered to be fractures of the same geometry but this is different from the actual propagation state of the fractures in the formation this is because of the leak of restrictive conditions for the fracture morphology therefore in the second part this paper uses the stress interference between the fractures to restrict the propagation of the fractures for the first time based on the stress field distribution formula around multiple fractures proposed by gao and yao the calculation method of stress interference between any two fractures the formula can be expressed as gao 2013 29 δ σ ζ ij p bh s h min 1 1 h f 2 d ij 2 3 2 wherein δ σ ζ ij is the stress interference pa between the i th fracture and the j th fracture d ij is the fracture spacing m between the i th fracture and the j th fracture when the mutual stress interference between all fractures is calculated the net pressure of each fracture can be obtained according to the stress interference between the fractures the formula can be expressed as gao 2013 30 p net i p bh s h min j 1 j i n δ σ ζ ij wherein p net i is the average net pressure of i th fracture pa in particular if the net pressure of a certain fracture is calculated as a negative number during the calculation process this paper considered that the fracture cannot be expanded normally the fracture should be removed and the net pressure of the remaining fractures should be recalculated when the net pressure of all the fractures is obtained according to the fracture width expression derived by sneddon and elliot the fracture width under the stress interference model of each fracture is calculated and the formula can be expressed as sneddon and elliot 1946 31 w i 2 h f 1 v 2 p net i e wherein v is poisson s ratio through the above eqs 29 31 the width of each fracture is calculated by stress interference in the third part a new method of coupling stress interference and fracture parameters is proposed to ensure the volume conservation of fractures the width of each fracture is proportionally combined into eq 27 according to the known equivalent single fracture width and the proportion of each fracture width calculated by eq 31 the w i value of the fracture width of multiple fractures can be calculated then according to eq 22 the formula for calculating the length of multiple fractures can be obtained 32 l fi i t h fi ρ w i wherein i t and h fi can be known according to the equivalent single fracture eq 17 can be changed to the net pressure of each multi fracture 33 δ p oi 4 π 2 e 1 v 2 e m w i 1 l fi 2 h fi wherein v is poisson s ratio the calculated each fracture half length l fi and each fracture width w i of multiple fractures are used in eq 33 to calculate the net pressure of each fracture δ p oi finally eq 20 can be changed to the multiple fractures half length 34 l fi c i i t δ p oi ρ eq 34 can be changed into 35 c i l fi 2 ρ i t δ p oi bring the fracture half length of each fracture and the net pressure of each fracture into eq 35 to get the capacitance of each fracture c i of each fracture with multiple fractures as well as the half length l fi fracture width w i and fracture height h fi of each fracture can all be calculated 2 2 solution method method of characteristic according to the 2 1 wellbore flow model two dependent variables are used to represent motion and continuity equations the two independent variables of flow rate and pressure head time and distance along the pipeline are transformed into four ordinary differential equations wylie and streeter rewrote the motion and continuity equations to transform the method of characteristic wylie and streeter 1993 36 l 1 q t g a h x fq q 2 d a 0 37 l 2 h t a 2 ga q x 0 the linear combination of the above equation into the unknown quantity λ obtains the eq 38 38 l l 1 λ l 2 q t g a h x fq q 2 d a λ h t a 2 ga q x the two values λ 1 a are put into eq 38 then two equations can be obtained which are defined as c and c respectively after obtaining the c and c equations the flow rate q and the pressure head h at t t can be obtained by combining the flow rate q and the pressure head h at time t through the differential equation differential equations are solved by the finite difference method after simplification the finite difference form of c and c equations as eq 39 and eq 40 39 c h p h a b q p q a r

is the roughness of the well and re is the reynolds number in the initial state at the beginning of the solution time t 0 the flow state in the wellbore is known at this time that was all the flow rate q and pressure head h at this time are known according to the flow rate q and pressure head h at the time of the known state the flow rate q and pressure head h at the point i 1 and i 1 can be used to calculate the flow rate q and pressure head h at the point i at the next unknown state time boundary condition at the head of the well after the hydraulic fracturing treatment is completed the flow rate at the inlet of the wellbore will continue to decrease assuming that the displacement of the pump decreases linearly during the process of stopping the pump until the flow rate at the wellhead drops to zero the boundary conditions of the well head can be defined by the change of flow rate at the bottom of the well first according to the value of r c and i eq 15 is used to calculate the near wellbore friction pressure drop δ p nwf and eqs 17 20 22 is used to calculate the average net pressure of the fracture δ p 0 and the geometry of the equivalent single fracture second eq 16 is used to calculate the well bottom pressure p bh and the well bottom pressure p bh is used as the well bottom boundary condition in the method of characteristic to simulate the water hammer pressure signal through the definition of the boundary conditions of the wellhead and the well bottom it is possible to simulate the water hammer pressure by the method of characteristic when the pump is stopped then according to the matching water hammer pressure signal the r c and i value can be obtained the obtained r c and i value will be used to calculate the fracture geometry computational multi fracture geometry first according to the method of characteristic the r c and i value are adjusted to match the water hammer pressure signal when the water hammer pressure signal is matched the r c and i values of the equivalent single fracture can be obtained second through the values of r t c t and i t of the equivalent single fracture l f e w e h fe and δ p 0 can be solved by eq 17 20 22 the obtained geometry is the equivalent single fracture geometry third the bottom well pressure p bh is calculated by eq 16 wherein δ p nwf can be calculated according to eq 15 and s h min is formation stress p bh would be brought into the method of characteristic as the bottom well boundary condition to simulate water hammer pressure signal fourth according to the p bh h fe the values of the number of perforation clusters n and the fracture spacing d ij in the fracturing design the stress interference between each fracture δ σ ζ ij can be calculated by eq 29 fifth according to eq 30 through the stress interference between each fracture δ σ ζ ij the net pressure in each fracture δ p 0 i is calculated sixth according to eq 31 the fracture width by griffith fracture is obtained according to the net pressure in each fracture δ p 0 i at last according to the fracture width by griffith fracture each fracture width w i is proportionally brought into eq 27 to obtain the fracture width by the rci model w i according to eq 32 the half length of each fracture can be calculated according to the above steps the geometry of each fracture can be solved 2 3 model validation to verify our model this

case analysis 3 results and discussion the basic parameters used in section 3 are shown in table 4 according to the model proposed in this paper the effect of fracture length and width fracture number fracture volume and fracture spacing are analyzed 3 1 the relationship between fracture half length and fracture width the basic parameters for analysis can be found in table 4 case 5 the dimensions of the fracture half length and fracture width are shown in fig 9 the half lengths of the fractures are 158 m 106 m and 158 m and the fracture widths are 30 mm 20 mm and 30 mm the longest fracture half length is 148 of the shortest fracture half length and the longest fracture width is 148 of the shortest fracture width therefore the half length and width of each fracture had a certain proportional relationship for the half length of the fracture and the fracture width is calculated by eq 20 and eq 22 under the same situation the inductance i density ρ and fracture height of the fracture h f are all known values thus the obtained fracture half length is proportional to the fracture width therefore only the change rule of the fracture half length will be discussed in chapter 3 the change rule of the fracture width is similar in figs 9 14 fl is used to represent the fracture half length fw is used to represent the fracture width and fh is used to represent the fracture height 3 2 effect of the number of fractures the basic parameters for analysis can be found in table 4 case 6 the half length of each fracture is shown in fig 10 from fig 10 a the half length of the fracture on both sides is longer than the half length of the middle fracture this is due to the different degrees of stress interference on both sides and the middle fractures from eq 29 the stress interference of the fractures on both sides is less than the stress interference of the middle fracture the fractures on both sides are easier to expand than the middle fracture with the increase of the number of fractures the longest fracture will decrease from 247 m to 149 m and the average fracture length will decrease from 247 m to 92 m while the total length of all fractures will increase from 247 m to 553 m from fig 10 b the number of fractures gradually increases the gradient of fracture length changes gradually decreases as the number of fractures increases the difference between the length of the first fracture and the second fracture will gradually increase 3 3 effect of fracture volume case 7 supposes the vertical section of the wellbore is 3000 m long the horizontal section is 2000 m long the diameter of the wellbore is 0 174 m the friction coefficient of the wellbore is 0 03 the initial flow rate is 10 m 3 min the wave velocity is 1000 m s the other basic parameters for analysis can be found in table 4 case 7 multi fracture is calculated that the half lengths of the fractures are 158 m 106 m 158 m the fracture widths are 30 mm 20 mm 30 mm and the fracture height is 31 m the simulated results are shown in fig 11 multi fractures when changing the value of rci and the total volume of the fracture only a single fracture is defined as a half length of 158 m a fracture width of 30 mm and a fracture height of 31 m the remaining pumping flow wellbore properties and formation properties remain unchanged the net pressure of the fracture can be calculated by the fracture geometry and then the bottom hole pressure can be calculated at this time the simulated water hammer pressure is shown in fig 11 single fracture from fig 11 when the fracture development does not reach the expected effect or the total fracture volume decreases the water hammer pressure signal shows a downward shifting state the lowest point of pressure in the case of three fractures is 31 3 mpa which is 26 lower than the lowest point of a single fracture at 23 0 mpa the average pressure of the three fractures is 34 2 mpa which is 24 lower than the average pressure of a single fracture of 25 9 mpa in the case of a single fracture the water hammer pressure drop is mainly due to the decrease in fracture volume and net pressure this will result in a single fracture with lower bottom well pressure than multiple fractures the water hammer pressure signal of a single fracture will move down however the real water hammer situation is not just a drop pressure and may also include a change in the decay rate of the water hammer our model does not consider the flow pressure loss within the fracture the flow pressure loss in the fracture will be our next research content 3 4 effect of fracture spacing the basic parameters for analysis can be found in table 4 case 8 the half length of each fracture is shown in fig 12 from fig 12 a with the increase of the fracture spacing the half length of the longest fracture decreases from 175 m to 149 m and the half length of the shortest fracture increases from 4 m to 129 m in addition the average length of fractures increases and the difference between the length of the longest fracture and the shortest fracture decreases as the fracture spacing increases the difference in stress interference between the fractures is continuously reduced so each fracture can get a more approximate fracture half length from fig 12 b when the fracture spacing is changed from 20 m to 25 m the half length of the shortest fracture increases from 4 m to 81 m the length increases 23 times and the growth rate is extremely high however as the fracture spacing continues to increase the shortest fracture half length is closer to the longest fracture half length according to the change of fracture length caused by different fracture spacing smaller fracture spacing may cause the center fractures too short or not propagation 4 field case analysis this paper uses the model to perform history matching on the field data of two multiple fractures hydraulic fracturing horizontal wells well a had a horizontal length of 1604 m a vertical depth of 3315 84 m well a has 4 clusters of perforations in each section well b had a horizontal length of 1600 m a vertical depth of 3331 35 m well b has 4 clusters of perforations in each section according to the pump stop water hammer pressure signal collected at the wellhead of each fracturing stage the values of r c and i are continuously changed iteratively until the simulation wave is similar to the pump stop water hammer pressure signal collected at the wellhead then the r c and i values of this stage can be determined taking the water hammer pressure signal collected from the fracturing stage 1 of well a as an example when the water hammer pressure signal matches the simulation water hammer pressure the result is shown in fig 13 as shown in fig 13 at the calculation time between 40 s and 50 s the fracture curve collected on the field had greater fluctuations than the simulation curve where the maximum error is 3 45 mpa and the average pressure error for the entire section is 0 44 mpa analysis of this is mainly because the pump displacement had a gentle and sudden decrease around the 30 s which is different from the assumption that the pump displacement is uniformly reduced during the pump stop time therefore there is a more severe water hammer fluctuation at the time of 40 s to 50 s but considering the overall fluctuation this paper believes that the simulated water hammer pressure signal had correctly matched the field acquisition wave at this time according to the r c and i values the equivalent total fracture geometry is calculated then the geometry of each fracture in the corresponding fracturing section is calculated according to the fracture spacing and the number of perforations designed for fracturing the fracturing data of 11 stages are analyzed and the results are compared with the micro seismic data of each fracturing stage during the fracturing process the rci values and fracture data of each fracturing stage are shown in table 5 and the comparison result is shown in fig 14 fig 14 a shows the comparison of the fracture half length calculated by the model and the micro seismic interpretation the x coordinate is the fracture half length data of the micro seismic interpretation and the y coordinate is the fracture half length data calculated by the multi fractures model from fig 14 a the average error between the calculated fracture half length geometry of well a and the fracture half length geometry of micro seismic interpretation is 6 1 m the error of well a accounts for 6 5 of the average fracture half length of micro seismic interpretation and the maximum single stage error is 22 0 the average error between the calculated fracture half length geometry of well b and the fracture half length geometry of micro seismic interpretation is 18 7 m the error of well b accounts for 18 3 of the average half length of micro seismic interpretation fractures and the maximum single section error is 32 0 fig 14 b shows the comparison of the fracture height calculated by the model and the micro seismic interpretation height the x coordinate is the fracture height data of the micro seismic interpretation and the y coordinate is the fracture height data calculated by the multi fractures model from fig 8 b the average error between the calculated fracture height of well a and the fracture height of micro seismic interpretation is 1 9 m the error of well a accounts for 5 5 of the average fracture height of the micro seismic interpretation and the largest single section error is 17 4 the average value of the error between the calculated fracture height of well b and the fracture height of micro seismic interpretation is 3 3 m the error of well b accounts for 9 5 of the average fracture height of the micro seismic interpretation and the maximum single section error is 23 0 according to the above figure in the process of multiple fractures fracturing the method of calculating fracture geometry by the multi fractures model is consistent with the interpretation of fracture geometry by micro seismic data 5 conclusion this paper proposed a model which can calculate the geometry of total fractures by matching the water hammer pressure signal compared with previous research the biggest improvement of our model is that it can be applied to the field environment of multiple fractures fracturing we propose a new model that can calculate the geometry of multiple fractures by stopping pumping water hammer pressure signal coupling the stress interference calculation method and the rci model the fracture geometry of each fracture can be calculated in above cases of the same set the values of r c and i the following results can be obtained 1 in contrast the length and width of fracture which is located at the middle of the fracturing stage are smaller than those far from the stage center 2 when the fracture spacing is constant and the number of fractures increases the average length and width of all fractures will decrease and the total length of the fracture network will increase but the rate of change of the fracture length and width with the number of fractures will gradually decrease 3 when the number of fractures is constant and the fracture spacing increases the average length of the fractures will increase but the rate of change of the fracture length and width with the fracture spacing will gradually decrease 4 the change of the fracture volume will directly affect the water hammer pressure signal the increase of the fracture volume means that it will cause higher water hammer pressure signal in addition by comparing the micro seismic data the average error of fracture half length and fracture width of well a is 6 5 and 5 5 and the average error of well b is 18 3 and 9 5 the fracture geometry calculated by our model is similar to the result explained by micro seismic credit authorship contribution

3133,hydraulic fracturing is an important means to develop unconventional resources fracture diagnosis techniques have been emerged in recent years which can evaluate hydraulic stimulated fractures after stimulation treatment fracture geometry evaluation is an important part of hydraulic fracturing diagnosis the fracture geometry evaluation techniques based on water hammer signal has the advantages of high economic efficiency easy implementation and high timeliness previously a model that couples the wellbore and the fracture rci model had been proposed which could calculate the fracture geometry however this model was mainly based on the assumption of a single fracture with a pair of double wings and there was no research on the calculation of the geometry of multi fractures in this paper a new model for calculating the geometry of multi fractures was proposed first a new factor the stress interference between the various fractures was considered in the model second based

b however these resources are reserved in formation with low permeability and poor connectivity scanlon et al 2014 song et al 2017 to enhance recovery rate it is an effective method to stimulate the reservoir through hydraulic fracturing treatment daneshy 2010 guo et al 2014 rahm 2011 zhang 2014 the geometry of the fracture after fracturing affects the final production of the unconventional reservoir therefore to obtain a higher recovery rate after hydraulic fracturing the evaluation of the fracture geometry of hydraulic fracturing is very important in hydraulic fracturing diagnosis cipolla and wright 2002 however hydraulic fracturing fractures are formed underground it is impossible to directly obtain the geometry of hydraulic fracturing fractures through observation therefore an economical and efficient method for evaluating fracture geometry is necessary the fracture geometry diagnosis techniques based on water hammer pressure signal is a potential method which has the advantages of high economic efficiency easy implementation and high timeliness parkhonyuk et al 2018 many literatures have proved the feasibility of diagnosing the fracture geometry through pressure waves holzhausen 1985 estimated the fracture impedance by artificially exciting the pressure wave at the wellhead and fitting it with the pressure wave reflection received at the wellhead through trial and error calculating the geometry of the fracture holzhausen and egan 1986 paige 1992 1995 yew and ashour 1994 and other scholars carried out some field scale tests for this method which verified the adaptability of holzhausen s model patzek and de 2000 proposed a lossy transmission line model to describe the wellbore and fracture geometry which could consider energy loss mondal 2010 established a semi analytical model for the continuity and momentum equations of a wellbore containing micro compressible single phase fluids using the method of characteristic moc and mondal defines a fracture model rci model which used some parameters r c and i to represent a single double wing fracture method of characteristic moc and the fracture model rci were combined to simulate and match the water hammer pressure signal through the above mentioned mondal model the length height and width of the fracture under the assumption of a single double wing fracture could be estimated carey 2015 proposed the relationship between multiple fractures and mondal s equivalent single fracture carey 2016 compared the fracture geometry diagnosis method based on water hammer pressure signal with the micro seismic diagnostics he found that there was a strong correlation between the fracture length calculated by the rci model and the fracture length measured by the micro seismic data hwang 2017 studied the effect of each parameter in the rci model on the waveform of the water hammer pressure signal and calculated the geometry of the fractures through the rci model and solved multiple fractures according to the same geometry haustveit 2017 compared the results of electromagnetic imaging micro seismic pressure interference testing fracture simulation and water hammer pressure diagnosis haustveit pointed out that the fracture length estimated by the water hammer rci model was longer than the fracture length estimated by other methods and was comparable to the fracture length derived from the micro seismic in this method the water hammer pressure diagnostic simulation assumed that there was only one effective fracture at each stimulation stage thus the actual fracture length in the fracture network was expected to be shorter than the simulated water hammer pressure signal fracture length ma et al 2019 proposed a new expression of water hammer pressure boundary conditions based on the rci model including pressure leakage perforation friction and internal fracture friction for this boundary condition the circuit simulation system was abandoned and the friction equations in the fractures were used instead dung et al 2021 discussed factors affecting fracturing related water hammer behavior and presented a field study that correlates water hammer characteristics with fracture intensity and wellbore productivity based on the basic theory of fluid mechanics a simulator was developed to treatment water hammer characteristics however the main limitation of the diagnosis of fracture geometry by water hammer pressure signal is that the model only considered a single fracture in the water hammer pressure diagnostics when multiple fractures existed the geometry of each fracture cannot be effectively expressed in addition it is simply defined that each fracture propagation uniformly with the same geometry this assumption does not correspond to reality in fact multiple fractures have stress interference the fracture geometry is not the same therefore how to correctly characterize the geometry of multiple fractures in the field of fracturing is a challenging task in this study a new water hammer diagnostics model is proposed to calculate the geometry of the multiple fractures first a new factor is considered in the model which is the stress interference between the multiple fractures according to the effect of stress interference the maximum fracture width constraining each fracture is calculated second based on the conservation of the total volume of fractures the rationality of the volume equivalent relationship of multiple fractures is proved third a new method is proposed to allow influencing factors to be added to the model reasonably base on volume conservation through this method the characteristic parameters of each fracture r c and i can be defined more reasonably the geometrical parameters of each fracture can be calculated additionally the model is validated based on four cases after that the relationship between fracture half length and fracture width the effect of the number of fractures and fracture spacing on the fracture geometry and the effect of fracture volume changes on the water hammer pressure signal are analyzed furthermore based on the field micro seismic data a comparative analysis of the fracture geometry calculated by our model and the micro seismic interpretation geometry is conducted this study provides a new multi fracture geometry diagnosis model based on the water hammer pressure signal 2 model establishment in order to allow readers to have a simpler and clearer understanding of the hydraulic fracturing process and the modeling process of the model this paper briefly describes the hydraulic fracturing process through the fig 1 after the wellbore construction are completed the perforating gun needs to be placed at the bottom of the wellbore and shoots through the wellbore wellbore is connected to the formation this step is called perforating and the distance between perforation cluster is called fracture spacing then high pressure fluid is pumped from the wellhead and the rock at the perforation is broken by high pressure to form fractures as the pump stop at the end of hydraulic fracturing water hammer will generate in the wellbore fracture system then the numerical simulation method and boundary conditions are selected for solving the water hammer pressure signal among all numerical solutions the method of characteristic moc proves to be the most popular method ghidaoui et al 2005 the method of characteristic is often used to solve the initial value problem of the first order hyperbolic partial differential equation this method can transform the partial differential equation into an ordinary differential equation by integrating along the characteristic line since the equation of water hammer is a first order partial differential equation many researchers use this method to conduct research on transient flow problems first the values of equivalent single fracture parameters r c and i should be obtained the characteristic method is used to control the flow change in the closed pipeline through the motion equation and the continuity equation the equivalent single fracture characteristic parameters r c and i are adjusted to match the water hammer pressure signal second according to the stress interference between fractures each fracture geometry can be calculated the stress interference between fractures are calculated by fracture spacing and the number of fractures the effect of stress interference is introduced into the previously calculated equivalent single fracture characteristic parameters r c and i then the geometry of each fracture can be calculated the flowchart is shown in fig 2 2 1 mathematical model establishment wellbore flow model this paper uses the method of characteristic to describe the flow in the wellbore this model is mainly controlled by the equation of motion and the continuity equation chaudhury proposed the general expression of the equation of motion as chaudhry 2014 1 v t v v x 1 ρ p x g sin θ fv v 2 d 0 wherein v is the flow velocity m s in the pipe t is the time s x is the coordinate axis along the axis of the pipe m ρ is the fluid density kg m 3 p is the pressure pa and d is the pipe diameter m f is the friction coefficient g is the acceleration of gravity m s 2 and θ is the inclination of the pipe to the horizontal ground for the low mach number unsteady flow the term v v x can be ignored so the motion equation 1 can be simplified to 2 v t 1 ρ p x g sin θ fv v 2 d 0 in addition chaudhury proposed the general expression form of the continuity equation as chaudhry 2014 3 1 ρ d ρ dt 1 a da dt v x 0 wherein a is the cross sectional area of the wellbore m 2 v is the flow velocity m s assuming that the elastic pipe is filled with a slightly compressible fluid eq 3 could be simplified as 4 p t v p x ρ a 2 v x 0 wherein a is the wave speed m s v is the flow velocity m s a can be calculated by eq 5 chaudhry 2014 5 a k ρ 1 dk ee wherein k is the bulk modulus pa e is the young s modulus of elasticity of the pipe pa e is the pipe wall thickness m similarly the term v p x is small compared to the other terms so the continuity eq 4 can be simplified as 6 p t ρ a 2 v x 0 wherein v is the flow velocity m s in the analysis of pipeline flow velocity v and pressure p are usually represented by flow rate q m 3 s and pressure head h m 7 q v a 8 h p ρ g z wherein z is the elevation of the reference datum v is the flow velocity m s in the above eq 2 and 6 can be represented by h and q as shown in eq 9 and eq 10 9 q t g a h x fq q 2 d a 0 10 h t a 2 ga q x 0 according to the above equation of motion eq 9 and the continuity equation eq 10 the simulated water hammer pressure can be calculated in addition the boundary conditions can be calculated by the rci multi fractures model rci multi fractures model the multi fracture model proposes in this paper includes three parts in the first part through the equivalent single fracture model rci and the wellbore flow model moc the fracture parameters r c and i are used to match the water hammer pressure signal to find a total value of r c and i in the second part in the fracture geometry diagnosis technology based on water hammer pressure signal the effect of stress interference among multiple fractures are considered for the first time the maximum fracture width of each fracture is calculated based on the stress interference between multiple fractures in the third part based on the conservation of fracture volume a method to considering the effect of stress interference into the fracture model rci is proposed for the first time that is the ratio of each maximum fracture width is brought into the equivalent relationship of each fracture then the values can be calculated for each fracture geometry this chapter will describe each part in detail in the first part the single fracture model is an rci model proposed by mondal this model equates the well bottom fracture into a circuit form and uses the resistance r the capacitance c and the inductance i to characterize the well bottom fracture shape and the net pressure of the fracture δ p 0 wherein δ p 0 p f s h min p f is the average fluid pressure in the fracture s h min is the minimum formation stress and δ p 0 represents the stress difference between the fluid pressure in the fracture and the stress of the formation fig 3 a shows a hydraulic fracture of a horizontal well and fig 3 b shows the equivalent circuit representation in particular the fracture should have double wings in this paper but in order to save space of the paper only one wing of the fracture is shown in figs 3 and 4 and the other wing is similar to it the detailed fracture geometry will be described in fig 5 any fracture can be represented by r c and i and these parameters are defined as follows resistance r is the constant of proportionality between the flow rate q to maintain the fracture and the required potential energy difference which can be expressed as eq 11 schönfeld 1954 11 δ p r q wherein δ p is pressure drop pa the capacitance c is defined as the ratio of the fracture volume change every time the liquid pressure changes which can be expressed as eq 12 holzhausen and gooch 1985a b 12 c δ v δ p wherein δ v is the change of fracture volume m 3 the inductance i is related to the quality of the fluid in the system and is potential difference required to accelerate or decelerate the discharge q in the absence of friction the inductance i is equivalent to the inductance in the circuit which can be expressed as eq 13 schönfeld 1954 13 δ p i dq dt the potential difference at the well bottom boundary condition defines as the sum of the individual r c and i potential differences which can be shown as below in eq 14 carey et al 2015 14 ρ g δ h r q 1 c qdt i dq dt wherein δ h can be considered as a head corresponding to the near wellbore friction pressure drop δ p nwf and the average net pressure of the fracture δ p 0 for rci model mondal first made the following assumptions to simplify the calculation of fracture geometry mondal 2010 1 during the water hammer duration only the fracture width changes with the pressure pulse after the water hammer stops the fracture geometry is unchanged 2 fractures generated by hydraulic fracturing can be considered as an equivalent single plane fracture 3 during the water hammer duration the model ignores the fluid loss of the fracture which means the fluid will not flow into the formation but will surge in the fracture 4 during the water hammer duration the model ignores the friction along the fracture length but considers the near wellbore friction because the fracture length friction pressure drop is much smaller than the near wellbore friction pressure drop the near wellbore friction pressure drop can be expressed as δ p nwf 5 the surface pressure is used to calculate the average near well pressure and the near wellbore frictional resistance is used to express the fracture frictional resistance the friction resistance of the near wellbore can be represented by the resistance r and the connectivity of the well and fracture can be quantified by the value of r r is mainly affected by the perforation and wellbore fracture connectivity considering the fracture geometry into eqs 11 14 the relationship between the fracture geometry and the well bottom pressure boundary can be obtained in eqs 15 22 the near wellbore friction pressure drop δ p nwf as shown in eq 15 the smaller the value of r the lower the near wellbore friction pressure drop carey et al 2015 15 r δ p nwf q 0 wherein δ p nwf is the near wellbore friction pressure drop pa δ p nwf meant the press drop of the fluid from the perforation to the fracture the values of r c and i can be obtained based on the matching of the water hammer pressure signal according to the appropriate r c and i values the length width height and net pressure of the fracture can be calculated the average net pressure δ p 0 can be obtained by eq 16 carey et al 2015 16 δ p 0 p bh δ p nwf s h min wherein p bh is the well bottom pressure pa and s h min is the minimum formation stress pa δ p nwf can be solved by r and q 0 in eq 15 the relationship between the pressure parameters is shown in the fig 4 according to eq 16 when the average net pressure δ p 0 of the fracture and the near wellbore friction pressure drop δ p nwf is calculated the well bottom pressure p bh can be calculated by combining the parameters of the minimum formation stress s h min the calculated well bottom pressure is used as the boundary condition of the fracture in the wellbore flow to simulate the water hammer pressure signal when the pump is stopped according to different forms fractures can be divided into two types shylapobersky defined short fractures as when 2 l f h f 1 and long fractures when 2 l f h f 1 shlyapobersky et al 1998 the fracture geometry for short fractures and long fractures is shown in fig 5 the fracture half length is perpendicular to the wellbore and is the main propagation direction the fracture height is parallel to the wellbore direction the fracture width is perpendicular to the fracture length and fracture height the fracture length and fracture height are in meters and the fracture width is in millimeters the fracture width is drawn larger than the actual scale in order to be clearly marked in fig 5 the average net pressure of fractures can be calculated by eq 17 carey et al 2015 17 δ p o 4 π 2 e 1 v 2 e m w max 1 l f 2 h f wherein v is poisson s ratio w is the average fracture width mm e is young s modulus pa l f is the half length of the fracture m h f is the height of the fracture m e m can be calculated by eq 18 carey et al 2015 18 e m 0 π 2 1 m 2 sin 2

as carey et al 2015 m 1 min l f h f 2 max l f h f 2 2 at the same time the fracture geometry can be estimated according to eqs 20 22 carey et al 2015 20 l f ci δ p 0 ρ 21 h f 4 e e m c π 2 l f 2 short fracture 4 e e m c π 2 l f long fracture 22 w ρ l f i h f wherein e e 1 v 2 v is poisson s ratio according to the above formula and the r c and i values the fracture geometry can be calculated through the above calculation method eqs 15 22 the near wellbore friction pressure drop δ p nwf the average net pressure δ p 0 and the well bottom pressure p bh can be calculated to simulate water hammer and the signal fracture half length width and height can be calculated then the fracture length fracture width fracture height and net pressure of the equivalent single fracture can be calculated the model proposed by mondal is based on the plane double wing single fractures assumptions since the current hydraulic fracturing process is based on multiple fractures fracturing mode in each fracturing stage the multiple fractures fracturing method can improve the fracturing efficiency and increase the recovery ratio in multiple fractures case mondal model can only calculate the equivalent single fracture geometry so the geometry of multiple fractures cannot be accurately calculated therefore carey believed that the equivalent fracture length and width calculated by the mondal model could be considered as the combination of all fractures connected to the wellbore carey et al 2015 consider a fracturing stage that consists of n perforation clusters that create n transverse fractures the multi fracture equivalent circuit relationship is shown in fig 6 through the rci circuit the capacitance of each fracture is connected in parallel so the capacitance of n fractures can be expressed as 23 c t i 1 n c i wherein c t is the total capacitance r t is the total resistance and i t is the total inductance at the equivalent single fracture therefore the half length of each fracture can be expressed as 24 l f e c t i t δ p 0 ρ i 1 n c i i t δ p 0 i ρ i t ρ i 1 n c i δ p 0 i wherein l f e is the half length of the equivalent total fracture from eq 24 the equivalent single fracture half length can be written as the sum of each fracture and the fracture half length conversion formula can be expressed as 25 l f e i 1 n l i 2 similarly the average fracture width of each fracture can also be expressed as 26 w e ρ h fe i t i 1 n c i δ p 0 i wherein w e is the fracture width of the equivalent total fracture h fe is the fracture height of the equivalent single fracture which can be calculated by the equivalent single fracture parameters r t c t and i t from eq 26 the equivalent single fracture width could be written as the sum of each fracture the fracture width conversion formula could be expressed as 27 w e i 1 n w i 2 according to the assumption that the initiating fractures are all equal height fractures the height of each fracture can be defined as 28 h fe h fi i 1 2 n hwang calculated the length of multiple fractures according to the above mentioned multi fracture and total fracture equivalent method hwang et al 2017 in hwang s calculation all fractures are considered to be fractures of the same geometry but this is different from the actual propagation state of the fractures in the formation this is because of the leak of restrictive conditions for the fracture morphology therefore in the second part this paper uses the stress interference between the fractures to restrict the propagation of the fractures for the first time based on the stress field distribution formula around multiple fractures proposed by gao and yao the calculation method of stress interference between any two fractures the formula can be expressed as gao 2013 29 δ σ ζ ij p bh s h min 1 1 h f 2 d ij 2 3 2 wherein δ σ ζ ij is the stress interference pa between the i th fracture and the j th fracture d ij is the fracture spacing m between the i th fracture and the j th fracture when the mutual stress interference between all fractures is calculated the net pressure of each fracture can be obtained according to the stress interference between the fractures the formula can be expressed as gao 2013 30 p net i p bh s h min j 1 j i n δ σ ζ ij wherein p net i is the average net pressure of i th fracture pa in particular if the net pressure of a certain fracture is calculated as a negative number during the calculation process this paper considered that the fracture cannot be expanded normally the fracture should be removed and the net pressure of the remaining fractures should be recalculated when the net pressure of all the fractures is obtained according to the fracture width expression derived by sneddon and elliot the fracture width under the stress interference model of each fracture is calculated and the formula can be expressed as sneddon and elliot 1946 31 w i 2 h f 1 v 2 p net i e wherein v is poisson s ratio through the above eqs 29 31 the width of each fracture is calculated by stress interference in the third part a new method of coupling stress interference and fracture parameters is proposed to ensure the volume conservation of fractures the width of each fracture is proportionally combined into eq 27 according to the known equivalent single fracture width and the proportion of each fracture width calculated by eq 31 the w i value of the fracture width of multiple fractures can be calculated then according to eq 22 the formula for calculating the length of multiple fractures can be obtained 32 l fi i t h fi ρ w i wherein i t and h fi can be known according to the equivalent single fracture eq 17 can be changed to the net pressure of each multi fracture 33 δ p oi 4 π 2 e 1 v 2 e m w i 1 l fi 2 h fi wherein v is poisson s ratio the calculated each fracture half length l fi and each fracture width w i of multiple fractures are used in eq 33 to calculate the net pressure of each fracture δ p oi finally eq 20 can be changed to the multiple fractures half length 34 l fi c i i t δ p oi ρ eq 34 can be changed into 35 c i l fi 2 ρ i t δ p oi bring the fracture half length of each fracture and the net pressure of each fracture into eq 35 to get the capacitance of each fracture c i of each fracture with multiple fractures as well as the half length l fi fracture width w i and fracture height h fi of each fracture can all be calculated 2 2 solution method method of characteristic according to the 2 1 wellbore flow model two dependent variables are used to represent motion and continuity equations the two independent variables of flow rate and pressure head time and distance along the pipeline are transformed into four ordinary differential equations wylie and streeter rewrote the motion and continuity equations to transform the method of characteristic wylie and streeter 1993 36 l 1 q t g a h x fq q 2 d a 0 37 l 2 h t a 2 ga q x 0 the linear combination of the above equation into the unknown quantity λ obtains the eq 38 38 l l 1 λ l 2 q t g a h x fq q 2 d a λ h t a 2 ga q x the two values λ 1 a are put into eq 38 then two equations can be obtained which are defined as c and c respectively after obtaining the c and c equations the flow rate q and the pressure head h at t t can be obtained by combining the flow rate q and the pressure head h at time t through the differential equation differential equations are solved by the finite difference method after simplification the finite difference form of c and c equations as eq 39 and eq 40 39 c h p h a b q p q a r q p q a 40 c h p h b b q p q b r q p q b wherein b is the impedance characteristic of the pipeline r is the resistance coefficient of the pipe and f is the frictional resistance coefficient of the pipeline calculated by chen chen 1979 above parameters are expressed as eqs 41 43 41 b a ga 42 r f δ x 2 g d a 2 43 1 f 2 log 1 3 7065 e d 5 0452 re log 1 2 8257 e d 1 1098 5 8506 re 0 8981 wherein e is the roughness of the well and re is the reynolds number in the initial state at the beginning of the solution time t 0 the flow state in the wellbore is known at this time that was all the flow rate q and pressure head h at this time are known according to the flow rate q and pressure head h at the time of the known state the flow rate q and pressure head h at the point i 1 and i 1 can be used to calculate the flow rate q and pressure head h at the point i at the next unknown state time boundary condition at the head of the well after the hydraulic fracturing treatment is completed the flow rate at the inlet of the wellbore will continue to decrease assuming that the displacement of the pump decreases linearly during the process of stopping the pump until the flow rate at the wellhead drops to zero the boundary conditions of the well head can be defined by the change of flow rate at the bottom of the well first according to the value of r c and i eq 15 is used to calculate the near wellbore friction pressure drop δ p nwf and eqs 17 20 22 is used to calculate the average net pressure of the fracture δ p 0 and the geometry of the equivalent single fracture second eq 16 is used to calculate the well bottom pressure p bh and the well bottom pressure p bh is used as the well bottom boundary condition in the method of characteristic to simulate the water hammer pressure signal through the definition of the boundary conditions of the wellhead and the well bottom it is possible to simulate the water hammer pressure by the method of characteristic when the pump is stopped then according to the matching water hammer pressure signal the r c and i value can be obtained the obtained r c and i value will be used to calculate the fracture geometry computational multi fracture geometry first according to the method of characteristic the r c and i value are adjusted to match the water hammer pressure signal when the water hammer pressure signal is matched the r c and i values of the equivalent single fracture can be obtained second through the values of r t c t and i t of the equivalent single fracture l f e w e h fe and δ p 0 can be solved by eq 17 20 22 the obtained geometry is the equivalent single fracture geometry third the bottom well pressure p bh is calculated by eq 16 wherein δ p nwf can be calculated according to eq 15 and s h min is formation stress p bh would be brought into the method of characteristic as the bottom well boundary condition to simulate water hammer pressure signal fourth according to the p bh h fe the values of the number of perforation clusters n and the fracture spacing d ij in the fracturing design the stress interference between each fracture δ σ ζ ij can be calculated by eq 29 fifth according to eq 30 through the stress interference between each fracture δ σ ζ ij the net pressure in each fracture δ p 0 i is calculated sixth according to eq 31 the fracture width by griffith fracture is obtained according to the net pressure in each fracture δ p 0 i at last according to the fracture width by griffith fracture each fracture width w i is proportionally brought into eq 27 to obtain the fracture width by the rci model w i according to eq 32 the half length of each fracture can be calculated according to the above steps the geometry of each fracture can be solved 2 3 model validation to verify our model this paper compares between our model and previous work including two classical numerical solution methods laboratory experiments data and rci model data the two numerical solutions are implicit method of characteristic imoc and finite volume method fvm the method of calculating water hammer pressure signal in case 1 is based on the implicit method of characteristic the initial parameters are shown in table 1 afshar and rohani 2008 when the boundary condition is that the upstream boundary condition is a constant pressure head of 182 88 m and the downstream boundary condition is 4 s to close the end valve our method is used to simulate the water hammer pressure and compared with the result simulated by implicit method the comparison result is shown in fig 7 a the maximum head difference between two methods is 9 2 m the minimum head difference is 6 5 m the max pressures error between the implicit method of characteristic and our method is 2 6 the method of calculating water hammer pressure signal in case 2 is based on the finite volume method the initial parameters are shown in table 1 zhao et al 2014 when the boundary condition is that the upstream boundary condition is a constant pressure head of 150 m and the downstream boundary condition is 10 s to close the end valve our method is used to simulate the water hammer pressure and compared with the result simulated by finite volume method the comparison result is shown in fig 7 b the maximum head difference between two methods is 0 2 m the minimum head difference is 1 m the max pressures error between the finite volume method and our method is 0 6 the case 3 simulated the water hammer pressure signal in the presence of fractures through laboratory experiment in this experiment a pressure vessel is connected at the branch pipe to simulate the fracture a constant pressure is applied to the pressure vessel to simulate the pressure in the fracture in particular this constant pressure can be assumed to be the pressure boundary calculated by the rci model the initial parameters are shown in table 2 the comparison result is shown in fig 8 the max pressure difference is 0 004 mpa the max pressures error is 2 1 case 3 had proved that the water hammer pressure can be simulated on the premise that the pressure at the fracture can be accurately calculated by the value of r c and i therefore next section case 4 will focus on verifying the accuracy of the rci model case 4 is aim to confirm the value of rci and simulate water hammer pressure we use the accurate rci value of other scholars to calculate the fracture geometry the calculated fracture geometry differences are shown in table 3 carey et al 2015 wherein l fpre h fpre and w pre represent the previous calculation result case 4 can prove that the accuracy of the calculated fracture geometry of the rci model can be guaranteed through the above four cases it is verified that the model and boundary conditions proposed in this paper can be applied in practice the model used in this paper can simulate the water hammer pressure in the well head in the presence of fractures so in the following we will use this model to carry out results and field case analysis 3 results and discussion the basic parameters used in section 3 are shown in table 4 according to the model proposed in this paper the effect of fracture length and width fracture number fracture volume and fracture spacing are analyzed 3 1 the relationship between fracture half length and fracture width the basic parameters for analysis can be found in table 4 case 5 the dimensions of the fracture half length and fracture width are shown in fig 9 the half lengths of the fractures are 158 m 106 m and 158 m and the fracture widths are 30 mm 20 mm and 30 mm the longest fracture half length is 148 of the shortest fracture half length and the longest fracture width is 148 of the shortest fracture width therefore the half length and width of each fracture had a certain proportional relationship for the half length of the fracture and the fracture width is calculated by eq 20 and eq 22 under the same situation the inductance i density ρ and fracture height of the fracture h f are all known values thus the obtained fracture half length is proportional to the fracture width therefore only the change rule of the fracture half length will be discussed in chapter 3 the change rule of the fracture width is similar in figs 9 14 fl is used to represent the fracture half length fw is used to represent the fracture width and fh is used to represent the fracture height 3 2 effect of the number of fractures the basic parameters for analysis can be found in table 4 case 6 the half length of each fracture is shown in fig 10 from fig 10 a the half length of the fracture on both sides is longer than the half length of the middle fracture this is due to the different degrees of stress interference on both sides and the middle fractures from eq 29 the stress interference of the fractures on both sides is less than the stress interference of the middle fracture the fractures on both sides are easier to expand than the middle fracture with the increase of the number of fractures the longest fracture will decrease from 247 m to 149 m and the average fracture length will decrease from 247 m to 92 m while the total length of all fractures will increase from 247 m to 553 m from fig 10 b the number of fractures gradually increases the gradient of fracture length changes gradually decreases as the number of fractures increases the difference between the length of the first fracture and the second fracture will gradually increase 3 3 effect of fracture volume case 7 supposes the vertical section of the wellbore is 3000 m long the horizontal section is 2000 m long the diameter of the wellbore is 0 174 m the friction coefficient of the wellbore is 0 03 the initial flow rate is 10 m 3 min the wave velocity is 1000 m s the other basic parameters for analysis can be found in table 4 case 7 multi fracture is calculated that the half lengths of the fractures are 158 m 106 m 158 m the fracture widths are 30 mm 20 mm 30 mm and the fracture height is 31 m the simulated results are shown in fig 11 multi fractures when changing the value of rci and the total volume of the fracture only a single fracture is defined as a half length of 158 m a fracture width of 30 mm and a fracture height of 31 m the remaining pumping flow wellbore properties and formation properties remain unchanged the net pressure of the fracture can be calculated by the fracture geometry and then the bottom hole pressure can be calculated at this time the simulated water hammer pressure is shown in fig 11 single fracture from fig 11 when the fracture development does not reach the expected effect or the total fracture volume decreases the water hammer pressure signal shows a downward shifting state the lowest point of pressure in the case of three fractures is 31 3 mpa which is 26 lower than the lowest point of a single fracture at 23 0 mpa the average pressure of the three fractures is 34 2 mpa which is 24 lower than the average pressure of a single fracture of 25 9 mpa in the case of a single fracture the water hammer pressure drop is mainly due to the decrease in fracture volume and net pressure this will result in a single fracture with lower bottom well pressure than multiple fractures the water hammer pressure signal of a single fracture will move down however the real water hammer situation is not just a drop pressure and may also include a change in the decay rate of the water hammer our model does not consider the flow pressure loss within the fracture the flow pressure loss in the fracture will be our next research content 3 4 effect of fracture spacing the basic parameters for analysis can be found in table 4 case 8 the half length of each fracture is shown in fig 12 from fig 12 a with the increase of the fracture spacing the half length of the longest fracture decreases from 175 m to 149 m and the half length of the shortest fracture increases from 4 m to 129 m in addition the average length of fractures increases and the difference between the length of the longest fracture and the shortest fracture decreases as the fracture spacing increases the difference in stress interference between the fractures is continuously reduced so each fracture can get a more approximate fracture half length from fig 12 b when the fracture spacing is changed from 20 m to 25 m the half length of the shortest fracture increases from 4 m to 81 m the length increases 23 times and the growth rate is extremely high however as the fracture spacing continues to increase the shortest fracture half length is closer to the longest fracture half length according to the change of fracture length caused by different fracture spacing smaller fracture spacing may cause the center fractures too short or not propagation 4 field case analysis this paper uses the model to perform history matching on the field data of two multiple fractures hydraulic fracturing horizontal wells well a had a horizontal length of 1604 m a vertical depth of 3315 84 m well a has 4 clusters of perforations in each section well b had a horizontal length of 1600 m a vertical depth of 3331 35 m well b has 4 clusters of perforations in each section according to the pump stop water hammer pressure signal collected at the wellhead of each fracturing stage the values of r c and i are continuously changed iteratively until the simulation wave is similar to the pump stop water hammer pressure signal collected at the wellhead then the r c and i values of this stage can be determined taking the water hammer pressure signal collected from the fracturing stage 1 of well a as an example when the water hammer pressure signal matches the simulation water hammer pressure the result is shown in fig 13 as shown in fig 13 at the calculation time between 40 s and 50 s the fracture curve collected on the field had greater fluctuations than the simulation curve where the maximum error is 3 45 mpa and the average pressure error for the entire section is 0 44 mpa analysis of this is mainly because the pump displacement had a gentle and sudden decrease around the 30 s which is different from the assumption that the pump displacement is uniformly reduced during the pump stop time therefore there is a more severe water hammer fluctuation at the time of 40 s to 50 s but considering the overall fluctuation this paper believes that the simulated water hammer pressure signal had correctly matched the field acquisition wave at this time according to the r c and i values the equivalent total fracture geometry is calculated then the geometry of each fracture in the corresponding fracturing section is calculated according to the fracture spacing and the number of perforations designed for fracturing the fracturing data of 11 stages are analyzed and the results are compared with the micro seismic data of each fracturing stage during the fracturing process the rci values and fracture data of each fracturing stage are shown in table 5 and the comparison result is shown in fig 14 fig 14 a shows the comparison of the fracture half length calculated by the model and the micro seismic interpretation the x coordinate is the fracture half length data of the micro seismic interpretation and the y coordinate is the fracture half length data calculated by the multi fractures model from fig 14 a the average error between the calculated fracture half length geometry of well a and the fracture half length geometry of micro seismic interpretation is 6 1 m the error of well a accounts for 6 5 of the average fracture half length of micro seismic interpretation and the maximum single stage error is 22 0 the average error between the calculated fracture half length geometry of well b and the fracture half length geometry of micro seismic interpretation is 18 7 m the error of well b accounts for 18 3 of the average half length of micro seismic interpretation fractures and the maximum single section error is 32 0 fig 14 b shows the comparison of the fracture height calculated by the model and the micro seismic interpretation height the x coordinate is the fracture height data of the micro seismic interpretation and the y coordinate is the fracture height data calculated by the multi fractures model from fig 8 b the average error between the calculated fracture height of well a and the fracture height of micro seismic interpretation is 1 9 m the error of well a accounts for 5 5 of the average fracture height of the micro seismic interpretation and the largest single section error is 17 4 the average value of the error between the calculated fracture height of well b and the fracture height of micro seismic interpretation is 3 3 m the error of well b accounts for 9 5 of the average fracture height of the micro seismic interpretation and the maximum single section error is 23 0 according to the above figure in the process of multiple fractures fracturing the method of calculating fracture geometry by the multi fractures model is consistent with the interpretation of fracture geometry by micro seismic data 5 conclusion this paper proposed a model which can calculate the geometry of total fractures by matching the water hammer pressure signal compared with previous research the biggest improvement of our model is that it can be applied to the field environment of multiple fractures fracturing we propose a new model that can calculate the geometry of multiple fractures by stopping pumping water hammer pressure signal coupling the stress interference calculation method and the rci model the fracture geometry of each fracture can be calculated in above cases of the same set the values of r c and i the following results can be obtained 1 in contrast the length and width of fracture which is located at the middle of the fracturing stage are smaller than those far from the stage center 2 when the fracture spacing is constant and the number of fractures increases the average length and width of all fractures will decrease and the total length of the fracture network will increase but the rate of change of the fracture length and width with the number of fractures will gradually decrease 3 when the number of fractures is constant and the fracture spacing increases the average length of the fractures will increase but the rate of change of the fracture length and width with the fracture spacing will gradually decrease 4 the change of the fracture volume will directly affect the water hammer pressure signal the increase of the fracture volume means that it will cause higher water hammer pressure signal in addition by comparing the micro seismic data the average error of fracture half length and fracture width of well a is 6 5 and 5 5 and the average error of well b is 18 3 and 9 5 the fracture geometry calculated by our model is similar to the result explained by micro seismic credit authorship contribution

3134,the great lakes of north america are the largest unfrozen surface freshwater system in the world and many ecosystems industries and coastal processes are sensitive to the changes in their water levels the water levels of the great lakes are primarily governed by the net basin supplies nbs of each lake which are the sum of over lake precipitation and basin runoff minus lake evaporation recent studies projected the future nbs of the great lakes by dynamically downscaling general circulation models gcms using regional climate models rcms however their rcms had been coupled to one dimensional 1d lake column models which lack the ability to accurately simulate the great lakes hydrodynamics and thermal structure in this study an ensemble of three dynamical downscalings based on the great lakes atmosphere regional model glarm is used to project the future nbs and water level of the great lakes glarm is a three dimensional 3d regional climate modeling system for the great lakes region that two way couples an rcm to a 3d hydrodynamic lake and ice model making this the first study to use such an advanced model for water level projection of the great lakes for the present day climate over lake precipitation and lake evaporation simulated by glarm along with the basin runoff simulated by the glarm driven large basin runoff model lbrm track the mean seasonal cycle of the nbs components remarkably well in particular compared to previous studies the most significant improvements are made in estimating the lake evaporation for future hydroclimate the ensemble average projects an increase in annual nbs and average annual water level for each lake the projected nbs increase is mostly due to an increase in over lake precipitation and basin runoff combined with a relatively smaller increase in lake evaporation according to the ensemble average by 2040 2049 the average annual water levels of lake superior michigan huron and erie are projected to increase by 0 19 0 44 and 0 28 m respectively relative to 2010 2019 the individual downscaling cases highlight the uncertainty in climate projection showing both increases and decreases in annual nbs and water level projection the projected changes in the average annual water levels by 2040 2049 relative to 2010 2019 range from 0 01 to 0 32 m in lake superior 0 13 to 0 80 m in lake michigan huron and 0 09 to 0 54 m in lake erie data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the great lakes of north america superior michigan huron erie and ontario form the largest surface freshwater system in the world collectively they have a surface area of about 244 000 km2 and contain around 23 000 km3 of water which accounts for 18 of the world s freshwater supply u s environmental protection agency and government of canada 1995 the great lakes exert a significant influence on the regional climate especially on air temperature and precipitation due to their large size large thermal inertia low surface roughness and low albedo changnon and jones 1972 scott and huff 1996 notaro et al 2013 the large thermal inertia of the lakes decreases the variability of near surface air temperature and the amplitude of its diurnal seasonal and annual cycles scott and huff 1996 notaro et al 2013 the lakes also support greater atmospheric instability stability during the cold warm seasons which results in increased decreased sensible and latent heat fluxes lake evaporation convective clouds and precipitation scott and huff 1996 notaro et al 2013 in recent decades climate change has affected the great lakes basin with noticeable changes such as higher air temperatures and lake temperatures zhong et al 2016 decreased ice cover over the lakes wang et al 2012 increased over lake wind speeds desai et al 2009 and fluctuating water levels gronewold et al 2013 2016 2021 a substantial decrease in ice cover over the lakes due to warmer winters wang et al 2012 has strengthened the ice albedo feedback and has caused a rapid increase in the summertime water temperatures of the great lakes austin and colman 2007 decreased ice cover and warmer waters have also led to increased lake effect snowfall in specific areas of the great lakes region burnett et al 2003 kunkel et al 2009 water levels of the great lakes have fluctuated dramatically by more than 2 m over the past decades due to climate induced changes in the three major components of the lakes water budget over lake precipitation lake evaporation and basin runoff gronewold et al 2016 these three components are collectively referred to as the net basin supply nbs calculated as over lake precipitation plus basin runoff minus lake evaporation in the early 1970s and early 1980s an increase in precipitation led to water level rise while unusually high air and water surface temperatures during the late 1990s coincident with one of the strongest el nino events on record led to high lake evaporation low basin runoff and ultimately low water levels from 1998 to 2013 assel et al 2004 gronewold and stow 2014 after this period of low water levels a rapid decline in lake evaporation due to colder winters triggered a record setting water level rise in 2013 2014 and persistent above average precipitation further sustained the water level rise leading to record highs in 2019 2020 gronewold et al 2016 2021 such large fluctuations in water levels which are much more significant than that of marine systems have forced communities to adapt and have highlighted the need for incorporating climate change induced water level changes into water level management gronewold et al 2013 high water levels have led to severe flooding in the past gronewold and rood 2019 while low and fluctuating water levels affect hydropower production hartmann 1990 shlozberg et al 2014 and coastal bluff erosion theuerkauf et al 2019 krueger et al 2020 volpano et al 2020 therefore improving our understanding and projection of the great lakes water levels have been a priority for the great lakes scientific community in recent years sharma et al 2018 delaney and milner 2019 numerous studies have projected the water levels of the great lakes on a climate timescale by adopting a common and straightforward approach project the nbs i e project the three components of nbs and translate it into future water levels using a lake to lake routing model that incorporates inter lake flows with regulation rules logic such as the coordinated great lakes regulating and routing model cglrrm quinn 1978 clites and lee 1998 early studies e g croley 1990 chao 1999 mortsch et al 2000 lofgren et al 2002 angel and kunkel 2010 projected the basin runoff and lake evaporation by driving a pair of models from the great lakes environmental research laboratory glerl with future climate variables e g air temperature precipitation and wind speed that were created by perturbing historical data with the changes projected by general circulation models gcms the pair of glerl models consisted of the large basin runoff model lbrm to simulate future basin runoff and the large lake thermodynamic model lltm to simulate future lake evaporation the future over lake precipitation on the other hand was estimated by simply perturbing the historical over lake precipitation data with the changes projected by gcms these studies projected both increases and decreases in water levels with a high degree of uncertainty due to the coarse spatial resolution of the gcms lack of representation of the great lakes in the gcms and the one way coupling of gcms with lbrm and lltm that did not allow for any feedback mechanisms between the land lake processes and the atmosphere mackay and seglenieks 2013 furthermore the use of air temperature to calculate the potential evapotranspiration pet in lbrm was later found to violate the conservation of energy and consequently result in an unnaturally large future pet lofgren et al 2011 putting the basin runoff and water level projections from these gcm based studies into question it should be mentioned that this issue in lbrm has since been addressed with an update to the pet formula in the lbrm code to ensure the pet follows the clausius clapeyron relationship this modified version of lbrm is hereafter referred to as lbrm cc to mitigate the limitations and shortcomings of the early gcm based studies more recent studies e g mackay and seglenieks 2013 notaro et al 2015a opted to dynamically downscale gcms using regional climate models rcms to project the nbs components but similar to the gcm based studies these rcm based projections also showed some contradictory results due to the uncertainties in climate modeling mackay and seglenieks 2013 performed a cascading sequence of dynamical downscaling on environment canada s gcm cgcm3 and projected decreases in the great lakes water levels while notaro et al 2015a dynamically downscaled two different gcms using the same rcm and projected both increases and decreases in the water levels nevertheless rcms provided significant improvements over the use of gcms and glerl models partly because rcms have a much higher spatial resolution and were coupled to lake models that capture the influence of the great lakes on the local climate including lake induced phenomena such as lake effect storms by resolving lake atmosphere interactions mackay and seglenieks 2013 however to date the rcms used to project the future nbs on a climate timescale have been two way coupled to one dimensional 1d lake column models 1d lake models have been shown to produce large biases in lake surface temperature lst ice cover and thermal structure due to their inability to resolve three dimensional 3d lake circulation and the associated turbulent mixing processes bennington et al 2014 these biases lead to higher uncertainties in the projected precipitation notaro et al 2015b shi and xue 2019 and lake evaporation notaro et al 2015a xue et al 2017 2022 and undermine the credibility of the nbs projections thus multiple studies e g bennington et al 2014 notaro et al 2015a notaro et al 2015b sharma et al 2018 have highlighted the two way coupling of rcms to 3d lake models to properly resolve the complex dynamics and lake atmosphere interaction of the great lakes as a necessary step to ultimately improve the long term water level projections 3d lake models have been developed for the great lakes but until recently extremely limited progress was made in terms of two way coupling them to rcms sharma et al 2018 xue et al 2022 xue et al 2017 were the first to two way couple an rcm the international center for theoretical physics ictp regional climate model version 4 regcm4 giorgi et al 2012 with a 3d hydrodynamic lake and ice model based on the finite volume coastal ocean model fvcom chen et al 2006 2013 their coupled system called the great lakes atmosphere regional model glarm showed significant improvements over the rcms coupled to built in 1d lake and ice models in simulating the great lakes ice and thermal structure sun et al 2020 likewise demonstrated the benefits of a 3d hydrodynamic model by two way coupling the climate weather research and forecasting cwrf rcm to an fvcom based 3d lake and ice model they also simulated the historical water levels of the great lakes by using cwrf fvcom to calculate the historical nbs and running the nbs through a stage fall discharge equation within the fvcom model however they made no efforts in projecting the future water level changes of the great lakes durnford et al 2018 developed an operational water level forecasting system for the great lakes by two way coupling an rcm with a 3d lake model but their forecasts were on a 7 day short term timescale with data assimilation in fact at the time of writing this paper no study has projected the water levels of the great lakes on a climate timescale by utilizing an rcm with a two way coupled 3d lake model therefore the primary goal of this study is to use a two way coupled 3d regional climate modeling system glarm in conjunction with lbrm and cglrrm to better resolve land lake atmosphere interactive processes and project the water level changes of the great lakes on a climate timescale here three gcms from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 are dynamically downscaled using glarm for the early twenty first 2000 2019 and mid twenty first 2030 2049 centuries under the representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 scenario the changes in the nbs components by the mid twenty first century i e the modeled changes between the early and mid twenty first century in glarm and lbrm simulations are applied to the observed early twenty first century nbs to derive the future nbs which is then used to drive cglrrm to project the mid twenty first century water levels 2 methodology 2 1 models 2 1 1 great lakes atmosphere regional model glarm glarm xue et al 2017 is a regional climate modeling system for the great lakes that two way couples regcm4 and an fvcom based 3d hydrodynamic lake and ice model it has been recently updated to glarm version 2 xue et al 2022 which is the version used in this study regcm4 is a 3d hydrostatic compressible σ coordinate regional climate model whose atmospheric dynamics and radiative transfer scheme are based on the hydrostatic version of the pennsylvania state university national center for atmospheric research ncar mesoscale model mm5 grell et al 1994 and ncar community climate model version 3 ccm3 kiehl et al 1996 respectively regcm4 has several improvements over its older version regcm3 such as multiple schemes for representing cumulus convection planetary boundary layer processes and land surface processes giorgi et al 2012 here the cumulus convection is represented using the grell parametrization grell 1993 grell et al 1994 and the planetary boundary layer processes are described using the holtslag et al 1990 scheme the version of regcm4 in glarm is based on wang et al 2016 so the land surface processes are described using the community land model version 4 clm4 the spatial modeling domain of glarm fig 1 encompasses the great lakes basin along with parts of the midwest and northeast regions of the us and the ontario and quebec provinces of canada the regcm4 module in glarm covers this modeling domain with 18 km spaced grids and 18 vertical sigma layers the 3d hydrodynamic model in glarm is based on fvcom a prognostic free surface 3d primitive equation coastal ocean circulation model that is numerically solved over an unstructured grid using the finite volume method chen et al 2006 2013 xue et al 2020 the ice water interaction processes are simulated by a computationally efficient version of the los alamos community ice code cice within the fvcom framework xue et al 2017 the horizontal resolution of the hydrodynamic model ranges from 1 to 2 km near the coast to 2 4 km

coupler craig et al 2017 2 1 2 large basin runoff model clausius clapeyron lbrm cc lbrm developed by glerl is a physically based conceptual model that utilizes an interdependent tank cascade model to simulate basin runoff from all 121 subbasins of the great lakes croley 1983a 1983b the model represents the land as a cascade of four layers upper soil zone lower soil zone groundwater storage and surface storage and describes the flows within these layers using the linear reservoir concept the basin runoff along with all fluxes between the layers including evaporation and evapotranspiration is calculated by solving a set of one dimensional mass continuity equations lbrm requires limited input data which is quite useful for working within the great lakes basin where observational data are sparse croley 2002 lbrm has been successfully calibrated and used by multiple studies for simulating the historical basin runoff within the great lakes region e g croley 2002 anderson et al 2010 gaborit et al 2016 additionally as mentioned in section 1 the lbrm code has been revised to improve its performance in future basin runoff projection and climate change studies by incorporating the clausius clapeyron relationship cc the inputs to lbrm cc aside from the calibrated parameters hunter personal communication 2020 are the daily precipitation and daily minimum and maximum air temperature over a subbasin these daily inputs for the historical and future simulations are obtained directly from glarm 2 1 3 coordinated great lakes regulation and routing model cglrrm cglrrm is a hydrologic routing model developed by the coordinating committee for great lakes basic hydraulic and hydrologic data hereafter referred to as the coordinating committee that uses nbs to compute the water levels and the flows in the connecting channels for lake superior michigan huron st clair erie and ontario besides nbs it also considers the major diversions in the great lakes like the ogoki and long lac diversion the chicago diversion and the welland canal the model consists of three linked modules the lake superior module the middle lakes module and the lake ontario module the lake superior module computes the water level and outflow via the st mary s river of lake superior under the pre project relationship the plan 1977 a regulation plan and the plan 2012 regulation plan in this study the 1977 a regulation plan was used as it required the fewest initial conditions and performs very similarly to plan 2012 the middle lakes module initially developed by quinn 1978 and clites and lee 1998 computes the water level and the outflow of the middle lakes michigan huron st clair and erie since the middle lakes outflows via their connecting channels st clair river detroit river and niagara river are all unregulated and interdependent the module calculates the water levels and outflows using continuity equations and stage fall discharge relationships lastly the lake ontario module computes the water level and outflow of lake ontario however at the time of this study this module was not operational so the water levels of lake ontario are not projected in this study 2 2 dynamical downscaling in this study three cmip5 gcms are dynamically downscaled using glarm namely giss e2 h ipsl cm5a hr and mpi esm mr these three gcms were chosen due to their high reliability factor when simulating the mean surface air temperature over north america under the reliability ensemble averaging rea method as shown by xue et al 2022 the downscalings are performed for the early twenty first 2000 2019 and mid twenty first 2030 2049 centuries under the rcp 8 5 scenario rcp 8 5 was chosen because out of all the rcp scenarios its total co2 emission for 2005 2020 is the closest within 1 to the observed total emission schwalm et al 2020 it is the most suitable pathway for assessing the impact of climate change by 2050 under the current and stated policies schwalm et al 2020 rcp 8 5 has the highest greenhouse gas emission within the rcp set leading to an additional radiative forcing greater than 8 5 w m2 by 2100 moss et al 2010 riahi et al 2011 hereafter giss ipsl and mpi refer to giss e2 h ipsl cm5a hr and mpi esm mr respectively while giss gl ipsl gl and mpi gl refer to their downscaled simulations using glarm additionally the mean of these three downscaling cases is hereafter referred to as the ensemble average 2 3 developing nbs and water level projections glarm estimating over lake precipitation and evaporation and lbrm estimating basin runoff simulate the nbs components for both the early twenty first century and mid twenty first century the future nbs could have directly been used as an input to cglrrm to estimate the future water level change however driving cglrrm directly with the future nbs would introduce the inherent biases in glarm and lbrm projections into the water level estimation one common way to minimize the introduction of bias is to estimate the future nbs based on the observed historical nbs and the model projected changes in the nbs components i e the difference between the mid and early twenty first century simulations the following paragraphs describe the specific procedure that was developed to calculate 1 the projected changes in the nbs components and 2 the future nbs the procedure to calculate the projected changes is the same for each nbs component so x is hereafter used to denote the three nbs components over lake precipitation lake evaporation and basin runoff first the monthly climatology mean and standard deviation of x for historical x m his and σ x m his and future simulations x m fut and σ x m fut were calculated then the monthly climatology mean and the standard deviation of the projected changes between the future and present day climate in x δ x m and σ δ x m were calculated based on equation 1 and equation 2 respectively 1 δ x m x m fut x m his m 1 t o 12 2 σ δ x m σ x m

climatology mean of the projected changes in x for month m σ δ x m standard deviation of the projected changes in x for month m next a 20 member ensemble was randomly generated where every member was a 20 yr monthly time series of the projected changes in x each time series was generated by randomly drawing 20 values from the normal distribution n δ x m σ δ x m for each month m additionally to avoid large changes in x the time series was constrained to contain the changes within 1 σ δ x m these aforementioned steps were performed for each nbs component to obtain a 20 member ensemble for each nbs component the ensembles of each nbs component were then combined to produce a 20 member ensemble of projected changes in nbs equation 3 finally an ensemble of future nbs time series was created by applying the projected nbs changes to the observed historical nbs from the coordinating committee equation 4 this ensemble of future nbs was used to drive cglrrm to produce a 20 member ensemble of mid twenty first century water levels the historical nbs from the coordinating committee is termed as residual nbs nbs res as it is inferred as a residual term between the observed water level of the great lakes the inter lake flows and the flow in the major great lakes diversions this is considered as the most accurate estimate of historical nbs the coordinating committee s nbs data are coordinated by the us army corps of engineers usace and environment and climate change canada eccc although data from 2009 onward remain provisional at the time of the writing of this paper 3 δ

of the projected mid twenty first century nbs this entire procedure visually represented in fig 2 was repeatedly performed for each of the five lakes and each of the three downscaling cases the projected water level changes were derived by comparing the projected future water levels with the early twenty first century water levels which were simulated by forcing cglrrm with the early twenty first century residual nbs note that although we only used the projected changes in nbs components rather than directly using the projected future nbs component values we conducted a detailed validation section 3 1 of the glarm and lbrm performances in simulating the present day nbs components to provide confidence in our projected changes the projected changes in the nbs components nbs and water levels presented in this paper are the average of the 20 member ensemble additionally for the water level projections the simulation period is 2040 2049 as the first 10 years of the simulation 2030 2039 is used as a spin up time for cglrrm to ensure the model results are not affected by the model initialization section 3 2 3 results 3 1 evaluation of the simulated historical nbs and its components the estimates from the great lakes hydrometeorological database glerl hmd hunter et al 2015 maintained by glerl are used to evaluate glarm s performance in simulating the historical mean seasonal cycles of the nbs components fig 3 glerl hmd is a monthly hydrometeorological database that provides historical estimates for all the major components of the great lakes water budget including the three nbs components the over lake precipitation and basin runoff estimates are derived almost exclusively from land based station measurements whereas the lake evaporation estimates are produced directly from lltm simulations hunter et al 2015 it should be noted that due to sparse land based stations in some regions and the lack of lake based stations in the great lakes there are biases and uncertainties in the glerl hmd estimates hunter et al 2015 so although it is the most comprehensive dataset for the great lakes water budget components we should be mindful of its potential biases when comparing it to the glarm simulations the ensemble average of glarm s over lake precipitation has a good agreement with glerl hmd in terms of the seasonality and magnitude it captures the diminished winter precipitation and rising spring precipitation reasonably well a comparison between glerl hmd and the glarm ensemble average shows that the mean monthly over lake precipitation from the ensemble average is larger by 8 10 and 9 mm 10 for lake michigan huron and erie respectively and smaller by only 0 2 0 3 and 3 mm 3 for lake superior and ontario respectively these results are particularly encouraging considering that the lateral boundary conditions lbcs for the dynamical downscalings are from gcms instead of reanalysis data this provides us with confidence regarding our selection of gcms furthermore the ensemble simulation represents uncertainties in climate modeling which are partly inherited from the driving gcms in downscaling the individual downscaling cases span a wide range of values with mpi gl and giss gl producing the largest and smallest estimates of mean monthly over lake precipitation respectively relative to the ensemble average the mean monthly estimates from mpi gl are larger by up to 40 in lake erie while the mean monthly estimates from giss gl are smaller by up to 49 in lake erie the lake evaporation from glarm is very consistent and all three downscaling cases closely follow the seasonality and magnitude of glerl hmd fig 3 second column compared to precipitation glarm s evaporation is affected to a lesser extent by the lbcs from gcms the evaporation minima during spring and early summer and maxima during the late fall and winter are well captured by glarm noticeable discrepancies in evaporation between the glarm ensemble average and glerl hmd are mostly limited to lake superior and erie only the ensemble average simulates smaller evaporation during september march and october december in lake superior and erie respectively overall compared to glerl hmd the mean monthly lake evaporation from the ensemble average is smaller by 13 24 0 1 0 3 1 1 and 3 mm 6 for lake superior michigan huron erie and ontario respectively more importantly upon comparing glarm s historical evaporation with those simulated by rcms that were coupled to 1d lake models in notaro et al 2015a music et al 2015 and mailhot et al 2019 it is evident that glarm reproduces historical lake evaporation significantly better the rcm based evaporation presented in those three studies exhibited larger monthly biases and early seasonal peaks due to their rudimentary derivation of lake surface conditions via gcm lake ocean grids or 1d lake models see fig 6 in notaro et al 2015a fig 2 in music et al 2015 and fig 2 in mailhot et al 2019 this again highlights the importance and advantage of two way coupling an rcm with a 3d lake model with respect to the basin runoff validation the glarm driven lbrm cc ensemble average also reproduces the seasonality of monthly basin runoff very well fig 3 third column the timings of the peaks are well captured in all lakes while the most noticeable discrepancy is that the lbmr cc slightly underestimates the winter runoff and overestimates the snowmelt fed spring peak and summer decline particularly for lake michigan huron and erie compared to glerl hmd the mean monthly basin runoff from the ensemble average is larger by 6 12 13 19 and 21 mm 26 for lake superior michigan huron and erie respectively and smaller by 12 mm 7 for lake ontario again similar to over lake precipitation the individual downscaling cases illustrate the inherent uncertainties in climate impact modeling by spanning a wide range of values for basin runoff mpi gl giss gl produces the largest smallest mean monthly basin runoff primarily due to its larger smaller estimate for over land precipitation which is consistent with its large small estimate for over lake precipitation the last column of fig 3 compares the simulated nbs which is calculated by combining the simulated nbs components with the residual nbs from the coordinating committee the ensemble average reasonably captures the magnitude and seasonality of nbs because each nbs component is already well reproduced by the ensemble average the nbs peak during spring and the subsided period during late summer and early fall are closely tracked by the ensemble average albeit with a slightly higher magnitude for lake michigan huron and erie due to the larger simulated basin runoff compared to the coordinating committee the mean monthly nbs from glarm is larger by 18 34 37 and 18 mm for lake superior michigan huron erie and ontario respectively since nbs is the combination of its components the simulated nbs also reflects the differences between individual downscaling cases for example since mpi gl giss gl estimates the largest smallest over lake precipitation and basin runoff it estimates the largest smallest mean monthly nbs as well overall the ensemble average reproduces the historical nbs and its three components remarkably well and justifies our selection of gcms and the use of glarm for future climate projections 3 2 assessing the impact of nbs biases on the long term projection of water level change the validation results show that the model performs well in simulating the climatological monthly values of over lake precipitation lake evaporation basin runoff and nbs however even though the biases are small in the climatological comparisons one important question is whether and to which extent these biases can accumulate over time and result in the long term projection drifting away from the true state over several decades especially in the context of climate change impacts in this section we address this question with a set of cglrrm simulations and quantify the cumulative impact of these so called chronic biases on the long term water level projection four cglrrm simulations were performed to examine the error accumulation in simulated water levels over time each simulation was driven by an nbs time series 1950 2019 with a perturbation where the perturbations represented the levels of climatological biases the perturbed nbs time series were created by applying four constant perturbations to the observed residual nbs time series of each lake 10 10 20 and 20 of the 1950 2019 nbs average the four cglrrm simulations are hereafter referred to as the perturbed runs a fifth run in which cglrrm is driven by the observed residual nbs was also performed and is hereafter referred to as the unperturbed run by comparing the perturbed runs with the unperturbed run over a 70 year simulation we examine whether the nbs biases quantified at the climatological level would accumulate over time in the long term water level projection fig 4 shows the results from the perturbed and unperturbed runs for lake michigan huron the other lakes produce similar results it is evident from the lower panel of fig 4 that the perturbation in nbs result in a bias in the water level however note that the biases increase in a quasi linear fashion only for the first five years and eventually transition to an asymptote where the bias level nearly reaches an equilibrium after the first 10 years in other words the errors in the water levels from the perturbed runs do not continue to grow with time after the first decade it shows that the lake system has a memory of 10 years it takes 10 years for the lakes to adjust to nbs changes through changes in inter lake flows to reach a new equilibrium state that is to say it is appropriate to use the climatological error after the model spinup of the first decade to represent the level of climate projection s uncertainty more importantly the relative evolution in water level in all these simulations remains similar this is quantified in table 1 which for example shows that the difference between the january water level of 2000 and 2019 from the perturbed runs is similar to the difference from the unperturbed run the relative magnitude of water levels between two periods is more or less conserved after the first decade so since the first decade of water level is already ignored for this study described in section 2 3 the projected future water level changes from this study do not suffer from increasing errors uncertainties that we were concerned of being amplified due to the climatological biases in nbs 3 3 projected changes in nbs and its components the projected annual and monthly changes in nbs and its components are shown in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively the ensemble average projects an increase in annual over lake precipitation for all the lakes 55 54 66 and 27 mm for lake superior michigan huron erie and ontario respectively by the mid twenty first century relative to the early twenty first century the biggest increases are projected for may september with decreases or minimal changes projected for december march although the ensemble average projects an increase in annual over lake precipitation there is a large variability among the individual downscaling cases the projections from the three downscaling cases range from 28 to 72 mm in lake superior 11 to 92 mm in lake michigan huron 4 to 138 mm in lake erie and 25 to 64 mm in lake ontario thus illustrating the uncertainty in future climate projections ipsl gl is the only downscaling case to project either decreases or the smallest increase in annual precipitation over the lakes such contrasting projections show that in addition to affecting historical simulations as shown in the validation section 3 1 the driving gcm also affects the future changes similar to over lake precipitation the ensemble average projects an increase in annual basin runoff for all the lakes and the individual downscaling cases project both increases and decreases the ensemble average projects annual runoff increases of 31 68 72 and 80 mm for lake superior michigan huron erie and ontario respectively the biggest projected increases such as 187 mm from giss gl for lake ontario are primarily due to the large projected increases in over land precipitation the projected decreases on the other hand are projected solely by ipsl gl and are a result of a warmer and drier future climate the projections from the three downscaling cases range from 21 to 59 mm in lake superior 17 to 125 mm in lake michigan huron 15 to 179 mm in lake erie and 54 to 187 mm in lake ontario as for the monthly changes basin runoff is projected to increase in winter and early spring due to the increased snowmelt and precipitation and decrease in late spring due to the reduced snowpack following the increased snowmelt compared to the over lake precipitation and basin runoff changes the projected changes in annual lake evaporation are smaller in magnitude lake superior s annual evaporation is projected to undergo the smallest changes with ipsl gl projecting a decrease in annual evaporation in all the remaining lakes all three downscaling cases project increases in annual evaporation the changes projected by the ensemble average for the annual evaporation in lake superior michigan huron erie and ontario are 8 30 31 and 38 mm respectively evaporation is projected to increase during spring and summer with minimal changes during fall and winter except in lake superior where there is a clear decrease in evaporation during fall and early winter compared to over lake precipitation and basin runoff the evaporation projections from the individual downscaling cases for a particular lake span a smaller range this is consistent with the validation efforts for evaporation shown in fig 3 the projections from the three downscaling cases range from 11 to 26 mm in lake superior 21 to 37 mm in lake michigan huron 24 to 42 mm in lake erie and 28 to 58 mm in lake ontario as for the nbs the ensemble average projects an increase in annual nbs for all the lakes since for most downscaling cases the projected changes in the nbs components create an influx of water into the lake the ensemble average projects the annual nbs to increase by 79 92 107 and 69 mm in lake superior michigan huron erie and ontario respectively peaks in nbs increases are scattered throughout the year with most of them coinciding unsurprisingly with the peaks in the projected over lake precipitation and basin runoff increases peaks in the projected nbs increases are most common during may and september while november and december usually exhibit decreases or relatively minimal changes in nbs the projected changes in annual nbs from the three downscaling cases range from 18 to 119 mm in lake superior 49 to 175 mm in lake michigan huron 43 to 276 mm in lake erie and 109 to 192 mm in lake ontario ipsl gl is the only downscaling case to project a decrease in nbs mainly due to the projected decrease in precipitation and basin runoff 3 4 projected changes in water level the ensemble average projects an increase in average annual water level for all the lakes 0 19 0 44 and 0 28 m for lake superior michigan huron and erie respectively fig 7 and figure s1 from the individual downscaling cases the projections range from 0 01 to 0 32 m in lake superior 0 13 to 0 80 m in lake michigan huron and 0 09 to 0 54 m in lake erie the projected increases are significantly larger than the projected decreases hence the positive ensemble average additionally no major changes are projected for the seasonality of the water levels changes in nbs are the primary drivers behind water level changes however since the great lakes are connected by rivers whose flows are mainly governed by the hydraulic head the water level of a lake is also affected by the water level changes in the upstream and downstream lakes so the projected changes in water levels reflect the projected changes in nbs as well as the projected water level changes in the upstream and downstream lakes for example even though ipsl gl projects an increase in lake superior s nbs the water level in lake superior decreases because the projected decrease in lake michigan huron s water level increases the outflow of water from lake superior through st mary s river therefore the water level change of a particular lake is not an exact reflection of the lake s nbs change rather it is a reflection of the nbs changes across the whole great lakes system 4 discussion 4 1 importance of a two way coupled 3d lake model in simulating nbs xue et al 2017 conclusively presented evidence of glarm s superiority over rcm coupled with 1d lake model systems in simulating the thermal structure surface water fluxes e g precipitation and evaporation and ice coverage of the great lakes the exceptional historical simulation of nbs and its components by glarm presented in section 3 1 further supports xue et al 2017 s conclusion the accuracy of lake evaporation which is the nbs component that is most affected by the lake modeling has been significantly improved by glarm when compared to the previous studies e g music et al 2015 notaro et al 2015a mailhot et al 2019 which used 1 d lake models to represent the great lakes lake evaporation was clearly impacted by their simplified lake model since in their validation their simulated evaporation had an almost different climatology pattern to the observation as discussed in section 3 1 the ensemble averages of the historical nbs presented in this study are also better than those from the aforementioned studies due to the much improved evaporation additionally xue et al 2022 recently showcased glarm s ability to significantly improve the driving gcm s air temperature precipitation lst and ice cover for the great lakes therefore glarm by properly representing the complexity of hydrodynamics and lake atmosphere interaction contributes to a more advanced modeling framework necessary for improving the great lakes hydroclimate projections this is particularly evident through the markedly improved simulation of one nbs component lake evaporation 4 2 comparison of nbs and water level projection with previous studies the range of the projected nbs and water level changes from this and previous studies are shown in fig 8 upon comparison the early gcm based studies of croley 1990 hartmann 1990 lofgren et al 2002 and angel and kunkel 2010 projected significant decreases in nbs and water levels partly due to the faulty lbrm that projected larger increases in evapotranspiration and subsequently larger decreases in basin runoff gcm s inability to capture the moisture recycling within the great lakes i e evaporated water returning to the lake as over lake precipitation or basin runoff also contributed to the large projected decreases in nbs and water levels mackay and seglenieks 2013 rcm based studies including this one do not project drastic decreases in nbs and water level due to the projected increase in over lake precipitation and basin runoff while the nbs and water level increases projected by our ensemble average are closer to the increases projected by the rcm based studies the upper bound of our projected water level increases is in fact closer to the increases projected by the gcm based study of angel and kunkel 2010 it should be noted that all these previous studies considered different time periods and emission scenarios for their projections but a comparison is nevertheless useful as it illustrates the challenges and uncertainties in projecting the water level of the great lakes these comparisons also suggest that as there are many methodological differences and associated sources of errors and uncertainties that may be accumulated or offset in all these studies it is difficult to assert that the current study has the most accurate projection of the water level change however we highlight that the current study does provide the more appropriate and the most advanced modeling framework which is a critical step towards a better understanding and projection of the great lakes water level changes also a future rise rather than a decline of the great lakes water levels is more likely based on the most up to date climate projection 4 3 challenges in water level projection this paper marks one of the more notable advances in water level projection of the great lakes by using a two way coupled rcm and 3d lake model to project nbs however apart from the mostly unavoidable uncertainties in future climate modeling which giorgi 2010 calls the intrinsic uncertainties those related to future climate policies and internal variability in climate there are some limitations stemming from our applied models that could be addressed in future complementary studies one focus of future studies should be developing water level projections using a two way coupled land lake atmosphere modeling system that can more accurately represent the complete hydrological cycle of the great lakes the modeling framework used in this study is also a land lake atmosphere coupled modeling system but the basin runoff and inter lake flows water levels in this study were simulated offline using lbrm cc and cglrrm respectively an integrated two way coupled land lake atmosphere modeling system with a more advanced representation of land hydrology processes would provide a better estimation of basin runoff in the great lakes for example the direct contribution of groundwater to the great lakes is considered to be negligible in magnitude when compared to the nbs components and therefore was ignored or lumped into the error term in almost all studies relating to the great lakes water budget lee 1992 lenters 2001 2004 fortin and gronewold 2012 however groundwater has a big impact on basin runoff and therefore has a significant indirect contribution to the lakes water balance lbrm cc has a simplified representation of land surface processes as described in section 2 1 2 in addition although lbrm cc considers the contribution of groundwater to basin runoff it does not account for the lateral exchange of groundwater between subbasins using a modeling system that resolves land atmosphere interaction and vertical lateral movement of surface and subsurface water to calculate basin runoff would be an improvement upon this study a modeling system like the ncar weather research forecasting wrf hydrological modeling system wrf hydro gochis et al 2020 is a possible future substitute for lbrm cc the integration of wrf hydro into glarm would offer a more realistic representation of land surface processes on both temporal and spatial scales which has a profound impact on the soil thermal and moisture states surface energy fluxes and consequently on the entire coupled land lake atmosphere processes future studies can also complement this study by downscaling a larger and more advanced ensemble of gcms the gcms for this study were chosen from cmip5 based on the rea method so gcms from the latest phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 along with other gcm ensembles and selection methods that have been prescribed for use in the great lakes region delaney and milner 2019 can help improve upon this study the use of new integrated modeling systems and a larger ensemble of projections will help improve our understanding of the role of climate change in great lakes water levels and ultimately help water resource managers better prepare for the future 5 summary the changes in the great lakes nbs components nbs and water levels by the mid twenty first century relative to the early twenty first century are projected using an ensemble of three glarm based dynamical downscalings unlike the widely used rcms that are two way coupled to 1d lake models glarm two way couples the regcm4 rcm to an fvcom based 3d lake model the modeling system reproduces the present day nbs remarkably well with a significantly improved simulation accuracy of lake evaporation reinforcing the importance of this new modeling system for hydroclimate simulation the ensemble average of the simulated nbs and its components closely follow the estimates from glerl hmd and the coordinating committee with the span of individual downscaling cases representing the uncertainty present in gcms for future hydroclimate the ensemble average projects an increase in annual nbs and average annual water level for each lake increases in over lake precipitation are projected in may september with minimal changes during winter while increases in basin runoff are the most significant during the winter and early spring due to increased snowmelt as for annual lake evaporation compared to over lake precipitation and basin runoff the ensemble average projects relatively smaller increases with slight increases for spring and summer followed by decreases or minimal increases during the fall and winter months the projected changes in the nbs components result in an increase in the average annual water level according to the ensemble average by 2040 2049 the average annual water levels of lake superior michigan huron and erie are projected to increase by 0 19 0 44 and 0 28 m respectively relative to 2010 2019 the individual downscaling cases highlight the uncertainty in climate projection showing both increases and decreases in annual nbs and average annual water level projection for giss gl and mpi gl the projected changes in the nbs components result in an increase in average annual water level by 2040 2049 relative to 2010 2019 however ipsl gl project decreases in average annual water level thus leading to projections ranging from 0 01 to 0 32 m in lake superior 0 13 to 0 80 m in lake michigan huron and 0 09 to 0 54 m in lake erie water level projections highlight the complexity of the great lakes hydroclimate system and the need for an integrated modeling framework as a critical element toward better understanding and projections of the great lakes water levels credit authorship contribution statement miraj b kayastha data curation formal analysis investigation methodology

3134,the great lakes of north america are the largest unfrozen surface freshwater system in the world and many ecosystems industries and coastal processes are sensitive to the changes in their water levels the water levels of the great lakes are primarily governed by the net basin supplies nbs of each lake which are the sum of over lake precipitation and basin runoff minus lake evaporation recent studies projected the future nbs of the great lakes by dynamically downscaling general circulation models gcms using regional climate models rcms however their rcms had been coupled to one dimensional 1d lake column models which lack the ability to accurately simulate the great lakes hydrodynamics and thermal structure in this study an ensemble of three dynamical downscalings based on the great lakes atmosphere regional model glarm is used to project the future nbs and water level of the great lakes glarm is a three dimensional 3d regional climate modeling system for the great lakes region that two way couples an rcm to a 3d hydrodynamic lake and ice model making this the first study to use such an advanced model for water level projection of the great lakes for the present day climate over lake precipitation and lake evaporation simulated by glarm along with the basin runoff simulated by the glarm driven large basin runoff model lbrm track the mean seasonal cycle of the nbs components remarkably well in particular compared to previous studies the most significant improvements are made in estimating the lake evaporation for future hydroclimate the ensemble average projects an increase in annual nbs and average annual water level for each lake the projected nbs increase is mostly due to an increase in over lake precipitation and basin runoff combined with a relatively smaller increase in lake evaporation according to the ensemble average by 2040 2049 the average annual water levels of lake superior michigan huron and erie are projected to increase by 0 19 0 44 and 0 28 m respectively relative to 2010 2019 the individual downscaling cases highlight the uncertainty in climate projection showing both increases and decreases in annual nbs and water level projection the projected changes in the average annual water levels by 2040 2049 relative to 2010 2019 range from 0 01 to 0 32 m in lake superior 0 13 to 0 80 m in lake michigan huron and 0 09 to 0 54 m in lake erie data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the great lakes of north america superior michigan huron erie and ontario form the largest surface freshwater system in the world collectively they have a surface area of about 244 000 km2 and contain around 23 000 km3 of water which accounts for 18 of the world s freshwater supply u s environmental protection agency and government of canada 1995 the great lakes exert a significant influence on the regional climate especially on air temperature and precipitation due to their large size large thermal inertia low surface roughness and low albedo changnon and jones 1972 scott and huff 1996 notaro et al 2013 the large thermal inertia of the lakes decreases the variability of near surface air temperature and the amplitude of its diurnal seasonal and annual cycles scott and huff 1996 notaro et al 2013 the lakes also support greater atmospheric instability stability during the cold warm seasons which results in increased decreased sensible and latent heat fluxes lake evaporation convective clouds and precipitation scott and huff 1996 notaro et al 2013 in recent decades climate change has affected the great lakes basin with noticeable changes such as higher air temperatures and lake temperatures zhong et al 2016 decreased ice cover over the lakes wang et al 2012 increased over lake wind speeds desai et al 2009 and fluctuating water levels gronewold et al 2013 2016 2021 a substantial decrease in ice cover over the lakes due to warmer winters wang et al 2012 has strengthened the ice albedo feedback and has caused a rapid increase in the summertime water temperatures of the great lakes austin and colman 2007 decreased ice cover and warmer waters have also led to increased lake effect snowfall in specific areas of the great lakes region burnett et al 2003 kunkel et al 2009 water levels of the great lakes have fluctuated dramatically by more than 2 m over the past decades due to climate induced changes in the three major components of the lakes water budget over lake precipitation lake evaporation and basin runoff gronewold et al 2016 these three components are collectively referred to as the net basin supply nbs calculated as over lake precipitation plus basin runoff minus lake evaporation in the early 1970s and early 1980s an increase in precipitation led to water level rise while unusually high air and water surface temperatures during the late 1990s coincident with one of the strongest el nino events on record led to high lake evaporation low basin runoff and ultimately low water levels from 1998 to 2013 assel et al 2004 gronewold and stow 2014 after this period of low water levels a rapid decline in lake evaporation due to colder winters triggered a record setting water level rise in 2013 2014 and persistent above average precipitation further sustained the water level rise leading to record highs in 2019 2020 gronewold et al 2016 2021 such large fluctuations in water levels which are much more significant than that of marine systems have forced communities to adapt and have highlighted the need for incorporating climate change induced water level changes into water level management gronewold et al 2013 high water levels have led to severe flooding in the past gronewold and rood 2019 while low and fluctuating water levels affect hydropower production hartmann 1990 shlozberg et al 2014 and coastal bluff erosion theuerkauf et al 2019 krueger et al 2020 volpano et al 2020 therefore improving our understanding and projection of the great lakes water levels have been a priority for the great lakes scientific community in recent years sharma et al 2018 delaney and milner 2019 numerous studies have projected the water levels of the great lakes on a climate timescale by adopting a common and straightforward approach project the nbs i e project the three components of nbs and translate it into future water levels using a lake to lake routing model that incorporates inter lake flows with regulation rules logic such as the coordinated great lakes regulating and routing model cglrrm quinn 1978 clites and lee 1998 early studies e g croley 1990 chao 1999 mortsch et al 2000 lofgren et al 2002 angel and kunkel 2010 projected the basin runoff and lake evaporation by driving a pair of models from the great lakes environmental research laboratory glerl with future climate variables e g air temperature precipitation and wind speed that were created by perturbing historical data with the changes projected by general circulation models gcms the pair of glerl models consisted of the large basin runoff model lbrm to simulate future basin runoff and the large lake thermodynamic model lltm to simulate future lake evaporation the future over lake precipitation on the other hand was estimated by simply perturbing the historical over lake precipitation data with the changes projected by gcms these studies projected both increases and decreases in water levels with a high degree of uncertainty due to the coarse spatial resolution of the gcms lack of representation of the great lakes in the gcms and the one way coupling of gcms with lbrm and lltm that did not allow for any feedback mechanisms between the land lake processes and the atmosphere mackay and seglenieks 2013 furthermore the use of air temperature to calculate the potential evapotranspiration pet in lbrm was later found to violate the conservation of energy and consequently result in an unnaturally large future pet lofgren et al 2011 putting the basin runoff and water level projections from these gcm based studies into question it should be mentioned that this issue in lbrm has since been addressed with an update to the pet formula in the lbrm code to ensure the pet follows the clausius clapeyron relationship this modified version of lbrm is hereafter referred to as lbrm cc to mitigate the limitations and shortcomings of the early gcm based studies more recent studies e g mackay and seglenieks 2013 notaro et al 2015a opted to dynamically downscale gcms using regional climate models rcms to project the nbs components but similar to the gcm based studies these rcm based projections also showed some contradictory results due to the uncertainties in climate modeling mackay and seglenieks 2013 performed a cascading sequence of dynamical downscaling on environment canada s gcm cgcm3 and projected decreases in the great lakes water levels while notaro et al 2015a dynamically downscaled two different gcms using the same rcm and projected both increases and decreases in the water levels nevertheless rcms provided significant improvements over the use of gcms and glerl models partly because rcms have a much higher spatial resolution and were coupled to lake models that capture the influence of the great lakes on the local climate including lake induced phenomena such as lake effect storms by resolving lake atmosphere interactions mackay and seglenieks 2013 however to date the rcms used to project the future nbs on a climate timescale have been two way coupled to one dimensional 1d lake column models 1d lake models have been shown to produce large biases in lake surface temperature lst ice cover and thermal structure due to their inability to resolve three dimensional 3d lake circulation and the associated turbulent mixing processes bennington et al 2014 these biases lead to higher uncertainties in the projected precipitation notaro et al 2015b shi and xue 2019 and lake evaporation notaro et al 2015a xue et al 2017 2022 and undermine the credibility of the nbs projections thus multiple studies e g bennington et al 2014 notaro et al 2015a notaro et al 2015b sharma et al 2018 have highlighted the two way coupling of rcms to 3d lake models to properly resolve the complex dynamics and lake atmosphere interaction of the great lakes as a necessary step to ultimately improve the long term water level projections 3d lake models have been developed for the great lakes but until recently extremely limited progress was made in terms of two way coupling them to rcms sharma et al 2018 xue et al 2022 xue et al 2017 were the first to two way couple an rcm the international center for theoretical physics ictp regional climate model version 4 regcm4 giorgi et al 2012 with a 3d hydrodynamic lake and ice model based on the finite volume coastal ocean model fvcom chen et al 2006 2013 their coupled system called the great lakes atmosphere regional model glarm showed significant improvements over the rcms coupled to built in 1d lake and ice models in simulating the great lakes ice and thermal structure sun et al 2020 likewise demonstrated the benefits of a 3d hydrodynamic model by two way coupling the climate weather research and forecasting cwrf rcm to an fvcom based 3d lake and ice model they also simulated the historical water levels of the great lakes by using cwrf fvcom to calculate the historical nbs and running the nbs through a stage fall discharge equation within the fvcom model however they made no efforts in projecting the future water level changes of the great lakes durnford et al 2018 developed an operational water level forecasting system for the great lakes by two way coupling an rcm with a 3d lake model but their forecasts were on a 7 day short term timescale with data assimilation in fact at the time of writing this paper no study has projected the water levels of the great lakes on a climate timescale by utilizing an rcm with a two way coupled 3d lake model therefore the primary goal of this study is to use a two way coupled 3d regional climate modeling system glarm in conjunction with lbrm and cglrrm to better resolve land lake atmosphere interactive processes and project the water level changes of the great lakes on a climate timescale here three gcms from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 are dynamically downscaled using glarm for the early twenty first 2000 2019 and mid twenty first 2030 2049 centuries under the representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 scenario the changes in the nbs components by the mid twenty first century i e the modeled changes between the early and mid twenty first century in glarm and lbrm simulations are applied to the observed early twenty first century nbs to derive the future nbs which is then used to drive cglrrm to project the mid twenty first century water levels 2 methodology 2 1 models 2 1 1 great lakes atmosphere regional model glarm glarm xue et al 2017 is a regional climate modeling system for the great lakes that two way couples regcm4 and an fvcom based 3d hydrodynamic lake and ice model it has been recently updated to glarm version 2 xue et al 2022 which is the version used in this study regcm4 is a 3d hydrostatic compressible σ coordinate regional climate model whose atmospheric dynamics and radiative transfer scheme are based on the hydrostatic version of the pennsylvania state university national center for atmospheric research ncar mesoscale model mm5 grell et al 1994 and ncar community climate model version 3 ccm3 kiehl et al 1996 respectively regcm4 has several improvements over its older version regcm3 such as multiple schemes for representing cumulus convection planetary boundary layer processes and land surface processes giorgi et al 2012 here the cumulus convection is represented using the grell parametrization grell 1993 grell et al 1994 and the planetary boundary layer processes are described using the holtslag et al 1990 scheme the version of regcm4 in glarm is based on wang et al 2016 so the land surface processes are described using the community land model version 4 clm4 the spatial modeling domain of glarm fig 1 encompasses the great lakes basin along with parts of the midwest and northeast regions of the us and the ontario and quebec provinces of canada the regcm4 module in glarm covers this modeling domain with 18 km spaced grids and 18 vertical sigma layers the 3d hydrodynamic model in glarm is based on fvcom a prognostic free surface 3d primitive equation coastal ocean circulation model that is numerically solved over an unstructured grid using the finite volume method chen et al 2006 2013 xue et al 2020 the ice water interaction processes are simulated by a computationally efficient version of the los alamos community ice code cice within the fvcom framework xue et al 2017 the horizontal resolution of the hydrodynamic model ranges from 1 to 2 km near the coast to 2 4 km in the lake s offshore region and the vertical resolution ranges from 1 m in nearshore waters to 2 4 m in the lake s offshore region in glarm lst and ice coverage calculated by fvcom are provided to regcm4 for the over lake surface boundary conditions and the surface meteorological forcing fields calculated by regcm4 are provided to fvcom this two way coupling is employed through the oasis3 mct coupler craig et al 2017 2 1 2 large basin runoff model clausius clapeyron lbrm cc lbrm developed by glerl is a physically based conceptual model that utilizes an interdependent tank cascade model to simulate basin runoff from all 121 subbasins of the great lakes croley 1983a 1983b the model represents the land as a cascade of four layers upper soil zone lower soil zone groundwater storage and surface storage and describes the flows within these layers using the linear reservoir concept the basin runoff along with all fluxes between the layers including evaporation and evapotranspiration is calculated by solving a set of one dimensional mass continuity equations lbrm requires limited input data which is quite useful for working within the great lakes basin where observational data are sparse croley 2002 lbrm has been successfully calibrated and used by multiple studies for simulating the historical basin runoff within the great lakes region e g croley 2002 anderson et al 2010 gaborit et al 2016 additionally as mentioned in section 1 the lbrm code has been revised to improve its performance in future basin runoff projection and climate change studies by incorporating the clausius clapeyron relationship cc the inputs to lbrm cc aside from the calibrated parameters hunter personal communication 2020 are the daily precipitation and daily minimum and maximum air temperature over a subbasin these daily inputs for the historical and future simulations are obtained directly from glarm 2 1 3 coordinated great lakes regulation and routing model cglrrm cglrrm is a hydrologic routing model developed by the coordinating committee for great lakes basic hydraulic and hydrologic data hereafter referred to as the coordinating committee that uses nbs to compute the water levels and the flows in the connecting channels for lake superior michigan huron st clair erie and ontario besides nbs it also considers the major diversions in the great lakes like the ogoki and long lac diversion the chicago diversion and the welland canal the model consists of three linked modules the lake superior module the middle lakes module and the lake ontario module the lake superior module computes the water level and outflow via the st mary s river of lake superior under the pre project relationship the plan 1977 a regulation plan and the plan 2012 regulation plan in this study the 1977 a regulation plan was used as it required the fewest initial conditions and performs very similarly to plan 2012 the middle lakes module initially developed by quinn 1978 and clites and lee 1998 computes the water level and the outflow of the middle lakes michigan huron st clair and erie since the middle lakes outflows via their connecting channels st clair river detroit river and niagara river are all unregulated and interdependent the module calculates the water levels and outflows using continuity equations and stage fall discharge relationships lastly the lake ontario module computes the water level and outflow of lake ontario however at the time of this study this module was not operational so the water levels of lake ontario are not projected in this study 2 2 dynamical downscaling in this study three cmip5 gcms are dynamically downscaled using glarm namely giss e2 h ipsl cm5a hr and mpi esm mr these three gcms were chosen due to their high reliability factor when simulating the mean surface air temperature over north america under the reliability ensemble averaging rea method as shown by xue et al 2022 the downscalings are performed for the early twenty first 2000 2019 and mid twenty first 2030 2049 centuries under the rcp 8 5 scenario rcp 8 5 was chosen because out of all the rcp scenarios its total co2 emission for 2005 2020 is the closest within 1 to the observed total emission schwalm et al 2020 it is the most suitable pathway for assessing the impact of climate change by 2050 under the current and stated policies schwalm et al 2020 rcp 8 5 has the highest greenhouse gas emission within the rcp set leading to an additional radiative forcing greater than 8 5 w m2 by 2100 moss et al 2010 riahi et al 2011 hereafter giss ipsl and mpi refer to giss e2 h ipsl cm5a hr and mpi esm mr respectively while giss gl ipsl gl and mpi gl refer to their downscaled simulations using glarm additionally the mean of these three downscaling cases is hereafter referred to as the ensemble average 2 3 developing nbs and water level projections glarm estimating over lake precipitation and evaporation and lbrm estimating basin runoff simulate the nbs components for both the early twenty first century and mid twenty first century the future nbs could have directly been used as an input to cglrrm to estimate the future water level change however driving cglrrm directly with the future nbs would introduce the inherent biases in glarm and lbrm projections into the water level estimation one common way to minimize the introduction of bias is to estimate the future nbs based on the observed historical nbs and the model projected changes in the nbs components i e the difference between the mid and early twenty first century simulations the following paragraphs describe the specific procedure that was developed to calculate 1 the projected changes in the nbs components and 2 the future nbs the procedure to calculate the projected changes is the same for each nbs component so x is hereafter used to denote the three nbs components over lake precipitation lake evaporation and basin runoff first the monthly climatology mean and standard deviation of x for historical x m his and σ x m his and future simulations x m fut and σ x m fut were calculated then the monthly climatology mean and the standard deviation of the projected changes between the future and present day climate in x δ x m and σ δ x m were calculated based on equation 1 and equation 2 respectively 1 δ x m x m fut x m his m 1 t o 12 2 σ δ x m σ x m his 2 σ x m fut 2 2 c o v x m his x m fut m 1 t o 12 where x m his values of x for month m during the early twenty first century x m fut values of x for month m during the mid twenty first century x m his climatology mean of x for month m during the early twenty first century x m fut climatology mean of x for month m during the mid twenty first century σ x m his standard deviation of x for month m during the early twenty first century σ x m fut standard deviation of x for month m during the mid twenty first century c o v x m his x m fut covariance between x m his and x m fut for month m δ x m climatology mean of the projected changes in x for month m σ δ x m standard deviation of the projected changes in x for month m next a 20 member ensemble was randomly generated where every member was a 20 yr monthly time series of the projected changes in x each time series was generated by randomly drawing 20 values from the normal distribution n δ x m σ δ x m for each month m additionally to avoid large changes in x the time series was constrained to contain the changes within 1 σ δ x m these aforementioned steps were performed for each nbs component to obtain a 20 member ensemble for each nbs component the ensembles of each nbs component were then combined to produce a 20 member ensemble of projected changes in nbs equation 3 finally an ensemble of future nbs time series was created by applying the projected nbs changes to the observed historical nbs from the coordinating committee equation 4 this ensemble of future nbs was used to drive cglrrm to produce a 20 member ensemble of mid twenty first century water levels the historical nbs from the coordinating committee is termed as residual nbs nbs res as it is inferred as a residual term between the observed water level of the great lakes the inter lake flows and the flow in the major great lakes diversions this is considered as the most accurate estimate of historical nbs the coordinating committee s nbs data are coordinated by the us army corps of engineers usace and environment and climate change canada eccc although data from 2009 onward remain provisional at the time of the writing of this paper 3 δ

of the projected mid twenty first century nbs this entire procedure visually represented in fig 2 was repeatedly performed for each of the five lakes and each of the three downscaling cases the projected water level changes were derived by comparing the projected future water levels with the early twenty first century water levels which were simulated by forcing cglrrm with the early twenty first century residual nbs note that although we only used the projected changes in nbs components rather than directly using the projected future nbs component values we conducted a detailed validation section 3 1 of the glarm and lbrm performances in simulating the present day nbs components to provide confidence in our projected changes the projected changes in the nbs components nbs and water levels presented in this paper are the average of the 20 member ensemble additionally for the water level projections the simulation period is 2040 2049 as the first 10 years of the simulation 2030 2039 is used as a spin up time for cglrrm to ensure the model results are not affected by the model initialization section 3 2 3 results 3 1 evaluation of the simulated historical nbs and its components the estimates from the great lakes hydrometeorological database glerl hmd hunter et al 2015 maintained by glerl are used to evaluate glarm s performance in simulating the historical mean seasonal cycles of the nbs components fig 3 glerl hmd is a monthly hydrometeorological database that provides historical estimates for all the major components of the great lakes water budget including the three nbs components the over lake precipitation and basin runoff estimates are derived almost exclusively from land based station measurements whereas the lake evaporation estimates are produced directly from lltm simulations hunter et al 2015 it should be noted that due to sparse land based stations in some regions and the lack of lake based stations in the great lakes there are biases and uncertainties in the glerl hmd estimates hunter et al 2015 so although it is the most comprehensive dataset for the great lakes water budget components we should be mindful of its potential biases when comparing it to the glarm simulations the ensemble average of glarm s over lake precipitation has a good agreement with glerl hmd in terms of the seasonality and magnitude it captures the diminished winter precipitation and rising spring precipitation reasonably well a comparison between glerl hmd and the glarm ensemble average shows that the mean monthly over lake precipitation from the ensemble average is larger by 8 10 and 9 mm 10 for lake michigan huron and erie respectively and smaller by only 0 2 0 3 and 3 mm 3 for lake superior and ontario respectively these results are particularly encouraging considering that the lateral boundary conditions lbcs for the dynamical downscalings are from gcms instead of reanalysis data this provides us with confidence regarding our selection of gcms furthermore the ensemble simulation represents uncertainties in climate modeling which are partly inherited from the driving gcms in downscaling the individual downscaling cases span a wide range of values with mpi gl and giss gl producing the largest and smallest estimates of mean monthly over lake precipitation respectively relative to the ensemble average the mean monthly estimates from mpi gl are larger by up to 40 in lake erie while the mean monthly estimates from giss gl are smaller by up to 49 in lake erie the lake evaporation from glarm is very consistent and all three downscaling cases closely follow the seasonality and magnitude of glerl hmd fig 3 second column compared to precipitation glarm s evaporation is affected to a lesser extent by the lbcs from gcms the evaporation minima during spring and early summer and maxima during the late fall and winter are well captured by glarm noticeable discrepancies in evaporation between the glarm ensemble average and glerl hmd are mostly limited to lake superior and erie only the ensemble average simulates smaller evaporation during september march and october december in lake superior and erie respectively overall compared to glerl hmd the mean monthly lake evaporation from the ensemble average is smaller by 13 24 0 1 0 3 1 1 and 3 mm 6 for lake superior michigan huron erie and ontario respectively more importantly upon comparing glarm s historical evaporation with those simulated by rcms that were coupled to 1d lake models in notaro et al 2015a music et al 2015 and mailhot et al 2019 it is evident that glarm reproduces historical lake evaporation significantly better the rcm based evaporation presented in those three studies exhibited larger monthly biases and early seasonal peaks due to their rudimentary derivation of lake surface conditions via gcm lake ocean grids or 1d lake models see fig 6 in notaro et al 2015a fig 2 in music et al 2015 and fig 2 in mailhot et al 2019 this again highlights the importance and advantage of two way coupling an rcm with a 3d lake model with respect to the basin runoff validation the glarm driven lbrm cc ensemble average also reproduces the seasonality of monthly basin runoff very well fig 3 third column the timings of the peaks are well captured in all lakes while the most noticeable discrepancy is that the lbmr cc slightly underestimates the winter runoff and overestimates the snowmelt fed spring peak and summer decline particularly for lake michigan huron and erie compared to glerl hmd the mean monthly basin runoff from the ensemble average is larger by 6 12 13 19 and 21 mm 26 for lake superior michigan huron and erie respectively and smaller by 12 mm 7 for lake ontario again similar to over lake precipitation the individual downscaling cases illustrate the inherent uncertainties in climate impact modeling by spanning a wide range of values for basin runoff mpi gl giss gl produces the largest smallest mean monthly basin runoff primarily due to its larger smaller estimate for over land precipitation which is consistent with its large small estimate for over lake precipitation the last column of fig 3 compares the simulated nbs which is calculated by combining the simulated nbs components with the residual nbs from the coordinating committee the ensemble average reasonably captures the magnitude and seasonality of nbs because each nbs component is already well reproduced by the ensemble average the nbs peak during spring and the subsided period during late summer and early fall are closely tracked by the ensemble average albeit with a slightly higher magnitude for lake michigan huron and erie due to the larger simulated basin runoff compared to the coordinating committee the mean monthly nbs from glarm is larger by 18 34 37 and 18 mm for lake superior michigan huron erie and ontario respectively since nbs is the combination of its components the simulated nbs also reflects the differences between individual downscaling cases for example since mpi gl giss gl estimates the largest smallest over lake precipitation and basin runoff it estimates the largest smallest mean monthly nbs as well overall the ensemble average reproduces the historical nbs and its three components remarkably well and justifies our selection of gcms and the use of glarm for future climate projections 3 2 assessing the impact of nbs biases on the long term projection of water level change the validation results show that the model performs well in simulating the climatological monthly values of over lake precipitation lake evaporation basin runoff and nbs however even though the biases are small in the climatological comparisons one important question is whether and to which extent these biases can accumulate over time and result in the long term projection drifting away from the true state over several decades especially in the context of climate change impacts in this section we address this question with a set of cglrrm simulations and quantify the cumulative impact of these so called chronic biases on the long term water level projection four cglrrm simulations were performed to examine the error accumulation in simulated water levels over time each simulation was driven by an nbs time series 1950 2019 with a perturbation where the perturbations represented the levels of climatological biases the perturbed nbs time series were created by applying four constant perturbations to the observed residual nbs time series of each lake 10 10 20 and 20 of the 1950 2019 nbs average the four cglrrm simulations are hereafter referred to as the perturbed runs a fifth run in which cglrrm is driven by the observed residual nbs was also performed and is hereafter referred to as the unperturbed run by comparing the perturbed runs with the unperturbed run over a 70 year simulation we examine whether the nbs biases quantified at the climatological level would accumulate over time in the long term water level projection fig 4 shows the results from the perturbed and unperturbed runs for lake michigan huron the other lakes produce similar results it is evident from the lower panel of fig 4 that the perturbation in nbs result in a bias in the water level however note that the biases increase in a quasi linear fashion only for the first five years and eventually transition to an asymptote where the bias level nearly reaches an equilibrium after the first 10 years in other words the errors in the water levels from the perturbed runs do not continue to grow with time after the first decade it shows that the lake system has a memory of 10 years it takes 10 years for the lakes to adjust to nbs changes through changes in inter lake flows to reach a new equilibrium state that is to say it is appropriate to use the climatological error after the model spinup of the first decade to represent the level of climate projection s uncertainty more importantly the relative evolution in water level in all these simulations remains similar this is quantified in table 1 which for example shows that the difference between the january water level of 2000 and 2019 from the perturbed runs is similar to the difference from the unperturbed run the relative magnitude of water levels between two periods is more or less conserved after the first decade so since the first decade of water level is already ignored for this study described in section 2 3 the projected future water level changes from this study do not suffer from increasing errors uncertainties that we were concerned of being amplified due to the climatological biases in nbs 3 3 projected changes in nbs and its components the projected annual and monthly changes in nbs and its components are shown in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively the ensemble average projects an increase in annual over lake precipitation for all the lakes 55 54 66 and 27 mm for lake superior michigan huron erie and ontario respectively by the mid twenty first century relative to the early twenty first century the biggest increases are projected for may september with decreases or minimal changes projected for december march although the ensemble average projects an increase in annual over lake precipitation there is a large variability among the individual downscaling cases the projections from the three downscaling cases range from 28 to 72 mm in lake superior 11 to 92 mm in lake michigan huron 4 to 138 mm in lake erie and 25 to 64 mm in lake ontario thus illustrating the uncertainty in future climate projections ipsl gl is the only downscaling case to project either decreases or the smallest increase in annual precipitation over the lakes such contrasting projections show that in addition to affecting historical simulations as shown in the validation section 3 1 the driving gcm also affects the future changes similar to over lake precipitation the ensemble average projects an increase in annual basin runoff for all the lakes and the individual downscaling cases project both increases and decreases the ensemble average projects annual runoff increases of 31 68 72 and 80 mm for lake superior michigan huron erie and ontario respectively the biggest projected increases such as 187 mm from giss gl for lake ontario are primarily due to the large projected increases in over land precipitation the projected decreases on the other hand are projected solely by ipsl gl and are a result of a warmer and drier future climate the projections from the three downscaling cases range from 21 to 59 mm in lake superior 17 to 125 mm in lake michigan huron 15 to 179 mm in lake erie and 54 to 187 mm in lake ontario as for the monthly changes basin runoff is projected to increase in winter and early spring due to the increased snowmelt and precipitation and decrease in late spring due to the reduced snowpack following the increased snowmelt compared to the over lake precipitation and basin runoff changes the projected changes in annual lake evaporation are smaller in magnitude lake superior s annual evaporation is projected to undergo the smallest changes with ipsl gl projecting a decrease in annual evaporation in all the remaining lakes all three downscaling cases project increases in annual evaporation the changes projected by the ensemble average for the annual evaporation in lake superior michigan huron erie and ontario are 8 30 31 and 38 mm respectively evaporation is projected to increase during spring and summer with minimal changes during fall and winter except in lake superior where there is a clear decrease in evaporation during fall and early winter compared to over lake precipitation and basin runoff the evaporation projections from the individual downscaling cases for a particular lake span a smaller range this is consistent with the validation efforts for evaporation shown in fig 3 the projections from the three downscaling cases range from 11 to 26 mm in lake superior 21 to 37 mm in lake michigan huron 24 to 42 mm in lake erie and 28 to 58 mm in lake ontario as for the nbs the ensemble average projects an increase in annual nbs for all the lakes since for most downscaling cases the projected changes in the nbs components create an influx of water into the lake the ensemble average projects the annual nbs to increase by 79 92 107 and 69 mm in lake superior michigan huron erie and ontario respectively peaks in nbs increases are scattered throughout the year with most of them coinciding unsurprisingly with the peaks in the projected over lake precipitation and basin runoff increases peaks in the projected nbs increases are most common during may and september while november and december usually exhibit decreases or relatively minimal changes in nbs the projected changes in annual nbs from the three downscaling cases range from 18 to 119 mm in lake superior 49 to 175 mm in lake michigan huron 43 to 276 mm in lake erie and 109 to 192 mm in lake ontario ipsl gl is the only downscaling case to project a decrease in nbs mainly due to the projected decrease in precipitation and basin runoff 3 4 projected changes in water level the ensemble average projects an increase in average annual water level for all the lakes 0 19 0 44 and 0 28 m for lake superior michigan huron and erie respectively fig 7 and figure s1 from the individual downscaling cases the projections range from 0 01 to 0 32 m in lake superior 0 13 to 0 80 m in lake michigan huron and 0 09 to 0 54 m in lake erie the projected increases are significantly larger than the projected decreases hence the positive ensemble average additionally no major changes are projected for the seasonality of the water levels changes in nbs are the primary drivers behind water level changes however since the great lakes are connected by rivers whose flows are mainly governed by the hydraulic head the water level of a lake is also affected by the water level changes in the upstream and downstream lakes so the projected changes in water levels reflect the projected changes in nbs as well as the projected water level changes in the upstream and downstream lakes for example even though ipsl gl projects an increase in lake superior s nbs the water level in lake superior decreases because the projected decrease in lake michigan huron s water level increases the outflow of water from lake superior through st mary s river therefore the water level change of a particular lake is not an exact reflection of the lake s nbs change rather it is a reflection of the nbs changes across the whole great lakes system 4 discussion 4 1 importance of a two way coupled 3d lake model in simulating nbs xue et al 2017 conclusively presented evidence of glarm s superiority over rcm coupled with 1d lake model systems in simulating the thermal structure surface water fluxes e g precipitation and evaporation and ice coverage of the great lakes the exceptional historical simulation of nbs and its components by glarm presented in section 3 1 further supports xue et al 2017 s conclusion the accuracy of lake evaporation which is the nbs component that is most affected by the lake modeling has been significantly improved by glarm when compared to the previous studies e g music et al 2015 notaro et al 2015a mailhot et al 2019 which used 1 d lake models to represent the great lakes lake evaporation was clearly impacted by their simplified lake model since in their validation their simulated evaporation had an almost different climatology pattern to the observation as discussed in section 3 1 the ensemble averages of the historical nbs presented in this study are also better than those from the aforementioned studies due to the much improved evaporation additionally xue et al 2022 recently showcased glarm s ability to significantly improve the driving gcm s air temperature precipitation lst and ice cover for the great lakes therefore glarm by properly representing the complexity of hydrodynamics and lake atmosphere interaction contributes to a more advanced modeling framework necessary for improving the great lakes hydroclimate projections this is particularly evident through the markedly improved simulation of one nbs component lake evaporation 4 2 comparison of nbs and water level projection with previous studies the range of the projected nbs and water level changes from this and previous studies are shown in fig 8 upon comparison the early gcm based studies of croley 1990 hartmann 1990 lofgren et al 2002 and angel and kunkel 2010 projected significant decreases in nbs and water levels partly due to the faulty lbrm that projected larger increases in evapotranspiration and subsequently larger decreases in basin runoff gcm s inability to capture the moisture recycling within the great lakes i e evaporated water returning to the lake as over lake precipitation or basin runoff also contributed to the large projected decreases in nbs and water levels mackay and seglenieks 2013 rcm based studies including this one do not project drastic decreases in nbs and water level due to the projected increase in over lake precipitation and basin runoff while the nbs and water level increases projected by our ensemble average are closer to the increases projected by the rcm based studies the upper bound of our projected water level increases is in fact closer to the increases projected by the gcm based study of angel and kunkel 2010 it should be noted that all these previous studies considered different time periods and emission scenarios for their projections but a comparison is nevertheless useful as it illustrates the challenges and uncertainties in projecting the water level of the great lakes these comparisons also suggest that as there are many methodological differences and associated sources of errors and uncertainties that may be accumulated or offset in all these studies it is difficult to assert that the current study has the most accurate projection of the water level change however we highlight that the current study does provide the more appropriate and the most advanced modeling framework which is a critical step towards a better understanding and projection of the great lakes water level changes also a future rise rather than a decline of the great lakes water levels is more likely based on the most up to date climate projection 4 3 challenges in water level projection this paper marks one of the more notable advances in water level projection of the great lakes by using a two way coupled rcm and 3d lake model to project nbs however apart from the mostly unavoidable uncertainties in future climate modeling which giorgi 2010 calls the intrinsic uncertainties those related to future climate policies and internal variability in climate there are some limitations stemming from our applied models that could be addressed in future complementary studies one focus of future studies should be developing water level projections using a two way coupled land lake atmosphere modeling system that can more accurately represent the complete hydrological cycle of the great lakes the modeling framework used in this study is also a land lake atmosphere coupled modeling system but the basin runoff and inter lake flows water levels in this study were simulated offline using lbrm cc and cglrrm respectively an integrated two way coupled land lake atmosphere modeling system with a more advanced representation of land hydrology processes would provide a better estimation of basin runoff in the great lakes for example the direct contribution of groundwater to the great lakes is considered to be negligible in magnitude when compared to the nbs components and therefore was ignored or lumped into the error term in almost all studies relating to the great lakes water budget lee 1992 lenters 2001 2004 fortin and gronewold 2012 however groundwater has a big impact on basin runoff and therefore has a significant indirect contribution to the lakes water balance lbrm cc has a simplified representation of land surface processes as described in section 2 1 2 in addition although lbrm cc considers the contribution of groundwater to basin runoff it does not account for the lateral exchange of groundwater between subbasins using a modeling system that resolves land atmosphere interaction and vertical lateral movement of surface and subsurface water to calculate basin runoff would be an improvement upon this study a modeling system like the ncar weather research forecasting wrf hydrological modeling system wrf hydro gochis et al 2020 is a possible future substitute for lbrm cc the integration of wrf hydro into glarm would offer a more realistic representation of land surface processes on both temporal and spatial scales which has a profound impact on the soil thermal and moisture states surface energy fluxes and consequently on the entire coupled land lake atmosphere processes future studies can also complement this study by downscaling a larger and more advanced ensemble of gcms the gcms for this study were chosen from cmip5 based on the rea method so gcms from the latest phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 along with other gcm ensembles and selection methods that have been prescribed for use in the great lakes region delaney and milner 2019 can help improve upon this study the use of new integrated modeling systems and a larger ensemble of projections will help improve our understanding of the role of climate change in great lakes water levels and ultimately help water resource managers better prepare for the future 5 summary the changes in the great lakes nbs components nbs and water levels by the mid twenty first century relative to the early twenty first century are projected using an ensemble of three glarm based dynamical downscalings unlike the widely used rcms that are two way coupled to 1d lake models glarm two way couples the regcm4 rcm to an fvcom based 3d lake model the modeling system reproduces the present day nbs remarkably well with a significantly improved simulation accuracy of lake evaporation reinforcing the importance of this new modeling system for hydroclimate simulation the ensemble average of the simulated nbs and its components closely follow the estimates from glerl hmd and the coordinating committee with the span of individual downscaling cases representing the uncertainty present in gcms for future hydroclimate the ensemble average projects an increase in annual nbs and average annual water level for each lake increases in over lake precipitation are projected in may september with minimal changes during winter while increases in basin runoff are the most significant during the winter and early spring due to increased snowmelt as for annual lake evaporation compared to over lake precipitation and basin runoff the ensemble average projects relatively smaller increases with slight increases for spring and summer followed by decreases or minimal increases during the fall and winter months the projected changes in the nbs components result in an increase in the average annual water level according to the ensemble average by 2040 2049 the average annual water levels of lake superior michigan huron and erie are projected to increase by 0 19 0 44 and 0 28 m respectively relative to 2010 2019 the individual downscaling cases highlight the uncertainty in climate projection showing both increases and decreases in annual nbs and average annual water level projection for giss gl and mpi gl the projected changes in the nbs components result in an increase in average annual water level by 2040 2049 relative to 2010 2019 however ipsl gl project decreases in average annual water level thus leading to projections ranging from 0 01 to 0 32 m in lake superior 0 13 to 0 80 m in lake michigan huron and 0 09 to 0 54 m in lake erie water level projections highlight the complexity of the great lakes hydroclimate system and the need for an integrated modeling framework as a critical
