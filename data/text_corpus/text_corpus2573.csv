12865,ammonia oxidation is a critical process during nitrogen removal while the activity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob might be impacted severely in disposing high salinity nitrogen containing wastewater to protect aob in high saline medium layer by layer self assembly using graphene oxide go and poly diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride pdda was applied to immobilize enriched aob by mixing go and aob it was found that 30 mg l go showed the best promotion on the ammonia oxidation capacity of aob after coating aob with pdda go showed higher absolute value of zeta potential of 20 1 1 mv and compact structure comparing with uncoated aob although nh4 n consumption process was slightly inhibited by the pdda go composite materials under low salinity conditions 0 2 nacl they presented great effective protection on the capacity of aob in a 3 nacl solution the consumption ratio of nh4 n was 1 34 times that of uncoated aob and the accumulation ratio of no2 n of the former one was 1 40 times that of the latter it inferred that the inhibitory to mass transferring caused by immobilizing materials was less than its positive promotion of aob protection at 3 nacl concentration and the protection of pdda go composite materials was better than go this finding has some certain guiding significance for ammonia oxidation in high salinity graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords high salinity wastewater ammonia oxidation ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob graphene oxide go pdda go composite materials data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction high salinity wastewater or brine refers to wastewater with an inorganic salt content between 1 and 3 5 1 which accounts for around 5 of the total global wastewater treatment 2 aquaculture leather manufacturing agriculture and food processing oil and gas production and nuclear industry all generate large quantities of high salinity wastewater and meanwhile most of them usually contain a high concentration of ammonia nitrogen 3 7 the biological nitrification and denitrification technique has been widely adopted to remove nitrogen from varied ammonia contaminated wastewaters due to its safe and economical treatment process however high salinity is generally believed to be an adverse even an inhibited factor during the biological treatment of wastewater ammonia nitrogen in wastewater is generally eliminated by the traditional nitrification denitrification process compared with the traditional nitrification denitrification process shortcut nitrification denitrification as a new biological nitrogen removal technology can theoretically reduce the oxygen and organic carbon source consumption by 25 and 40 respectively the reaction time is also shorter due to the reduced biochemical reaction steps and consequently the space occupied by the treatment process is reduced so that the construction and operation costs can be saved 8 the main principle of the shortcut nitrification denitrification process is to oxidize nh4 n to no2 n by aerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa to avoid further oxidation of no2 n via maintaining proper reaction conditions and then no2 n is directly denitrified by denitrifying bacteria one key factor of this new process is the enrichment of ammonium oxidizing functional microorganisms however either of aob and aoa has limitation in practice aob belongs to aerobic autotrophic bacteria requiring strict environmental conditions such as ph temperature and dissolved oxygen do 9 11 which all might affect the activity of aob adversely and then decelerate the enrichment of aob during wastewater treatment previous studies 12 14 have also shown that the activity of aob is significantly inhibited in a high salinity environment aoa is observed a high salinity adaptability 3 15 16 nevertheless a narrow nh4 n concentration range 5 6 11 mg l and or temperature 10 c limit the application of aoa in general wastewater treatment 17 19 increased temperature and or nh4 n concentration might severely inhibit the activity of aoa 19 21 therefore to remove high concentration of nh4 n in wastewater aob shows relatively higher enrichment potential for aob the external environment with salt concentration exceeding 1 would result in plasmolysis or disintegration of extracellular polymeric substances eps and further inhibit the removal of chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonia nitrogen therefore mitigating negative environmental factors especially salinity on aob activity has caused increasing academic attention encapsulation of microorganisms using immobilization materials to reduce the negative influence of environmental factors on the activity of microorganisms is a widely applied approach graphene oxide go sodium alginate and α carrageenan are commonly used microbial embedded materials among them go shows a sheet like structure large surface area good colloidal properties and low cytotoxicity at low concentrations due to the functional groups including epoxide carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on the basal plane and edge 22 23 previous studies 24 27 have shown that go could promote the growth and activity of escherichia coli anammox bacteria and aob in a proper low go concentration range yet go would turn toxic to bacteria at high concentrations 28 wang et al 25 believed that 100 mg l go concentration could promote the activity of anammox bacteria guo et al 26 found that the degradation rate of nh4 n and the generation rate of no2 n in aerobic granular sludge ags were obviously promoted with go of below 60 mg l indicating enhanced aob activity while jiang et al 29 believed that 50 mg l go concentration had significant toxicity on fibroblasts ruiz et al 24 found that under the condition of 25 mg l go escherichia coli grew at a rate that 2 times that there was no go thus the efficient utilization of go to coat aob has been intensively focused on in current research layer by layer self assembly lbl is a promising immobilization approach to encapsulate bacteria the composite structure made by the lbl method using polyelectrolytes has the characteristics of semi permeability high mechanical strength and stability 30 poly diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride pdda is a positively charged polyelectrolyte with diallyl dimethyl ammonium repeated groups and chloride as counter ions widely used in water treatment membrane modification and nanoparticle synthesis because of the poly positive charge it can combine the negatively charged aob and go through electrostatic interaction so that it works as a carrier or intermediate layer for self assembly 31 based on the effect of pdda the pdda functionalized graphene has been employed as a matrix material 32 33 it has been reported that using pdda as an immobilized material to coat urease and arginase could improve their catalytic activity 34 and further if the charge on the protein is opposite to the membrane or the enzyme is immobilized in the middle layer the stability of the immobilized cells and the enzyme was higher 35 however studies on alleviating the influence of high salt concentration on the nitrosification activity of aob by encapsulation are still sparse this study intended to investigate the positive effect of composite coating material consisting of go and pdda on the ammonia oxidation activity of aob in a high salt concentration environment aob was enriched using the strain flow feeding approach with controlled environmental conditions and the enriched microorganisms were tested using the high throughput sequencing method the optimum go concentration for promoting the activity of aob was determined based on the results pdda and go were used to coat the enriched aob using lbl method at optimal conditions the salt effect on the aob composite material aob with pdda go was investigated to determine the protection effect of pdda go composite material on aob the objective of this study was to determine a proper approach to protecting aob to ensure short cut nitrification in high salinity wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials graphene oxide go used in experiments was a commercially available concentrate of 3 00 g l from xianfeng nano co ltd nanjing china and it was stored in dark and low temperature 4 c before use poly diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride pdda solid was purchased from shanghai aladdin biochemical tech co used without further purification sodium chloride nacl purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd was used directly with a purity of 99 5 enriched freeze dried aob belonging to nitrosomonas was purchased from biobw biotechnology co ltd beijing other chemicals including nh4 2so4 nahco3 k2hpo4 and so on were all analytical grade supplied by sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd water used in the experiment was all ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm made by hetai smart ro shanghai hitech instruments co ltd 2 2 inoculation and enrichment of aob 500 ml ags cultured in the lab was used as the inoculated sludge with sodium acetate as the carbon source and its mlss and mlvss were 5396 180 mg l and 3099 60 mg l respectively static aeration without influent was applied to the inoculated ags sludge for 2 days and then the ags solids were ground to shorten the acclimation time and to improve the mass transfer efficiency a previous study 36 has proved that the addition of a small amount of anammox sludge during the enrichment process could significantly shorten the start up time therefore about 50 ml of commercially available enriched aob sludge was added in the initial stage of the enrichment process to achieve a rapid start up the activity of heterotrophic bacteria and nitrate bacteria was inhibited during the aob enrichment process by controlling temperature ph value and do as describe below the culture medium for aob was also renewed periodically to increase its proportion and to replace the indigenous bacteria in the sludge so that aob could grow as the dominant strain the main components and concentrations of the influent water of the reactors were as follows 1 64 g l nh4 2so4 1 31 g l nahco3 0 82 g l k2hpo4 0 03 g l mgso4 0 03 g l feso4 hcl and naoh were used to adjust the ph value at around 7 2 37 aob was enriched in an sbr with an effective volume of 2 0 l which was made with double layer plexiglass with an inner diameter of 13 cm a height of 18 cm and an outer diameter of 19 cm shown in fig s1 in the supplementary data the water bath was utilized in the interlayer to control the temperature the sbr was operated for 2 cycles per day and ran continuously for 30 d the volume exchange ratio was 0 72 every cycle had 5 steps including water input of 5 min reaction intermittent aeration and stirring of 670 min precipitation of 35 min the effluent of 5 min and idle period of 5 min the sbr was operated under the temperature of at 30 1 c do of 0 5 mg l stirrer revolution of 300 10 rpm and sludge retention time srt of 20 days 2 3 preparation of pdda go composite to immobilize aob 30 ml aob sludge mixture was taken out from the sbr shown in fig s1 after being rinsed for 3 times with ultra pure water the mixture was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min and the obtained aob precipitates were placed in a refrigerator of 4 c for later use at room temperature the aob concentrate was added to 40 ml pdda solution of 5 g l and the mixture was shaken for 5 min in a shaker at 150 rpm then the mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 6000 rpm to remove the redundant pdda after that 30 ml go solution of 30 mg l was mixed with the separated solid the same shake and centrifuge processes were repeated to adhere go onto aob with pdda and to remove redundant free go the schematic diagram of the process was shown in fig 1 2 4 the performance of aob with pdda go under high salinity 2 4 1 determination of go optimal concentration for aob there is no consensus on the concentration range of go for promoting microbial growth and activity to determine the optimum go concentration to promote the ammoxidation ability of aob six gradients were investigated the concentration effect of go six portions of aob concentrates were placed in 50 ml centrifuge tubes and 30 ml of go solution with concentrations of 0 5 15 30 40 and 50 mg l were added to the aob concentrates the suspensions were shaken at 150 rpm for 5 min to make aob fully embedded into go 26 38 39 and then the redundant go materials were removed via centrifuge 6000 rpm 5 min the separated solids after centrifuge were moved to six erlenmeyer flasks with 100 ml aob culture medium 0 09 g l nahco3 0 10 0 12 g l nh4 2so4 ph value of 7 2 adjusted by adding hcl or naoh the erlenmeyer flasks were shaken in a shaker at 150 rpm and 30 1 c for 4 h and the suspension samples were taken at every 1 h the suspensions were filtered through 0 22 μm filters to determine the no2 n concentrations of permeates the experiment was repeated 3 times and the average values were reported 2 4 2 the effect of salinity on aob samples to investigate the protective effect of pdda go composites on aob sludge activity under different salinities six gradients of nacl were selected as 0 1 2 3 4 and 5 wt aob with pdda go concentrates were prepared as shown in section 2 3 and placed into erlenmeyer flasks of 100 ml enriched nutrient solution same as section 2 4 1 with different nacl concentrations the open erlenmeyer flasks were shaken in a shaker at 150 rpm for 5 h the concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n in the supernatant were measured before and after reactions in addition equal parts of raw aob sludge concentrates were tested as described above to compare the effect of salinity on the ammoxidation of aob sludge 2 4 3 performance of aob samples at 3 nacl concentration 30 ml of aob concentrate was placed in a centrifuge tube and 30 ml go solution of 30 mg l was added and aob was embedded into go after shaking and centrifuge aob concentrate aob with go and aob with pdda go were placed in erlenmeyer flasks with 3 nacl enriched nutrient solution of 100 ml same as section 2 4 1 respectively the open erlenmeyer flasks were placed in a shaker and shaken at 150 rpm for 5 h the concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n were measured every 30 min in first one hour and every 1 h in the next 4 h the experiment was repeated 3 times and the average values were reported 2 5 detection and analysis methods to determine the functional groups of go fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir analysis was proceeded the main steps of go sample preparation were drying grinding tableting and scanning the samples were fully dried in the oven at 50 c and the kbr sheet pressing method was adopted 1 2 mg samples and 200 mg pure kbr were finely ground and mixed under the irradiation of infrared lamp and then placed in the mold under 4 108 pa vacuum cold pressing the scanning resolution was 4 cm 1 the scanning times were 20 times and the scanning range was 400 4000 cm 1 26 zeta potential values of samples were measured using zetasizer nano zss js94h shanghai 16srdna high throughput sequencing technology based on miseq sequencing platform was adopted in this study lab prepared ags was named sample i and the enriched aob sludge was named sample ii the metagenomes of sample i and ii were classified and sequenced to further compare the changes before and after aob enrichment high throughput sequencing could be roughly divided into the following steps 1 an appropriate amount of sludge was taken to centrifuge for 60 s at 12000 rpm and the precipitates were separated then the dna was extracted from the sludge samples according to omega kit instructions 2 the 16srdna of the bacteria was amplified by pcr using universal primers 338f actcctacgggagcagcag and 806r ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 the amplified dna was tested on the computer using qubit 3 0 dna detection kit 4 data analysis was performed using the illumina miseq platform the high throughput analysis in this study was entrusted to shanghai sangon biological experimental center for assistance the similarity value used in this analysis was 0 97 ph value was measured using ph meter phs3c rex china do was measured with dissolved oxygen meter hq30d hach usa sludge microscopic morphology was observed by electron microscope from sunny optical technology co ltd the macroscopic morphology of the sludge and the mixed materials after embedding was obtained by a digital camera the detection of nh4 n nox n mlss mlvss indicators referred to apha 40 3 results and discussion 3 1 enrichment of aob sludge lab prepared ags and a small amount of commercially available enriched aob sludge were added together on the first day as the startup step of the sbr as described in section 2 2 with mixed mlss of approximately 1400 mg l and sv30 value of 10 to enrich aob in the sbr the influent nh4 n was maintained at around 250 mg l during the whole process the changes of nh4 no3 and no2 in the effluent of the sbr counted in nitrogen concentration during 30 days are shown in fig 2 the effluent no3 n concentration was in a high range from around 170 to 180 mg l during the initial 7 days and the nh4 n removals were up to 90 showing good nitrification performance of the inoculated mixed sludge yet after that the effluent no3 n concentration gradually decreased obviously until day 17 with concentration of 30 25 mg l this is because continuous high nh4 n concentrations of the influent inhibited the activity of nitrite oxidizing bacteria and promoting the metabolic activity of aob 37 meanwhile the effluent no2 n concentration increased gradually from initial 2 35 to 187 mg l on day 21 and then kept at around 180 mg l about 72 of the influent nh4 n converted to no2 n at the end of the enrichment process indicating the successful enrichment of aob in the sbr as previous studies reported on higher than 65 as an indicator of enrichment of aob 41 42 the enriched aob sludge with light yellow color observed in the photo shown in the following fig 5 also showed good settling performance with sv30 of 16 2 and a svi value of 91 4 ml gss the mlss and mlvss of the sludge in the sbr were measured as 1750 150 mg l and 1080 80 mg l respectively the microscope photo of the enriched aob sludge on day 28 fig s2 shows a thin and translucent sludge structure with a small amount of relatively dense flocs and there is no distinct filamentous substance can be seen within sight in order to further understand the microbiological composition of the enriched aob sludge high throughput sequencing analysis was performed on the sludge with results shown in table 1 otus ace chao and shannon are four positively correlated descriptors that represent high throughput results of the samples shannon and simpson are common descriptors utilized to describe the diversity of microflora and the high shannon value and the low simpson value mean high biodiversity comparing sample i with ii the decline of otus ace chao and shannon values and the increase of simpson value indicated the decrease of bacterial diversity undergoing the enrichment process the microbial composition at the phylum and genus levels of the sludge after inoculation and enrichment culture is shown in fig 3 fig 3a presents the phylum level results where sample i and ii were compared the relative abundance of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes rose from 55 and 17 to 69 and 18 respectively chloroflexi decreased most notably from 10 to 0 1 mainly due to the lack of organic carbon source 43 from fig 3a the species of bacteria decreased in phylum level and the relative abundance of dominant bacteria obviously increased fig 3b presents the genus level results and the relative abundance of unclassified genus was the highest in both sludge samples combined with the family tree and fig 3a the relative abundance of unclassified genus obviously reduced from 55 56 to 35 80 the relative abundance of other genus slightly reduced from 10 83 to 7 32 the result was that the relative abundances of bacterial genus in enriched aob sludge were well proportioned compared with that in inoculated sludge except for the unclassified genus fig 3b shows the changes of bacteria at genus level before and after the enrichment showing those whose relative abundances higher than 0 5 the dominant bacteria in the inoculated mixed sludge sample i were thauera 5 53 chryseolinea 3 98 and nitrospira 3 46 all belonging to gram negative bacteria and they are the main functional bacteria for denitrification phosphorus removal and oxidation of nitrite correspondingly 44 46 therefore quite limited amount of no2 n was observed in the sludge in the early stage of domestication before day 7 as shown in fig 2 while the no3 n concentration maintained at a high level in the enriched aob sludge sample ii the dominant bacterial genera were observed as rhodopseudomonas 10 01 thermomonas 6 79 rhodanobacter 5 47 nitrosospira 5 26 and nitrosomonas 2 48 among them rhodopseudomonas and thermomonas contribute to denitrification 47 50 rhodanobacter undertakes nitrification and denitrification 49 the subsequent two genuses are for ammonia oxidation reaction 51 nitrosomonas and nitrosospira both belonging to the nitrosomonadaceae family in betaproteobacteria increased from 0 007 to 7 74 after enrichment aob mainly belong to three genera including nitrosomonas nitrosospira and nitrosococcus 52 from the above high throughput test results the aob sludge has a high content of microorganisms for ammonia oxidation which was consistent with the domestication results as shown in fig 2 3 2 preparation of aob coated with composite numerous previous studies 22 25 26 have reported that microorganism s activity would be inhibited if the concentration of go in the environment is above 100 mg l however the effect of go below 100 mg l on microorganisms was controversial therefore the concentration of go is inferred as an important factor affecting the activity of aob activity to reveal the optimal go concentration for promoting aob activity six concentration gradients 0 5 15 30 40 and 50 mg l of go were selected to investigate the ammonia oxidation characteristics of aob with different go concentrations with the results presented in fig 4 the accumulated concentration of no2 n showed a positive correlation with the go concentration from 0 to 30 mg l in this study indicating gradually enhanced activity of aob and this consequence is consistent with the conclusion reported by ruiz et al 24 as the concentration of go increased to above 30 mg l e g 40 and 50 mg l the accumulation ratio of no2 n decreased significantly from 89 20 to below 36 92 obviously lower than the value of 78 78 in the environment without go and this phenomenon is consistent with the conclusion of jiang et al 29 thus based on the results 30 mg l was selected as the optimal concentration of go used in the subsequent composite material preparation process three aob samples were prepared to compare their apparent characteristics shown in fig 5 the sample in tube i was raw enriched aob served as a control the sample in tube ii was aob embedded into go and the sample in tube iii was covered with pdda go composite materials as shown aob precipitates in tube i looked light yellow the aob samples in tube ii showed a darker color than that in tube i and the color of precipitates in tube iii was the darkest it could be noted that color of the precipitate getting darker as the number of embedded layers increased at the same time the volume of aob precipitates in tube ii decreased slightly which might be attributed to the self wrinkled and porous structure of go 53 54 while the precipitate in tube iii significantly reduced which was primarily caused by the coagulative effect of pdda 55 another reason is that the positive charge pdda neutralized the negative charge of go the composite structure was more compact 56 fig 6 shows the zeta potential of various aob samples as known the bacterial surface exhibits a negative potential and the value of raw aob zeta potential was determined at 13 6 1 mv covered with oppositely charged pdda the surface potential of aob turned from an initial negative potential to a positive value of 7 8 0 7 mv as go was added as the outermost material to encapsulate aob sludge particles the zeta potential of aob with pdda go switched to 20 1 1 mv because of a large amount of negatively charged oxygen containing functional groups in go the ftir spectrum of go is shown in fig s3 the change of surface potential reflected the features of lbl assembly of colloidal particles aob is covered sequentially by oppositely charged materials due to the electrostatic force with specific structure shown in fig 1 the light yellow negatively charged aob is in the innermost layer which binds the positively charged pdda via electrostatic attraction and further attracts the negatively charged go through electrostatic attraction to form a composite structure 3 3 comparison of the aob activities in salty environments 3 3 1 effect of nacl concentrations previous studies indicated that activities of microorganisms decreased in the high salinity environments linarić et al 57 found that the domestication process of sludge became very slow or even tough under the condition of salinity over 30 g l when they studied the effect on the activated sludge caused by different concentrations of nacl and na2so4 ye et al 14 found that 1 02 of nacl caused the ammonia decomposition rate reduced by half in the salty wastewater in order to further study the effect of different nacl concentrations on ammonia oxidation capacities of aob and aob with composite materials six concentration gradients of nacl 0 5 were selected to test the tolerance of aob samples and the results are presented in fig 7 the nh4 n consumption ratio and no2 n accumulation ratio both decreased obviously as the nacl concentration increased from 0 to 5 for aob respectively the decrease trend of ratios indicated aob activity was inhibited by the enhanced salt concentration however those ratios were relatively stable for aob with pdda go when the concentration of nacl was lower than 3 without marked decreases and the decrease occurred as the concentration of nacl increased to above 4 with lower than 2 nacl concentrations the raw aob showed higher nh4 n consumption ratio and no2 n accumulation ratio than aob with pdda go because aob couldn t contact directly with nh4 n in water with pdda go composite materials coated on aob surface nh4 n was intercepted by the outer composite materials instead of being absorbed by aob resulting significant drop in both the conversion rate of nh4 n and the accumulation rate of no2 n compared with naked aob yet as the concentration of nacl increased to 3 the consumption ratio of nh4 n and the accumulation ratio of no2 n of aob with pdda go showed higher values than those of aob indicating the coating materials played a protective role for aob at this salt concentration the consumption ratio of nh4 n is 1 34 times that of uncoated aob and the accumulation ratio of no2 n of the former one is 1 40 times that of the latter as nacl concentration further increased to 4 5 nh4 n consumption ratio and no2 n accumulation ratio of both raw aob and aob with pdda go dropped sharply illustrating the penetration of protective materials by high salinity from the results it can be seen that aob with pdda go had a better nitrosification performance under a nacl concentration of 3 which is close to the average salt concentration of seawater 3 3 2 the protection of aob in 3 nacl by composite materials in order to further understand the protective effect of different coating materials e g pdda go and go on aob s activity 3 nacl was used in the experiment and the results of nh4 n consumption and no2 n accumulation are shown in fig 8 during the first 30 min the consumption rate of nh4 n of raw aob aob with go and aob with pdda go were 5 24 6 75 and 4 64 mg gvss h respectively while the accumulation no2 n rate were 1 23 1 39 and 2 48 mg gvss h respectively the highest nh4 n consumption rate of aob with go was possibly attribute to the strong negative charge of go to absorb positive charge nh4 n 26 the lowest nh4 n consumption rate of aob with pdda go was due to the obstacles from multiple layers on aob surfaces and compact composites including positively charged pdda nevertheless the accumulation rate of no2 n of aob with pdda go was the fastest which implied that pdda protected aob from the negative effect of a higher salt 32 56 after 120 min the nh4 n consumption of aob with pdda go became fastest and nh4 n concentration reduced to approximately 10 39 mg l at the end of reaction lower than the other two aob samples during the whole reaction process the order of accumulated no2 n concentration of varied aob samples was aob with pdda go aob with go raw aob the final no2 n concentration in the aob with pdda go sample was 8 57 mg l higher than the other two samples both around 6 mg l the accumulation concentration of no2 n nearly equaled to the consumption concentration of nh4 n it meant that under the protection of pdda and go multi layers the negative impact of high salinity on aob was partially offset and the ammonia oxidation activity of the main functional bacteria of 7 74 was promoted to some extent 3 3 3 discussion without the protection the activity of naked aob is affected markedly with increased salt concentration i e nacl in this study while the consumption of nh4 n and the accumulation of no2 n of aob with protection of pdda go materials have no obvious change within 0 3 salt concentration as shown in fig 7 on the one hand aob is immobilized inside the pdda and go multilayers and pdda and go tightly bound together by electrostatic force and the composite material combined the advantages of both pdda and go it had stronger binding ability with aob and mechanical strength 30 56 58 pdda is a strong positive polymer organic material without toxicity it can enhance the dispersion of go 33 and have higher cohesion to aob and go making the aob with pdda go has a certain resistance to external high salinity environment on the other hand because of obstacles from multilayers the penetration of nh4 is slowed down so those ratios are lower for aob with pdda go comparing with raw aob under low salt concentrations 0 2 which have not severely affected aob as shown in fig 8 when the concentration of salt increases to 4 5 aob might crumble rupture and lose the activity of ammonia oxidation due to the high osmotic pressure leading to consumption ratio of nh4 n and accumulation ratio of no2 n both close to around only 10 comparing the three aob samples in fig 8 it could be considered that the inhibitory to mass transferring caused by embedded materials was less than its positive promotion of aob protection at 3 nacl concentration and the protection of pdda go composite materials was better than only go composite material contributes a lot to promote the stability and activity of microorganisms this point was proved in other researches calcium alginate activated carbon composite materials were used to immobilize hydrocarbon degrading bacteria and the degradation rate was 33 higher than that of free bacteria 59 with polyvinyl alcohol ethyl orthosilicate immobilized trichosporon cutaneum the immobilized cells showed higher uptake rates of cu2 and cd2 than the free cells 60 in summary pdda go composite materials showed effective protective effect on aob in 3 nacl solution 4 conclusions in order to investigate the protection of composite materials on aob in a high salinity environment 3 pdda and go were selected to coat aob using lbl method in this study aob was quickly enriched in sbr using strain flow adding method and via controlling environmental factors including temperature ph value and influent substrate the consequence of high throughput sequencing showed that the relative abundance of nitrosomonadaceae significantly increased from 0 007 to 7 74 meant that aob was successfully enriched after coating with pdda and go the aob samples showed compact morphology with dark yellow color and a negative zeta potential of 20 1 1 mv lower than the raw enrich aob 13 6 1 mv it was found that activity of aob with pdda go was lower than that of raw aob at low nacl concentrations 0 2 because of the masking effect of embedded materials however the composite materials showed the effective protection on activity of aob at 3 nacl concentration comparison results showed that the no2 n accumulation ratio of aob with pdda go was 1 40 times that of raw aob while the protection effect of composite material on aob obviously weakened at the concentration of 4 5 nacl these results have certain practical guidance for the treatment of moderate high salinity nitrogen containing wastewater declaration of competing

reaction steps and consequently the space occupied by the treatment process is reduced so that the construction and operation costs can be saved 8 the main principle of the shortcut nitrification denitrification process is to oxidize nh4 n to no2 n by aerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa to avoid further oxidation of no2 n via maintaining proper reaction conditions and then no2 n is directly denitrified by denitrifying bacteria one key factor of this new process is the enrichment of ammonium oxidizing functional microorganisms however either of aob and aoa has limitation in practice aob belongs to aerobic autotrophic bacteria requiring strict environmental conditions such as ph temperature and dissolved oxygen do 9 11 which all might affect the activity of aob adversely and then decelerate the enrichment of aob during wastewater treatment previous studies 12 14 have also shown that the activity of aob is significantly inhibited in a high salinity environment aoa is observed a high salinity adaptability 3 15 16 nevertheless a narrow nh4 n concentration range 5 6 11 mg l and or temperature 10 c limit the application of aoa in general wastewater treatment 17 19 increased temperature and or nh4 n concentration might severely inhibit the activity of aoa 19 21 therefore to remove high concentration of nh4 n in wastewater aob shows relatively higher enrichment potential for aob the external environment with salt concentration exceeding 1 would result in plasmolysis or disintegration of extracellular polymeric substances eps and further inhibit the removal of chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonia nitrogen therefore mitigating negative environmental factors especially salinity on aob activity has caused increasing academic attention encapsulation of microorganisms using immobilization materials to reduce the negative influence of environmental factors on the activity of microorganisms is a widely applied approach graphene oxide go sodium alginate and α carrageenan are commonly used microbial embedded materials among them go shows a sheet like structure large surface area good colloidal properties and low cytotoxicity at low concentrations due to the functional groups including epoxide carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on the basal plane and edge 22 23 previous studies 24 27 have shown that go could promote the growth and activity of escherichia coli anammox bacteria and aob in a proper low go concentration range yet go would turn toxic to bacteria at high concentrations 28 wang et al 25 believed that 100 mg l go concentration could promote the activity of anammox bacteria guo et al 26 found that the degradation rate of nh4 n and the generation rate of no2 n in aerobic granular sludge ags were obviously promoted with go of below 60 mg l indicating enhanced aob activity while jiang et al 29 believed that 50 mg l go concentration had significant toxicity on fibroblasts ruiz et al 24 found that under the condition of 25 mg l go escherichia coli grew at a rate that 2 times that there was no go thus the efficient utilization of go to coat aob has been intensively focused on in current research layer by layer self assembly lbl is a promising immobilization approach to encapsulate bacteria the composite structure made by the lbl method using polyelectrolytes has the characteristics of semi permeability high mechanical strength and stability 30 poly diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride pdda is a positively charged polyelectrolyte with diallyl dimethyl ammonium repeated groups and chloride as counter ions widely used in water treatment membrane modification and nanoparticle synthesis because of the poly positive charge it can combine the negatively charged aob and go through electrostatic interaction so that it works as a carrier or intermediate layer for self assembly 31 based on the effect of pdda the pdda functionalized graphene has been employed as a matrix material 32 33 it has been reported that using pdda as an immobilized material to coat urease and arginase could improve their catalytic activity 34 and further if the charge on the protein is opposite to the membrane or the enzyme is immobilized in the middle layer the stability of the immobilized cells and the enzyme was higher 35 however studies on alleviating the influence of high salt concentration on the nitrosification activity of aob by encapsulation are still sparse this study intended to investigate the positive effect of composite coating material consisting of go and pdda on the ammonia oxidation activity of aob in a high salt concentration environment aob was enriched using the strain flow feeding approach with controlled environmental conditions and the enriched microorganisms were tested using the high throughput sequencing method the optimum go concentration for promoting the activity of aob was determined based on the results pdda and go were used to coat the enriched aob using lbl method at optimal conditions the salt effect on the aob composite material aob with pdda go was investigated to determine the protection effect of pdda go composite material on aob the objective of this study was to determine a proper approach to protecting aob to ensure short cut nitrification in high salinity wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials graphene oxide go used in experiments was a commercially available concentrate of 3 00 g l from xianfeng nano co ltd nanjing china and it was stored in dark and low temperature 4 c before use poly diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride pdda solid was purchased from shanghai aladdin biochemical tech co used without further purification sodium chloride nacl purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd was used directly with a purity of 99 5 enriched freeze dried aob belonging to nitrosomonas was purchased from biobw biotechnology co ltd beijing other chemicals including nh4 2so4 nahco3 k2hpo4 and so on were all analytical grade supplied by sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd water used in the experiment was all ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm made by hetai smart ro shanghai hitech instruments co ltd 2 2 inoculation and enrichment of aob 500 ml ags cultured in the lab was used as the inoculated sludge with sodium acetate as the carbon source and its mlss and mlvss were 5396 180 mg l and 3099 60 mg l respectively static aeration without influent was applied to the inoculated ags sludge for 2 days and then the ags solids were ground to shorten the acclimation time and to improve the mass transfer efficiency a previous study 36 has proved that the addition of a small amount of anammox sludge during the enrichment process could significantly shorten the start up time therefore about 50 ml of commercially available enriched aob sludge was added in the initial stage of the enrichment process to achieve a rapid start up the activity of heterotrophic bacteria and nitrate bacteria was inhibited during the aob enrichment process by controlling temperature ph value and do as describe below the culture medium for aob was also renewed periodically to increase its proportion and to replace the indigenous bacteria in the sludge so that aob could grow as the dominant strain the main components and concentrations of the influent water of the reactors were as follows 1 64 g l nh4 2so4 1 31 g l nahco3 0 82 g l k2hpo4 0 03 g l mgso4 0 03 g l feso4 hcl and naoh were used to adjust the ph value at around 7 2 37 aob was enriched in an sbr with an effective volume of 2 0 l which was made with double layer plexiglass with an inner diameter of 13 cm a height of 18 cm and an outer diameter of 19 cm shown in fig s1 in the supplementary data the water bath was utilized in the interlayer to control the temperature the sbr was operated for 2 cycles per day and ran continuously for 30 d the volume exchange ratio was 0 72 every cycle had 5 steps including water input of 5 min reaction intermittent aeration and stirring of 670 min precipitation of 35 min the effluent of 5 min and idle period of 5 min the sbr was operated under the temperature of at 30 1 c do of 0 5 mg l stirrer revolution of 300 10 rpm and sludge retention time srt of 20 days 2 3 preparation of pdda go composite to immobilize aob 30 ml aob sludge mixture was taken out from the sbr shown in fig s1 after being rinsed for 3 times with ultra pure water the mixture was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min and the obtained aob precipitates were placed in a refrigerator of 4 c for later use at room temperature the aob concentrate was added to 40 ml pdda solution of 5 g l and the mixture was shaken for 5 min in a shaker at 150 rpm then the mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 6000 rpm to remove the redundant pdda after that 30 ml go solution of 30 mg l was mixed with the separated solid the same shake and centrifuge processes were repeated to adhere go onto aob with pdda and to remove redundant free go the schematic diagram of the process was shown in fig 1 2 4 the performance of aob with pdda go under high salinity 2 4 1 determination of go optimal concentration for aob there is no consensus on the concentration range of go for promoting microbial growth and activity to determine the optimum go concentration to promote the ammoxidation ability of aob six gradients were investigated the concentration effect of go six portions of aob concentrates were placed in 50 ml centrifuge tubes and 30 ml of go solution with concentrations of 0 5 15 30 40 and 50 mg l were added to the aob concentrates the suspensions were shaken at 150 rpm for 5 min to make aob fully embedded into go 26 38 39 and then the redundant go materials were removed via centrifuge 6000 rpm 5 min the separated solids after centrifuge were moved to six erlenmeyer flasks with 100 ml aob culture medium 0 09 g l nahco3 0 10 0 12 g l nh4 2so4 ph value of 7 2 adjusted by adding hcl or naoh the erlenmeyer flasks were shaken in a shaker at 150 rpm and 30 1 c for 4 h and the suspension samples were taken at every 1 h the suspensions were filtered through 0 22 μm filters to determine the no2 n concentrations of permeates the experiment was repeated 3 times and the average values were reported 2 4 2 the effect of salinity on aob samples to investigate the protective effect of pdda go composites on aob sludge activity under different salinities six gradients of nacl were selected as 0 1 2 3 4 and 5 wt aob with pdda go concentrates were prepared as shown in section 2 3 and placed into erlenmeyer flasks of 100 ml enriched nutrient solution same as section 2 4 1 with different nacl concentrations the open erlenmeyer flasks were shaken in a shaker at 150 rpm for 5 h the concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n in the supernatant were measured before and after reactions in addition equal parts of raw aob sludge concentrates were tested as described above to compare the effect of salinity on the ammoxidation of aob sludge 2 4 3 performance of aob samples at 3 nacl concentration 30 ml of aob concentrate was placed in a centrifuge tube and 30 ml go solution of 30 mg l was added and aob was embedded into go after shaking and centrifuge aob concentrate aob with go and aob with pdda go were placed in erlenmeyer flasks with 3 nacl enriched nutrient solution of 100 ml same as section 2 4 1 respectively the open erlenmeyer flasks were placed in a shaker and shaken at 150 rpm for 5 h the concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n were measured every 30 min in first one hour and every 1 h in the next 4 h the experiment was repeated 3 times and the average values were reported 2 5 detection and analysis methods to determine the functional groups of go fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir analysis was proceeded the main steps of go sample preparation were drying grinding tableting and scanning the samples were fully dried in the oven at 50 c and the kbr sheet pressing method was adopted 1 2 mg samples and 200 mg pure kbr were finely ground and mixed under the irradiation of infrared lamp and then placed in the mold under 4 108 pa vacuum cold pressing the scanning resolution was 4 cm 1 the scanning times were 20 times and the scanning range was 400 4000 cm 1 26 zeta potential values of samples were measured using zetasizer nano zss js94h shanghai 16srdna high throughput sequencing technology based on miseq sequencing platform was adopted in this study lab prepared ags was named sample i and the enriched aob sludge was named sample ii the metagenomes of sample i and ii were classified and sequenced to further compare the changes before and after aob enrichment high throughput sequencing could be roughly divided into the following steps 1 an appropriate amount of sludge was taken to centrifuge for 60 s at 12000 rpm and the precipitates were separated then the dna was extracted from the sludge samples according to omega kit instructions 2 the 16srdna of the bacteria was amplified by pcr using universal primers 338f actcctacgggagcagcag and 806r ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 the amplified dna was tested on the computer using qubit 3 0 dna detection kit 4 data analysis was performed using the illumina miseq platform the high throughput analysis in this study was entrusted to shanghai sangon biological experimental center for assistance the similarity value used in this analysis was 0 97 ph value was measured using ph meter phs3c rex china do was measured with dissolved oxygen meter hq30d hach usa sludge microscopic morphology was observed by electron microscope from sunny optical technology co ltd the macroscopic morphology of the sludge and the mixed materials after embedding was obtained by a digital camera the detection of nh4 n nox n mlss mlvss indicators referred to apha 40 3 results and discussion 3 1 enrichment of aob sludge lab prepared ags and a small amount of commercially available enriched aob sludge were added together on the first day as the startup step of the sbr as described in section 2 2 with mixed mlss of approximately 1400 mg l and sv30 value of 10 to enrich aob in the sbr the influent nh4 n was maintained at around 250 mg l during the whole process the changes of nh4 no3 and no2 in the effluent of the sbr counted in nitrogen concentration during 30 days are shown in fig 2 the effluent no3 n concentration was in a high range from around 170 to 180 mg l during the initial 7 days and the nh4 n removals were up to 90 showing good nitrification performance of the inoculated mixed sludge yet after that the effluent no3 n concentration gradually decreased obviously until day 17 with concentration of 30 25 mg l this is because continuous high nh4 n concentrations of the influent inhibited the activity of nitrite oxidizing bacteria and promoting the metabolic activity of aob 37 meanwhile the effluent no2 n concentration increased gradually from initial 2 35 to 187 mg l on day 21 and then kept at around 180 mg l about 72 of the influent nh4 n converted to no2 n at the end of the enrichment process indicating the successful enrichment of aob in the sbr as previous studies reported on higher than 65 as an indicator of enrichment of aob 41 42 the enriched aob sludge with light yellow color observed in the photo shown in the following fig 5 also showed good settling performance with sv30 of 16 2 and a svi value of 91 4 ml gss the mlss and mlvss of the sludge in the sbr were measured as 1750 150 mg l and 1080 80 mg l respectively the microscope photo of the enriched aob sludge on day 28 fig s2 shows a thin and translucent sludge structure with a small amount of relatively dense flocs and there is no distinct filamentous substance can be seen within sight in order to further understand the microbiological composition of the enriched aob sludge high throughput sequencing analysis was performed on the sludge with results shown in table 1 otus ace chao and shannon are four positively correlated descriptors that represent high throughput results of the samples shannon and simpson are common descriptors utilized to describe the diversity of microflora and the high shannon value and the low simpson value mean high biodiversity comparing sample i with ii the decline of otus ace chao and shannon values and the increase of simpson value indicated the decrease of bacterial diversity undergoing the enrichment process the microbial composition at the phylum and genus levels of the sludge after inoculation and enrichment culture is shown in fig 3 fig 3a presents the phylum level results where sample i and ii were compared the relative abundance of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes rose from 55 and 17 to 69 and 18 respectively chloroflexi decreased most notably from 10 to 0 1 mainly due to the lack of organic carbon source 43 from fig 3a the species of bacteria decreased in phylum level and the relative abundance of dominant bacteria obviously increased fig 3b presents the genus level results and the relative abundance of unclassified genus was the highest in both sludge samples combined with the family tree and fig 3a the relative abundance of unclassified genus obviously reduced from 55 56 to 35 80 the relative abundance of other genus slightly reduced from 10 83 to 7 32 the result was that the relative abundances of bacterial genus in enriched aob sludge were well proportioned compared with that in inoculated sludge except for the unclassified genus fig 3b shows the changes of bacteria at genus level before and after the enrichment showing those whose relative abundances higher than 0 5 the dominant bacteria in the inoculated mixed sludge sample i were thauera 5 53 chryseolinea 3 98 and nitrospira 3 46 all belonging to gram negative bacteria and they are the main functional bacteria for denitrification phosphorus removal and oxidation of nitrite correspondingly 44 46 therefore quite limited amount of no2 n was observed in the sludge in the early stage of domestication before day 7 as shown in fig 2 while the no3 n concentration maintained at a high level in the enriched aob sludge sample ii the dominant bacterial genera were observed as rhodopseudomonas 10 01 thermomonas 6 79 rhodanobacter 5 47 nitrosospira 5 26 and nitrosomonas 2 48 among them rhodopseudomonas and thermomonas contribute to denitrification 47 50 rhodanobacter undertakes nitrification and denitrification 49 the subsequent two genuses are for ammonia oxidation reaction 51 nitrosomonas and nitrosospira both belonging to the nitrosomonadaceae family in betaproteobacteria increased from 0 007 to 7 74 after enrichment aob mainly belong to three genera including nitrosomonas nitrosospira and nitrosococcus 52 from the above high throughput test results the aob sludge has a high content of microorganisms for ammonia oxidation which was consistent with the domestication results as shown in fig 2 3 2 preparation of aob coated with composite numerous previous studies 22 25 26 have reported that microorganism s activity would be inhibited if the concentration of go in the environment is above 100 mg l however the effect of go below 100 mg l on microorganisms was controversial therefore the concentration of go is inferred as an important factor affecting the activity of aob activity to reveal the optimal go concentration for promoting aob activity six concentration gradients 0 5 15 30 40 and 50 mg l of go were selected to investigate the ammonia oxidation characteristics of aob with different go concentrations with the results presented in fig 4 the accumulated concentration of no2 n showed a positive correlation with the go concentration from 0 to 30 mg l in this study indicating gradually enhanced activity of aob and this consequence is consistent with the conclusion reported by ruiz et al 24 as the concentration of go increased to above 30 mg l e g 40 and 50 mg l the accumulation ratio of no2 n decreased significantly from 89 20 to below 36 92 obviously lower than the value of 78 78 in the environment without go and this phenomenon is consistent with the conclusion of jiang et al 29 thus based on the results 30 mg l was selected as the optimal concentration of go used in the subsequent composite material preparation process three aob samples were prepared to compare their apparent characteristics shown in fig 5 the sample in tube i was raw enriched aob served as a control the sample in tube ii was aob embedded into go and the sample in tube iii was covered with pdda go composite materials as shown aob precipitates in tube i looked light yellow the aob samples in tube ii showed a darker color than that in tube i and the color of precipitates in tube iii was the darkest it could be noted that color of the precipitate getting darker as the number of embedded layers increased at the same time the volume of aob precipitates in tube ii decreased slightly which might be attributed to the self wrinkled and porous structure of go 53 54 while the precipitate in tube iii significantly reduced which was primarily caused by the coagulative effect of pdda 55 another reason is that the positive charge pdda neutralized the negative charge of go the composite structure was more compact 56 fig 6 shows the zeta potential of various aob samples as known the bacterial surface exhibits a negative potential and the value of raw aob zeta potential was determined at 13 6 1 mv covered with oppositely charged pdda the surface potential of aob turned from an initial negative potential to a positive value of 7 8 0 7 mv as go was added as the outermost material to encapsulate aob sludge particles the zeta potential of aob with pdda go switched to 20 1 1 mv because of a large amount of negatively charged oxygen containing functional groups in go the ftir spectrum of go is shown in fig s3 the change of surface potential reflected the features of lbl assembly of colloidal particles aob is covered sequentially by oppositely charged materials due to the electrostatic force with specific structure shown in fig 1 the light yellow negatively charged aob is in the innermost layer which binds the positively charged pdda via electrostatic attraction and further attracts the negatively charged go through electrostatic attraction to form a composite structure 3 3 comparison of the aob activities in salty environments 3 3 1 effect of nacl concentrations previous studies indicated that activities of microorganisms decreased in the high salinity environments linarić et al 57 found that the domestication process of sludge became very slow or even tough under the condition of salinity over 30 g l when they studied the effect on the activated sludge caused by different concentrations of nacl and na2so4 ye et al 14 found that 1 02 of nacl caused the ammonia decomposition rate reduced by half in the salty wastewater in order to further study the effect of different nacl concentrations on ammonia oxidation capacities of aob and aob with composite materials six concentration gradients of nacl 0 5 were selected to test the tolerance of aob samples and the results are presented in fig 7 the nh4 n consumption ratio and no2 n accumulation ratio both decreased obviously as the nacl concentration increased from 0 to 5 for aob respectively the decrease trend of ratios indicated aob activity was inhibited by the enhanced salt concentration however those ratios were relatively stable for aob with pdda go when the concentration of nacl was lower than 3 without marked decreases and the decrease occurred as the concentration of nacl increased to above 4 with lower than 2 nacl concentrations the raw aob showed higher nh4 n consumption ratio and no2 n accumulation ratio than aob with pdda go because aob couldn t contact directly with nh4 n in water with pdda go composite materials coated on aob surface nh4 n was intercepted by the outer composite materials instead of being absorbed by aob resulting significant drop in both the conversion rate of nh4 n and the accumulation rate of no2 n compared with naked aob yet as the concentration of nacl increased to 3 the consumption ratio of nh4 n and the accumulation ratio of no2 n of aob with pdda go showed higher values than those of aob indicating the coating materials played a protective role for aob at this salt concentration the consumption ratio of nh4 n is 1 34 times that of uncoated aob and the accumulation ratio of no2 n of the former one is 1 40 times that of the latter as nacl concentration further increased to 4 5 nh4 n consumption ratio and no2 n accumulation ratio of both raw aob and aob with pdda go dropped sharply illustrating the penetration of protective materials by high salinity from the results it can be seen that aob with pdda go had a better nitrosification performance under a nacl concentration of 3 which is close to the average salt concentration of seawater 3 3 2 the protection of aob in 3 nacl by composite materials in order to further understand the protective effect of different coating materials e g pdda go and go on aob s activity 3 nacl was used in the experiment and the results of nh4 n consumption and no2 n accumulation are shown in fig 8 during the first 30 min the consumption rate of nh4 n of raw aob aob with go and aob with pdda go were 5 24 6 75 and 4 64 mg gvss h respectively while the accumulation no2 n rate were 1 23 1 39 and 2 48 mg gvss h respectively the highest nh4 n consumption rate of aob with go was possibly attribute to the strong negative charge of go to absorb positive charge nh4 n 26 the lowest nh4 n consumption rate of aob with pdda go was due to the obstacles from multiple layers on aob surfaces and compact composites including positively charged pdda nevertheless the accumulation rate of no2 n of aob with pdda go was the fastest which implied that pdda protected aob from the negative effect of a higher salt 32 56 after 120 min the nh4 n consumption of aob with pdda go became fastest and nh4 n concentration reduced to approximately 10 39 mg l at the end of reaction lower than the other two aob samples during the whole reaction process the order of accumulated no2 n concentration of varied aob samples was aob with pdda go aob with go raw aob the final no2 n concentration in the aob with pdda go sample was 8 57 mg l higher than the other two samples both around 6 mg l the accumulation concentration of no2 n nearly equaled to the consumption concentration of nh4 n it meant that under the protection of pdda and go multi layers the negative impact of high salinity on aob was partially offset and the ammonia oxidation activity of the main functional bacteria of 7 74 was promoted to some extent 3 3 3 discussion without the protection the activity of naked aob is affected markedly with increased salt concentration i e nacl in this study while the consumption of nh4 n and the accumulation of no2 n of aob with protection of pdda go materials have no obvious change within 0 3 salt concentration as shown in fig 7 on the one hand aob is immobilized inside the pdda and go multilayers and pdda and go tightly bound together by electrostatic force and the composite material combined the advantages of both pdda and go it had stronger binding ability with aob and mechanical strength 30 56 58 pdda is a strong positive polymer organic material without toxicity it can enhance the dispersion of go 33 and have higher cohesion to aob and go making the aob with pdda go has a certain resistance to external high salinity environment on the other hand because of obstacles from multilayers the penetration of nh4 is slowed down so those ratios are lower for aob with pdda go comparing with raw aob under low salt concentrations 0 2 which have not severely affected aob as shown in fig 8 when the concentration of salt increases to 4 5 aob might crumble rupture and lose the activity of ammonia oxidation due to the high osmotic pressure leading to consumption ratio of nh4 n and accumulation ratio of no2 n both close to around only 10 comparing the three aob samples in fig 8 it could be considered that the inhibitory to mass transferring caused by embedded materials was less than its positive promotion of aob protection at 3 nacl concentration and the protection of pdda go composite materials was better than only go composite material contributes a lot to promote the stability and activity of microorganisms this point was proved in other researches calcium alginate activated carbon composite materials were used to immobilize hydrocarbon degrading bacteria and the degradation rate was 33 higher than that of free bacteria 59 with polyvinyl alcohol ethyl orthosilicate immobilized trichosporon cutaneum the immobilized cells showed higher uptake rates of cu2 and cd2 than the free cells 60 in summary pdda go composite materials showed effective protective effect on aob in 3 nacl solution 4 conclusions in order to investigate the protection of composite materials on aob in a high salinity environment 3 pdda and go were selected to coat aob using lbl method in this study aob was quickly enriched in sbr using strain flow adding method and via controlling environmental factors including temperature ph value and influent substrate the consequence of high throughput sequencing showed that the relative abundance of nitrosomonadaceae significantly increased from 0 007 to 7 74 meant that aob was successfully enriched after coating with pdda and go the aob samples showed compact morphology with dark yellow color and a negative zeta potential of 20 1 1 mv lower than the raw enrich aob 13 6 1 mv it was found that activity of aob with pdda go was lower than that of raw aob at low nacl concentrations 0 2 because of the masking effect of embedded materials however the composite materials showed the effective protection on activity of aob at 3 nacl concentration comparison results showed that the no2 n accumulation ratio of aob with pdda go was 1 40 times that of raw aob while the protection effect of composite material on aob obviously weakened at the concentration of 4 5 nacl these results have certain practical guidance for the treatment of moderate high salinity nitrogen containing wastewater declaration of competing

12866,the potential of microalgae in wastewater treatment and resource utilization has received considerable interest for better outcomes in large scale cultivations it is usually essential to optimize the microalgal culture parameters in a sub pilot cultivation system herein a series of experiments were carried out to investigate the effects of photoperiod co2 concentration and aeration intensity on nutrients removal and biomass production of tetradesmus dimorphus under the 50 l culture scale the results showed that the removal rates of chemical oxygen demand codcr nh4 n and total phosphorus tp in primary effluent pe were 93 9 92 3 and 84 8 respectively compared with 15 h 9 h 15 h light and 9 h dark cycle the maximum chlorophyll a content of 2797 78 mg m3 was reached at 24 h 0 h the maximum microalgae biomass od680 0 56 was obtained when the co2 concentration was 200 ml min but co2 enrichment inhibited nitrogen removal at optimal aeration intensity 60 l h the highest chlorophyll a content was recorded on day 3 the removal rates of nh4 n and tp were 92 1 and 89 7 respectively graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords tetradesmus dimorphus wastewater cultivation nutrients removal data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction in recent years many countries and regions have gradually formulated more stringent effluent discharge standards for nitrogen and phosphorus to deal with water pollution problems such as eutrophication 1 however traditional nitrogen and phosphorus removal processes usually exist serious problems such as high energy consumption greenhouse gas emission and complex sludge disposal 2 therefore the development of more efficient and economical technologies for nitrogen and phosphorus removal has become a research hot spot for years 3 microalgae are a large diversity of unicellular microorganisms with relatively higher photosynthetic efficiency and shorter cultivation cycle than terrestrial plants 4 microalgae have the potential to efficiently utilize multiple nutrients in wastewater and reduce nitrogen and phosphorus to an undetectable level 5 more attractively microalgae can fix co2 via photosynthesis the harvested biomass can be converted to valuable by products such as lipids and carotenoids 6 as a result microalgae cultivation has been widely regarded as a promising strategy for nutrients removal and the production of valuable biomass by products the microalgal growth and nutrients removal are usually influenced by several key parameters such as nutrients concentration photoperiod co2 concentration and aeration intensity in general there are differences in microalgae growth and nutrients removal in different culture mediums 7 beydes and karapinar demonstrated that nutrient removal was mainly affected by the influent nh4 n concentration 8 compared to phosphorus concentration the effect of nitrogen concentration on microalgae growth was more significant 9 it has also been reported that the removal rate of nh4 n by chlamydomonas reinhardtii and chlorella vulgaris could be influenced by phosphorus concentration in the effluent of anaerobic treatment 10 light intensity and photoperiod are important factors that affect the growth rate and cell composition of microalgae 11 prolonged illumination promoted the biomass production of microalgal scenedesmus sp but inhibited lipid accumulation 12 tetraselmis sp was applied to the treatment of tannery wastewater the maximum biomass yield and pollutant removal rates were achieved under continuous illumination 13 co2 is another crucial parameter affecting the growth of microalgae different microalgae species have different optimal co2 levels for biomass growth 14 goncalves et al reported the optimum co2 levels of chlorella vulgaris pseudokirchneriella subcapitata cyanobacteria synechocystis salina and microcystis aeruginosa in the cultivation of c vulgaris s salina and m aeruginosa almost all nitrogen and phosphorus were removed after an additional supply of co2 15 aeration is vital for the suspended culture of microalgae which enables a sufficient cell intake of nutrients co2 and light energy 16 however aeration presents the main energy consumption in wastewater treatment processes and excessive dissolved oxygen do would inhibit microalgal growth 17 magdaong et al reported that cumulative biomass production specific growth rate overall biomass productivity and nitrate consumption of chlorella sorokiniana were significantly influenced by aeration rate the optimal culture results and lower culture costs were recorded at 0 1000 vvm 18 therefore optimizing the culture conditions of specific microalgal species can significantly improve nutrients removal and increases the

with 7 ml of 90 ethanol at 80 c for 2 min 25 the samples were treated with ultrasonic vibration in an ultrasonic cleaning machine for 10 min chlorophyll a was further extracted in the dark for 4 6 h

cultivation the growth of t dimorphus under different wastewater sources is shown in fig 2 a b t dimorphus growth in pe was more consistent with the typical growth curve than in se moreover the biomass of t dimorphus in pe was significantly higher compared to se the maximum chlorophyll a content was around 2800 mg m3 the microalgae in se rapidly entered the decline phase after a short period of growth but biomass increased again on day 6 probably due to the contamination of exogenous microalgae therefore pe was more suitable for the cultivation of t dimorphus than se tam and wong came to a similar conclusion suggesting that abundant nutrients in pe promoted microalgae growth 27 furthermore the c n p of pe is close to microalgae biomass 100 14 2 while se is limited by carbon 28 on the other hand there are abundant bacteria in pe and the growth of bacteria and microalgae promote each other in a symbiotic microalgae bacterial community bacteria decompose organic nutrients into small organic or inorganic substances that are conducive to the absorption of microalgae and release co2 to promote the photosynthesis of microalgae 29 interestingly biomass precipitation was found in pe which facilitated the harvesting of microalgae it might be due to the formation of bacterial algal aggregates or bioflocs by native bacteria and microalgae petrini et al found that microalgae bacterial bioflocculant existed in the unsterilized wastewater which ensured the excellent sedimentability of microalgae 30 in another study zhou et al demonstrated that bacterial quorum sensing molecule n acyl hyperserine lactone could induce microalgae aggregation which increased the sedimentation efficiency of chlorophyta sp by 41 31 the removal of nutrients is shown in fig 2 c e most fast growing microalgae usually prefer to use nh4 n in wastewater as a nitrogen source 32 in this study tn in the wastewater was mainly in the form of nh4 n so nh4 n concentration was investigated in nitrogen removal nh4 n concentration in pe was reduced to 2 1 mg l on day 5 attaining a removal rate of 93 9 the tp was decreased to 0 3 mg l on day 5 with a removal rate of 92 3 codcr was rapidly consumed in nearly 3 days with a removal rate of 84 8 wang et al cultivated chlorella sp in pe and found that the removal rates of nh4 n tn tp and cod were 74 7 90 6 and 56 5 on day 9 33 almomani and ormeci treat pe by using chlorella vulgaris neochloris oleoabundans and mixed indigenous microalgae mixed indigenous microalgae showed advantages in nutrients removal and the removal rates of nh4 n tdp and cod were 63 2 70 0 and 64 9 respectively 7 after one day of aeration the do of pe increased rapidly from 0 16 mg l to 7 32 mg l and finally stabilized at about 7 70 mg l fig 2 f with the growth of microalgae the ph in wastewater increased from 6 8 to 9 9 fig 2 g as we all know nh4 n will volatilize from wastewater at higher ph in this experiment the ph of wastewater was as high as 9 9 and there was an aeration operation which could explain the high nitrogen removal rate therefore pe was selected as the t dimorphus culture medium to investigate the effect of environmental factors 3 2 the effects of photoperiod on growth and nutrients removal of t dimorphus the growth curves of t dimorphus under different photoperiods are shown in fig 3 a b microalgae biomass of 24 h 0 h was dramatically higher than 15 h 9 h in addition the growth curve in the 24 h 0 h group rapidly reached a stable period when chandra et al studied the growth of scenedesmus obtusus under different photoperiods maximum chlorophyll accumulation was found under continuous illumination 34 however binnal and babu demonstrated that the optimal light intensity and photoperiod were 6000 lux and 16 h 8 h respectively 35 the reasons accounting for this inconsistency may be attributable to the higher light transmittance of the tubular bioreactor nutrients removal in different photoperiods is shown in fig 3 c e at a photoperiod of 24 h 0 h nutrients were rapidly consumed in nearly 5 days nh4 n declined to 2 1 mg l attaining a removal rate of 93 9 tp decreased to 0 3 mg l and the removal rate was 92 3 in contrast the residual concentrations of nh4 n and tp in the 15 h 9 h group on day 6 were 6 0 mg l and 1 4 mg l respectively codcr removal at the two photoperiods was essentially no different on day 3 the codcr removal rates of 15 h 9 h and 24 h 0 h were 82 1 and 84 8 respectively the light dark cycle plays an important role in the cell metabolism of microalgae prolonged light duration is conducive to the production of atp and h by autotrophic microalgae in the light reaction phase thus promoting the use of nutrients in wastewater to synthesize organic matter in the dark reaction phase therefore extending the photoperiod is beneficial to microalgae growth and nutrients removal 12 lee et al investigated the growth and nutrients removal of microalgae at the photoperiod of 12 h 12 h 36 h 12 h and 60 h 12 h the results indicated that the carbon removal rate increased with the extension of the dark cycle while nitrogen and phosphorus removal were negatively correlated with the dark cycle 36 in the study of praveen and loh biomass accumulation and nutrients removal capacity of microalgae were significantly improved after extending the photoperiod from 12 h 12 h to continuous illumination 37 it was also reported that the maximum biomass and astaxanthin accumulation of scenedesmus obliquus were recorded under the conditions of blue light high light intensity and 18 h 6 h while the highest nitrogen and phosphorus removal were obtained at a photoperiod of 24 h 0 h 38 it can be seen from fig 3 f g that the trends of do were similar in both photoperiods but the do of 24 h 0 h was slightly higher than 15 h 9 h at a photoperiod of 24 h 0 h ph increased continuously and reached 9 9 after 5 days of culture however there was no significant increase under 15 h 9 h the rise of ph might be related to the absorption of inorganic carbon by microalgae the stable range and change rule of ph under different photoperiods are consistent with the research results of su et al 39 3 3 the effects of co2 concentration on growth and nutrients removal of t dimorphus the growth curves of t dimorphus under different co2 concentrations are shown in fig 4 a b it can be observed that the microalgal growth was significantly affected by the co2 concentration the maximum biomass of microalgae was positively correlated with co2 concentration when enriched with 200 ml min co2 the maximum biomass of microalgae was twice as high as that without co2 enrichment however the time to reach the maximum biomass was prolonged with co2 enrichment excessive co2 might have led to a decrease in ph which in turn caused the acidification of chloroplasts and cytoplasmic compartments and the inactivation of key enzymes in the calvin cycle 40 this is similar to the results of satoh et al who found that the growth of chlorococcum littorale lagged for 1 4 days when microalgae were exposed to a high co2 concentration 41 fig 4 c e shows the removal of nutrients under different co2 concentrations the nh4 n removal rate decreased with increasing co2 concentration co2 enrichment might have led to a decrease in ph then the dissolution balance of nh3 and nh4 in wastewater moved in the direction of nh4 which reduced the efficiency of nh3 stripping in other words low ph inhibited the volatilization of nh4 n 42 the influences of co2 concentration on the removal of tp and codcr were negligible the phosphorus removal was not strictly linearly correlated with microalgae biomass similar findings were reported in the study of liu et al 43 there are three main phosphorus removal pathways in microalgal culture systems microalgae assimilation luxury uptake and chemical precipitation 44 it is speculated that phosphorus removal in this study involved t dimorphus assimilation luxury uptake and chemical precipitation among them luxury uptake was the major approach liu et al intermittently aerated 1 20 co2 into domestic wastewater to investigate the effect of co2 on chlochloas vulgaris the results showed that the maximum biomass and the optimal nitrogen and phosphorus removal rates were obtained under 10 co2 45 mehrabadi et al reported a direct relationship between biomass yield and co2 concentration in summer the maximum productivity was obtained under 10 co2 the high ph 8 5 would facilitate nh4 n volatilization and phosphate precipitation which resulted in the highest nutrient removal in the control group 46 chaudhary et al investigated nutrients removal by chlorella vulgaris atcc 13482 in a bubble column photobioreactor according to kinetic study data the nutrients removal of 5 co2 was better than air when 5 co2 was aerated the removal rates of cod nh4 n no3 n and po4 3 p were 84 6 88 0 72 0 and 92 8 respectively 47 the do of each experimental group was finally stabilized at 6 8 mg l which decreased with the increase in co2 concentration from fig 4 g co2 concentration had a significant influence on ph as co2 concentration increased the ph decreased to around 6 4 7 6 however the ph of the group without co2 enrichment increased to 10 eventually it might be due to a greater consumption than replenishment of co2 on the one hand dissolved co2 was consumed through microalgal assimilation and co2 stripping 48 49 on the other hand the aerated air contained only a small amount of co2 the dissolved co2 was not replenished in time as a result the decrease in co2 broke the equilibrium between dissolved co2 and hco3 leading to a continuous elevation of ph the tendency of ph is consistent with the results of qi et al 50 3 4 the effects of aeration intensity on growth and nutrients removal of t dimorphus the growth curves of t dimorphus under different aeration intensities are shown in fig 5 a b compared to non aeration aeration had a significant promotion effect on microalgae growth the maximum microalgae biomass under different aeration intensities was essentially the same however the maximum biomass was obtained three days earlier in aeration than in non aeration the removal of nh4 n by t dimorphus under different aeration intensities is shown in fig 5 c compared to the non aeration group the nitrogen removal rate presented significantly higher in the aeration groups the nh4 n removal rates of non aeration 60 l h and 160 l h on day 6 were 73 7 92 1 and 99 4 respectively it might be owing to the reason that aeration could strip out nh4 n from the system in the form of nh3 which could be strengthened with the increase of aeration intensity there were four main ways to remove nh4 n in the bacterial algae symbiosis system firstly the assimilation of bacteria and microalgae absorbs nh4 n into the organism secondly the nitrification of bacteria converts nh4 n into no3 n and no2 n thirdly the stripping effect of aeration releases nh3 into the atmosphere finally nh4 n forms precipitate with metal ions 51 aeration obviously promoted the removal of tp fig 5 d tp removal rates of non aerated 60 l h and 160 l h on day 6 were 75 7 89 7 and 90 2 respectively an increase in ph often means an increase in phosphorus removal when the ph was above 8 the microalgae system exhibited coagulation and adsorption of inorganic phosphate 52 the fastest increase in ph was observed at 60 l h it was speculated that some phosphorus removal after day 3 was through the formation of phosphate precipitation in the first 2 days the codcr removal rate was low in non aerated due to the low do fig 5 e however there was no remarkable difference in codcr removal on day 3 for different aeration intensities it was reported that nh4 n removal under agitation and aeration by native microalgae were 52 6 and 55 6 respectively phosphate removal rates were 67 and 20 4 respectively 53 the low removal of nitrogen and phosphorus could be attributed to the high aeration intensity 1 l s which resulted in the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus depending mainly on the assimilation of microorganisms choi demonstrated that cod removal bod removal biomass productivity and lipids productivity could be improved under dark aeration however the removal effects of tn and tp under light aeration were better than in other conditions 54 tang et al evaluated the effects of aeration levels 0 0 2 0 4 and 1 0 l min on the algal bacteria symbiotic system and traditional activated sludge system the results indicated that the removal rates of cod and nh4 n in the two systems increased with the increase of aeration 55 as shown in fig 5 f the do of non aeration was almost zero in the first 2 days and the microalgae solution presented a black and smelly phenomenon however do increased rapidly from day 3 and finally reached 20 mg l which is consistent with the results of hage et al 56 the do of aeration groups was maintained between 7 and 9 mg l from day 2 these phenomena indicated that the microalgae in wastewater released a large amount of molecular oxygen which supersaturated the do furthermore the stripping effect of aeration caused the supersaturated molecular oxygen to overflow the wastewater this conclusion was in accordance with the work of vijayaraghavan and goswami who considered that high do could be observed in microalgae ponds due to the rapid growth of microalgae producing oxygen the mixing or agitation of water dramatically accelerated the loss of o2 to the atmosphere 57 therefore to fully utilize the o2 released by microalgae and reduce the energy consumption in wastewater treatment it is recommended to perform aeration only a few hours before cultivation hage et al cultured the cold adapted microalgae monoraphidium sp dek 19 it was found that cell productivity and nutrient removal were not significantly different from continuous aeration when the microalgae were aerated 4 times a day for 1 h each 56 from fig 5 g the ph of 60 l h increased significantly while ph of 160 l h and non aerated were relatively stable it might be due to the consumption of dissolved co2 by photosynthesis which broke the equilibrium between dissolved co2 and hco3 leading to a continuous elevation of ph the ph of non aeration slowly increased due to the slow growth of microalgae when the aeration rate was higher 160 l h the aeration accelerated the dissolution of co2 from the air into the wastewater thus weakening the rise in ph 4 conclusions in this study single factor experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of photoperiod co2 concentration and aeration intensity on the growth and nutrients removal capacity of t dimorphus on a sub pilot scale the results showed that pe was more conducive to microalgae growth than se maximum biomass of t dimorphus could be increased by continuous illumination and elevated co2 concentration but high co2 levels had detrimental effects on nitrogen removal continuous illumination and high aeration intensity could shorten microalgae culture time and accelerate the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus therefore cultivating t dimorphus in pe

12866,the potential of microalgae in wastewater treatment and resource utilization has received considerable interest for better outcomes in large scale cultivations it is usually essential to optimize the microalgal culture parameters in a sub pilot cultivation system herein a series of experiments were carried out to investigate the effects of photoperiod co2 concentration and aeration intensity on nutrients removal and biomass production of tetradesmus dimorphus under the 50 l culture scale the results showed that the removal rates of chemical oxygen demand codcr nh4 n and total phosphorus tp in primary effluent pe were 93 9 92 3 and 84 8 respectively compared with 15 h 9 h 15 h light and 9 h dark cycle the maximum chlorophyll a content of 2797 78 mg m3 was reached at 24 h 0 h the maximum microalgae biomass od680 0 56 was obtained when the co2 concentration was 200 ml min but co2 enrichment inhibited nitrogen removal at optimal aeration intensity 60 l h the highest chlorophyll a content was recorded on day 3 the removal rates of nh4 n and tp were 92 1 and 89 7 respectively graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords tetradesmus dimorphus wastewater cultivation nutrients removal data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction in recent years many countries and regions have gradually formulated more stringent effluent discharge standards for nitrogen and phosphorus to deal with water pollution problems such as eutrophication 1 however traditional nitrogen and phosphorus removal processes usually exist serious problems such as high energy consumption greenhouse gas emission and complex sludge disposal 2 therefore the development of more efficient and economical technologies for nitrogen and phosphorus removal has become a research hot spot for years 3 microalgae are a large diversity of unicellular microorganisms with relatively higher photosynthetic efficiency and shorter cultivation cycle than terrestrial plants 4 microalgae have the potential to efficiently utilize multiple nutrients in wastewater and reduce nitrogen and phosphorus to an undetectable level 5 more attractively microalgae can fix co2 via photosynthesis the harvested biomass can be converted to valuable by products such as lipids and carotenoids 6 as a result microalgae cultivation has been widely regarded as a promising strategy for nutrients removal and the production of valuable biomass by products the microalgal growth and nutrients removal are usually influenced by several key parameters such as nutrients concentration photoperiod co2 concentration and aeration intensity in general there are differences in microalgae growth and nutrients removal in different culture mediums 7 beydes and karapinar demonstrated that nutrient removal was mainly affected by the influent nh4 n concentration 8 compared to phosphorus concentration the effect of nitrogen concentration on microalgae growth was more significant 9 it has also been reported that the removal rate of nh4 n by chlamydomonas reinhardtii and chlorella vulgaris could be influenced by phosphorus concentration in the effluent of anaerobic treatment 10 light intensity and photoperiod are important factors that affect the growth rate and cell composition of microalgae 11 prolonged illumination promoted the biomass production of microalgal scenedesmus sp but inhibited lipid accumulation 12 tetraselmis sp was applied to the treatment of tannery wastewater the maximum biomass yield and pollutant removal rates were achieved under continuous illumination 13 co2 is another crucial parameter affecting the growth of microalgae different microalgae species have different optimal co2 levels for biomass growth 14 goncalves et al reported the optimum co2 levels of chlorella vulgaris pseudokirchneriella subcapitata cyanobacteria synechocystis salina and microcystis aeruginosa in the cultivation of c vulgaris s salina and m aeruginosa almost all nitrogen and phosphorus were removed after an additional supply of co2 15 aeration is vital for the suspended culture of microalgae which enables a sufficient cell intake of nutrients co2 and light energy 16 however aeration presents the main energy consumption in wastewater treatment processes and excessive dissolved oxygen do would inhibit microalgal growth 17 magdaong et al reported that cumulative biomass production specific growth rate overall biomass productivity and nitrate consumption of chlorella sorokiniana were significantly influenced by aeration rate the optimal culture results and lower culture costs were recorded at 0 1000 vvm 18 therefore optimizing the culture conditions of specific microalgal species can significantly improve nutrients removal and increases the process economics at present most literature investigating the effect of culture conditions was conducted on a lab scale large scale commercial applications have not been realized where problems often arise when trying to scale up the cultivation 19 yuvraj et al concluded that co2 light nutrients and ph lead to low cell density which limits the large scale culture of microalgae and the commercialization of high value microalgal products 20 before large scale culture it is essential to carry out pilot or sub pilot scale experiments examining the growth characteristics and treatment

tdp and cod were 63 2 70 0 and 64 9 respectively 7 after one day of aeration the do of pe increased rapidly from 0 16 mg l to 7 32 mg l and finally stabilized at about 7 70 mg l fig 2 f with the growth of microalgae the ph in wastewater increased from 6 8 to 9 9 fig 2 g as we all know nh4 n will volatilize from wastewater at higher ph in this experiment the ph of wastewater was as high as 9 9 and there was an aeration operation which could explain the high nitrogen removal rate therefore pe was selected as the t dimorphus culture medium to investigate the effect of environmental factors 3 2 the effects of photoperiod on growth and nutrients removal of t dimorphus the growth curves of t dimorphus under different photoperiods are shown in fig 3 a b microalgae biomass of 24 h 0 h was dramatically higher than 15 h 9 h in addition the growth curve in the 24 h 0 h group rapidly reached a stable period when chandra et al studied the growth of scenedesmus obtusus under different photoperiods maximum chlorophyll accumulation was found under continuous illumination 34 however binnal and babu demonstrated that the optimal light intensity and photoperiod were 6000 lux and 16 h 8 h respectively 35 the reasons accounting for this inconsistency may be attributable to the higher light transmittance of the tubular bioreactor nutrients removal in different photoperiods is shown in fig 3 c e at a photoperiod of 24 h 0 h nutrients were rapidly consumed in nearly 5 days nh4 n declined to 2 1 mg l attaining a removal rate of 93 9 tp decreased to 0 3 mg l and the removal rate was 92 3 in contrast the residual concentrations of nh4 n and tp in the 15 h 9 h group on day 6 were 6 0 mg l and 1 4 mg l respectively codcr removal at the two photoperiods was essentially no different on day 3 the codcr removal rates of 15 h 9 h and 24 h 0 h were 82 1 and 84 8 respectively the light dark cycle plays an important role in the cell metabolism of microalgae prolonged light duration is conducive to the production of atp and h by autotrophic microalgae in the light reaction phase thus promoting the use of nutrients in wastewater to synthesize organic matter in the dark reaction phase therefore extending the photoperiod is beneficial to microalgae growth and nutrients removal 12 lee et al investigated the growth and nutrients removal of microalgae at the photoperiod of 12 h 12 h 36 h 12 h and 60 h 12 h the results indicated that the carbon removal rate increased with the extension of the dark cycle while nitrogen and phosphorus removal were negatively correlated with the dark cycle 36 in the study of praveen and loh biomass accumulation and nutrients removal capacity of microalgae were significantly improved after extending the photoperiod from 12 h 12 h to continuous illumination 37 it was also reported that the maximum biomass and astaxanthin accumulation of scenedesmus obliquus were recorded under the conditions of blue light high light intensity and 18 h 6 h while the highest nitrogen and phosphorus removal were obtained at a photoperiod of 24 h 0 h 38 it can be seen from fig 3 f g that the trends of do were similar in both photoperiods but the do of 24 h 0 h was slightly higher than 15 h 9 h at a photoperiod of 24 h 0 h ph increased continuously and reached 9 9 after 5 days of culture however there was no significant increase under 15 h 9 h the rise of ph might be related to the absorption of inorganic carbon by microalgae the stable range and change rule of ph under different photoperiods are consistent with the research results of su et al 39 3 3 the effects of co2 concentration on growth and nutrients removal of t dimorphus the growth curves of t dimorphus under different co2 concentrations are shown in fig 4 a b it can be observed that the microalgal growth was significantly affected by the co2 concentration the maximum biomass of microalgae was positively correlated with co2 concentration when enriched with 200 ml min co2 the maximum biomass of microalgae was twice as high as that without co2 enrichment however the time to reach the maximum biomass was prolonged with co2 enrichment excessive co2 might have led to a decrease in ph which in turn caused the acidification of chloroplasts and cytoplasmic compartments and the inactivation of key enzymes in the calvin cycle 40 this is similar to the results of satoh et al who found that the growth of chlorococcum littorale lagged for 1 4 days when microalgae were exposed to a high co2 concentration 41 fig 4 c e shows the removal of nutrients under different co2 concentrations the nh4 n removal rate decreased with increasing co2 concentration co2 enrichment might have led to a decrease in ph then the dissolution balance of nh3 and nh4 in wastewater moved in the direction of nh4 which reduced the efficiency of nh3 stripping in other words low ph inhibited the volatilization of nh4 n 42 the influences of co2 concentration on the removal of tp and codcr were negligible the phosphorus removal was not strictly linearly correlated with microalgae biomass similar findings were reported in the study of liu et al 43 there are three main phosphorus removal pathways in microalgal culture systems microalgae assimilation luxury uptake and chemical precipitation 44 it is speculated that phosphorus removal in this study involved t dimorphus assimilation luxury uptake and chemical precipitation among them luxury uptake was the major approach liu et al intermittently aerated 1 20 co2 into domestic wastewater to investigate the effect of co2 on chlochloas vulgaris the results showed that the maximum biomass and the optimal nitrogen and phosphorus removal rates were obtained under 10 co2 45 mehrabadi et al reported a direct relationship between biomass yield and co2 concentration in summer the maximum productivity was obtained under 10 co2 the high ph 8 5 would facilitate nh4 n volatilization and phosphate precipitation which resulted in the highest nutrient removal in the control group 46 chaudhary et al investigated nutrients removal by chlorella vulgaris atcc 13482 in a bubble column photobioreactor according to kinetic study data the nutrients removal of 5 co2 was better than air when 5 co2 was aerated the removal rates of cod nh4 n no3 n and po4 3 p were 84 6 88 0 72 0 and 92 8 respectively 47 the do of each experimental group was finally stabilized at 6 8 mg l which decreased with the increase in co2 concentration from fig 4 g co2 concentration had a significant influence on ph as co2 concentration increased the ph decreased to around 6 4 7 6 however the ph of the group without co2 enrichment increased to 10 eventually it might be due to a greater consumption than replenishment of co2 on the one hand dissolved co2 was consumed through microalgal assimilation and co2 stripping 48 49 on the other hand the aerated air contained only a small amount of co2 the dissolved co2 was not replenished in time as a result the decrease in co2 broke the equilibrium between dissolved co2 and hco3 leading to a continuous elevation of ph the tendency of ph is consistent with the results of qi et al 50 3 4 the effects of aeration intensity on growth and nutrients removal of t dimorphus the growth curves of t dimorphus under different aeration intensities are shown in fig 5 a b compared to non aeration aeration had a significant promotion effect on microalgae growth the maximum microalgae biomass under different aeration intensities was essentially the same however the maximum biomass was obtained three days earlier in aeration than in non aeration the removal of nh4 n by t dimorphus under different aeration intensities is shown in fig 5 c compared to the non aeration group the nitrogen removal rate presented significantly higher in the aeration groups the nh4 n removal rates of non aeration 60 l h and 160 l h on day 6 were 73 7 92 1 and 99 4 respectively it might be owing to the reason that aeration could strip out nh4 n from the system in the form of nh3 which could be strengthened with the increase of aeration intensity there were four main ways to remove nh4 n in the bacterial algae symbiosis system firstly the assimilation of bacteria and microalgae absorbs nh4 n into the organism secondly the nitrification of bacteria converts nh4 n into no3 n and no2 n thirdly the stripping effect of aeration releases nh3 into the atmosphere finally nh4 n forms precipitate with metal ions 51 aeration obviously promoted the removal of tp fig 5 d tp removal rates of non aerated 60 l h and 160 l h on day 6 were 75 7 89 7 and 90 2 respectively an increase in ph often means an increase in phosphorus removal when the ph was above 8 the microalgae system exhibited coagulation and adsorption of inorganic phosphate 52 the fastest increase in ph was observed at 60 l h it was speculated that some phosphorus removal after day 3 was through the formation of phosphate precipitation in the first 2 days the codcr removal rate was low in non aerated due to the low do fig 5 e however there was no remarkable difference in codcr removal on day 3 for different aeration intensities it was reported that nh4 n removal under agitation and aeration by native microalgae were 52 6 and 55 6 respectively phosphate removal rates were 67 and 20 4 respectively 53 the low removal of nitrogen and phosphorus could be attributed to the high aeration intensity 1 l s which resulted in the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus depending mainly on the assimilation of microorganisms choi demonstrated that cod removal bod removal biomass productivity and lipids productivity could be improved under dark aeration however the removal effects of tn and tp under light aeration were better than in other conditions 54 tang et al evaluated the effects of aeration levels 0 0 2 0 4 and 1 0 l min on the algal bacteria symbiotic system and traditional activated sludge system the results indicated that the removal rates of cod and nh4 n in the two systems increased with the increase of aeration 55 as shown in fig 5 f the do of non aeration was almost zero in the first 2 days and the microalgae solution presented a black and smelly phenomenon however do increased rapidly from day 3 and finally reached 20 mg l which is consistent with the results of hage et al 56 the do of aeration groups was maintained between 7 and 9 mg l from day 2 these phenomena indicated that the microalgae in wastewater released a large amount of molecular oxygen which supersaturated the do furthermore the stripping effect of aeration caused the supersaturated molecular oxygen to overflow the wastewater this conclusion was in accordance with the work of vijayaraghavan and goswami who considered that high do could be observed in microalgae ponds due to the rapid growth of microalgae producing oxygen the mixing or agitation of water dramatically accelerated the loss of o2 to the atmosphere 57 therefore to fully utilize the o2 released by microalgae and reduce the energy consumption in wastewater treatment it is recommended to perform aeration only a few hours before cultivation hage et al cultured the cold adapted microalgae monoraphidium sp dek 19 it was found that cell productivity and nutrient removal were not significantly different from continuous aeration when the microalgae were aerated 4 times a day for 1 h each 56 from fig 5 g the ph of 60 l h increased significantly while ph of 160 l h and non aerated were relatively stable it might be due to the consumption of dissolved co2 by photosynthesis which broke the equilibrium between dissolved co2 and hco3 leading to a continuous elevation of ph the ph of non aeration slowly increased due to the slow growth of microalgae when the aeration rate was higher 160 l h the aeration accelerated the dissolution of co2 from the air into the wastewater thus weakening the rise in ph 4 conclusions in this study single factor experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of photoperiod co2 concentration and aeration intensity on the growth and nutrients removal capacity of t dimorphus on a sub pilot scale the results showed that pe was more conducive to microalgae growth than se maximum biomass of t dimorphus could be increased by continuous illumination and elevated co2 concentration but high co2 levels had detrimental effects on nitrogen removal continuous illumination and high aeration intensity could shorten microalgae culture time and accelerate the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus therefore cultivating t dimorphus in pe is regarded as a promising strategy for nutrients removal and resource recovery declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

12867,in the present study the performance of a circular flow constructed wetland cfcw 1 1 cfcw circular flow constructed wetland system was assessed for organics and total phosphorus removal from fertilizer plant effluent the cfcw system has five media compartments containing gravel slag iron and a mixture of sand and zeolite as the media substrates synthetic fertilizer wastewater having initial cod 520 98 8 27 mg l was fed to the wetland maintaining hydraulic loading rate of 6 945 l m2 h typha angustifolia was used as the wetland vegetation the phase 1 of the study included three cycles with influent phosphorus concentrations 10 20 and 30 mg l respectively without step feeding and effluent recirculation the phase 2 of the study included two cycles with influent phosphorus concentrations of 20 and 30 mg l and application of step feeding and effluent recirculation strategies the average phosphorus removal efficiencies of the system in three cycles of phase 1 were 85 16 88 and 81 95 respectively along with average cod removal of 87 48 87 65 and 86 84 respectively the average phosphorus removal efficiencies of the system in two cycles of phase 2 were 89 01 and 90 22 respectively along with average cod removal of 91 6 and 91 23 respectively the step feeding and effluent recirculation strategies have shown satisfactory improvement in organics and total phosphorus removal performance of the cfcw system however future long term studies are recommended involving an unplanted control system step feeding and effluent recirculation in varying compartments and varying combination of media substrates for improving the design and performance of the cfcw systems graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords constructed wetland fertilizer plant effluent slag iron total phosphorus removal dissolved oxygen data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction phosphorus is essential for every life forms of the globe it is a fundamental component of nucleic acids adenosine di phosphate and tri phosphates adps atps and also sugar phosphates 1 central pollution control board cpcb india recognised and reported the chemical fertilizer industry as one of the gross polluting industry 2 the main constituents of the chemical fertilizer plant effluents are organics ammonia alcohols fluorides suspended solids nitrates and phosphorus 3 the nature of effluent streams varies in terms of their constituents and complexity 4 nitrogen n and phosphorus p are essential parts of a water ecosystem but when present in excessive amount lead to eutrophication hypoxia potential toxicity and ecosystem imbalance phosphorus has been identified as the primary and limiting parameter for the eutrophication of lotic and lentic surface waters 1 since the 1980s constructed wetland cw has emerged as an environmentally friendly low cost technology for the treatment of domestic wastewater and an effective decentralized wastewater treatment scheme 5 7 cws have also been studied for treating specific wastewaters like swine wastewater 8 industrial wastewater 4 and campus wastewater 5 the primary processes that are involved in phosphorus removal are adsorption plant uptake substrates complexation and chemical precipitation 9 various materials such as slag iron zeolite sand and alum sludge have been used in cws as media substrates and extensive studies have been performed 10 14 researchers have also focused on novel designs 8 and operational strategies like step feeding intermittent aeration 15 to enhance cw performance in terms of nutrient removal conventional vertical flow cws are associated with some intrinsic drawbacks while treating wastewater containing high nutrient loading in most cases dissolved oxygen is generally exhausted in the system resulting in lower phosphorus removal and unsatisfactory nitrification and organic removal a cfcw system overcomes these problems by facilitating partial recirculation of wastewater and exposing the wastewater to open atmosphere which allows replenishment of dissolved oxygen also it offers flexibility in involving step feeding and combination of media substrates in various compartments for performance enhancement and removal of specific contaminants circular flow constructed wetland cfcw was designed and introduced by peng et al 8 considering the benefits of partial flow recirculation within the wetland systems for better removal of nutrients particularly total nitrogen 16 peng et al 8 obtained 93 efficiency in terms of organics ammonia and phosphorus removal while treating secondary high strength synthetic swine wastewater after peng et al 8 very few researchers have focused on the application of cfcw for treating different types of wastewaters and available works of literature on cfcw are scarce one of the major drawbacks of cws is a higher area footprint which makes its application difficult particularly where population density is high and land is very expensive in view of this more studies involving novel designs and operational strategies are warranted for improving the performance of cws and reducing their area footprint the main objectives of the present study include organics and total phosphorus removal performance evaluation of circular flow corridor constructed wetland system for synthetic fertilizer plant effluent involving step feeding and effluent recirculation strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup a laboratory scale model of circular flow constructed wetland cfcw system was fabricated and

identical dimensions of 0 3 m length 0 3 m width 0 6 m depth these compartments together formed an annular flow corridor for the wastewater first compartment was divided into influent dilution zone of 0 2 m 0 3 m 0 6 m and effluent zone of 0 1 m 0 3 m 0 6 m the influent cum dilution zone dz and effluent zone ez were separated by an overflow weir ez was provided for collecting the treated effluent from mc5 and dz was provided for influent feeding in phase 1 and for influent feeding after mixing raw sfww and recirculated flow in phase 2 the rest of the five compartments were porous media compartments designated as mc1 to mc5 respectively figs 1 2 the treated wastewater from mc5 was moved into the effluent zone ez and then to the influent cum dilution zone dz through the overflow weir the water from dz was used during effluent recirculation in phase 2 for reducing the high nutrient load for recirculation 2 5 l treated wastewater was allowed to flow over the weir from ez to dz and mixed with 5 l raw sfww resulting into 50 recirculation ratio and then fed to mc1 by pump gravels of 10 12 mm size were provided as drainage layers of 7 cm and 10 cm at top and bottom of each media compartment to support media materials and for better distribution of the wastewater in the compartments the depth of the main media materials i e slag iron river sand and zeolite were kept 25 cm in all five media compartments in first compartment mc1 third compartment mc3 and fifth compartment mc5 combination of 12 5 cm zeolite and 12 5 cm sand layers were provided as the media material a 25 cm thick slag iron layers were provided as the main media material in second compartment mc2 and fourth compartment mc4 substrates in the porous media compartments sand zeolite and slag iron were selected due to their high phosphorus adsorption capabilities the media compartments were provided for supporting plant growth microbial activities and acting as adsorbent layers for tp removal from wastewater 2 2 wetland vegetation typha angustifolia plants were used as the wetland vegetation for the study this plant was selected due to their easy availability in kurukshetra and adaptability to the local environmental conditions use of typha plants in constructed wetlands for treatment of variety of wastewaters is well documented in the literature due to benefits of increased phytoremediation compact and expansive root formation and higher nutrient uptake 17 19 the macrophyte was collected from local marshlands stem density was kept constant at 2 per compartment initially i e 1 stem per 0 045 m2 however due to favourable growth conditions the stem density increased after the end of the maturation period throughout the study new sprouts were noticed to have emerged in the media compartments the average height of macrophytes was about 50 60 cm at the time of plantation in the cfcw 2 3 wetland media locally available gravel 10 12 mm were provided as top and bottom drainage layers in various media compartments the zeolite of 13x grade has been used by many researchers for removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from aqueous solutions 20 21 the porosity of the zeolite used in constructed materials generally varies in between 40 to 50 8 22 in present study zeolite grade 13x of 4 8 mm size and packing density 0 68 to 0 73 g cm3 was used in the selected media compartments river sand passing through 600 μ sieve and having a packing density of 1860 g m3 was used as media in selected compartments slag iron in gravel form 15 25 mm with a density of 2 8 g cm3 was collected from a local foundry factory bd alloys located at ambala haryana india and used in selected media compartments 2 4 synthetic fertilizer wastewater sfww the synthetic fertilizer wastewater was prepared daily by dissolving an appropriate quantity of analytical grade chemicals in tap water the initial cod and ph values in raw sfww ranged 520 98 8 27 mg l and 7 15 0 11 respectively the composition of sfww is given in table 1 2 5 operational details of the wetland system the wetland system was operated in a continuous mode sfww was prepared daily in the laboratory and fed into the reactor immediately after preparation using peristaltic pump during phase 1 5 l of raw sfww was directly fed into mc1 thrice in a day as no recirculation was adopted in phase 2 of the study 2 5 l treated wastewater from effluent zone was mixed with raw sfww in the dz compartment and then fed to mc1 the loading rate was kept constant throughout the study at a rate of 15 l per day and it resulted in a hydraulic loading rate hlr of 6 945 l m2 h in mc1 the hydraulic retention time hrt of the cfcw system was 48 h throughout the study period for individual media compartments hrt was found to be 9 6 h from mc1 by the action of gravity wastewater flowed downward and reached the next media zone mc2 through an interconnected rectangular opening of 0 05 m 0 3 m provided at the bottom the water level in mc2 increased gradually and after reaching the top surface wastewater entered into mc3 from there wastewater flowed gravitationally to the fourth media zone mc4 through the bottom opening from the top surface of mc4 wastewater went to the last media zone mc5 and moved downward the effluent from mc5 finally reached the effluent zone ez and from there to the influent cum dilution zone dz through the overflow weir wetland effluent samples were collected from sampling taps provided in media compartments and effluent zone sample collection taps were provided at the bottom of the down flow chambers mc1 mc3 mc5 and dz and at top of the up flow chambers mc2 mc4 and ez 14 days of inoculation period was provided to the wetland system to adapt to the novel environmental conditions during this period domestic wastewater from the oxidation pond of nit kurukshetra was collected and fed into the reactor after that 14 days of acclimation period was allowed and during the acclimation period cod and total phosphorus concentrations were gradually increased in the synthetic feed wastewater so that the wetland system doesn t become susceptible to toxicity cod and phosphorous concentrations were increased from 150 to 500 mg l and 1 to 10 mg l respectively during the acclimation period the operational period of the cfcw system was considered after the acclimation period at the start of the study the operational period was divided into two phases namely phase 1 and phase 2 the phase 1 of the study was continued for 45 days and involved three cycles i e cycle 1 p1c1 cycle 2 p1c2 and cycle 3 p1c3 with increasing total phosphorus concentrations of 10 20 and 30 mg l respectively in the influent sfww each cycle was continued for 15 days no acclimation was provided in between the cycles to check the adaptability of the system against shock nutrient tp loading no recirculation and step feeding were provided during the phase 1 of the study phase 2 was started immediately after completion of phase 1 and no acclimation was provided in between the phases phase 2 of the study was conducted in 30 days and it involved two cycles i e cycle 1 p2c1 and cycle 2 p2c2 with influent total phosphorus concentrations of 20 and 30 mg l in raw sfww respectively each cycle was continued for 15 days no acclimation was provided between the cycles of phase 2 also the recirculation and step feeding were provided during the phase 2 of the study for effluent recirculation treated sfww was mixed with raw sfww in dz to maintain a recirculation ratio of 50 and was fed to mc1 for step feeding 11 25 l and 3 75 l mixed sfww from dz were fed directly to mc1 and mc3 respectively daily resulting into a 3 1 step feeding ratio the operational conditions of the cfcw is stipulated in table 2 2 6 analytical methods the complete study was conducted in 110 days 30 days of inoculation and acclimation and then 75 days of operational period and performance monitoring samples from each zone dz mc1 mc2 mc3 mc4 and mc5 were collected during operational period and were analyzed for ph do cod and total phosphorus tp frequency of the sample collection for cod and tp analysis was 48 h which resulted into 22 number of samplings during phase 1 and 15 number of samplings during phase 2 samples were collected and analyzed in triplicates however do and ph analysis was done regularly for the effluents of all the media compartments the ph was measured using a digital ph meter thermo scientific orion 5 star the do was measured using the modified winkler method the cod was measured using the closed reflux method the tp was measured using the vanadomolybdophosphoric acid colorimetric method all parameters were analyzed according to the procedures provided in the standard methods 23 cod and tp removal efficiency in of different compartments were determined using eq 1 1 efficiency co ce 100 co where co is the cod or tp concentration in mg l of the influent and ce is the cod or tp concentration of respective effluents mass removal rate g m2 d for cod and tp in different cycles during the study was calculated using eq 2 2 mass removal rate co ce a x hrt where co and ce are cod of raw sfww and effluent of ez in g l a is the surface area of the complete cfcw reactor 0 54 m2 and hrt is the hydraulic retention time of the system which is 2 days performance enhancement data has been statistically analyzed using anova analysis tool in ms excel 3 results and discussions 3 1 removal of organics removal of organics was determined by assessing the chemical oxygen demand cod of the synthetic feed and effluents from different media compartments the cod of raw sfww in the present study was 520 98 8 27 mg l and the mean cod in the reactor effluent was 56 6 10 787 mg l the cod in the influent was mainly contributed by sodium acetate the average cod removal efficiency of the system in phase 1 was found to be 87 46 in phase 2 where performance enhancement strategies were adopted the average overall cod removal efficiency was increased from 87 46 to 92 the efficiency improvement may be attributed to the increased organic availability and increased activity of the heterotrophic microorganisms 24 the organic availability increased due to the effluent recirculation and the step feeding strategies the increase in organic availability and the ambient temperature both helped in increased microbial activities and better biodegradation of the organics the cod profiles of different compartment effluents along with the influent sfww in phase 1 and phase 2 are shown in fig 3 the cod removal efficiencies of various media compartments are given in table 3 in phase 1 p1c1 p1c2 and p1c3 cod removal efficiency of mc3 was found to be 1 20 to 6 96 which is considerably low this might be a combined effect of reduced microbial activity which in turn can be associated with very low do concentration and also the low organics availability in mc3 average do in the effluent of mc3 throughout the study period was 0 91 mg l however the efficiency improved in mc4 and mc5 possibly due to increase in do level due to increased amount of available organics in phase 2 considerable improvement in cod removal efficiency of mc4 and mc5 can be observed compared to phase 1 throughout the study average cod removal efficiencies for mc1 and mc2 were 38 93 and 60 07 respectively and average effluent do levels of mc1 and mc2 were found to be 0 12 mg l and 1 19 mg l respectively which might be indicative of do consumption by heterotrophic microorganisms for organic degradation similarly mc4 and mc5 have rendered average cod removal efficiencies of 32 27 and 30 06 throughout study period corresponding to average effluent do levels of 2 72 mg l and 1 15 mg l do reduction in mc5 compared to preceding chamber mc4 also indicates do utilization for organic degradation variation in mean ambient temperature during the study period inoculation and acclimation phase 1 and phase 2 is shown in fig 4 the average organic loading rates in p1c1 p1c2 p1c3 p2c1 and p2c2 cycles of the study were 86 08 g m2 d 88 g m2 d 85 27 g m2 d 86 67 g m2 d and 88 11 g m2 d respectively the average mass removal rates for cod in p1c1 p1c2 p1c3 p2c1 and p2c2 were found to be 12 44 g m2 d 12 69 g m2 d 12 54 g m2 d 12 56 g m2 d and 13 07 g m2 d respectively peng et al 8 reported an organic loading rate of 5 3 16 8 g m2 d with a similar circular flow corridor reactor benny and chakraborty 25 operated their wetland reactor with an organic loading rate of around 63 g m2 d in both the studies 90 organic removal was reported chen et al 26 obtained 61 cod removal with a loading of 17 g m2 d while treating the effluents of chemical steel and food processing industries calheiros et al 27 applied constructed wetlands for treating tannery wastewater with an organic loading rate of 33 160 g m2 d but the efficiency was 41 73 evidently the reactor set up which was used for the current study is capable of operating under a higher organic loading rate and achieving similar or better organic removal compared to other reactor arrangements however in this study synthetic wastewater was used where the cod was contributed by sodium acetate and recalcitrant organics were absent in the feed unlike many original industrial wastewaters 3 2 dissolved oxygen and ph the final effluent from the cfcw as well as effluents from all the media chambers were analyzed for dissolved oxygen do the mean do level in the final reactor effluent was 3 54 0 26 mg l not much deviation was observed in the do levels of the intermediate chambers in mc1 mc3 and mc5 the average do levels were 0 12 0 05 0 91 0 22 mg l and 1 13 0 2 mg l respectively in mc2 and mc4 the dissolved oxygen levels were 1 19 0 25 mg l and 2 40 0 39 mg l respectively an increase in do was observed in the effluents of the up flow media chambers mc2 mc4 where water surface came in contact with the open atmosphere and also some do contribution was done by the typha roots 28 the do level in the study was found higher than reported by peng et al 8 which might have been facilitated by the typha plants having large root density and high oxygen extrusion capability among most of the macrophytes 29 chand et al 30 reported an improved phosphorus removal efficiency from 22 63 to 80 50 by maintaining a do level of 2 74 5 66 mg l using tidal flow operation and effluent recirculation in a gravitational flow vertical cw planted with colocasia esculenta li et al 31 applied intermittent aeration to maintain a do level of 3 mg l in a horizontal flow cw planted with hydrocotyle vulgaris and obtained tp removal efficiency of 94 in the current study the continuous operation was performed with a mean influent ph range of 6 9 to 7 3 the mean effluent ph in the whole study was 8 23 0 11 the mean ph values of various compartments are shown in table 4 effluent ph of mc1 mc3 and mc5 varied from 7 89 to 8 44 jeon et al 32 reported that without ph control anaerobic microbial phosphorus uptake can increase the ph up to 8 4 ph is highly influential for successful phosphorus removal from wastewaters and aquatic solutions liu et al 33 observed optimum initial ph for higher biological phosphorus removal to be within 6 4 to 7 2 phosphorus adsorption by sand zeolite and slag iron media is also affected by ph variation park et al 14 reported near neutral ph suitable for phosphorus adsorption by iron slag and in the case of sand adsorption equilibrium ph was found to be 8 2 8 56 34 3 3 removal of phosphorus in the current study influent total phosphorus concentration in p1c1 p1c2 and p1c3 cycles were 10 20 and 30 mg l respectively the average total phosphorus in the ez during p1c1 p1c2 and p1c3 cycles were 1 48 2 47 and 3 41 mg l and accordingly mean phosphorous removal efficiencies were 85 16 88 and 81 95 respectively in phase 2 effluent recirculation and step feeding strategies were adopted simultaneously to reduce effluent total phosphorus levels in this phase the influent total phosphorus concentration was varied from 20 to 30 mg l the concentration of 10 mg l was omitted as the removal efficiency for that was satisfactory in phase 1 in the p2c1 cycle mean total phosphorus removal was increased from 88 to 89 01 with a feed concentration of 20 mg l in the p2c2 cycle an increase in phosphorous removal from 81 95 to 90 22 showed considerable improvement in performance besides the performance enhancement strategies higher phosphorus removal was achieved due to the presence of slag iron and zeolite which have a high affinity to soluble phosphorus presence of typha angustifolia in the cfcw might also have played a positive role for tp removal in the cfcw system these species of macrophytes are extensively used in constructed wetland systems for their nutrient uptake capability mustafa and scholz 19 have reported 10 mg kg of phosphorus uptake by typha angustifolia during the summer periods in another study by maucieri et al 18 it was found that typha angustifolia was capable of 21 8 phosphorus uptake another major factor which governs the adsorption of phosphorus from aquatic solution via phosphate complexation is the presence of charged ions on the surface of iron compounds 35 36 presence of charged particles on the surface of slag iron and on the surface of the media compartments which was made of iron sheet might also have been a driving factor in tp removal from the sfww the mass removal rates for tp during p1c1 p1c2 and p1c3 was found to be 0 24 g m2 d 0 49 g m2 d and 0 74 g m2 d respectively during p2c1 and p2c2 mass removal rates of tp were found to be 0 49 g m2 d and 0 75 g m2 d respectively the mean effluent total phosphorus concentration in various compartments during phase 1 and phase 2 is shown in fig 5 the mean total phosphorus concentration in various media chambers is shown in table 5 during the study the effluent total phosphorus level in mc3 was observed more than that in the influent this trend continued during all cycles in both phases of the study the probable reason for this may be desorption of soluble phosphorus from the substrate media into the water column the major driving factors behind this may be low dissolved oxygen level 1 0 mg l and the low influent phosphorus concentration as both of these conditions favour phosphorus desorption from river sediments and substrate media 37 39 other than desorption some prevailing conditions in mc3 might have also led to lower biological uptake and higher release of phosphorus the cod tp ratio might also have played a role for reduction of tp removal efficiency in mc3 the mean cod tp ratio for mc3 in phase 1 and phase 2 of the study were 27 32 and 23 72 respectively generally a cod tp ratio 40 is desirable for inhibiting the phosphorus release and effective biological phosphorus uptake 40 41 low do 1 0 mg l inside mc3 chamber also played its role for low biological phosphorus removal and increased phosphorus release the preferable do level for biological phosphorus removal is 2 to 5 mg l as reported by previous studies in which phosphate accumulating organisms paos are able to remove phosphorus from the system via aerobic anaerobic sequestration 40 42 prevailing ph 7 86 8 13 of mc3 in low do conditions also have affected biological phosphorus release boswell et al 43 and liu et al 44 reported enhanced rate of biological release of phosphorus with a ph increment up to 8 5 fig 6 shows the relative total phosphorus removal efficiencies of various media chambers corresponding to their respective effluent dissolved oxygen levels many studies are documented in literature where artificial aeration was adopted to reduce phosphorus desorption from the media and increase the removal efficiency 45 47 however multiple studies have also documented significant amount of phosphorus removal without aeration by applying different wetland configurations and substrate media and vegetation although the influent tp concentration were significantly low as compared to the current study baldovi et al 48 obtained total phosphorus removal of 82 to 95 while operating a horizontal flow free water surface constructed wetland having hrt 3 days to 10 days the influent phosphorus levels were 2 to 2 9 mg l and eichhornia crassipes was used as wetland vegetation wang et al 49 investigated the possibilities of phosphorus removal from saline wastewater using intertidal wetland sediments as microbial source in vertical gravitational flow constructed wetland they have observed significantly higher total phosphorus removal efficiency of about 90 in salt free environment as compared to total phosphorus removal efficiency of about 70 in saline environment by maintaining 3 day hrt dias et al 50 observed maximum phosphorus removal of 92 from piggery wastewater in cw with phragmytes australis and 68 in cw planted with typha latifolia the hrt of the system was varied between 7 and 15 days liu et al 51 operated lab scale electrolysis integrated cw planted with cyperus alternifolius to treat synthetic domestic sewage having a phosphorus concentration of 3 mg l and reported 74 to 99 removal of total phosphorus at a hrt of 3 days 4 conclusions conventional cws are already in use for treating variety of wastewaters but these systems have some intrinsic limitations particularly for treating wastewater containing high nutrient loading in the past attempts have been made to develop various types of cws including cfcw for overcoming limitations of conventional cws and improving performance for treating variety of wastewaters in the present study performance of a circular flow constructed wetland cfcw system was assessed for organics and phosphorus removal from synthetic fertilizer wastewater with high tp concentration the study involved evaluation of step feeding and effluent recirculation strategies for performance enhancement of cfcw system gravel slag iron and a mixture of sand and zeolite were used as the media substrates in compartments of cfcw system in phase 1 the cfcw system performed well under increased tp shock loading from 10 to 20 mg l and removal efficiency decreased from 85 16 to 81 95 at a tp concentration of 30 mg l however in the second phase p2c2 cycle with an influent shock loading of 30 mg l the phosphorous removal efficiency of the cfcw system was increased to 90 22 compared to 81 95 in p1c3 cycle of phase 1 which shows that dilution of sfww by recirculation and increased organic availability in mc3 and consecutive compartments due to step feeding played a positive role to withstand the shock loading and increased the tp removal efficiency of the cfcw presence of zeolite and slag iron as media substrate also have possibly played a major role for handling the higher tp loading of sfww both of these materials are effective in removal of phosphorus through adsorption and co precipitation the mean ph of the cfcw system varied between 7 16 and 8 32 which is effective for phosphorus adsorption and also microbial phosphorus uptake dissolved oxygen in the effluents of down flow media chambers was found to be 1 0 mg l and in the effluents of up flow media chambers it varied between 1 19 and 3 54 mg l which is a combined result of oxygen diffusion by typha roots and exposure of the wastewater to the open atmosphere the organics removal was satisfactory in both the phases however during phase 2 the cod removal efficiency was significantly increased p value 0 0011 to 91 from 87 in phase 1 which is a possible result of the performance enhancement strategies and increase in the ambient temperature leading toward enhanced heterotrophic microbial activity overall cfcw system with recirculation and step feeding have shown improved performance for treatment of sfww with high phosphorus loading and stability against shock nutrient loading the configurational advantages of cfcw for providing effluent recirculation and maintaining the do balance in the water were proved to be effective mc2 containing slag iron as main media substrate was found most effective with average cod and tp removal efficiency of 60 07 and 52 12 throughout the study in future more studies are warranted to identify role of plants media substrates effluent recirculation and step feeding in phosphorous removal for further improvement in design and performance of cfcw system future studies may involve a control cfcw system without plants step feeding in varying number of compartments varying recirculation ratio and varying combination of media substrates considering the surface charge monitoring

12867,in the present study the performance of a circular flow constructed wetland cfcw 1 1 cfcw circular flow constructed wetland system was assessed for organics and total phosphorus removal from fertilizer plant effluent the cfcw system has five media compartments containing gravel slag iron and a mixture of sand and zeolite as the media substrates synthetic fertilizer wastewater having initial cod 520 98 8 27 mg l was fed to the wetland maintaining hydraulic loading rate of 6 945 l m2 h typha angustifolia was used as the wetland vegetation the phase 1 of the study included three cycles with influent phosphorus concentrations 10 20 and 30 mg l respectively without step feeding and effluent recirculation the phase 2 of the study included two cycles with influent phosphorus concentrations of 20 and 30 mg l and application of step feeding and effluent recirculation strategies the average phosphorus removal efficiencies of the system in three cycles of phase 1 were 85 16 88 and 81 95 respectively along with average cod removal of 87 48 87 65 and 86 84 respectively the average phosphorus removal efficiencies of the system in two cycles of phase 2 were 89 01 and 90 22 respectively along with average cod removal of 91 6 and 91 23 respectively the step feeding and effluent recirculation strategies have shown satisfactory improvement in organics and total phosphorus removal performance of the cfcw system however future long term studies are recommended involving an unplanted control system step feeding and effluent recirculation in varying compartments and varying combination of media substrates for improving the design and performance of the cfcw systems graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords constructed wetland fertilizer plant effluent slag iron total phosphorus removal dissolved oxygen data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction phosphorus is essential for every life forms of the globe it is a fundamental component of nucleic acids adenosine di phosphate and tri phosphates adps atps and also sugar phosphates 1 central pollution control board cpcb india recognised and reported the chemical fertilizer industry as one of the gross polluting industry 2 the main constituents of the chemical fertilizer plant effluents are organics ammonia alcohols fluorides suspended solids nitrates and phosphorus 3 the nature of effluent streams varies in terms of their constituents and complexity 4 nitrogen n and phosphorus p are essential parts of a water ecosystem but when present in excessive amount lead to eutrophication hypoxia potential toxicity and ecosystem imbalance phosphorus has been identified as the primary and limiting parameter for the eutrophication of lotic and lentic surface waters 1 since the 1980s constructed wetland cw has emerged as an environmentally friendly low cost technology for the treatment of domestic wastewater and an effective decentralized wastewater treatment scheme 5 7 cws have also been studied for treating specific wastewaters like swine wastewater 8 industrial wastewater 4 and campus wastewater 5 the primary processes that are involved in phosphorus removal are adsorption plant uptake substrates complexation and chemical precipitation 9 various materials such as slag iron zeolite sand and alum sludge have been used in cws as media substrates and extensive studies have been performed 10 14 researchers have also focused on novel designs 8 and operational strategies like step feeding intermittent aeration 15 to enhance cw performance in terms of nutrient removal conventional vertical flow cws are associated with some intrinsic drawbacks while treating wastewater containing high nutrient loading in most cases dissolved oxygen is generally exhausted in the system resulting in lower phosphorus removal and unsatisfactory nitrification and organic removal a cfcw system overcomes these problems by facilitating partial recirculation of wastewater and exposing the wastewater to open atmosphere which allows replenishment of dissolved oxygen also it offers flexibility in involving step feeding and combination of media substrates in various compartments for performance enhancement and removal of specific contaminants circular flow constructed wetland cfcw was designed and introduced by peng et al 8 considering the benefits of partial flow recirculation within the wetland systems for better removal of nutrients particularly total nitrogen 16 peng et al 8 obtained 93 efficiency in terms of organics ammonia and phosphorus removal while treating secondary high strength synthetic swine wastewater after peng et al 8 very few researchers have focused on the application of cfcw for treating different types of wastewaters and available works of literature on cfcw are scarce one of the major drawbacks of cws is a higher area footprint which makes its application difficult particularly where population density is high and land is very expensive in view of this more studies involving novel designs and operational strategies are warranted for improving the performance of cws and reducing their area footprint the main objectives of the present study include organics and total phosphorus removal performance evaluation of circular flow corridor constructed wetland system for synthetic fertilizer plant effluent involving step feeding and effluent recirculation strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup a laboratory scale model of circular flow constructed wetland cfcw system was fabricated and kept in an open area near oxidation pond in the national institute of technology kurukshetra india for investigating its capability to treat wastewater having high phosphorus loading the experimental cfcw system was rectangular in shape with overall dimensions 0 9 m length 0 6 m width 0 6 m depth and plan area of 0 54 m2 it has six alternate vertical down flow and up flow compartments each with identical dimensions of 0 3 m length 0 3 m width 0 6 m depth these compartments together formed an annular flow corridor for the wastewater first compartment was divided into influent dilution zone of 0 2 m 0 3 m 0 6 m and effluent zone of 0 1 m 0 3 m 0 6 m the influent cum dilution zone dz and effluent zone ez were separated by an overflow weir ez was provided for collecting the treated effluent from mc5 and dz was provided for influent feeding in phase 1 and for influent feeding after mixing raw sfww and recirculated flow in phase 2 the rest of the five compartments were porous media compartments designated as mc1 to mc5 respectively figs 1 2 the treated wastewater from mc5 was moved into the effluent zone ez and then to the influent cum dilution zone dz through the overflow weir the water from dz was used during effluent recirculation in phase 2 for reducing the high nutrient load for recirculation 2 5 l treated wastewater was allowed to flow over the weir from ez to dz and mixed with 5 l raw sfww resulting into 50 recirculation ratio and then fed to mc1 by pump gravels of 10 12 mm size were provided as drainage layers of 7 cm and 10 cm at top and bottom of each media compartment to support media materials and for better distribution of the wastewater in the compartments the depth of the main media materials i e slag iron river sand and zeolite were kept 25 cm in all five media compartments in first compartment mc1 third compartment mc3 and fifth compartment mc5 combination of 12 5 cm zeolite and 12 5 cm sand layers were provided as the media material a 25 cm thick slag iron layers were provided as the main media material in second compartment mc2 and fourth compartment mc4 substrates in the porous media compartments sand zeolite and slag iron were selected due to their high phosphorus adsorption capabilities the media compartments were provided for supporting plant growth microbial activities and acting as adsorbent layers for tp removal from wastewater 2 2 wetland vegetation typha angustifolia plants were used as the wetland vegetation for the study this plant was selected due to their easy availability in kurukshetra and adaptability to the local environmental conditions use of typha plants in constructed wetlands for treatment of variety of wastewaters is well documented in the literature due to benefits of increased phytoremediation compact and expansive root formation and higher nutrient uptake 17 19 the macrophyte was collected from local marshlands stem density was kept constant at 2 per compartment initially i e 1 stem per 0 045 m2 however due to favourable growth conditions the stem density increased after the end of the maturation period throughout the study new sprouts were noticed to have emerged in the media compartments the average height of macrophytes was about 50 60 cm at the time of plantation in the cfcw 2 3 wetland media locally available gravel 10 12 mm were provided as top and bottom drainage layers in various media compartments the zeolite of 13x grade has been used by many researchers for removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from aqueous solutions 20 21 the porosity of the zeolite used in constructed materials generally varies in between 40 to 50 8 22 in present study zeolite grade 13x of 4 8 mm size and packing density 0 68 to 0 73 g cm3 was used in the selected media compartments river sand passing through 600 μ sieve and having a packing density of 1860 g m3 was used as media in selected compartments slag iron in gravel form 15 25 mm with a density of 2 8 g cm3 was collected from a local foundry factory bd alloys located at ambala haryana india and used in selected media compartments 2 4 synthetic fertilizer wastewater sfww the synthetic fertilizer wastewater was prepared daily by dissolving an appropriate quantity of analytical grade chemicals in tap water the initial cod and ph values in raw sfww ranged 520 98 8 27 mg l and 7 15 0 11 respectively the composition of sfww is given in table 1 2 5 operational details of the wetland system the wetland system was operated in a continuous mode sfww was prepared daily in the laboratory and fed into the reactor immediately after preparation using peristaltic pump during phase 1 5 l of raw sfww was directly fed into mc1 thrice in a day as no recirculation was adopted in phase 2 of the study 2 5 l treated wastewater from effluent zone was mixed with raw sfww in the dz compartment and then fed to mc1 the loading rate was kept constant throughout the study at a rate of 15 l per day and it resulted in a hydraulic loading rate hlr of 6 945 l m2 h in mc1 the hydraulic retention time hrt of the cfcw system was 48 h throughout the study period for individual media compartments hrt was found to be 9 6 h from mc1 by the action of gravity wastewater flowed downward and reached the next media zone mc2 through an interconnected rectangular opening of 0 05 m 0 3 m provided at the bottom the water level in mc2 increased gradually and after reaching the top surface wastewater entered into mc3 from there wastewater flowed gravitationally to the fourth media zone mc4 through the bottom opening from the top surface of mc4 wastewater went to the last media zone mc5 and moved downward the effluent from mc5 finally reached the effluent zone ez and from there to the influent cum dilution zone dz through the overflow weir wetland effluent samples were collected from sampling taps provided in media compartments and effluent zone sample collection taps were provided at the bottom of the down flow chambers mc1 mc3 mc5 and dz and at top of the up flow chambers mc2 mc4 and ez 14 days of inoculation period was provided to the wetland system to adapt to the novel environmental conditions during this period domestic wastewater from the oxidation pond of nit kurukshetra was collected and fed into the reactor after that 14 days of acclimation period was allowed and during the acclimation period cod and total phosphorus concentrations were gradually increased in the synthetic feed wastewater so that the wetland system doesn t become susceptible to toxicity cod and phosphorous concentrations were increased from 150 to 500 mg l and 1 to 10 mg l respectively during the acclimation period the operational period of the cfcw system was considered after the acclimation period at the start of the study the operational period was divided into two phases namely phase 1 and phase 2 the phase 1 of the study was continued for 45 days and involved three cycles i e cycle 1 p1c1 cycle 2 p1c2 and cycle 3 p1c3 with increasing total phosphorus concentrations of 10 20 and 30 mg l respectively in the influent sfww each cycle was continued for 15 days no acclimation was provided in between the cycles to check the adaptability of the system against shock nutrient tp loading no recirculation and step feeding were provided during the phase 1 of the study phase 2 was started immediately after completion of phase 1 and no acclimation was provided in between the phases phase 2 of the study was conducted in 30 days and it involved two cycles i e cycle 1 p2c1 and cycle 2 p2c2 with influent total phosphorus concentrations of 20 and 30 mg l in raw sfww respectively each cycle was continued for 15 days no acclimation was provided between the cycles of phase 2 also the recirculation and step feeding were provided during the phase 2 of the study for effluent recirculation treated sfww was mixed with raw sfww in dz to maintain a recirculation ratio of 50 and was fed to mc1 for step feeding 11 25 l and 3 75 l mixed sfww from dz were fed directly to mc1 and mc3 respectively daily resulting into a 3 1 step feeding ratio the operational conditions of the cfcw is stipulated in table 2 2 6 analytical methods the complete study was conducted in 110 days 30 days of inoculation and acclimation and then 75 days of operational period and performance monitoring samples from each zone dz mc1 mc2 mc3 mc4 and mc5 were collected during operational period and were analyzed for ph do cod and total phosphorus tp frequency of the sample collection for cod and tp analysis was 48 h which resulted into 22 number of samplings during phase 1 and 15 number of samplings during phase 2 samples were collected and analyzed in triplicates however do and ph analysis was done regularly for the effluents of all the media compartments the ph was measured using a digital ph meter thermo scientific orion 5 star the do was measured using the modified winkler method the cod was measured using the closed reflux method the tp was measured using the vanadomolybdophosphoric acid colorimetric method all parameters were analyzed according to the procedures provided in the standard methods 23 cod and tp removal efficiency in of different compartments were determined using eq 1 1 efficiency co ce 100 co where co is the cod or tp concentration in mg l of the influent and ce is the cod or tp concentration of respective effluents mass removal rate g m2 d for cod and tp in different cycles during the study was calculated using eq 2 2 mass removal rate co ce a x hrt where co and ce are cod of raw sfww and effluent of ez in g l a is the surface area of the complete cfcw reactor 0 54 m2 and hrt is the hydraulic retention time of the system which is 2 days performance enhancement data has been statistically analyzed using anova analysis tool in ms excel 3 results and discussions 3 1 removal of organics removal of organics was determined by assessing the chemical oxygen demand cod of the synthetic feed and effluents from different media compartments the cod of raw sfww in the present study was 520 98 8 27 mg l and the mean cod in the reactor effluent was 56 6 10 787 mg l the cod in the influent was mainly contributed by sodium acetate the average cod removal efficiency of the system in phase 1 was found to be 87 46 in phase 2 where performance enhancement strategies were adopted the average overall cod removal efficiency was increased from 87 46 to 92 the efficiency improvement may be attributed to the increased organic availability and increased activity of the heterotrophic microorganisms 24 the organic availability increased due to the effluent recirculation and the step feeding strategies the increase in organic availability and the ambient temperature both helped in increased microbial activities and better biodegradation of the organics the cod profiles of different compartment effluents along with the influent sfww in phase 1 and phase 2 are shown in fig 3 the cod removal efficiencies of various media compartments are given in table 3 in phase 1 p1c1 p1c2 and p1c3 cod removal efficiency of mc3 was found to be 1 20 to 6 96 which is considerably low this might be a combined effect of reduced microbial activity which in turn can be associated with very low do concentration and also the low organics availability in mc3 average do in the effluent of mc3 throughout the study period was 0 91 mg l however the efficiency improved in mc4 and mc5 possibly due to increase in do level due to increased amount of available organics in phase 2 considerable improvement in cod removal efficiency of mc4 and mc5 can be observed compared to phase 1 throughout the study average cod removal efficiencies for mc1 and mc2 were 38 93 and 60 07 respectively and average effluent do levels of mc1 and mc2 were found to be 0 12 mg l and 1 19 mg l respectively which might be indicative of do consumption by heterotrophic microorganisms for organic degradation similarly mc4 and mc5 have rendered average cod removal efficiencies of 32 27 and 30 06 throughout study period corresponding to average effluent do levels of 2 72 mg l and 1 15 mg l do reduction in mc5 compared to preceding chamber mc4 also indicates do utilization for organic degradation variation in mean ambient temperature during the study period inoculation and acclimation phase 1 and phase 2 is shown in fig 4 the average organic loading rates in p1c1 p1c2 p1c3 p2c1 and p2c2 cycles of the study were 86 08 g m2 d 88 g m2 d 85 27 g m2 d 86 67 g m2 d and 88 11 g m2 d respectively the average mass removal rates for cod in p1c1 p1c2 p1c3 p2c1 and p2c2 were found to be 12 44 g m2 d 12 69 g m2 d 12 54 g m2 d 12 56 g m2 d and 13 07 g m2 d respectively peng et al 8 reported an organic loading rate of 5 3 16 8 g m2 d with a similar circular flow corridor reactor benny and chakraborty 25 operated their wetland reactor with an organic loading rate of around 63 g m2 d in both the studies 90 organic removal was reported chen et al 26 obtained 61 cod removal with a loading of 17 g m2 d while treating the effluents of chemical steel and food processing industries calheiros et al 27 applied constructed wetlands for treating tannery wastewater with an organic loading rate of 33 160 g m2 d but the efficiency was 41 73 evidently the reactor set up which was used for the current study is capable of operating under a higher organic loading rate and achieving similar or better organic removal compared to other reactor arrangements however in this study synthetic wastewater was used where the cod was contributed by sodium acetate and recalcitrant organics were absent in the feed unlike many original industrial wastewaters 3 2 dissolved oxygen and ph the final effluent from the cfcw as well as effluents from all the media chambers were analyzed for dissolved oxygen do the mean do level in the final reactor effluent was 3 54 0 26 mg l not much deviation was observed in the do levels of the intermediate chambers in mc1 mc3 and mc5 the average do levels were 0 12 0 05 0 91 0 22 mg l and 1 13 0 2 mg l respectively in mc2 and mc4 the dissolved oxygen levels were 1 19 0 25 mg l and 2 40 0 39 mg l respectively an increase in do was observed in the effluents of the up flow media chambers mc2 mc4 where water surface came in contact with the open atmosphere and also some do contribution was done by the typha roots 28 the do level in the study was found higher than reported by peng et al 8 which might have been facilitated by the typha plants having large root density and high oxygen extrusion capability among most of the macrophytes 29 chand et al 30 reported an improved phosphorus removal efficiency from 22 63 to 80 50 by maintaining a do level of 2 74 5 66 mg l using tidal flow operation and effluent recirculation in a gravitational flow vertical cw planted with colocasia esculenta li et al 31 applied intermittent aeration to maintain a do level of 3 mg l in a horizontal flow cw planted with hydrocotyle vulgaris and obtained tp removal efficiency of 94 in the current study the continuous operation was performed with a mean influent ph range of 6 9 to 7 3 the mean effluent ph in the whole study was 8 23 0 11 the mean ph values of various compartments are shown in table 4 effluent ph of mc1 mc3 and mc5 varied from 7 89 to 8 44 jeon et al 32 reported that without ph control anaerobic microbial phosphorus uptake can increase the ph up to 8 4 ph is highly influential for successful phosphorus removal from wastewaters and aquatic solutions liu et al 33 observed optimum initial ph for higher biological phosphorus removal to be within 6 4 to 7 2 phosphorus adsorption by sand zeolite and slag iron media is also affected by ph variation park et al 14 reported near neutral ph suitable for phosphorus adsorption by iron slag and in the case of sand adsorption equilibrium ph was found to be 8 2 8 56 34 3 3 removal of phosphorus in the current study influent total phosphorus concentration in p1c1 p1c2 and p1c3 cycles were 10 20 and 30 mg l respectively the average total phosphorus in the ez during p1c1 p1c2 and p1c3 cycles were 1 48 2 47 and 3 41 mg l and accordingly mean phosphorous removal efficiencies were 85 16 88 and 81 95 respectively in phase 2 effluent recirculation and step feeding strategies were adopted simultaneously to reduce effluent total phosphorus levels in this phase the influent total phosphorus concentration was varied from 20 to 30 mg l the concentration of 10 mg l was omitted as the removal efficiency for that was satisfactory in phase 1 in the p2c1 cycle mean total phosphorus removal was increased from 88 to 89 01 with a feed concentration of 20 mg l in the p2c2 cycle an increase in phosphorous removal from 81 95 to 90 22 showed considerable improvement in performance besides the performance enhancement strategies higher phosphorus removal was achieved due to the presence of slag iron and zeolite which have a high affinity to soluble phosphorus presence of typha angustifolia in the cfcw might also have played a positive role for tp removal in the cfcw system these species of macrophytes are extensively used in constructed wetland systems for their nutrient uptake capability mustafa and scholz 19 have reported 10 mg kg of phosphorus uptake by typha angustifolia during the summer periods in another study by maucieri et al 18 it was found that typha angustifolia was capable of 21 8 phosphorus uptake another major factor which governs the adsorption of phosphorus from aquatic solution via phosphate complexation is the presence of charged ions on the surface of iron compounds 35 36 presence of charged particles on the surface of slag iron and on the surface of the media compartments which was made of iron sheet might also have been a driving factor in tp removal from the sfww the mass removal rates for tp during p1c1 p1c2 and p1c3 was found to be 0 24 g m2 d 0 49 g m2 d and 0 74 g m2 d respectively during p2c1 and p2c2 mass removal rates of tp were found to be 0 49 g m2 d and 0 75 g m2 d respectively the mean effluent total phosphorus concentration in various compartments during phase 1 and phase 2 is shown in fig 5 the mean total phosphorus concentration in various media chambers is shown in table 5 during the study the effluent total phosphorus level in mc3 was observed more than that in the influent this trend continued during all cycles in both phases of the study the probable reason for this may be desorption of soluble phosphorus from the substrate media into the water column the major driving factors behind this may be low dissolved oxygen level 1 0 mg l and the low influent phosphorus concentration as both of these conditions favour phosphorus desorption from river sediments and substrate media 37 39 other than desorption some prevailing conditions in mc3 might have also led to lower biological uptake and higher release of phosphorus the cod tp ratio might also have played a role for reduction of tp removal efficiency in mc3 the mean cod tp ratio for mc3 in phase 1 and phase 2 of the study were 27 32 and 23 72 respectively generally a cod tp ratio 40 is desirable for inhibiting the phosphorus release and effective biological phosphorus uptake 40 41 low do 1 0 mg l inside mc3 chamber also played its role for low biological phosphorus removal and increased phosphorus release the preferable do level for biological phosphorus removal is 2 to 5 mg l as reported by previous studies in which phosphate accumulating organisms paos are able to remove phosphorus from the system via aerobic anaerobic sequestration 40 42 prevailing ph 7 86 8 13 of mc3 in low do conditions also have affected biological phosphorus release boswell et al 43 and liu et al 44 reported enhanced rate of biological release of phosphorus with a ph increment up to 8 5 fig 6 shows the relative total phosphorus removal efficiencies of various media chambers corresponding to their respective effluent dissolved oxygen levels many studies are documented in literature where artificial aeration was adopted to reduce phosphorus desorption from the media and increase the removal efficiency 45 47 however multiple studies have also documented significant amount of phosphorus removal without aeration by applying different wetland configurations and substrate media and vegetation although the influent tp concentration were significantly low as compared to the current study baldovi et al 48 obtained total phosphorus removal of 82 to 95 while operating a horizontal flow free water surface constructed wetland having hrt 3 days to 10 days the influent phosphorus levels were 2 to 2 9 mg l and eichhornia crassipes was used as wetland vegetation wang et al 49 investigated the possibilities of phosphorus removal from saline wastewater using intertidal wetland sediments as microbial source in vertical gravitational flow constructed wetland they have observed significantly higher total phosphorus removal efficiency of about 90 in salt free environment as compared to total phosphorus removal efficiency of about 70 in saline environment by maintaining 3 day hrt dias et al 50 observed maximum phosphorus removal of 92 from piggery wastewater in cw with phragmytes australis and 68 in cw planted with typha latifolia the hrt of the system was varied between 7 and 15 days liu et al 51 operated lab scale electrolysis integrated cw planted with cyperus alternifolius to treat synthetic domestic sewage having a phosphorus concentration of 3 mg l and reported 74 to 99 removal of total phosphorus at a hrt of 3 days 4 conclusions conventional cws are already in use for treating variety of wastewaters but these systems have some intrinsic limitations particularly for treating wastewater containing high nutrient loading in the past attempts have been made to develop various types of cws including cfcw for overcoming limitations of conventional cws and improving performance for treating variety of wastewaters in the present study performance of a circular flow constructed wetland cfcw system was assessed for organics and phosphorus removal from synthetic fertilizer wastewater with high tp concentration the study involved evaluation of step feeding and effluent recirculation strategies for performance enhancement of cfcw system gravel slag iron and a mixture of sand and zeolite were used as the media substrates in compartments of cfcw system in phase 1 the cfcw system performed well under increased tp shock loading from 10 to 20 mg l and removal efficiency decreased from 85 16 to 81 95 at a tp concentration of 30 mg l however in the second phase p2c2 cycle with an influent shock loading of 30 mg l the phosphorous removal efficiency of the cfcw system was increased to 90 22 compared to 81 95 in p1c3 cycle of phase 1 which shows that dilution of sfww by recirculation and increased organic availability in mc3 and consecutive compartments due to step feeding played a positive role to withstand the shock loading and increased the tp removal efficiency of the cfcw presence of zeolite and slag iron as media substrate also have possibly played a major role for handling the higher tp loading of sfww both of these materials are effective in removal of phosphorus through adsorption and co precipitation the mean ph of the cfcw system varied between 7 16 and 8 32 which is effective for phosphorus adsorption and also microbial phosphorus uptake dissolved oxygen in the effluents of down flow media chambers was found to be 1 0 mg l and in the effluents of up flow media chambers it varied between 1 19 and 3 54 mg l which is a combined result of oxygen diffusion by typha roots and exposure of the wastewater to the open atmosphere the organics removal was satisfactory in both the phases however during phase 2 the cod removal efficiency was significantly increased p value 0 0011 to 91 from 87 in phase 1 which is a possible result of the performance enhancement strategies and increase in the ambient temperature leading toward enhanced heterotrophic microbial activity overall cfcw system with recirculation and step feeding have shown improved performance for treatment of sfww with high phosphorus loading and stability against shock nutrient loading the configurational advantages of cfcw for providing effluent recirculation and maintaining the do balance in the water were proved to be effective mc2 containing slag iron as main media substrate was found most effective with average cod and tp removal efficiency of 60 07 and 52 12 throughout the study in future more studies are warranted to identify role of plants media substrates effluent recirculation and step feeding in phosphorous removal for further improvement in design and performance of cfcw system future studies may involve a control cfcw system without plants step feeding in varying number of compartments varying recirculation ratio and varying combination of media substrates considering the surface charge monitoring

12868,a new type of adsorption material polypyrrole modified mushroom residue activated carbon ppy mrac was prepared by compounding mr in agricultural waste and ppy using a dipping method a characterization analysis indicated that ppy mrac is a mesoporous material containing functional groups such as hydroxyl oh and coordinated chloride cl ions the efficacy of ppy mrac for removing sulfate so4 2 and nitrate no3 from water was studied the experimental results showed that the adsorption of so4 2 and no3 by ppy mrac followed the langmuir and pseudo second order kinetic models with maximum adsorption capacities of 40 00 and 51 55 mg g respectively the removal rates of 500 mg l so4 2 at 35 c and 50 mg l no3 at 15 c were 31 53 and 82 65 respectively a thermodynamic analysis revealed adsorption of so4 2 and no3 via spontaneous endothermic and exothermic reactions respectively the adsorption mechanisms were mainly electrostatic attraction ion exchange and hydrogen bond the ppy mrac could be regenerated six times after being eluted by naoh low cost ppy mrac had a high removal rate for inorganic salts in simulated wastewater and strong environmental and economic benefits graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords polypyrrole mushroom residue activated carbon sulfate nitrate adsorption mechanism 1 introduction water resources can promote economic growth and maintain the balance among ecosystems which are both essential for human development 1 with economic development water pollution has become a serious issue worldwide 2 both sulfate so4 2 and nitrate no3 are common inorganic pollutants in water excessive levels thereof can cause great harm to humans and the environment the mining and mineral industries are the main sources of so4 2 in the aquatic environment under the combined action of oxygen water and bacteria mine tailings are oxidized to produce mine wastewater with a high so4 2 concentration 3 because so4 2 is very stable in water it cannot be easily removed through the self purification of water bodies therefore direct discharge of so4 2 wastewater without treatment will pollute groundwater harm aquatic organisms and change soil composition excessive intake by humans can cause conditions such as intestinal dysfunction 4 industry farmland irrigation and domestic sewage are the main sources of no3 in the aquatic environment high levels of no3 in groundwater can lead to reactions that produce potential carcinogens throughout the food chain and can also be converted into nitrite no2 in the human body nitrite combines with hemoglobin in the blood to cause methemoglobinemia and exposed infants may suffer from blue baby syndrome due to hypoxia 5 6 the world health organization who stipulates that the maximum so4 2 and no3 concentrations in drinking water should not exceed 500 and 10 mg l respectively 7 many countries have recommended stricter maximum standard limits brazil and china stipulate that so4 2 concentration in drinking water sources should not exceed 250 mg l 8 china s groundwater quality standard gb t14848 2017 stipulates that no3 concentration in class iii water should not exceed 20 mg l common methods for removing inorganic anions from water include chemical membrane filtration ion exchange biological and adsorption methods the adsorption method is simple to operate and environmentally sustainable it has a diverse range of adsorbent materials and has been widely used in wastewater treatment 9 at present many researchers have investigated the use of different adsorption materials to remove so4 2 and no3 from water such as metal oxides carbon nanotubes zeolites biomass materials etc table 1 lists the removal effects of different adsorbents on so4 2 and no3 most of which have low adsorption capacity and are expensive biomass materials are wastes produced by forestry agriculture and animals that contain natural polymers such as cellulose and lignin they are good materials for the preparation of adsorbents and have many potential applications 10 biomass activated carbon has the advantage of being widely available and biodegradable 11 several materials have been extensively studied including chitosan 12 straw 13 and nutshells 14 mushroom residue mr is an agricultural waste 170 million tons of which are generated every year worldwide when discarded or incinerated in an uncontrolled manner it not only wastes resources but also causes serious pollution of groundwater and the atmospheric environment 21 china is a major producer of edible fungi accounting for more than 70 of the world s output with the development of the edible fungus industry rational disposal and effective use of mr have become issues that cannot be ignored mr is rich in fungal filaments protein cellulose and hydroxyl functional groups and is conducive to the penetration of an activator into the interior increasing the activation efficiency and forming a loose porous structure 22 it is also an excellent material for preparing activated carbon ac the use of mr resources can lead to the development of new products such as biochar and culture medium for a value added effect 23 some studies have used mrac to remove pollutants from water such as heavy metals 24 organic dyes 25 and pharmaceutical products 26 a single biomass material has poor selectivity but can be combined with other substances to improve adsorption performance pyrrole py can be oxidatively polymerized into polypyrrole ppy by oxidizing agents such as ferric chloride and ammonium persulfate 27 ppy is one of the common polymers with good electrical conductivity environmental stability and non toxicity 28 the facile synthesis of ppy makes it an effective adsorbent with characteristics such as ion exchange and polar functional groups 29 however ppy has poor processability and solubility and is prone to agglomeration during the preparation process which limits its wide application synthetic composites are considered to be one of the most effective modification methods for ppy 30 for example when ppy is combined with chitosan and lignosulfonic acid biomass materials to adsorb dye wastewater the removal rate of the composite material for the anionic dye congo red can reach 95 4 31 there are also composites of ppy with chitosan graphene etc to remove heavy metal ions cu2 ag pb2 cd2 cr6 in water 32 33 to sum up the combination of ppy and other materials is mostly used for the adsorption of dyes and heavy metal wastewater in water while the research on the removal of inorganic anions in water is less therefore using the rough surface area of mrac as a carrier can provide more attachment sites for ppy which is beneficial to the uniform dispersion of ppy the composite of ppy and mrac can not only effectively exert the synergistic effect of various functional groups and improve the adsorption capacity of mrac but also solve the problem of processability of ppy which has strong environmental and economic benefits in this study ppy was used to modify an mrac to prepare a composite material ppy mrac which was applied to remove so4 2 and no3 of various concentrations from water the optimal adsorption conditions were determined by considering the ppy mrac dosage initial concentration adsorption time solution ph and adsorption temperature the adsorption mechanism was characterized by isothermal kinetic and thermodynamic models the competitive adsorption regeneration of materials and adsorption of real wastewater were also studied the ppy mrac provided an environmentally sustainable adsorbent for the removal of inorganic anions from water 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals ppy was purchased from shanghai yien chemical technology co ltd china and stored at 4 c iron chloride fecl3 sodium sulfate na2so4 potassium nitrate kno3 zinc chloride zncl2 methanol ch3oh hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh were all purchased from tianjin komiou chemical reagent co ltd china all chemical reagents were of analytical grade mr was taken from the edible fungus research center of shanxi provincial institute of biology co ltd china 2 2 preparation of ppy mrac the preparation process of ppy mrac composites is shown in fig 1 waste mushroom stalks were peeled and dried ground with a pulverizer and passed through a 60 mesh standard sieve then the activator zncl2 solution and mr were mixed at a mass ratio of 2 1 and placed in a sealed crucible the mixture was activated in a muffle furnace at 600 c for 2 h and removed after cooling after soaking in 1 hcl for 1 h and washing with distilled water until neutral to remove excess activator the sample was placed in an oven and dried at 100 c for 6 h finally the prepared mrac was taken out ground and passed through a 100 mesh sieve next 50 ml of the 0 8 m pyrrole solution was ultrasonically treated for 30 min and 1 g of the prepared mrac was then added the mixture was shaken at 150 r min for 1 h at 25 c then 50 ml of 2 m ferric chloride solution was added dropwise to the solution which was shaken for a further 4 h finally the prepared ppy mrac was washed and filtered with distilled water several times and dried in a vacuum drying oven at 50 c for 6 h 2 3 characterization of adsorbents scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 7100f jeol japan was used to observe the apparent morphology of mrac ppy mrac ppy mrac after the adsorption of so4 2 ppy mrac s and ppy mrac after the adsorption of no3 ppy mrac n the elemental contents of mrac ppy mrac ppy mrac s and ppy mrac n were analyzed with an energy dispersive spectroscopy eds jeol japan the specific surface area and pores of mrac and ppy mrac were measured by a fully automatic specific surface area and pore analyzer bet asap2460

spectroscopy xps thermo scientific escalab 250xi usa 2 4 adsorption studies the adsorption performance of ppy mrac for so4 2 and no3 in water was investigated the so4 2 and no3 removal rates were determined at different ppy mrac dosages 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 g initial concentrations so4 2 200 300 400 500 and 600 mg l no3 50 100 150 200 250 and 300 mg l adsorption times 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 and 240 min solution ph 1 3 5 7 9 11 and 13 and adsorption temperatures 15 20 25 30 and 35 c a 100 ml volume of a certain concentration of so4 2 or no3 solution was prepared in an erlenmeyer flask a certain quality of activated carbon was added and the flask was sealed adsorption experiments were conducted at a constant temperature in a shaking incubator with a rotation speed of 150 r min during the experiment four experimental factors were held constant and only one factor was changed after the reaction the solution was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane the so4 2 and no3 concentrations in the filtrate were measured with ion chromatography aquion china three parallel samples were used for each group of experiments to ensure reliability and accuracy the removal rate re and adsorption capacity qe were calculated according to the following formula eqs 1 2 1 r e c 0 c e c 0 100 2 q e c 0 c e m v where c 0 is the initial concentration of so4 2 or no3 mg l c e is the equilibrium concentration of so4 2 or no3 mg l v is the volume of the reaction system l m is the ppy mrac dosage g 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterization analysis 3 1 1 sem eds the apparent morphology and elemental contents of mrac and ppy mrac were analyzed by sem eds fig 2 a shows the mrac magnified 2000 it can be seen that the mrac had an irregular block structure rough and porous surface and large specific surface area which was conducive to the attachment of ppy fig 2 b is an image of the ppy mrac magnified 2000 comparison of a and b showed that mrac could be used as a carrier to load ppy after ppy was loaded the number of mrac pores was reduced however ppy was loaded on the surface of mrac in a flocculent state with a fluffy structure and more pores by providing more active sites the reason may be that during the polymerization of ppy the n atoms in the structure are positively charged while the surface of mrac contains a large number of hydroxyl groups that are negatively charged due to the electrostatic effect the pyrrole monomer will undergo directional oxidative polymerization on the mrac surface and be adsorbed on the surface which is consistent with other polypyrrole modified materials reported in previous studies 34 35 an obvious nitrogen peak appears in the eds of ppy mrac fig 2 c and d which further confirmed that ppy was successfully loaded on the activated carbon in conclusion mrac can be used as a carrier to realize the adhesion of ppy on its surface 3 1 2 bet the specific surface area and porosity characteristics of mrac and ppy mrac were analyzed by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves and the results are shown in fig 2 e and f the two isotherms had a hysteresis loop when the relative pressure was 0 4 1 0 both curves belonged to type iv isotherms 36 type iv curve generally appears in adsorbents with a layered pore structure 37 consistent with the sem characterization it can be seen from the pore size distribution curve that the mrac and ppy mrac are both mesoporous materials with a pore size distribution in the range of 2 30 nm consistent with the isotherm result the specific surface area pore diameter and total pore volume of mrac and ppy mrac were determined by brunauer emmett teller bet method barret joyner halenda bjh method and relative nitrogen adsorption 38 and the calculated results were 655 and 38 m2 g 3 91 and 3 49 nm 0 64 and 0 033 cm3 g respectively compared with mrac the specific surface area average pore diameter and total pore volume of ppy mrac decreased which proved that ppy was successfully loaded on the surface and pores of mrac 3 1 3 ftir the changes in functional groups of mrac and ppy mrac were analyzed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir with the results shown in fig 2 g the strong and broad absorption band at 3471 27 cm 1 was the oh stretching vibration absorption peak on the mrac while the sharp absorption band at 1610 97 cm 1 was the co stretching vibration absorption peak of the aromatic ring 39 the absorption band at 1398 12 cm 1 was the stretching vibration absorption peak of co and cc compared with the ftir spectra of mrac ppy mrac showed new absorption bands at 1531 21 1161 81 1023 95 and 896 24 cm 1 the absorption bands at 1531 21 and 896 24 cm 1 were related to the cn and ch stretching vibration absorptions on ppy 40 41 and the absorption bands at 1161 81 and 1023 95 cm 1 were fat amine nh stretching vibration absorption peaks 42 in addition the characteristic adsorption of the oh group at 3471 27 cm 1 was relatively weak and the possible reason for the decrease in intensity was that the oh group moiety was consumed in the polymerization reaction with ppy the co group peak of ppy mrac composite at 1637 43 cm 1 was weak which may be due to the π π interaction between mrac and aromatic ppy 43 ftir analysis showed that ppy was successfully loaded on mrac and the hydroxyl rich mrac was effectively combined with ppy giving full play to the synergistic effect of each functional group which was consistent with sem and bet analysis 3 1 4 zeta potential the ph value played an important role in the adsorption experiment the zeta potential of mrac and ppy mrac surface was tested under different ph conditions and the results are shown in fig 2 h it can be seen from fig 2 h that the zeta potential of mrac and ppy mrac decreases gradually with the increase of ph and the surface potential is zero when the solution ph is 7 6 and 10 2 respectively compared to mrac ppy mrac is positively charged over a wide ph range 2 10 when the ph of the solution was less than 10 2 ppy mrac was protonated and positively charged which was conducive to the adsorption of anionic pollutants 3 2 effect of key factors on the removal of so4 2 and no3 by ppy mrac 3 2 1 effect of ppy mrac dosage the effect of ppy mrac dosage 0 2 1 g on the removal of so4 2 and no3 was studied when the adsorption time was 3 h the ph was 7 and the initial concentrations of so4 2 and no3 were 500 and 50 mg l respectively it can be seen from fig 3 a that with an increase in the dosage of ppy mrac the so4 2 removal rate increased from 14 44 at a dosage of 0 2 g to 28 29 at a dosage of 0 4 g with continual increase of the dosage the removal rate remained stable at around 31 it can be seen from fig 3 b that as the dosage increased from 0 2 to 0 6 g the no3 removal efficiency increased from 65 67 to 87 76 and when the dosage was 0 8 g the removal rate was relatively reduced by 4 then remain relatively stable this was because as the dosage increased ppy mrac provided more adsorption sites which effectively improved the so4 2 and no3 removal rates when so4 2 and no3 concentrations remained unchanged the presence of excess ppy mrac resulted in an accumulate of adsorption sites reducing the adsorption area of ppy mrac affecting the diffusion of so4 2 and no3 and resulting in a decrease in adsorption efficiency 44 considering the cost the amount of ppy mrac used in subsequent experiments was 0 4 g 3 2 2 effect of initial concentration the initial concentration was an important parameter affecting the adsorption performance of the adsorbent fig 3 c and d show the effect of adsorbent concentration on the removal of so4 2 and no3 by ppy mrac it can be seen from fig 3 c and d that with an increase in the initial concentration the so4 2 and no3 removal rate achieved by using ppy mrac decreased from 53 07 and 75 64 to 16 95 and 49 87 respectively this was because although the increase in concentration promoted contact between the adsorbate and adsorbent the adsorption sites of the adsorbent were limited when the so4 2 and no3 concentrations were both 200 mg l it was obvious that ppy mrac achieved a higher no3 removal rate indicating that ppy mrac had a strong adsorption effect on no3 3 2 3 effect of adsorption time the effect of adsorption time 30 240 min on the removal of so4 2 and no3 was studied when the adsorbent dosage was 0 4 g the ph was 7 and the initial so4 2 and no3 concentrations were 500 and 50 mg l respectively the resulting curves are shown in fig 3 e and f it can be seen from fig 3 e and f that the so4 2 and no3 removal rates increased rapidly within 30 180 min the no3 removal rate exceeded 50 within 60 min and the so4 2 removal rate was 20 after 180 min the removal rate tended to become stable over time indicating that the adsorption equilibrium had been reached therefore to ensure that the adsorption equilibrium is reached 180 min was selected as the adsorption time in subsequent experiments 3 2 4 effect of solution ph the solution ph will affect the surface charge of ppy mrac which is an important parameter affecting the adsorption reaction the effect of solution ph on the removal of so4 2 and no3 was investigated by changing the ph of the reaction system 1 13 and the results are shown in fig 3 g and h the point of zero charge phpzc of a material is an important parameter used to analyze how solution ph affects the adsorption performance of an adsorbent the characterization showed that a phpzc of 10 2 for ppy mrac when ph phpzc the surface of the ppy mrac was negatively charged and when ph phpzc the surface of the ppy mrac was positively charged enabling it to adsorb more so4 2 and no3 it can be seen from fig 3 g and h that with the increase of solution ph the removal rate of so4 2 and no3 gradually increased by ppy mrac when the ph was 7 and 5 the highest removal rates of so4 2 and no3 by ppy mrac were 28 29 and 82 72 respectively when the alkalinity continued to increase ph 10 2 the removal rate of so4 2 by ppy mrac decreased gradually while the removal rate of no3 remained relatively stable this was because the n group in polypyrrole could be protonated below the phpzc so the adsorbent ppy mrac was positively charged and can adsorb so4 2 and no3 in solution through electrostatic attraction 34 when the ph continued to increase high hydroxyl ion oh concentrations would compete with so4 2 and no3 in water for adsorption and the competitive adsorption of oh to so4 2 was stronger than that of no3 under strong alkaline conditions ph 10 2 the surface of ppy mrac was negatively charged which repelled so4 2 and no3 in water resulting in a lower removal rate although solution ph had a large influence on the adsorption process the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent over a wide ph range remained relatively stable and could adapt to different water environments 3 3 adsorption isotherms the adsorption isotherm model was used to analyze the relationship between the adsorption capacity and equilibrium concentration predict the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent and optimize the adsorption process parameters it was very important to analyze the interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate the langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevitch d r models are widely used for this purpose langmuir model the langmuir model assumes that the adsorbent surface is uniformly adsorbed on a single layer and there is no force between adsorbate molecules 45 the nonlinear expression is as follows eqs 3 4 3 c e q e 1 q m k l c e q m 4 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where ce is the equilibrium concentration of adsorbate mg l qe is the equilibrium adsorption capacity mg g qm is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g kl is the langmuir constant l mg rl is the separation factor if 0 rl 1 the adsorption process is favorable c0 is the initial concentration of adsorbate mg l freundlich model the freundlich model assumes that the adsorption is heterogeneous multilayer adsorption with interactions between molecules 46 the nonlinear expression is as follows eq 5 5 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where qe is the equilibrium adsorption capacity mg g kf is the freundlich constant l1 n mg1 1 n g ce is the equilibrium concentration of adsorbate mg l d r model the d r model believes that the adsorption process is a process of gradual filling of adsorbates in the surface pores of the adsorbent and it can be judged whether the adsorption process is mainly chemical adsorption or physical adsorption 47 the nonlinear expression is as follows eqs 6 7 8 6 ln q e ln q m k dr ε 2 7 ε rt ln c s c e 8 e 1 2 k dr where qe is the equilibrium adsorption capacity mg g qm is the theoretical adsorption capacity mg g kdr is the d r constant mol2 kj2 ε is the polanyi potential energy kj mol r is the ideal gas constant j mol k t is the thermodynamic absolute temperature k cs is the solubility of the adsorbate mg l ce is the equilibrium concentration of adsorbate mg l e is the free energy kj mol if e 8 the adsorption process is physical adsorption and if 8 e 16 the adsorption process is chemical adsorption the fitting curves of the three isothermal models at different temperatures are shown in fig 4 and the parameters of each model are determined according to the nonlinear expressions as shown in table 2 it can be seen from the fitting results that the langmuir model had the highest correlation coefficient which could better describe the adsorption process the model predicted the maximum adsorption capacity of so4 2 and no3 to be 40 00 and 51 55 mg g respectively consistent with the experimental results according to the calculation of linear expression the rl value of so4 2 at 200 600 mg l was between 0 06 and 0 23 and the rl value of no3 at 50 300 mg l was between 0 10 and 0 58 table 3 indicating that the adsorption of so4 2 and no3 on ppy mrac proceeded via a single layer chemical adsorption process and the use of ppy mrac was suitable for the adsorption of so4 2 and no3 48 the n value of the freundlich isotherm model was between 1 and 10 indicating that ppy mrac had strong adsorption capacity 49 the value of e in the d r model was between 8 and 16 indicating that the adsorption process was dominated by chemical adsorption compared with other adsorbents as shown in table 4 ppy mrac has the characteristics of low cost and good adsorption capacity and is a promising environment friendly adsorbent 3 4 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetics is an important process for analyzing the interface reaction between adsorbents and adsorbates pseudo first order kinetic models pseudo second order kinetic models and intra particle diffusion models are used to analyze the adsorption mechanism and process 56 the equations of each model are as follows eqs 9 10 11 9 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 10 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e 11 q t k p t 0 5 c where qe is the equilibrium adsorption capacity mg g qt is the adsorption capacity at time t mg g k1 is the pseudo first order kinetic rate equilibrium constant min 1 k2 is the pseudo second order kinetic rate equilibrium constant g mg min kp is adsorption rate constant of the intra particle diffusion model mg g min0 5 c is a constant related to the thickness of the boundary layer mg g pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were used to fit the data for different concentrations of so4 2 and no3 the curve fitting and results of the kinetic models are shown in fig 5 and table 5 it can be seen that the correlation coefficient of so4 2 and no3 was highest for the pseudo second order kinetic models and the curve fitting was also better which can describe the adsorption process well it indicated that the adsorption of so4 2 and no3 by ppy mrac was a chemical adsorption process which was consistent with the results of the isothermal model the adsorption process included membrane diffusion intra particle diffusion and adsorption equilibrium stages and the adsorption speed was affected by one or more steps 57 to further determine the factors controlling the adsorption of so4 2 and no3 by ppy mrac the data were fitted and analyzed by the intra particle diffusion model the fitted data are shown in table 5 it can be seen from table 5 that the boundary layer coefficient c for both so4 2 and no3 increased with an increase in concentration indicating that the higher the concentration of adsorbate the more the adsorption rate was affected by diffusion of the boundary layer 58 the data were fitted by plotting qt vs t0 5 it can be seen from fig 5 that the fitting curve indicated multiple linear relationships the data could be divided into two different curves that did not pass through the origin indicating that particle diffusion was not the only controlling factor 59 the slope of the curve changed significantly from t 12 min indicating that there were two types of adsorption the linear slope of the first stage was relatively large indicating that the initial stage of the adsorption reaction was the membrane diffusion stage in the adsorption process the slope of the second stage was smaller than that of the first stage and tended to be flat indicating that the active sites were gradually occupied during the adsorption process intra particle diffusion became the controlling factor and adsorption equilibrium was gradually reached 3 5 effect of adsorption temperature and adsorption thermodynamics the effect of adsorption temperature 15 35 c on the removal of so4 2 and no3 by ppy mrac is shown in fig 6 a b it can be seen that with an increase in temperature the so4 2 removal rate displayed an upward trend while the no3 removal rate showed a downward trend indicating that the adsorption of so4 2 and no3 by ppy mrac were endothermic and exothermic processes respectively the temperature dependence of adsorption process is related to the change of thermodynamic parameters by calculating thermodynamic parameters such as the gibbs free energy δg enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs the thermodynamic behavior of adsorption was studied the formula for calculating the thermodynamic parameters was as follows eqs 12 13 12 g rt ln k d 13 g h t s where δg is the gibbs free energy kj mol r is the ideal gas constant j mol k t is the thermodynamic absolute temperature k kd is the distribution coefficient l g δh is the standard enthalpy change kj mol δs is the standard entropy change kj mol k the results of the thermodynamic calculation results are shown in table 6 it can be seen that so4 2 and no3 exhibited different adsorption behaviors for both so4 2 and no3 the negative values of g indicated the spontaneous nature of adsorption process the negative h value for so4 2 and positive h value for no3 confirm the exothermic and endothermic nature of the adsorption respectively the different thermodynamic behavior was because the increase of temperature could increase the reaction characteristics of the surface sites and promote the adsorption of so4 2 while it could reduce the rate of intra particle diffusion of no3 resulting in a decrease in its removal rate 60 the results are consistent with most studies on sulfate and nitrate adsorption 61 63 the s values of so4 2 and no3 were both positive indicating that the degree of disorder in the adsorption process increased and the adsorption interface had a strong interaction 64 3 6 competitive adsorption regeneration and adsorption of real wastewater to study the competitive adsorption a two stage experiment was conducted to investigate the removal rate of the two ions by ppy mrac when so4 2 and no3 ions coexisted at different concentrations the experimental results are shown in fig 7 a it can be seen that the presence of no3 in the solution greatly affected the adsorption of so4 2 on ppy mrac while the presence of so4 2 did not affect the adsorption of no3 when the two ions coexisted the so4 2 removal rate was significantly reduced by about 30 while the no3 removal rate was only reduced by about 10 indicating that the ppy mrac had a strong selective adsorption effect on no3 the number of regenerations is a key factor when evaluating the durability of adsorbent materials in this study a 0 1 m naoh solution was selected as the eluent and the ppy mrac that adsorbed the saturated so4 2 and no3 was subjected to six cycles of regeneration experiments the experimental results are shown in fig 7 b it can be seen from fig 7 b that as the number of regenerations increased the so4 2 and no3 removal rate by ppy mrac gradually decreased after the fourth regeneration the so4 2 removal rate by ppy mrac decreased by 47 8 while the no3 removal rate reduced by 23 18 after the sixth regeneration to evaluate the practicability of the adsorbent material the effect of ppy mrac on the removal of so4 2 and no3 in real river water was studied wastewater samples were taken from the fenhe river in shanxi province the initial concentrations of so4 2 and no3 in real water samples were 294 and 8 6 mg l respectively the results are shown in fig 7 c when the dosage was 0 4 g the removal effect in the actual wastewater was smaller than that in the simulated wastewater this may have been due to the presence of other impurities in the wastewater when the dosage was 0 8 g the so4 2 and no3 removal rates were 21 8 and 70 respectively these results showed that the ppy mrac prepared in this study had good recoverability and reusability and was a promising adsorbent 3 7 adsorption mechanisms 3 7 1 sem eds analysis to study the adsorption mechanism sem eds analysis of ppy mrac s and ppy mrac n was performed and the results are shown in fig 8 a d fig 8 a and b are sem images of ppy mrac s and ppy mrac n at 2000 magnification compared with the sem images fig 2 b of ppy mrac there were no obvious changes in the structure of ppy mrac s and ppy mrac n indicating that ppy mrac adsorbed so4 2 and no3 mainly by chemical adsorption previous studies have shown that cl doped in ppy can exchange with anions 65 sulfur and nitrogen appeared in the eds energy spectrum analysis after adsorption fig 8 c and d while the relative content of chlorine decreased from 11 2 to 4 2 and 4 9 respectively which proved that so4 2 and no3 had ion exchange with cl during the adsorption process 3 7 2 ftir analysis previous studies have shown that the oxygen atom in the structure of no3 contains lone electrons and has strong electronegativity which can be removed by forming hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl functional groups on the surface of the adsorbent 66 and so4 2 can also form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl functional groups in the biomass structure 67 to further explore the adsorption mechanism ftir analysis of ppy mrac s and ppy mrac n was performed fig 8 e compared with the ftir spectra of ppy mrac new characteristic peaks appeared at 1284 73 and 1294 88 cm 1 which may be due to the adsorption of so4 2 and no3 by ppy mrac 68 the peaks of ppy mrac s and ppy mrac n at 3471 27 cm 1 were reduced which may be caused by the formation of hydrogen bonds during the adsorption process consistent with previous research 69 3 7 3 xps analysis to further study the adsorption mechanism the xps spectra of ppy mrac before and after so4 2 and no3 adsorption are presented in fig 8 f i binding energies at 284 54 531 95 399 47 and 198 22 ev fig 8 f were detected and consistent with the characteristic peaks of c 1 s o 1 s n 1 s and cl 2p which were the main elements of ppy mrac and were consistent with the eds results xps spectra of ppy mrac s showed the presence of new bands with binding energy values at 168 85 ev corresponded to the s 2p the intensity of the n1s peak of ppy mrac n was enhanced and the intensity of the cl 2p peak of ppy mrac s and ppy mrac n was decreased fig 8 f and g the results indicated that cl was ion exchanged with so4 2 and no3 during the adsorption process which could be confirmed by eds the n 1 s spectrum of ppy mrac could be deconvoluted into three peaks at 401 05 399 47 and 403 ev fig 8 h correspond to three different states of nh n and n respectively where n is a positive charge that adsorbs so4 2 and no3 in water through electrostatic attraction 70 compared with ppy mrac the n functional group content of ppy mrac s and ppy mrac n was reduced indicating that electrostatic interactions occurred during the adsorption process the o1s spectrum shows three peaks at 530 3 531 95 and 534 05 ev fig 8 i corresponding to co c oh o c oh respectively 71 the c oh functional group content of ppy mrac s and ppy mrac n was lower than that before adsorption indicating that hydrogen bonds were formed during the adsorption process which was consistent with the ftir results in summary the mechanism of so4 2 and no3 adsorption by ppy mrac in water is shown in fig 9 there were three main adsorption mechanisms cl doped in ppy mrac can exchange with so4 2 and no3 so4 2 and no3 were adsorbed on the surface of ppy mrac by electrostatic attraction oh group of ppy mrac forms hydrogen bonds with so4 2 and no3 4 conclusions in this study ppy mrac was prepared by the impregnation method which enabled efficient use of mr in agricultural waste the ppy mrac was a mesoporous material that contained a variety of functional groups and was effective for adsorbing anionic pollutants in water the ppy mrac could effectively remove so4 2 and no3 in water with maximum adsorption capacities of 40 00 and 51 55 mg g respectively the adsorption capacity of ppy mrac remained relatively stable between ph 3 9 and ppy mrac was easy to regenerate and recover the adsorption model conformed to the langmuir and pseudo second order kinetic models the adsorption mechanisms were mainly electrostatic attraction ion exchange and hydrogen bond studies using real wastewater samples

12868,a new type of adsorption material polypyrrole modified mushroom residue activated carbon ppy mrac was prepared by compounding mr in agricultural waste and ppy using a dipping method a characterization analysis indicated that ppy mrac is a mesoporous material containing functional groups such as hydroxyl oh and coordinated chloride cl ions the efficacy of ppy mrac for removing sulfate so4 2 and nitrate no3 from water was studied the experimental results showed that the adsorption of so4 2 and no3 by ppy mrac followed the langmuir and pseudo second order kinetic models with maximum adsorption capacities of 40 00 and 51 55 mg g respectively the removal rates of 500 mg l so4 2 at 35 c and 50 mg l no3 at 15 c were 31 53 and 82 65 respectively a thermodynamic analysis revealed adsorption of so4 2 and no3 via spontaneous endothermic and exothermic reactions respectively the adsorption mechanisms were mainly electrostatic attraction ion exchange and hydrogen bond the ppy mrac could be regenerated six times after being eluted by naoh low cost ppy mrac had a high removal rate for inorganic salts in simulated wastewater and strong environmental and economic benefits graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords polypyrrole mushroom residue activated carbon sulfate nitrate adsorption mechanism 1 introduction water resources can promote economic growth and maintain the balance among ecosystems which are both essential for human development 1 with economic development water pollution has become a serious issue worldwide 2 both sulfate so4 2 and nitrate no3 are common inorganic pollutants in water excessive levels thereof can cause great harm to humans and the environment the mining and mineral industries are the main sources of so4 2 in the aquatic environment under the combined action of oxygen water and bacteria mine tailings are oxidized to produce mine wastewater with a high so4 2 concentration 3 because so4 2 is very stable in water it cannot be easily removed through the self purification of water bodies therefore direct discharge of so4 2 wastewater without treatment will pollute groundwater harm aquatic organisms and change soil composition excessive intake by humans can cause conditions such as intestinal dysfunction 4 industry farmland irrigation and domestic sewage are the main sources of no3 in the aquatic environment high levels of no3 in groundwater can lead to reactions that produce potential carcinogens throughout the food chain and can also be converted into nitrite no2 in the human body nitrite combines with hemoglobin in the blood to cause methemoglobinemia and exposed infants may suffer from blue baby syndrome due to hypoxia 5 6 the world health organization who stipulates that the maximum so4 2 and no3 concentrations in drinking water should not exceed 500 and 10 mg l respectively 7 many countries have recommended stricter maximum standard limits brazil and china stipulate that so4 2 concentration in drinking water sources should not exceed 250 mg l 8 china s groundwater quality standard gb t14848 2017 stipulates that no3 concentration in class iii water should not exceed 20 mg l common methods for removing inorganic anions from water include chemical membrane filtration ion exchange biological and adsorption methods the adsorption method is simple to operate and environmentally sustainable it has a diverse range of adsorbent materials and has been widely used in wastewater treatment 9 at present many researchers have investigated the use of different adsorption materials to remove so4 2 and no3 from water such as metal oxides carbon nanotubes zeolites biomass materials etc table 1 lists the removal effects of different adsorbents on so4 2 and no3 most of which have low adsorption capacity and are expensive biomass materials are wastes produced by forestry agriculture and animals that contain natural polymers such as cellulose and lignin they are good materials for the preparation of adsorbents and have many potential applications 10 biomass activated carbon has the advantage of being widely available and biodegradable 11 several materials have been extensively studied including chitosan 12 straw 13 and nutshells 14 mushroom residue mr is an agricultural waste 170 million tons of which are generated every year worldwide when discarded or incinerated in an uncontrolled manner it not only wastes resources but also causes serious pollution of groundwater and the atmospheric environment 21 china is a major producer of edible fungi accounting for more than 70 of the world s output with the development of the edible fungus industry rational disposal and effective use of mr have become issues that cannot be ignored mr is rich in fungal filaments protein cellulose and hydroxyl functional groups and is conducive to the penetration of an activator into the interior increasing the activation efficiency and forming a loose porous structure 22 it is also an excellent material for preparing activated carbon ac the use of mr resources can lead to the development of new products such as biochar and culture medium for a value added effect 23 some studies have used mrac to remove pollutants from water such as heavy metals 24 organic dyes 25 and pharmaceutical products 26 a single biomass material has poor selectivity but can be combined with other substances to improve adsorption performance pyrrole py can be oxidatively polymerized into polypyrrole ppy by oxidizing agents such as ferric chloride and ammonium persulfate 27 ppy is one of the common polymers with good electrical conductivity environmental stability and non toxicity 28 the facile synthesis of ppy makes it an effective adsorbent with characteristics such as ion exchange and polar functional groups 29 however ppy has poor processability and solubility and is prone to agglomeration during the preparation process which limits its wide application synthetic composites are considered to be one of the most effective modification methods for ppy 30 for example when ppy is combined with chitosan and lignosulfonic acid biomass materials to adsorb dye wastewater the removal rate of the composite material for the anionic dye congo red can reach 95 4 31 there are also composites of ppy with chitosan graphene etc to remove heavy metal ions cu2 ag pb2 cd2 cr6 in water 32 33 to sum up the combination of ppy and other materials is mostly used for the adsorption of dyes and heavy metal wastewater in water while the research on the removal of inorganic anions in water is less therefore using the rough surface area of mrac as a carrier can provide more attachment sites for ppy which is beneficial to the uniform dispersion of ppy the composite of ppy and mrac can not only effectively exert the synergistic effect of various functional groups and improve the adsorption capacity of mrac but also solve the problem of processability of ppy which has strong environmental and economic benefits in this study ppy was used to modify an mrac to prepare a composite material ppy mrac which was applied to remove so4 2 and no3 of various concentrations from water the optimal adsorption conditions were determined by considering the ppy mrac dosage initial concentration adsorption time solution ph and adsorption temperature the adsorption mechanism was characterized by isothermal kinetic and thermodynamic models the competitive adsorption regeneration of materials and adsorption of real wastewater were also studied the ppy mrac provided an environmentally sustainable adsorbent for the removal of inorganic anions from water 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals ppy was purchased from shanghai yien chemical technology co ltd china and stored at 4 c iron chloride fecl3 sodium sulfate na2so4 potassium nitrate kno3 zinc chloride zncl2 methanol ch3oh hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh were all purchased from tianjin komiou chemical reagent co ltd china all chemical reagents were of analytical grade mr was taken from the edible fungus research center of shanxi provincial institute of biology co ltd china 2 2 preparation of ppy mrac the preparation process of ppy mrac composites is shown in fig 1 waste mushroom stalks were peeled and dried ground with a pulverizer and passed through a 60 mesh standard sieve then the activator zncl2 solution and mr were mixed at a mass ratio of 2 1 and placed in a sealed crucible the mixture was activated in a muffle furnace at 600 c for 2 h and removed after cooling after soaking in 1 hcl for 1 h and washing with distilled water until neutral to remove excess activator the sample was placed in an oven and dried at 100 c for 6 h finally the prepared mrac was taken out ground and passed through a 100 mesh sieve next 50 ml of the 0 8 m pyrrole solution was ultrasonically treated for 30 min and 1 g of the prepared mrac was then added the mixture was shaken at 150 r min for 1 h at 25 c then 50 ml of 2 m ferric chloride solution was added dropwise to the solution which was shaken for a further 4 h finally the prepared ppy mrac was washed and filtered with distilled water several times and dried in a vacuum drying oven at 50 c for 6 h 2 3 characterization of adsorbents scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 7100f jeol japan was used to observe the apparent morphology of mrac ppy mrac ppy mrac after the adsorption of so4 2 ppy mrac s and ppy mrac after the adsorption of no3 ppy mrac n the elemental contents of mrac ppy mrac ppy mrac s and ppy mrac n were analyzed with

spectroscopy xps thermo scientific escalab 250xi usa 2 4 adsorption studies the adsorption performance of ppy mrac for so4 2 and no3 in water was investigated the so4 2 and no3 removal rates were determined at different ppy mrac dosages 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 g initial concentrations so4 2 200 300 400 500 and 600 mg l no3 50 100 150 200 250 and 300 mg l adsorption times 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 and 240 min solution ph 1 3 5 7 9 11 and 13 and adsorption temperatures 15 20 25 30 and 35 c a 100 ml volume of a certain concentration of so4 2 or no3 solution was prepared in an erlenmeyer flask a certain quality of activated carbon was added and the flask was sealed adsorption experiments were conducted at a constant temperature in a shaking incubator with a rotation speed of 150 r min during the experiment four experimental factors were held constant and only one factor was changed after the reaction the solution was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane the so4 2 and no3 concentrations in the filtrate were measured with ion chromatography aquion china three parallel samples were used for each group of experiments to ensure reliability and accuracy the removal rate re and adsorption capacity qe were calculated according to the following formula eqs 1 2 1 r e c 0 c e c 0 100 2 q e c 0 c e m v where c 0 is the initial concentration of so4 2 or no3 mg l c e is the equilibrium concentration of so4 2 or no3 mg l v is the volume of the reaction system l m is the ppy mrac dosage g 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterization analysis 3 1 1 sem eds the apparent morphology and elemental contents of mrac and ppy mrac were analyzed by sem eds fig 2 a shows the mrac magnified 2000 it can be seen that the mrac had an irregular block structure rough and porous surface and large specific surface area which was conducive to the attachment of ppy fig 2 b is an image of the ppy mrac magnified 2000 comparison of a and b showed that mrac could be used as a carrier to load ppy after ppy was loaded the number of mrac pores was reduced however ppy was loaded on the surface of mrac in a flocculent state with a fluffy structure and more pores by providing more active sites the reason may be that during the polymerization of ppy the n atoms in the structure are positively charged while the surface of mrac contains a large number of hydroxyl groups that are negatively charged due to the electrostatic effect the pyrrole monomer will undergo directional oxidative polymerization on the mrac surface and be adsorbed on the surface which is consistent with other polypyrrole modified materials reported in previous studies 34 35 an obvious nitrogen peak appears in the eds of ppy mrac fig 2 c and d which further confirmed that ppy was successfully loaded on the activated carbon in conclusion mrac can be used as a carrier to realize the adhesion of ppy on its surface 3 1 2 bet the specific surface area and porosity characteristics of mrac and ppy mrac were analyzed by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves and the results are shown in fig 2 e and f the two isotherms had a hysteresis loop when the relative pressure was 0 4 1 0 both curves belonged to type iv isotherms 36 type iv curve generally appears in adsorbents with a layered pore structure 37 consistent with the sem characterization it can be seen from the pore size distribution curve that the mrac and ppy mrac are both mesoporous materials with a pore size distribution in the range of 2 30 nm consistent with the isotherm result the specific surface area pore diameter and total pore volume of mrac and ppy mrac were determined by brunauer emmett teller bet method barret joyner halenda bjh method and relative nitrogen adsorption 38 and the calculated results were 655 and 38 m2 g 3 91 and 3 49 nm 0 64 and 0 033 cm3 g respectively compared with mrac the specific surface area average pore diameter and total pore volume of ppy mrac decreased which proved that ppy was successfully loaded on the surface and pores of mrac 3 1 3 ftir the changes in functional groups of mrac and ppy mrac were analyzed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir with the results shown in fig 2 g the strong and broad absorption band at 3471 27 cm 1 was the oh stretching vibration absorption peak on the mrac while the sharp absorption band at 1610 97 cm 1 was the co stretching vibration absorption peak of the aromatic ring 39 the absorption band at 1398 12 cm 1 was the stretching vibration absorption peak of co and cc compared with the ftir spectra of mrac ppy mrac showed new absorption bands at 1531 21 1161 81 1023 95 and 896 24 cm 1 the absorption bands at 1531 21 and 896 24 cm 1 were related to the cn and ch stretching vibration absorptions on ppy 40 41 and the absorption bands at 1161 81 and 1023 95 cm 1 were fat amine nh stretching vibration absorption peaks 42 in addition the characteristic adsorption of the oh group at 3471 27 cm 1 was relatively weak and the possible reason for the decrease in intensity was that the oh group moiety was consumed in the polymerization reaction with ppy the co group peak of ppy mrac composite at 1637 43 cm 1 was weak which may be due to the π π interaction between mrac and aromatic ppy 43 ftir analysis showed that ppy was successfully loaded on mrac and the hydroxyl rich mrac was effectively combined with ppy giving full play to the synergistic effect of each functional group which was consistent with sem and bet analysis 3 1 4 zeta potential the ph value played an important role in the adsorption experiment the zeta potential of mrac and ppy mrac surface was tested under different ph conditions and the results are shown in fig 2 h it can be seen from fig 2 h that the zeta potential of mrac and ppy mrac decreases gradually with the increase of ph and the surface potential is zero when the solution ph is 7 6 and 10 2 respectively compared to mrac ppy mrac is positively charged over a wide ph range 2 10 when the ph of the solution was less than 10 2 ppy mrac was protonated and positively charged which was conducive to the adsorption of anionic pollutants 3 2 effect of key factors on the removal of so4 2 and no3 by ppy mrac 3 2 1 effect of ppy mrac dosage the effect of ppy mrac dosage 0 2 1 g on the removal of so4 2 and no3 was studied when the adsorption time was 3 h the ph was 7 and the initial concentrations of so4 2 and no3 were 500 and 50 mg l respectively it can be seen from fig 3 a that with an increase in the dosage of ppy mrac the so4 2 removal rate increased from 14 44 at a dosage of 0 2 g to 28 29 at a dosage of 0 4 g with continual increase of the dosage the removal rate remained stable at around 31 it can be seen from fig 3 b that as the dosage increased from 0 2 to 0 6 g the no3 removal efficiency increased from 65 67 to 87 76 and when the dosage was 0 8 g the removal rate was relatively reduced by 4 then remain relatively stable this was because as the dosage increased ppy mrac provided more adsorption sites which effectively improved the so4 2 and no3 removal rates when so4 2 and no3 concentrations remained unchanged the presence of excess ppy mrac resulted in an accumulate of adsorption sites reducing the adsorption area of ppy mrac affecting the diffusion of so4 2 and no3 and resulting in a decrease in adsorption efficiency 44 considering the cost the amount of ppy mrac used in subsequent experiments was 0 4 g 3 2 2 effect of initial concentration the initial concentration was an important parameter affecting the adsorption performance of the adsorbent fig 3 c and d show the effect of adsorbent concentration on the removal of so4 2 and no3 by ppy mrac it can be seen from fig 3 c and d that with an increase in the initial concentration the so4 2 and no3 removal rate achieved by using ppy mrac decreased from 53 07 and 75 64 to 16 95 and 49 87 respectively this was because although the increase in concentration promoted contact between the adsorbate and adsorbent the adsorption sites of the adsorbent were limited when the so4 2 and no3 concentrations were both 200 mg l it was obvious that ppy mrac achieved a higher no3 removal rate indicating that ppy mrac had a strong adsorption effect on no3 3 2 3 effect of adsorption time the effect of adsorption time 30 240 min on the removal of so4 2 and no3 was studied when the adsorbent dosage was 0 4 g the ph was 7 and the initial so4 2 and no3 concentrations were 500 and 50 mg l respectively the resulting curves are shown in fig 3 e and f it can be seen from fig 3 e and f that the so4 2 and no3 removal rates increased rapidly within 30 180 min the no3 removal rate exceeded 50 within 60 min and the so4 2 removal rate was 20 after 180 min the removal rate tended to become stable over time indicating that the adsorption equilibrium had been reached therefore to ensure that the adsorption equilibrium is reached 180 min was selected as the adsorption time in subsequent experiments 3 2 4 effect of solution ph the solution ph will affect the surface charge of ppy mrac which is an important parameter affecting the adsorption reaction the effect of solution ph on the removal of so4 2 and no3 was investigated by changing the ph of the reaction system 1 13 and the results are shown in fig 3 g and h the point of zero charge phpzc of a material is an important parameter used to analyze how solution ph affects the adsorption performance of an adsorbent the characterization showed that a phpzc of 10 2 for ppy mrac when ph phpzc the surface of the ppy mrac was negatively charged and when ph phpzc the surface of the ppy mrac was positively charged enabling it to adsorb more so4 2 and no3 it can be seen from fig 3 g and h that with the increase of solution ph the removal rate of so4 2 and no3 gradually increased by ppy mrac when the ph was 7 and 5 the highest removal rates of so4 2 and no3 by ppy mrac were 28 29 and 82 72 respectively when the alkalinity continued to increase ph 10 2 the removal rate of so4 2 by ppy mrac decreased gradually while the removal rate of no3 remained relatively stable this was because the n group in polypyrrole could be protonated below the phpzc so the adsorbent ppy mrac was positively charged and can adsorb so4 2 and no3 in solution through electrostatic attraction 34 when the ph continued to increase high hydroxyl ion oh concentrations would compete with so4 2 and no3 in water for adsorption and the competitive adsorption of oh to so4 2 was stronger than that of no3 under strong alkaline conditions ph 10 2 the surface of ppy mrac was negatively charged which repelled so4 2 and no3 in water resulting in a lower removal rate although solution ph had a large influence on the adsorption process the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent over a wide ph range remained relatively stable and could adapt to different water environments 3 3 adsorption isotherms the adsorption isotherm model was used to analyze the relationship between the adsorption capacity and equilibrium concentration predict the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent and optimize the adsorption process parameters it was very important to analyze the interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate the langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevitch d r models are widely used for this purpose langmuir model the langmuir model assumes that the adsorbent surface is uniformly adsorbed on a single layer and there is no force between adsorbate molecules 45 the nonlinear expression is as follows eqs 3 4 3 c e q e 1 q m k l c e q m 4 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where ce is the equilibrium concentration of adsorbate mg l qe is the equilibrium adsorption capacity mg g qm is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g kl is the langmuir constant l mg rl is the separation factor if 0 rl 1 the adsorption process is favorable c0 is the initial concentration of adsorbate mg l freundlich model the freundlich model assumes that the adsorption is heterogeneous multilayer adsorption with interactions between molecules 46 the nonlinear expression is as follows eq 5 5 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where qe is the equilibrium adsorption capacity mg g kf is the freundlich constant l1 n mg1 1 n g ce is the equilibrium concentration of adsorbate mg l d r model the d r model believes that the adsorption process is a process of gradual filling of adsorbates in the surface pores of the adsorbent and it can be judged whether the adsorption process is mainly chemical adsorption or physical adsorption 47 the nonlinear expression is as follows eqs 6 7 8 6 ln q e ln q m k dr ε 2 7 ε rt ln c s c e 8 e 1 2 k dr where qe is the equilibrium adsorption capacity mg g qm is the theoretical adsorption capacity mg g kdr is the d r constant mol2 kj2 ε is the polanyi potential energy kj mol r is the ideal gas constant j mol k t is the thermodynamic absolute temperature k cs is the solubility of the adsorbate mg l ce is the equilibrium concentration of adsorbate mg l e is the free energy kj mol if e 8 the adsorption process is physical adsorption and if 8 e 16 the adsorption process is chemical adsorption the fitting curves of the three isothermal models at different temperatures are shown in fig 4 and the parameters of each model are determined according to the nonlinear expressions as shown in table 2 it can be seen from the fitting results that the langmuir model had the highest correlation coefficient which could better describe the adsorption process the model predicted the maximum adsorption capacity of so4 2 and no3 to be 40 00 and 51 55 mg g respectively consistent with the experimental results according to the calculation of linear expression the rl value of so4 2 at 200 600 mg l was between 0 06 and 0 23 and the rl value of no3 at 50 300 mg l was between 0 10 and 0 58 table 3 indicating that the adsorption of so4 2 and no3 on ppy mrac proceeded via a single layer chemical adsorption process and the use of ppy mrac was suitable for the adsorption of so4 2 and no3 48 the n value of the freundlich isotherm model was between 1 and 10 indicating that ppy mrac had strong adsorption capacity 49 the value of e in the d r model was between 8 and 16 indicating that the adsorption process was dominated by chemical adsorption compared with other adsorbents as shown in table 4 ppy mrac has the characteristics of low cost and good adsorption capacity and is a promising environment friendly adsorbent 3 4 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetics is an important process for analyzing the interface reaction between adsorbents and adsorbates pseudo first order kinetic models pseudo second order kinetic models and intra particle diffusion models are used to analyze the adsorption mechanism and process 56 the equations of each model are as follows eqs 9 10 11 9 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 10 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e 11 q t k p t 0 5 c where qe is the equilibrium adsorption capacity mg g qt is the adsorption capacity at time t mg g k1 is the pseudo first order kinetic rate equilibrium constant min 1 k2 is the pseudo second order kinetic rate equilibrium constant g mg min kp is adsorption rate constant of the intra particle diffusion model mg g min0 5 c is a constant related to the thickness of the boundary layer mg g pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were used to fit the data for different concentrations of so4 2 and no3 the curve fitting and results of the kinetic models are shown in fig 5 and table 5 it can be seen that the correlation coefficient of so4 2 and no3 was highest for the pseudo second order kinetic models and the curve fitting was also better which can describe the adsorption process well it indicated that the adsorption of so4 2 and no3 by ppy mrac was a chemical adsorption process which was consistent with the results of the isothermal model the adsorption process included membrane diffusion intra particle diffusion and adsorption equilibrium stages and the adsorption speed was affected by one or more steps 57 to further determine the factors controlling the adsorption of so4 2 and no3 by ppy mrac the data were fitted and analyzed by the intra particle diffusion model the fitted data are shown in table 5 it can be seen from table 5 that the boundary layer coefficient c for both so4 2 and no3 increased with an increase in concentration indicating that the higher the concentration of adsorbate the more the adsorption rate was affected by diffusion of the boundary layer 58 the data were fitted by plotting qt vs t0 5 it can be seen from fig 5 that the fitting curve indicated multiple linear relationships the data could be divided into two different curves that did not pass through the origin indicating that particle diffusion was not the only controlling factor 59 the slope of the curve changed significantly from t 12 min indicating that there were two types of adsorption the linear slope of the first stage was relatively large indicating that the initial stage of the adsorption reaction was the membrane diffusion stage in the adsorption process the slope of the second stage was smaller than that of the first stage and tended to be flat indicating that the active sites were gradually occupied during the adsorption process intra particle diffusion became the controlling factor and adsorption equilibrium was gradually reached 3 5 effect of adsorption temperature and adsorption thermodynamics the effect of adsorption temperature 15 35 c on the removal of so4 2 and no3 by ppy mrac is shown in fig 6 a b it can be seen that with an increase in temperature the so4 2 removal rate displayed an upward trend while the no3 removal rate showed a downward trend indicating that the adsorption of so4 2 and no3 by ppy mrac were endothermic and exothermic processes respectively the temperature dependence of adsorption process is related to the change of thermodynamic parameters by calculating thermodynamic parameters such as the gibbs free energy δg enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs the thermodynamic behavior of adsorption was studied the formula for calculating the thermodynamic parameters was as follows eqs 12 13 12 g rt ln k d 13 g h t s where δg is the gibbs free energy kj mol r is the ideal gas constant j mol k t is the thermodynamic absolute temperature k kd is the distribution coefficient l g δh is the standard enthalpy change kj mol δs is the standard entropy change kj mol k the results of the thermodynamic calculation results are shown in table 6 it can be seen that so4 2 and no3 exhibited different adsorption behaviors for both so4 2 and no3 the negative values of g indicated the spontaneous nature of adsorption process the negative h value for so4 2 and positive h value for no3 confirm the exothermic and endothermic nature of the adsorption respectively the different thermodynamic behavior was because the increase of temperature could increase the reaction characteristics of the surface sites and promote the adsorption of so4 2 while it could reduce the rate of intra particle diffusion of no3 resulting in a decrease in its removal rate 60 the results are consistent with most studies on sulfate and nitrate adsorption 61 63 the s values of so4 2 and no3 were both positive indicating that the degree of disorder in the adsorption process increased and the adsorption interface had a strong interaction 64 3 6 competitive adsorption regeneration and adsorption of real wastewater to study the competitive adsorption a two stage experiment was conducted to investigate the removal rate of the two ions by ppy mrac when so4 2 and no3 ions coexisted at different concentrations the experimental results are shown in fig 7 a it can be seen that the presence of no3 in the solution greatly affected the adsorption of so4 2 on ppy mrac while the presence of so4 2 did not affect the adsorption of no3 when the two ions coexisted the so4 2 removal rate was significantly reduced by about 30 while the no3 removal rate was only reduced by about 10 indicating that the ppy mrac had a strong selective adsorption effect on no3 the number of regenerations is a key factor when evaluating the durability of adsorbent materials in this study a 0 1 m naoh solution was selected as the eluent and the ppy mrac that adsorbed the saturated so4 2 and no3 was subjected to six cycles of regeneration experiments the experimental results are shown in fig 7 b it can be seen from fig 7 b that as the number of regenerations increased the so4 2 and no3 removal rate by ppy mrac gradually decreased after the fourth regeneration the so4 2 removal rate by ppy mrac decreased by 47 8 while the no3 removal rate reduced by 23 18 after the sixth regeneration to evaluate the practicability of the adsorbent material the effect of ppy mrac on the removal of so4 2 and no3 in real river water was studied wastewater samples were taken from the fenhe river in shanxi province the initial concentrations of so4 2 and no3 in real water samples were 294 and 8 6 mg l respectively the results are shown in fig 7 c when the dosage was 0 4 g the removal effect in the actual wastewater was smaller than that in the simulated wastewater this may have been due to the presence of other impurities in the wastewater when the dosage was 0 8 g the so4 2 and no3 removal rates were 21 8 and 70 respectively these results showed that the ppy mrac prepared in this study had good recoverability and reusability and was a promising adsorbent 3 7 adsorption mechanisms 3 7 1 sem eds analysis to study the adsorption mechanism sem eds analysis of ppy mrac s and ppy mrac n was performed and the results are shown in fig 8 a d fig 8 a and b are sem images of ppy mrac s and ppy mrac n at 2000 magnification compared with the sem images fig 2 b of ppy mrac there were no obvious changes in the structure of ppy mrac s and ppy mrac n indicating that ppy mrac adsorbed so4 2 and no3 mainly by chemical adsorption previous studies have shown that cl doped in ppy can exchange with anions 65 sulfur and nitrogen appeared in the eds energy spectrum analysis after adsorption fig 8 c and d while the relative content of chlorine decreased from 11 2 to 4 2 and 4 9 respectively which proved that so4 2 and no3 had ion exchange with cl during the adsorption process 3 7 2 ftir analysis previous studies have shown that the oxygen atom in the structure of no3 contains lone electrons and has strong electronegativity which can be removed by forming hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl functional groups on the surface of the adsorbent 66 and so4 2 can also form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl functional groups in the biomass structure 67 to further explore the adsorption mechanism ftir analysis of ppy mrac s and ppy mrac n was performed fig 8 e compared with the ftir spectra of ppy mrac new characteristic peaks appeared at 1284 73 and 1294 88 cm 1 which may be due to the adsorption of so4 2 and no3 by ppy mrac 68 the peaks of ppy mrac s and ppy mrac n at 3471 27 cm 1 were reduced which may be caused by the formation of hydrogen bonds during the adsorption process consistent with previous research 69 3 7 3 xps analysis to further study the adsorption mechanism the xps spectra of ppy mrac before and after so4 2 and no3 adsorption are presented in fig 8 f i binding energies at 284 54 531 95 399 47 and 198 22 ev fig 8 f were detected and consistent with the characteristic peaks of c 1 s o 1 s n 1 s and cl 2p which were the main elements of ppy mrac and were consistent with the eds results xps spectra of ppy mrac s showed the presence of new bands with binding energy values at 168 85 ev corresponded to the s 2p the intensity of the n1s peak of ppy mrac n was enhanced and the intensity of the cl 2p peak of ppy mrac s and ppy mrac n was decreased fig 8 f and g the results indicated that cl was ion exchanged with so4 2 and no3 during the adsorption process which could be confirmed by eds the n 1 s spectrum of ppy mrac could be deconvoluted into three peaks at 401 05 399 47 and 403 ev fig 8 h correspond to three different states of nh n and n respectively where n is a positive charge that adsorbs so4 2 and no3 in water through electrostatic attraction 70 compared with ppy mrac the n functional group content of ppy mrac s and ppy mrac n was reduced indicating that electrostatic interactions occurred during the adsorption process the o1s spectrum shows three peaks at 530 3 531 95 and 534 05 ev fig 8 i corresponding to co c oh o c oh respectively 71 the c oh functional group content of ppy mrac s and ppy mrac n was lower than that before adsorption indicating that hydrogen bonds were formed during the adsorption process which was consistent with the ftir results in summary the mechanism of so4 2 and no3 adsorption by ppy mrac in water is shown in fig 9 there were three main adsorption mechanisms cl doped in ppy mrac can exchange with so4 2 and no3 so4 2 and no3 were adsorbed on the surface of ppy mrac by electrostatic attraction oh group of ppy mrac forms hydrogen bonds with so4 2 and no3 4 conclusions in this study ppy mrac was prepared by the impregnation method which enabled efficient use of mr in agricultural waste the ppy mrac was a mesoporous material that contained a variety of functional groups and was effective for adsorbing anionic pollutants in water the ppy mrac could effectively remove so4 2 and no3 in water with maximum adsorption capacities of 40 00 and 51 55 mg g respectively the adsorption capacity of ppy mrac remained relatively stable between ph 3 9 and ppy mrac was easy to regenerate and recover the adsorption model conformed to the langmuir and pseudo second order kinetic models the adsorption mechanisms were mainly electrostatic attraction ion exchange and hydrogen bond studies using real wastewater samples showed that ppy mrac is a promising and environmentally sustainable adsorbent with a strong adsorption performance credit authorship contribution statement hongyan li conceptualization data curation

reverse osmosis electrodialysis mechanisms data availability data will be made available on request 1 overview the rapid development of industrialization and the massive increase in population have caused serious water pollution water is the most component for human life and the water demand has increased sevenfold due to the quadrupled global population in the last century 1 2 heavy metal is a general term for metals with an atomic density 4 5 g cm 3 3 since the beginning of the 21st century heavy metal pollution has become a global environmental problem 4 6 because of its wide distribution substantial toxicity and easy migration 7 8 heavy metals are mostly derived from both natural and anthropogenic sources 9 natural sources mainly comprised weathering and volcanic eruption 10 at present anthropogenic activities are the main cause of heavy metal pollution mainly including electroplating petroleum and metal smelting 11 governments around the world have set maximum permissible limits for the discharge of toxic heavy metals 12 however the control of heavy metal wastewater discharge is difficult under realistic conditions once excess heavy metal ions discharge into water streams and even drinking water they can cause great harm to human health 13 heavy metal ions with serious toxic hazards to human body include hg cd pb as cr and so on the uncontrolled discharge of heavy metals by industry might seriously threaten human health and ecosystem the toxic heavy metals must be removed from the wastewater effluent prior to discharging into the environment numerous methods for heavy metal removal have been reported such as chemical precipitation and flocculation where heavy metal ions are transformed into solid precipitates and separated from the liquid phase 14 16 for another methods such as adsorption and ion exchange methods are mainly based on concentrating the ions from a liquid phase to the solid surface and then releasing them to a concentrate media 17 20 however most of these approaches encounter trestrictions due to the high cost low removal efficiency and secondary pollutaion limiting their scale applications 21 24 among all the remediation methods for heavy metal contaiminted wastewater membrane separation technologies mst possess some great properties for scale applications such as excellent heavy metal rejection high efficiency easy operation and low space requirements which have been considered as favorable treatment methods for heavy metal removal 25 26 membrane filtration is a kind of separation technology that utilizes a membrane to separate substrates when a driving force is applied across the membrane membrane filtration separates substrates based on the substrate size membrane pore size solution concentration and the applied pressure in recent decades membrane technologies have received increasing attention for the treatment of heavy metals fig 1 as seen the number of published articles related to membrane methods for heavy metal removal retrieval with the topics of membrane and heavy metal removal increased by nearly tenfold from 2011 to 2021 correspondingly the number growth of membrane method citations shows the same trend and this number is expected to rise more in the upcoming years the proportion of four membrane methods for heavy metal removal in the order of ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro and electrodialysis ed of which uf and ro possess higher citation ratios indicating that they have gained higher interest there have been some discussions on membrane method reviews 27 29 but very few focused on heavy metals from wastewater and new research needs to be summarized and updated over time thus the purpose of the present mini review is to provide a summary and outlook on the opportunities and challenges in the membrane filtration field for heavy metal removal furthermore the present review offers a summary and outlook on the opportunities and challenges in the membrane filtration therefore this review is aimed to promote the development of heavy metals removal by membrane technology with significance 2 membrane filtration for heavy metal removal there has been much interest in the development of high pressure driven membranes for heavy metals removal which are mainly operated by the size exclusion and donnan charge repulsion mechanisms 30 32 the means of driving membranes requires high operational pressure thus the compressive strength of the membrane is an important index to measure its performance 33 the material is the most critical factor in determining membrane performance such as water permeability porosity hydrophilicity surface charge and thermal mechanical stability 34 35 membrane materials are mainly classified into two categories e g ceramics and polymers generally ceramic membranes are more applicable for industrial wastewater treatment than polymers due to their chemical resistance capacity and hydrophobicity 36 37 however ceramic membranes also present defects such as their fragile features and high cost for construction and operation 38 polymer materials such as polysulfone ps polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and polypropylene pp are often applied for commercial membranes due to their resistance to chemicals 39 40 depending on the different operation method and driving pressure of the membranes the most commonly used membrane filtration processes for heavy metal treatment are uf nf ro and several emerging membrane technologies such as ed 41 fig 2 shows the statistical summary of the membrane method for heavy metal removal using the citespace tool retrieved date 24th september 2021 database scopus for the removal of heavy metals as seen in fig 2 some types of membrane materials such as cellulose acetate ceramic carbon nanotubes and graphene have also gained great attention simultaneously uf and nf are two of the most concerning membrane methods for heavy metal removal another membrane filtration technology microfiltration is rarely applied for heavy metal removal since its large pore size 100 1000 nm is not an absolute barrier for heavy metals therefore this section mainly focus on providing a comprehensive review of the most feasible techniques in heavy metal removal based on these membrane processes 42 characteristics of membranes are additionally provided to further illustrate the relationship between removal performance and membrane materials experimental parameters 2 1 ultrafiltration uf is a variety of membrane filtration methods using a permeable membrane to separate heavy metals macromolecules and suspended solids by forces such as pressure or concentration gradients 43 normally the uf pore sizes are 5 20 nm which are larger than dissolved metal ions in the forms of either hydrated ions or complexes with common ligands thus uf must be modified to remove heavy metals from aqueous solution 44 to overcome the defects of removing metal ions by uf membranes there are two main approaches that are named as polymer enhanced ultrafiltration and peuf micellar enhanced uf meuf 45 the combination of macromolecular complexation with uf to selectively separate small solute molecules e g dyes and metal ions from aqueous solutions was first proposed in 1968 by michaels 47 the relevant filtration process and mechanism of uf and nf are shown in fig 3a for the two membrane filtration systems uf and nf processes require a driving pressure difference and the operating pressure of nf is often higher than that of uf due to the difference in membrane size and operating pressure the two membrane systems intercept different heavy metal species usually nf can screen substances except monovalent ions while uf can only intercept most suspended heavy metal particles polymer bound heavy metal heavy metal floccus colloids and most heavy metal ions generally polymeric materials are classified into three types natural polymers synthesized polymers and commercial polymers peuf is a type of uf purification technology that uses water soluble polymeric agents polymeric agents attach to metal ions to form macromolecules and these molecules cannot pass through the membrane simply because of size limitations fig 3b the macromolecules containing metal ions can be recovered and polymeric agents can be utilized for other purposes 48 natural and synthesized polymer usage are great in the case of lab scale applications but on a large scale their applications are limited 49 the peuf technique has high removal efficiency and high formation of macromolecules which are the major advantages of this filtration process several studies have reported the peuf treatment of heavy metal ion from wastewater qiu et al 50 used the copolymer of maleic acid and acrylic acid as a complexing ligand in the peuf process for the removal of manganese from wastewater the results show that the recovery efficiency of mn2 ions was up to 99 6 and the permeate removal was only 2 of the total process li et al 51 compared the ligands of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta nitrilotriacetic acid nta and citric acids as the complexing agents in the peuf process for the cd2 removal from wastewater the results illustrate that ph contributes greatly to the heavy metal removal efficiency the removal efficiency was lowat ph 4 0 without edta ligand the author explains that with edta the dominant cd species are negatively charged cd edta 2 and cdh edta which interact with pei through electrostatic attraction and are less ph dependent through comprehensive analyses it was found that peuf with the nta ligand possessed the best removal capacity which was higher than 97 under the optimum conditions similar research was carried out by shao et al 52 for the recovery of nickel from aqueous solutions by the peuf process with polyacrylate sodium paas and pei the results showed that under optimum experimental conditions the ni2 removal efficiency reached 99 5 by using paas and 93 5 by using pei as the complexation agent respectively mondal et al 46 synthesized ps based composite uf membranes by liquid casting methods and the membrane surface contained large numbers of active sites that possessed good interception for heavy metal pollutants the composite membrane mainly consists of psf polyacrylonitrile pan polyethylene glycol peg graphene oxide go which shows a maximum removal efficiency of 98 24 for pb2 fig 3c the addition of pan and go makes the membranes more porous and having a higher permeate flux simultaneously enhances the membrane compactness and surface properties more details of peuf and its heavy metal removal are shown in table 1 since polymers have a complex structure the separation of specific metal ions is problematic and it is difficult to recreate those polymers on the other hand natural polymers have low water solubility which increases the difficulty of separation 53 on this basis the meuf method was proposed to remove the pollutant from wastewater meuf was first proposed for the removal of heavy metal ions from wastewater by scamehorn et al in 1980 54 compared to peuf meuf has been identified as an efficient separation method for the removal of heavy metals from wastewater this method relies on the addition of surfactants into wastewater when the concentration of surfactants in water is higher than the critical micelle concentration cmc the surfactant will aggregate into micelles which wrap metal ions to form large metal surfactant structures the micelles with metals will be retained by uf membranes which possess smaller pores than micelles to obtain better retention anionic surfactants with electric charges opposite to those of metal ions are often chosen for meuf as presented in table 1 sodium dodecyl sulfate sds is the most commonly used surfactant for the effective removal of metal cations such as ni2 sr2 co2 and zn2 however in the case of cr2o7 2 removal cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab a cationic surfactant was selected in meuf the membrane materials are mainly covered ps polyamide pam cellulose and ceramic metal removal efficiency by meuf relies on the surfactants membrane materials solution ph metal concentrations ionic strength and other parameters related to membrane operation chhatre et al 55 used 20 kd ps as the membrane and sds as the surfactant to remove ni2 from aqueous solution the ni2 rejection was found to be 99 5 at ph 3 10 and the optimum surfactant to metal molar ratio was 10 ferella et al 56 investigated the effects of cationic and anionic surfactants on the performance of meuf in their study the uf process was performed by a monotubular ceramic membrane with a pore size of 20 nm the results show a quantitative removal of lead ions 99 in pb dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid dsa systems 2 2 nanofiltration nf is the most effective pressure driven methodology used in various chemical and biotech industries it is an intermediate technique between uf and ro 65 the advantages of nf are low energy requirement high effectiveness for heavy metal removal ease of operation and lower pressure demand than ro 66 the nf efficiency depends on many factors such as pressure temperature ph membrane configuration and feed concentration the nf membranes are usually made up of synthetic polymers that are positively or negatively charged on the surface which helps to dissociate the heavy metals and enhance the membrane performance due to the electrostatic interaction between the membrane and metal ions the removal efficiencies of heavy metals by various nf methods are summarized in table 2 similar to uf the separation mechanisms of uf are size exclusion and charge exclusion 67 zhu et al 69 designed a dual layer nf hollow membrane using polybenzimidazole pbi polyethersulfone pes and polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp for heavy metal ion cd2 cr2o7 2 and pb2 removal the separation performance between themembrane and these metal ions and the potential of a dual layer hollow nf membrane were investigated the rejection rates of mg2 and cd2 were 98 and 95 respectively altering the ph of the solution the rejection rates of cr2o7 2 and pb2 reached 98 and 93 respectively zhu et al 68 used a nf membrane synthesized by pes hollow fiber supports with a spinning procedure and grafted by trimesoyl chloride tmc and m phenylenediamine mpd for heavy metal removal the rejection rate was investigated against metals such as pb2 cu2 and cd2 which reached 99 67 99 61 and 99 13 respectively fig 4 the presence of nh2 groups makes the surface of the membrane more positively charged in the acidic medium which improves the hydrophilicity of the membrane and increases water permeability revealing a better stable activity and good anti fouling properties abdi et al 70 produced a magnetic graphene based composite mmgo introduced polyethersulfone pes polymer through phase inversion induced by the immersion precipitation method fig 5a the mmgo hybrid affected the cross sectional morphology and improved the hydrophilicity and pure water flux as well fig 5b shows the results of the effect of time on cu2 removal efficiency the mmgo embedded pes membrane exhibited a higher cu2 rejection efficiency 90 6 than the pristine pes membrane similarly alrashdi et al 72 studied the removal of heavy metal ions by using a nf membrane nf270 at a lower concentration of cu2 ions 1000 mg l the rejection rate reached 100 when the concentration of copper is increased to 2000 mg l the rejection rate decreases to 58 which means that this nf270 membrane is efficient for the removal of lower concentrations of copper ions pino et al 71 evaluate the rejection capacity of two commercial membranes nf90 and nf270 to remove cu2 and sulfate from acid mine drainage amd the experimental data show that nf90 possesses better rejection performance 95 at an operating pressure higher than 5 bar fig 5d and e 2 3 reverse osmosis osmosis can be defined as a natural process in which water molecules spontaneously move from a solution of low solute concentration and low osmotic pressure to a solution of high solute concentration and high osmotic pressure across a semipermeable membrane 79 the flow of water molecules can be stopped or reversed by applying external pressure to a high concentration solution feed solution if the applied pressure difference is greater than the osmotic difference across the membrane the water molecules are forced to flow in the opposite direction from the natural osmotic phenomenon 80 in such a case the process occurring is known as ro the ro membrane pore size ranges from 0 1 to 1 0 nm this technology was mostly used in the desalination process 81 currently the usage of ro is rising in wastewater for the removal of heavy metals however there are many faults in this process that require high energy high pressure for operation generally the pore sizes of ro membranes are between 0 1 and 1 nm fig 6 compared with uf and nf membranes ro usually exhibited better performance in heavy metal ions removal and desalination various experiments have been carried out in ro membranes to recycle and treat electroplating wastewater the capability of the ro membrane depends upon the membrane material ph temperature pressure and clogging characteristics of the membrane to avoid fouling of the membrane a pretreatment of wastewater was often conducted to remove the colloidal particles 49 compared to nf membranes ro membranes need a higher operating pressure due to their characteristics the ro membrane is also denser and does not have definite pores heavy metal removal using the ro process was initially studied by ozaki et al 82 for the treatment of electroplating wastewater with low concentrations 10mg l of various heavy metals cu cr and ni 98 75 rejection of heavy metals was achieved using the ultra low pressure ro membrane ulprom the study also suggested that ph played a role in determining the removal efficiency petrinic et al 83 studied the treatment of wastewater from the metal smelting industry by using combined membrane techniques of uf and ro to remove suspended solids and heavy metals from wastewater the uf process was used as a pretreatment process to eliminate the clogging problem in the ro membrane the results showed that combined membrane technology can remove approximately 91 3 to 99 8 of the contaminants from the effluent such as organic metal elements and inorganic compounds chon et al 84 estimated the performance of municipal wastewater plants which consist of combined coagulation disk filtration mf and ro processes they investigated the removal of organic materials metals metalloids and nutrients from wastewater using the abovementioned techniques the results showed that the ro method can obtain a better heavy metal removal than the other techniques dialynas et al 85 observed the evaluation of ro in a membrane bioreactor mbr to treat low concentrations of heavy metal ions the results revealed almost 100 removal efficiency of pb2 and ni2 89 of cro4 2 and lower removal efficiency of cu2 49 the lowest cu2 removal is linked to its high concentration in the inlet 1345 mg l which is 7 times higher than the other three studied heavy metals the removal efficiencies of heavy metals by several typcial ro methods are summarized in table 3 2 4 electrodialysis ed is an electromembrane method that transfers ions aided by the electricity applied across the membrane 90 the ed stack is embedded in the anionic and the cationic exchange membranes which are placed between the two electrodes fig 7 it allows only the anions to pass through the anionic exchange membrane and vice versa 91 thus the aqueous solution flowed into the ed system is partitioned into two divisions i e concentrate and diluent ed has several advantages such as chemical free and high recovery of clean water to date many studies have successfully employed ed for heavy metal removal various ed methods which have been applied in heavy metal removal are presented in table 4 sadyrbaeva et al 92 used a liquid membrane incorporated with tri n octylamine with mixtures of di 2 ethylhexyl phosphoric acid d2ehpa in 1 2 dichloroethane to remove cr2o7 2 from aqueous solutions the complete extraction of cr2o7 2 was 99 5 in this study under optimum conditions chen et al 93 designed a two stage ed system to concentrate and purify cr2o7 2 in this designed ed system the concentration of cr2o7 2 at 418 mg l which existed as hcro4 at low ph was concentrated by up to 191 during the second stage of the operation at ph values higher than 8 5 in which cr exists as cro4 2 cr was retained in the concentrated stream while other monovalent ions were successfully removed benvenuti et al 94 used ed to concentrate ni2 and other salts existing in the nickel electroplating process so that the water could be recycled for the subsequent electroplating process and electroplating washing the maximum extraction efficiency of ni2 achieved 97 4 at ph 4 and a feed concentration of 275mg l in presence of other salts liu et al 95 investigated the processing of hydrometallurgical copper ore using a bipolar membrane ed system a current density of 3 0 ma cm2 a volume ratio between the rc and the hmc 1 15 and a duration of 40 h were the optimal experimental parameters the removal efficiencies of heavy metals were 99 3 99 1 99 0 84 9 70 6 95 8 and 94 8 for fe3 zn2 cu2 ni2 cr2o7 2 cd2 and as3 respectively fig 8 the current density has a great influence on heavy metal removal current efficiency and specific energy consumption the optimal density was 3 0 ma cm2 increasing the number of rcs from one to two and three the current efficiency was increased from 54 0 to 106 9 and 157 9 beyond 45 h of process there was no significant improvement in heavy metal removal in comparison with 40 h 3 evaluation and comparison of membrane processes for heavy metal removal owing to the function of physical interception the pore screen is the critical mechanism in membrane separation the key characteristics controlling physical interception are the pore size of the membrane and the size of the target pollutants sludge particles metal ions etc by tuning the pore size of the membranes the efficient removal of various types of pollutants can be acheived solutes smaller than the pore sizes of the membrane can pass through the membrane while larger solutes will be retained fig 9 in an aqueous solution water molecules combine with metal ions by electrostatic ion dipole bonds to form hydration ions however their hydration radius is still too small to be retained by the microporous membrane in the membrane process the mf membrane can only intercept suspended particles while the uf membrane can intercept some macromolecules besides suspended particles however in the actual separation process with the help of chemical reagents the uf methods are able to remove heavy metal ions such as peuf and meuf when polymer micellar is added to a feed solution metal ions react with these agents to produce sufficiently large complexing agents or micellar compounds which are filtered by the uf membrane through a size exclusion mechanism nf and ro can effectively remove heavy metal ions and the ro film even has a good interception effect on monovalent ions this is mainly due to the fact that there are no holes or very tight holes in the nf and ro membranes which only allow the diffusion and passage of water molecules while inhibiting the passage of metal ions in summary different membrane methods are applicable to different applications based on their characteristics the advantages and disadvantages of the four membrane processes discussed previously were compared in table 5 for heavy metal removal and the limitations of each membrane process should be considered and optimized according to the features of the heavy metal contaminate wastewater it is worth noting that the presence of other organic pollutants in the wastewater will also affect the removal efficiency of the membrane toward metal ions 111 112 in most cases the rejection efficiency of heavy metals is greatly improved owing to the complexation between macromolecule organic pollutants and metal ions 113 however the presence of metal ions exhibited detrimental effect on the organic pollutants rejection efficiency of chelated membranes due to the destruction action of heavy metals on the organic pollutants 114 if the process parameters do not match the industrial application of removal efficiency may be seriously reduced nf and ro membranes require a higher operating pressure and therefore more stringent process requirements resulting in more serious membrane fouling than uf membranes uf nf and ro can be used together to treat wastewater with high concentrations of metal ions ed allows only anions to pass through the anionic exchange membrane and vice versa generally perfect technology does not exist especially for a single system in account of many parameters and treatment requirements therefore it is necessary to optimize the performance of various membrane methods for the removal of heavy metals at different application cases developing new functional materials or combining various treatment methods is a common modification approach to realize ultrahigh heavy metal removal membrane technology will be the most effective method for heavy metal removal once its disadvantages are overcame and the performance can be further improved 4 conclusions and perspectives this paper reviewed the aspects related to heavy metal membrane removal including the membrane process and the mechanisms and performance of four different membrane methods membrane separation technology shows great potential for heavy metal ions removal among which are the four membrane methods discussed before possessing their advantages and disadvantages mf membrane shows poor heavy metals rejection due to its large pore size the pore size of uf membrane is still considered too large for heavy metal ions the rejection efficiency could be enhanced by selecting appropriate polymer micelle agent and low operating pressure also makes its process more feasible nf has been shown to effectively remove heavy metal ions due to its smaller membrane pore size the high operation pressure low water flux and high energy consumption of ro caused by internal concentration polarization makes it only worth using in drinking water the operating cost of ed is normally between nf and ro as a promising method for treating heavy metal wastewater it is necessary to match the appropriate electrode and potential to optimize the purification process and improve the economic feasibility moreover the performance of the membrane is highly dependent on the number and size of pores on the membrane surface as well the functional groups on the surface of the membrane could retain the heavy metal ions and provide active sites for anchoring the metal ions despite the achieved adancements there are still several challenges and opportunities 1 to fabricate large scale low cost and efficient membranes smarter physical and chemical synthetic routes are required moreover finely tuning the properties of the membranes must be further studied for better removal efficiency of heavy metals 2 future prospects should be concerned with enhancing the performance of the membranes especially through modification and composite methods to improve the compatibility of membranes surface functionalization is challenging and requires the rational design of functional group sizes types and grafting methods covalent binding of the functional groups on mechanically stable metal oxides or carbon surfaces can endow the materials with strong mechanical strength thus improving their applicability for real applications 3 most of the membranes are assembled on polymeric or ceramic materials which would limit the significant improvement of heavy metal removal efficiency therefore

reverse osmosis electrodialysis mechanisms data availability data will be made available on request 1 overview the rapid development of industrialization and the massive increase in population have caused serious water pollution water is the most component for human life and the water demand has increased sevenfold due to the quadrupled global population in the last century 1 2 heavy metal is a general term for metals with an atomic density 4 5 g cm 3 3 since the beginning of the 21st century heavy metal pollution has become a global environmental problem 4 6 because of its wide distribution substantial toxicity and easy migration 7 8 heavy metals are mostly derived from both natural and anthropogenic sources 9 natural sources mainly comprised weathering and volcanic eruption 10 at present anthropogenic activities are the main cause of heavy metal pollution mainly including electroplating petroleum and metal smelting 11 governments around the world have set maximum permissible limits for the discharge of toxic heavy metals 12 however the control of heavy metal wastewater discharge is difficult under realistic conditions once excess heavy metal ions discharge into water streams and even drinking water they can cause great harm to human health 13 heavy metal ions with serious toxic hazards to human body include hg cd pb as cr and so on the uncontrolled discharge of heavy metals by industry might seriously threaten human health and ecosystem the toxic heavy metals must be removed from the wastewater effluent prior to discharging into the environment numerous methods for heavy metal removal have been reported such as chemical precipitation and flocculation where heavy metal ions are transformed into solid precipitates and separated from the liquid phase 14 16 for another methods such as adsorption and ion exchange methods are mainly based on concentrating the ions from a liquid phase to the solid surface and then releasing them to a concentrate media 17 20 however most of these approaches encounter trestrictions due to the high cost low removal efficiency and secondary pollutaion limiting their scale applications 21 24 among all the remediation methods for heavy metal contaiminted wastewater membrane separation technologies mst possess some great properties for scale applications such as excellent heavy metal rejection high efficiency easy operation and low space requirements which have been considered as favorable treatment methods for heavy metal removal 25 26 membrane filtration is a kind of separation technology that utilizes a membrane to separate substrates when a driving force is applied across the membrane membrane filtration separates substrates based on the substrate size membrane pore size solution concentration and the applied pressure in recent decades membrane technologies have received increasing attention for the treatment of heavy metals fig 1 as seen the number of published articles related to membrane methods for heavy metal removal retrieval with the topics of membrane and heavy metal removal increased by nearly tenfold from 2011 to 2021 correspondingly the number growth of membrane method citations shows the same trend and this number is expected to rise more in the upcoming years the proportion of four membrane methods for heavy metal removal in the order of ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro and electrodialysis ed of which uf and ro possess higher citation ratios indicating that they have gained higher interest there have been some discussions on membrane method reviews 27 29 but very few focused on heavy metals from wastewater and new research needs to be summarized and updated over time thus the purpose of the present mini review is to provide a summary and outlook on the opportunities and challenges in the membrane filtration field for heavy metal removal furthermore the present review offers a summary and outlook on the opportunities and challenges in the membrane filtration therefore this review is aimed to promote the development of heavy metals removal by membrane technology with significance 2 membrane filtration for heavy metal removal there has been much interest in the development of high pressure driven membranes for heavy metals removal which are mainly operated by the size exclusion and donnan charge repulsion mechanisms 30 32 the means of driving membranes requires high operational pressure thus the compressive strength of the membrane is an important index to measure its performance 33 the material is the most critical factor in determining membrane performance such as water permeability porosity hydrophilicity surface charge and thermal mechanical stability 34 35 membrane materials are mainly classified into two categories e g ceramics and polymers generally ceramic membranes are more applicable for industrial wastewater treatment than polymers due to their chemical resistance capacity and hydrophobicity 36 37 however ceramic membranes also present defects such as their fragile features and high cost for construction and operation 38 polymer materials such as polysulfone ps polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and polypropylene pp are often applied for commercial membranes due to their resistance to chemicals 39 40 depending on the different operation method and driving pressure of the membranes the most commonly used membrane filtration processes for heavy metal treatment are uf nf ro and several emerging membrane technologies such as ed 41 fig 2 shows the statistical summary of the membrane method for heavy metal removal using the citespace tool retrieved date 24th september 2021 database scopus for the removal of heavy metals as seen in fig 2 some types of membrane materials such as cellulose acetate ceramic carbon nanotubes and graphene have also gained great attention simultaneously uf and nf are two of the most concerning membrane methods for heavy metal removal another membrane filtration technology microfiltration is rarely applied for heavy metal removal since its large pore size 100 1000 nm is not an absolute barrier for heavy metals therefore this section mainly focus on providing a comprehensive review of the most feasible techniques in heavy metal removal based on these membrane processes 42 characteristics of membranes are additionally provided to further illustrate the relationship between removal performance and membrane materials experimental parameters 2 1 ultrafiltration uf is a variety of membrane filtration methods using a permeable membrane to separate heavy metals macromolecules and suspended solids by forces such as pressure or concentration gradients 43 normally the uf pore sizes are 5 20 nm which are larger than dissolved metal ions in the forms of either hydrated ions or complexes with common ligands thus uf must be modified to remove heavy metals from aqueous solution 44 to overcome the defects of removing metal ions by uf membranes there are two main approaches that are named as polymer enhanced ultrafiltration and peuf micellar enhanced uf meuf 45 the combination of macromolecular complexation with uf to selectively separate small solute molecules e g dyes and metal ions from aqueous solutions was first proposed in 1968 by michaels 47 the relevant filtration process and mechanism of uf and nf are shown in fig 3a for the two membrane filtration systems uf and nf processes require a driving pressure difference and the operating pressure of nf is often higher than that of uf due to the difference in membrane size and operating pressure the two membrane systems intercept different heavy metal species usually nf can screen substances except monovalent ions while uf can only intercept most suspended heavy metal particles polymer bound heavy metal heavy metal floccus colloids and most heavy metal ions generally polymeric materials are classified into three types natural polymers synthesized polymers and commercial polymers peuf is a type of uf purification technology that uses water soluble polymeric agents polymeric agents attach to metal ions to form macromolecules and these molecules cannot pass through the membrane simply because of size limitations fig 3b the macromolecules containing metal ions can be recovered and polymeric agents can be utilized for other purposes 48 natural and synthesized polymer usage are great in the case of lab scale applications but on a large scale their applications are limited 49 the peuf technique has high removal efficiency and high formation of macromolecules which are the major advantages of this filtration process several studies have reported the peuf treatment of heavy metal ion from wastewater qiu et al 50 used the copolymer of maleic acid and acrylic acid as a complexing ligand in the peuf process for the removal of manganese from wastewater the results show that the recovery efficiency of mn2 ions was up to 99 6 and the permeate removal was only 2 of the total process li et al 51 compared the ligands of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta nitrilotriacetic acid nta and citric acids as the complexing agents in the peuf process for the cd2 removal from wastewater the results illustrate that ph contributes greatly to the heavy metal removal efficiency the removal efficiency was lowat ph 4 0 without edta ligand the author explains that with edta the dominant cd species are negatively charged cd edta 2 and cdh edta which interact with pei through electrostatic attraction and are less ph dependent through comprehensive analyses it was found that peuf with the nta ligand possessed the best removal capacity which was higher than 97 under the optimum conditions similar research was carried out by shao et al 52 for the recovery of nickel from aqueous solutions by the peuf process with polyacrylate sodium paas and pei the results showed that under optimum experimental conditions the ni2 removal efficiency reached 99 5 by using paas and 93 5 by using pei as the complexation agent respectively mondal et al 46 synthesized ps based composite uf membranes by liquid casting methods and the membrane surface contained large numbers of active sites that possessed good interception for heavy metal pollutants the composite membrane mainly consists of psf polyacrylonitrile pan polyethylene glycol peg graphene oxide go which shows a maximum removal efficiency of 98 24 for pb2 fig 3c the addition of pan and go makes the membranes more porous and having a higher permeate flux simultaneously enhances the membrane compactness and surface properties more details of peuf and its heavy metal removal are shown in table 1 since polymers have a complex structure the separation of specific metal ions is problematic and it is difficult to recreate those polymers on the other hand natural polymers have low water solubility which increases the difficulty of separation 53 on this basis the meuf method was proposed to remove the pollutant from wastewater meuf was first proposed for the removal of heavy metal ions from wastewater by scamehorn et al in 1980 54 compared to peuf meuf has been identified as an efficient separation method for the removal of heavy metals from wastewater this method relies on the addition of surfactants into wastewater when the concentration of surfactants in water is higher than the critical micelle concentration cmc the surfactant will aggregate into micelles which wrap metal ions to form large metal surfactant structures the micelles with metals will be retained by uf membranes which possess smaller pores than micelles to obtain better retention anionic surfactants with electric charges opposite to those of metal ions are often chosen for meuf as presented in table 1 sodium dodecyl sulfate sds is the most commonly used surfactant for the effective removal of metal cations such as ni2 sr2 co2 and zn2 however in the case of cr2o7 2 removal cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab a cationic surfactant was selected in meuf the membrane materials are mainly covered ps polyamide pam cellulose and ceramic metal removal efficiency by meuf relies on the surfactants membrane materials solution ph metal concentrations ionic strength and other parameters related to membrane operation chhatre et al 55 used 20 kd ps as the membrane and sds as the surfactant to remove ni2 from aqueous solution the ni2 rejection was found to be 99 5 at ph 3 10 and the optimum surfactant to metal molar ratio was 10 ferella et al 56 investigated the effects of cationic and anionic surfactants on the performance of meuf in their study the uf process was performed by a monotubular ceramic membrane with a pore size of 20 nm the results show a quantitative removal of lead ions 99 in pb dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid dsa systems 2 2 nanofiltration nf is the most effective pressure driven methodology used in various chemical and biotech industries it is an intermediate technique between uf and ro 65 the advantages of nf are low energy requirement high effectiveness for heavy metal removal ease of operation and lower pressure demand than ro 66 the nf efficiency depends on many factors such as pressure temperature ph membrane configuration and feed concentration the nf membranes are usually made up of synthetic polymers that are positively or negatively charged on the surface which helps to dissociate the heavy metals and enhance the membrane performance due to the electrostatic interaction between the membrane and metal ions the removal efficiencies of heavy metals by various nf methods are summarized in table 2 similar to uf the separation mechanisms of uf are size exclusion and charge exclusion 67 zhu et al 69 designed a dual layer nf hollow membrane using polybenzimidazole pbi polyethersulfone pes and polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp for heavy metal ion cd2 cr2o7 2 and pb2 removal the separation performance between themembrane and these metal ions and the potential of a dual layer hollow nf membrane were investigated the rejection rates of mg2 and cd2 were 98 and 95 respectively altering the ph of the solution the rejection rates of cr2o7 2 and pb2 reached 98 and 93 respectively zhu et al 68 used a nf membrane synthesized by pes hollow fiber supports with a spinning procedure and grafted by trimesoyl chloride tmc and m phenylenediamine mpd for heavy metal removal the rejection rate was investigated against metals such as pb2 cu2 and cd2 which reached 99 67 99 61 and 99 13 respectively fig 4 the presence of nh2 groups makes the surface of the membrane more positively charged in the acidic medium which improves the hydrophilicity of the membrane and increases water permeability revealing a better stable activity and good anti fouling properties abdi et al 70 produced a magnetic graphene based composite mmgo introduced polyethersulfone pes polymer through phase inversion induced by the immersion precipitation method fig 5a the mmgo hybrid affected the cross sectional morphology and improved the hydrophilicity and pure water flux as well fig 5b shows the results of the effect of time on cu2 removal efficiency the mmgo embedded pes membrane exhibited a higher cu2 rejection efficiency 90 6 than the pristine pes membrane similarly alrashdi et al 72 studied the removal of heavy metal ions by using a nf membrane nf270 at a lower concentration of cu2 ions 1000 mg l the rejection rate reached 100 when the concentration of copper is increased to 2000 mg l the rejection rate decreases to 58 which means that this nf270 membrane is efficient for the removal of lower concentrations of copper ions pino et al 71 evaluate the rejection capacity of two commercial membranes nf90 and nf270 to remove cu2 and sulfate from acid mine drainage amd the experimental data show that nf90 possesses better rejection performance 95 at an operating pressure higher than 5 bar fig 5d and e 2 3 reverse osmosis osmosis can be defined as a natural process in which water molecules spontaneously move from a solution of low solute concentration and low osmotic pressure to a solution of high solute concentration and high osmotic pressure across a semipermeable membrane 79 the flow of water molecules can be stopped or reversed by applying external pressure to a high concentration solution feed solution if the applied pressure difference is greater than the osmotic difference across the membrane the water molecules are forced to flow in the opposite direction from the natural osmotic phenomenon 80 in such a case the process occurring is known as ro the ro membrane pore size ranges from 0 1 to 1 0 nm this technology was mostly used in the desalination process 81 currently the usage of ro is rising in wastewater for the removal of heavy metals however there are many faults in this process that require high energy high pressure for operation generally the pore sizes of ro membranes are between 0 1 and 1 nm fig 6 compared with uf and nf membranes ro usually exhibited better performance in heavy metal ions removal and desalination various experiments have been carried out in ro membranes to recycle and treat electroplating wastewater the capability of the ro membrane depends upon the membrane material ph temperature pressure and clogging characteristics of the membrane to avoid fouling of the membrane a pretreatment of wastewater was often conducted to remove the colloidal particles 49 compared to nf membranes ro membranes need a higher operating pressure due to their characteristics the ro membrane is also denser and does not have definite pores heavy metal removal using the ro process was initially studied by ozaki et al 82 for the treatment of electroplating wastewater with low concentrations 10mg l of various heavy metals cu cr and ni 98 75 rejection of heavy metals was achieved using the ultra low pressure ro membrane ulprom the study also suggested that ph played a role in determining the removal efficiency petrinic et al 83 studied the treatment of wastewater from the metal smelting industry by using combined membrane techniques of uf and ro to remove suspended solids and heavy metals from wastewater the uf process was used as a pretreatment process to eliminate the clogging problem in the ro membrane the results showed that combined membrane technology can remove approximately 91 3 to 99 8 of the contaminants from the effluent such as organic metal elements and inorganic compounds chon et al 84 estimated the performance of municipal wastewater plants which consist of combined coagulation disk filtration mf and ro processes they investigated the removal of organic materials metals metalloids and nutrients from wastewater using the abovementioned techniques the results showed that the ro method can obtain a better heavy metal removal than the other techniques dialynas et al 85 observed the evaluation of ro in a membrane bioreactor mbr to treat low concentrations of heavy metal ions the results revealed almost 100 removal efficiency of pb2 and ni2 89 of cro4 2 and lower removal efficiency of cu2 49 the lowest cu2 removal is linked to its high concentration in the inlet 1345 mg l which is 7 times higher than the other three studied heavy metals the removal efficiencies of heavy metals by several typcial ro methods are summarized in table 3 2 4 electrodialysis ed is an electromembrane method that transfers ions aided by the electricity applied across the membrane 90 the ed stack is embedded in the anionic and the cationic exchange membranes which are placed between the two electrodes fig 7 it allows only the anions to pass through the anionic exchange membrane and vice versa 91 thus the aqueous solution flowed into the ed system is partitioned into two divisions i e concentrate and diluent ed has several advantages such as chemical free and high recovery of clean water to date many studies have successfully employed ed for heavy metal removal various ed methods which have been applied in heavy metal removal are presented in table 4 sadyrbaeva et al 92 used a liquid membrane incorporated with tri n octylamine with mixtures of di 2 ethylhexyl phosphoric acid d2ehpa in 1 2 dichloroethane to remove cr2o7 2 from aqueous solutions the complete extraction of cr2o7 2 was 99 5 in this study under optimum conditions chen et al 93 designed a two stage ed system to concentrate and purify cr2o7 2 in this designed ed system the concentration of cr2o7 2 at 418 mg l which existed as hcro4 at low ph was concentrated by up to 191 during the second stage of the operation at ph values higher than 8 5 in which cr exists as cro4 2 cr was retained in the concentrated stream while other monovalent ions were successfully removed benvenuti et al 94 used ed to concentrate ni2 and other salts existing in the nickel electroplating process so that the water could be recycled for the subsequent electroplating process and electroplating washing the maximum extraction efficiency of ni2 achieved 97 4 at ph 4 and a feed concentration of 275mg l in presence of other salts liu et al 95 investigated the processing of hydrometallurgical copper ore using a bipolar membrane ed system a current density of 3 0 ma cm2 a volume ratio between the rc and the hmc 1 15 and a duration of 40 h were the optimal experimental parameters the removal efficiencies of heavy metals were 99 3 99 1 99 0 84 9 70 6 95 8 and 94 8 for fe3 zn2 cu2 ni2 cr2o7 2 cd2 and as3 respectively fig 8 the current density has a great influence on heavy metal removal current efficiency and specific energy consumption the optimal density was 3 0 ma cm2 increasing the number of rcs from one to two and three the current efficiency was increased from 54 0 to 106 9 and 157 9 beyond 45 h of process there was no significant improvement in heavy metal removal in comparison with 40 h 3 evaluation and comparison of membrane processes for heavy metal removal owing to the function of physical interception the pore screen is the critical mechanism in membrane separation the key characteristics controlling physical interception are the pore size of the membrane and the size of the target pollutants sludge particles metal ions etc by tuning the pore size of the membranes the efficient removal of various types of pollutants can be acheived solutes smaller than the pore sizes of the membrane can pass through the membrane while larger solutes will be retained fig 9 in an aqueous solution water molecules combine with metal ions by electrostatic ion dipole bonds to form hydration ions however their hydration radius is still too small to be retained by the microporous membrane in the membrane process the mf membrane can only intercept suspended particles while the uf membrane can intercept some macromolecules besides suspended particles however in the actual separation process with the help of chemical reagents the uf methods are able to remove heavy metal ions such as peuf and meuf when polymer micellar is added to a feed solution metal ions react with these agents to produce sufficiently large complexing agents or micellar compounds which are filtered by the uf membrane through a size exclusion mechanism nf and ro can effectively remove heavy metal ions and the ro film even has a good interception effect on monovalent ions this is mainly due to the fact that there are no holes or very tight holes in the nf and ro membranes which only allow the diffusion and passage of water molecules while inhibiting the passage of metal ions in summary different membrane methods are applicable to different applications based on their characteristics the advantages and disadvantages of the four membrane processes discussed previously were compared in table 5 for heavy metal removal and the limitations of each membrane process should be considered and optimized according to the features of the heavy metal contaminate wastewater it is worth noting that the presence of other organic pollutants in the wastewater will also affect the removal efficiency of the membrane toward metal ions 111 112 in most cases the rejection efficiency of heavy metals is greatly improved owing to the complexation between macromolecule organic pollutants and metal ions 113 however the presence of metal ions exhibited detrimental effect on the organic pollutants rejection efficiency of chelated membranes due to the destruction action of heavy metals on the organic pollutants 114 if the process parameters do not match the industrial application of removal efficiency may be seriously reduced nf and ro membranes require a higher operating pressure and therefore more stringent process requirements resulting in more serious membrane fouling than uf membranes uf nf and ro can be used together to treat wastewater with high concentrations of metal ions ed allows only anions to pass through the anionic exchange membrane and vice versa generally perfect technology does not exist especially for a single system in account of many parameters and treatment requirements therefore it is necessary to optimize the performance of various membrane methods for the removal of heavy metals at different application cases developing new functional materials or combining various treatment methods is a common modification approach to realize ultrahigh heavy metal removal membrane technology will be the most effective method for heavy metal removal once its disadvantages are overcame and the performance can be further improved 4 conclusions and perspectives this paper reviewed the aspects related to heavy metal membrane removal including the membrane process and the mechanisms and performance of four different membrane methods membrane separation technology shows great potential for heavy metal ions removal among which are the four membrane methods discussed before possessing their advantages and disadvantages mf membrane shows poor heavy metals rejection due to its large pore size the pore size of uf membrane is still considered too large for heavy metal ions the rejection efficiency could be enhanced by selecting appropriate polymer micelle agent and low operating pressure also makes its process more feasible nf has been shown to effectively remove heavy metal ions due to its smaller membrane pore size the high operation pressure low water flux and high energy consumption of ro caused by internal concentration polarization makes it only worth using in drinking water the operating cost of ed is normally between nf and ro as a promising method for treating heavy metal wastewater it is necessary to match the appropriate electrode and potential to optimize the purification process and improve the economic feasibility moreover the performance of the membrane is highly dependent on the number and size of pores on the membrane surface as well the functional groups on the surface of the membrane could retain the heavy metal ions and provide active sites for anchoring the metal ions despite the achieved adancements there are still several challenges and opportunities 1 to fabricate large scale low cost and efficient membranes smarter physical and chemical synthetic routes are required moreover finely tuning the properties of the membranes must be further studied for better removal efficiency of heavy metals 2 future prospects should be concerned with enhancing the performance of the membranes especially through modification and composite methods to improve the compatibility of membranes surface functionalization is challenging and requires the rational design of functional group sizes types and grafting methods covalent binding of the functional groups on mechanically stable metal oxides or carbon surfaces can endow the materials with strong mechanical strength thus improving their applicability for real applications 3 most of the membranes are assembled on polymeric or ceramic materials which would limit the significant improvement of heavy metal removal efficiency therefore emphasis on the development of emerging membrane materials such as graphene carbone nanotubes mxene and transition metal dichalcogenides is essential to enhance the membrane properties for heavy metal removal thus the design of a cost effective membrane for heavy metal removal should find a trade off situation where a balanced condition is achieved among performance cost and durability membrane methods for heavy metal removal are anticipated to play a significant role and have a bright future in heavy metal contaminated water treatment credit authorship contribution statement author i
