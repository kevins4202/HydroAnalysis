2545,dipole flow tracer test dftt has been proposed to estimate the vertical distribution of hydrogeological parameters by fitting the simulated and observed breakthrough curves btcs in the extraction chamber of a vertical circulation well vcw previous studies of dftt models neglected the non equilibrium sorption of tracer and the mixing process in the wellbore which have been proved to strongly influence the estimation accuracy of the dftt in this study we developed an improved dftt model considering a two site non equilibrium sorption of the tracer as well as the impact of the mixing effects on the btc behavior in both the extraction and injection chambers the results indicate that when interpreting the dftt with commonly used organic tracers an overestimation and underestimation occurs especially when the models do not account for sorption and consider equilibrium sorption respectively in addition the mixing effect was observed to affect the transport process as well as the btc behaviors in the dftt leading to an overestimation of the dispersivity the improved model proposed in this work was used to interpret the dftt test conducted with rhodamine wt rwt at the lizzie field site north carolina results showed that the improved model had better performance in interpreting the dftt compared to the stream tube model proposed by sutton et al 2000 this is especially when fluorescent dyes such as rwt or rhodamine b are used as tracers furthermore unlike previous models the improved dftt model is not limited as it is fit for tracers with various types of sorption properties meanwhile the consideration for mixing effect in the wellbore characterized by an ordinary differential equation promotes the dftt interpretation accuracy and also has great potential in the simulation of in situ remediation of subsurface contaminants through vcw especially for in well bioreactor technology keywords dipole flow tracer test numerical model non equilibrium sorption mixing effect data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction a vertical circulation well vcw is a well composed of two screened intervals divided by a straddle packer making groundwater pulled into one chamber and the same amount of water pushed out from the other chamber into the aquifer simultaneously therefore a three dimensional axial symmetry flow field is formed around vcw without ambient groundwater flow as a vertical recirculating system with a flexible and adjustable packer vcw has been successfully used in two aspects one is in situ aquifer remediation in which both reagent injection and pollutant extraction are implemented at the same time through vcw papini et al 2016 yuan et al 2021 zhao et al 2016 the other one is as an interpretation tool for aquifer parameters which are critical to the development and protection of groundwater resources this study mainly focuses on the hydrogeological parameter estimation through vcw which is an indispensable and practical supplement to traditional pumping or tracer test theis 1935 gelhar and collins 1971 kabala 1993 proposed the concept of dipole flow test dft in a uniformly anisotropic aquifer and presented a mathematical model of the drawdowns in each chamber of vcw which was used to obtain the vertical distributions of both horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities as well as the specific storage coefficient based on dft sutton et al 2000 proposed a new single borehole tracer test called the dipole flow tracer test dftt their study employed a streamline approach without accounting for the transverse dispersion developing a semi analytical solution of breakthrough curves btcs in the extraction chamber and estimating the dispersivity of the aquifer in the lizzie field site north carolina whereafter reiha 2006 developed a comprehensive model of multi species advection dispersion reaction for dftt using a reactive tracer estimating the in situ reaction coefficient of the aquifer at canadian forces base borden generally speaking vcw has a strong potential in dftt for estimating hydrogeological parameters related to groundwater flow solute transport sorption and even biogeochemical reaction a series of studies on dftt have been conducted using mathematical modeling laboratory experiments and field tests for example chen et al 2010 characterized the distribution of conservative solute concentration around vcw with the laplace transform finite difference ltfd method later chen et al 2011 highlighted that transverse dispersivity had significant effects on the btcs i e ignoring the transverse dispersion might lead to estimation errors of dftt also barns et al 2012 interpreted a two dimensional laboratory experiment of the dftt using a tracer imaging methodology providing theoretical concepts for field dftt meanwhile sutton et al 2000 had estimated the performance of the streamline method through field dftt using rhodamine wt rwt as a tracer in field tests sorption of tracer was found to influence the estimation of the longitudinal dispersivity through dftt sutton et al 2000 as for tracer brusseau and reid 1991 proved experimentally that organic chemicals in porous media tend to present non equilibrium sorption especially when the medium contains a certain amount of organic matter similar to rwt some other commonly used tracers such as rhodamine b and pontacyl brilliant pink b prove to have sorption properties as well shiau et al 1993 close et al 2002 for numerical modelling chen et al 2019 addressed that the non equilibrium transport model fit for reactive solutes with sorption induced source and sink term in the governing equation and it had better performance compared to the local equilibrium models that had been in use in the past in addition sutton et al 2001 confirmed that a two site non equilibrium sorption model had more accurate characterization than a conventional equilibrium model in terms of the transport process of the rwt in the aquifer their results explained the unmatched fitting between the measured data and the calculated results by sutton et al 2000 which simplified the non equilibrium sorption into an equilibrium one to solve the dftt model similarly pang and close 1999 pointed out the necessity of accounting for two region sites with different non equilibrium sorption conditions due to the ease in transforming to a completely instantaneous or rate limited sorption model chen et al 2019 the two site non equilibrium model can fit to more types of tracers in the field test therefore it is important to use a two site non equilibrium sorption model which is a model for reactive solute in dftt accounting for non equilibrium sorption as for the dftt the estimation accuracy of the parameters including hydraulic conductivity anisotropy ratio longitudinal and transverse dispersivities is strongly dependent on the btcs observed in the extraction chamber which is greatly affected by the real time volume of water and mass of tracer inside the extraction chamber as for the well boundary conditions in the solute transport model wang et al 2018 addressed that the assumption of a constant concentration in the wellbore results in remarkable parameter estimation error through single well push pull test as chen et al 2006 and shi et al 2020 indicated the wellbore storage leads to a mixing process when there are concentration differences between the influent and effluent tracers which makes the observed btcs very different from the simulated ones without considering the mixing effects during the mixing process which leads to strong differences from conventional dirichlet or neuman boundaries the wellbore concentration variation is mainly dominated by the net increase after simultaneous inflow and outflow therefore wellbore volume has great effects on the modulation of mixing process the effects on real time concentration due to the mixing process in a wellbore with non negligible volume is called mixing effect as a special kind of well with two separated chambers in the same wellbore the vcw represents more mixing effects than a traditional well because the wellbore storage should be considered in both extraction and injection chambers however existing dftt models have not accounted for the mixing effect leading to poor estimation of parameters therefore it is essential to develop a more sophisticated model that accounts for the mixing effect in the dftt model in summary despite the extensive insights from previous works on dftts the limited application of non reactive transport models to characterize non equilibrium transport of tracer has led to unsatisfactory performances in actual field tests this is even more so when organic tracers are used additionally previous dftt studies have not accounted for the mixing effects on the dftt which are almost inevitable in a wellbore of a certain volume consequently we will develop an improved mathematical model of dftts which consider both the non equilibrium solute transport as well as the mixing effect the impacts of sorption properties and wellbore volume on dftts will be analyzed here in addition the improved model will be employed to interpret the dftt conducted at lizzie field site north carolina 2 problem statement and mathematical model this study considers the problem of non equilibrium solute transport in a vcw induced flow field with a mixing effect in both the extraction and injection chamber the simulated btc data in the extraction chamber is relevant for dftt interpretation as fig 1 indicates the configurations of the well and aquifer are similar to those of sutton et al 2000 however the origin in the cylindrical coordinate is located at the center of the packer the positive z axis extends to the top of the well while the positive r axis extends along the radial direction the distance between the origin and each center of the injection and extraction chambers is l the length of each screen is 2d and the wellbore radius is rw the centers of the extraction and injection screens have the coordinates rw l and rw l groundwater flows into the extraction chamber and releases back to the aquifer from the injection chamber at the same constant rate of q 2 1 groundwater flow model there are two assumptions applied in the groundwater flow model 1 the aquifer is confined homogeneous horizontally isotropic vertically anisotropic and radially infinite with constant thickness b 2 the ambient groundwater flow is neglected relative to the steady state flow field generated by vcw the governing equation with the corresponding initial and boundary conditions is formulated as xiang kabala 1997 chen et al 2010 1

in dftt in this study we developed an improved dftt model considering non equilibrium solute transport a schematic diagram for the conceptual model was shown in fig 2 a two site non equilibrium transport model was considered with sorption sites partitioned into two sites selim et al 1976 in which one is in equilibrium and the other one is assumed to follow first order kinetics jardine et al

assuming that there is no tracer in the aquifer before the test starts the initial condition is shown as follows 14 c r z t 0 0 the infinite boundary condition in the radial direction can be given as

important factor in the dftt the mixing effect was usually ignored in the previous models this study assumes the tracer is well mixed in both injection and extraction chambers the concentration of the tracer in two chambers with mixing effect is described as wang et al 2018 on the basis of the mass balance theory 17a v i c i t t q c ex t c 0 t c i t l d z l d 17b v ex c ex t t lw v r θ c t r r w q

represent wellbore tracer concentration in the injection and extraction chambers respectively m l3 and the initial tracer concentration is c i t 0 c ex t 0 0 according to the eqs 17a and 17b it is obvious that the water volume affects the mixing in the wellbore which is mainly dependent on the length of the screened intervals 2d and the radius of the well r w as shown in fig 3 this radial two dimensional numerical solute transport model is solved using finite element comsol multiphysics the parameters used in the model are summarized in table 1 the influence can be negligible when r 10 a l so the radial range of the research region is set up as 40 m zlotnik ledder 1996 the simulation duration is 1000 min with the time step to be 1 min the model domain was discretized into 133 532 elements and the elements are refined for the region near the well screen by increasing 50 of the mesh number the variation degree of the concentration at each node was less than 1 which means the discretization of this study is reliable 2 4 model verification the analytical dftt model developed by sutton et al 2000 which does not consider sorption is employed to check the accuracy of the improved mathematical model the btcs in the extraction chamber can be calculated as follows 18 c ex t lw q r c t lw q r the results simulated by the mathematical model are kept the same to the dimensionless form in sutton et al 2000 as follows 19 t d t t c 20 c exd t c ex t q t c m where t c is the characteristic time which is defined as t c 2 d u c u c is the characteristic pore water velocity at the well face which can be obtained by u c q 4 d π r w θ in the analytical solution by sutton et al 2000 the tracer is treated as a conservative solute without sorption while the transverse dispersion is neglected in the comsol multiphysics software when the injection duration decreases to be short enough with the peak value of btc changes less than 0 01 this extremely short period which is 5 s can be regarded as equivalent to the impulse injection of tracer in sutton et al 2000 in order to verify the accuracy of the numerical model by comparing with the model of sutton et al 2000 the parameters used for the model verification were kept the same as those in sutton et al 2000 which are b 10 m l 0 838 m d 0 432 m rw 0 05725 m θ 0 33 a2 1 αl 1 m αl 2d 0 005 m q 1 577 10 4 m3 s the comparison between the concentrations of this model and the analytical solution of sutton et al 2000 is shown in fig 4 the results obtained in this study agree very well with the analytical solution of sutton et al 2000 highlighting the reliability of this improved model 3 results and discussion 3 1 baseline simulation to assess the influence of non equilibrium sorption and mixing effect on solute plume distribution different modeling results were compared by using various values for k d α and r w in the baseline simulation both non equilibrium sorption and mixing effect are considered using the parameter values listed in table 1 unlike the parameter values for model verification the parameter values listed in table 1 were applied to reveal the influences of non equilibrium sorption and mixing effect on the btc behaviors of dftt with the improved model the parameters about wellbore structure such as l d and rw are given normal values in field tests for example the values of the hydrogeological parameters are the same as those in chen et al 2011 and chen and wang 2021 the parameter values of sorption have the same order of magnitude with those in qi et al 2021 and sharma et al 2021 the re circulation of solute in this study was conducted by the following steps a constant concentration tracer solution was poured with constant flux into the injection chamber within 600 s the poured solute was assumed to be fully mixed with water in the wellbore and then the mixed solute was injected into the aquifer meanwhile the solute was pulled into the extraction chamber after the migration within the aquifer and mixed with the water in the extraction well instantaneously that mixed concentration was then re poured into the injection well and mixed with the present solute recirculating back to the aquifer fig 5 displays the evolution of solute plume in baseline simulation at t 50 t 200 t 500 t 1000 min the solute is mainly distributed near the injection screen the distribution area increases over time but stretches within two meters in the radial direction besides the increasing area and the solute absorbed from the aqueous phase to the solid phase causes diluted concentration since the total mass of the solute is constant using the parameter values listed in table 1 the following sections represent the effects of non equilibrium sorption and wellbore mixing on btc behaviors in dftt 3 2 effects of non equilibrium sorption on btcs the tracer with non equilibrium sorption properties such as rhodamine wt can be described by a two site non equilibrium sorption model there are two factors that play a major role in the sorption process i e distribution coefficient k d and first order rate limited coefficient α fig 6 depicts the comparisons of simulated btcs in the cases of un absorbable tracer and tracers with equilibrium and non equilibrium sorption in which the distribution coefficients of two adsorbent tracers are the same as those listed in table 1 the comparisons between cases 1 2 and 3 as presented in fig 6 indicate that sorption results in a lower btc peak since a part of the tracer is absorbed and becomes immobile meanwhile the equilibrium sorption can be regarded as a special case of two site non equilibrium sorption which always keeps the equilibrium state in both regions accommodating a great amount of absorbed solute so that the equilibrium model yields a smaller btc peak than the non equilibrium one to further explore the effects of distribution coefficients k d on dftt fig 7 a characterizes the btcs in the extraction chamber with five different k d ranging from 1 10 5 m3 kg to 1 10 3 m3 kg for linear adsorption the results indicate that the value of btc is smaller with a greater distribution coefficient which also leads to a later arrival of peak value as well as a more distinct tailing phenomenon this is because a greater distribution coefficient indicates a greater mass of solute absorbed to the solid phase which has been elaborated in fig 7b fig 7b represents temporal absorbed mass with different k d indicating that the total absorbed mass increases much faster in the early time but has very limited accumulation in the late time when the sorption site has been almost occupied this is because the first order mass transfer rate during non equilibrium process is strongly dependent on the concentration difference between the local mobile concentration and the absorbed one as eq 12 indicates in addition a greater distribution coefficient results in a larger storage of mass in the absorbed phase which is released back to the mobile phase and generates a long btc tailing with a gentle slope in the late time to investigate the other parameters of non equilibrium sorption i e first order kinetic rate coefficient α fig 8 a indicates the btcs in the extraction chamber with different α ranging from 1 10 7 1 s to 1 10 3 1 s it can be observed that the peak concentration decreases as α increases and a greater α lead to a more distinct tailing of btc this is because a greater kinetic rate coefficient results in a stronger mass transfer process resulting in less mobile solute concentration in the early stage but releasing more solute back from absorbed phase in the late stage as fig 8b indicates the equilibrium sorption site of the two region non equilibrium model makes the absorbed mass quickly reaches a high level in the early stage whereafter in the late stage a smaller α which dominates the mass transfer process through the non equilibrium site leads to a slower increase in absorbed mass this is the reason why the curve of absorbed mass is almost horizontal in the late stage with an extremely small α which also makes the btc gradually approaches the curve without sorption in the late stage despite the analyses of the btcs above it is indeed that sorption has a great influence on the value and the arrival time of peak concentration the simulation results indicate that dftt will be affected by higher k d and α therefore if the tracer used in dftt has remarkably non equilibrium sorption properties an adsorption experiment in a laboratory is suggested to obtain the sorption parameters as support to the field dftt 3 3 effects of mixing effect on btcs this improved model assumes that the mixing process inside the wellbore happens instantaneously though it actually spends some time in addition the mixing process is assumed to satisfythemassbalancerequirement with the wellbore volume to be a main influencing factor as eqs 17a and 17b indicate fig 6 shows the comparison between the btcs that consider the mixing effect and those without the mixing effect from the comparison between cases 1 and 4 it can be observed that the tracer inside the wellbore is diluted considering the mixing effect resulting in a decreasing peak value additionally as eqs 17a and 17b show the btc induced by the mixing effect is strongly dependent on the wellbore volume which is mainly controlled by the well radius r w in dftt the btcs presented in fig 9 were generated by different r w ranging from 0 03 0 05 0 07 0 1 to 0 15 m respectively the results highlight that the tracer concentration is directly proportional to the increase in r w that is to say if a traditional model that does not consider the mixing effect is employed for practical dftt the dispersivity will be overestimated due to wellbore storage similarly a wellbore with a greater radius will result in a larger estimation error of the aquifer parameter 3 4 sensitivity analysis to evaluate how each parameter affects the behavior of btcs this study conducted a sensitivity analysis on some of the main parameters including k d α and r w here the normalized sensitivity was used to remove the ambuguity in units between different parameters kabala 2001 the equation is illustrated as follows 21 s i j ω j y i ω j where s i j is the normalized sensitivity of the jth analyzed parameter ω j at the ith time where ω j includes distribution coefficient first order kinetic rate coefficient and well radius in this study y i is a function of ω j and t a forward difference formula was proposed by huang and yeh 2007 to approximate the partial derivation and the equation shown in eq 24 22 y i ω j y i ω j δ ω j y i ω j δ ω j where δ ω j is the small increment in the denominator that is usually approximated as the product of the target parameter value and a factor of 10 1 i e δ ω j 10 1 ω j y i represents the dimensionless concentration fig 10 shows the sensitivity analysis of the distribution coefficient first order kinetic rate coefficient and well radius on the btcs in the extraction well the base values of the parameters used in this sensitivity analysis are b 10 m l 0 5 m d 0 1 m rw 0 05 m θ 0 3 ρb 1300 kg m3 a2 1 αl 1 m αt 0 2 m t0 600 s q 1 10 5 m3 s α 1 10 5 1 s k d 1 10 4 m3 kg f 0 5 and c0 1 kg m3 fig 10 reveals that the sensitivities of btc to all of the three parameters are negative the order of the magnitude of the parameter sensitivity is s rw s kd s α in addition the btc is most sensitive to the well radius at the early stage but at the later stage it is minimal furthermore the btc is less sensitive to the distribution coefficient or linear adsorption in contrast to the well radius within the first 160 min but increases after 160 min this is because the spatial concentration difference inside the wellbore is great at the early stage when the mixing effect has strong impacts on the observed btcs the mixing effect becomes weak when the concentration inside the wellbore approaches that of the prepared solute the sensitivity of the btc to k d reaches the highest level and then decreases this is because the equilibrium site is filled in the early stage after which the mass transfer through non equilibrium sorption gradually weakens and the btc is not that sensitive to k d anymore this also explains why btc is not sensitive to α which only dominates the non equilibrium sorption rather than the equilibrium one 4 application of the improved model after extensive theoretical evaluation and analyses of the model we tested its effectiveness by evaluating and validating with dftt work conducted by sutton et al 2000 in which the parameter estimation is strongly dependent on the relationship between the dimensionless peak concentration arrival time and the front arrival time it is defined as the time at which the btc concentration is 5 of the peak value the dftt was conducted at the lizzie field site where the formation mainly consists of gray sandy and shelly material with some clay and the porosity is 0 39 the test well l 32 with a radius of 0 05715 m located 17 17 m below the surface and the configuration parameters as fig 1 shows are l 0 838 m and d 0 1 m rwt was applied as a tracer with flow rate q 3 13 10 4 m3 s the other details about this field test can be found in sutton et al 2000 rwt has two isomers which have the same percentage but different sorption properties the btcs shown in fig 11 indicate the simulation results of dftts using rwt and isomer 1 in which the tracer of the latter one is captured earlier because of smaller retardation among the parameters employed in fig 11 the technological parameters e l d and rw and porosity θ were obtained from the field dftt in lizzie field site in the study of sutton et al 2000 the other parameters were yielded by fitting the observed data with the r square of 0 99 sutton et al 2000 developed a dftt model using stream tube method welty and gelhar 1994 which ignored transverse dispersion estimating the longitudinal dispersivity and the permeability anisotropy ratio although the simulated btc fitted well in the early stage it was less than the observed data which has a btc tailing in the late stage this is because the tracer has non equilibrium sorption and the neglect of non equilibrium resulted in errors in the estimation of dispersivity instead our model considers isomers that have different sorption properties which is depicted by the two site non equilibrium sorption model this two site model assumes that rwt follows linear isotherm sorption and has two types of sorption sites where instantaneous equilibrium sorption and first order rate limited sorption happen separately with a given ratio of the two site numbers f based on the field data in sutton et al 2000 we find that the observed btc can be fitted well with the following parameter values a 2 1 0087 αl 4 12 10 2 m αt 1 52 10 4 m f 0 5 the first order kinetic rate coefficient of isomer 1 α 1 and isomer 2 α 2 are 6 39 10 4 s 1 and 1 02 10 2 s 1 respectively the distribution coefficient of isomer 1 k d 1 and isomer 2 k d 2 are 9 96 10 4 m3 kg and 1 02 10 3 m3 kg respectively the performance of the simulation is estimated by the coefficient of determination r square which is calculated as follows 23 r s q u a r e 1 i 1 n c obs i c sim i 2 i 1 n c obs i c obs 2 where c obs i is the observed dimensionless concentration of the well l 32 at the ith time c sim i is the simulated dimensionless concentration at the ith time n is the number of the observed dimensionless concentration c obs is the average value of the observed dimensionless concentration of all the samples which is characterized as 24 c obs i n 1 c obs n the btcs simulated by sutton et al 2000 and the improved model are presented in fig 11 in which the r square for this model is 0 99 but 4 32 and 0 18 for the models of sutton et al 2000 using rwt which is composed of isomer mixture isomer 1 isomer 2 and only isomer 1 as tracers respectively sutton s modeling results fit with observed data well only in the early period however the improved model performs better for all periods the results indicate that the model accounting for both non equilibrium sorption and mixing effects has better performance in the interpretation of dftt thereby improving the overall accuracy of parameter estimation 5 summary and conclusions the dftt has been presented as a great in situ method to estimate the hydrogeological parameters such as permeability coefficient and dispersivity this study developed an improved model accounting for non equilibrium transport of tracer with mixing effect in the wellbore for a more accurate interpretation of the dftt the solute plume is exhibited under spatiotemporal distribution three parameters including distribution coefficient first order kinetic rate coefficient and radius of the well which strongly affect the observed btcs in the wellbore were analyzed in detail in addition the field data from sutton et al 2000 was used to test the effectiveness of this improved model over the previous one the following conclusions were drawn 1 non equilibrium sorption of tracer decreases the peak concentration of btcs and causes the delay in the arrival of the btc peak preventing the dftt test from being interpreted by conventional dftt models without sorption or with equilibrium sorption 2 the wellbore storage which causes an overestimation in the dispersivity has a great influence on the btcs in the extraction well in the early stage but a negligible effect in the late stage in addition an increasing wellbore volume leads to a decreasing peak concentration as well as a late arrival of the btc peak 3 the improvement of the boundary conditions achieved by developing a module that considers the mixing effect in comsol can calculate the real time concentration in wellbore therefore unlike previous models the improved dftt model is not limited as it is fit for tracers with various types of sorption properties the model has good prospects in future remediation works 4 the results of the sensitivity analysis highlight that the btc is most sensitive to the radius of the well and less sensitive to the distribution coefficient for linear adsorption and least sensitive to the first order kinetic rate coefficient 5 the improved model performs better in parameter estimation than previous models based on the field data collected from sutton et al 2000 credit authorship contribution

2545,dipole flow tracer test dftt has been proposed to estimate the vertical distribution of hydrogeological parameters by fitting the simulated and observed breakthrough curves btcs in the extraction chamber of a vertical circulation well vcw previous studies of dftt models neglected the non equilibrium sorption of tracer and the mixing process in the wellbore which have been proved to strongly influence the estimation accuracy of the dftt in this study we developed an improved dftt model considering a two site non equilibrium sorption of the tracer as well as the impact of the mixing effects on the btc behavior in both the extraction and injection chambers the results indicate that when interpreting the dftt with commonly used organic tracers an overestimation and underestimation occurs especially when the models do not account for sorption and consider equilibrium sorption respectively in addition the mixing effect was observed to affect the transport process as well as the btc behaviors in the dftt leading to an overestimation of the dispersivity the improved model proposed in this work was used to interpret the dftt test conducted with rhodamine wt rwt at the lizzie field site north carolina results showed that the improved model had better performance in interpreting the dftt compared to the stream tube model proposed by sutton et al 2000 this is especially when fluorescent dyes such as rwt or rhodamine b are used as tracers furthermore unlike previous models the improved dftt model is not limited as it is fit for tracers with various types of sorption properties meanwhile the consideration for mixing effect in the wellbore characterized by an ordinary differential equation promotes the dftt interpretation accuracy and also has great potential in the simulation of in situ remediation of subsurface contaminants through vcw especially for in well bioreactor technology keywords dipole flow tracer test numerical model non equilibrium sorption mixing effect data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction a vertical circulation well vcw is a well composed of two screened intervals divided by a straddle packer making groundwater pulled into one chamber and the same amount of water pushed out from the other chamber into the aquifer simultaneously therefore a three dimensional axial symmetry flow field is formed around vcw without ambient groundwater flow as a vertical recirculating system with a flexible and adjustable packer vcw has been successfully used in two aspects one is in situ aquifer remediation in which both reagent injection and pollutant extraction are implemented at the same time through vcw papini et al 2016 yuan et al 2021 zhao et al 2016 the other one is as an interpretation tool for aquifer parameters which are critical to the development and protection of groundwater resources this study mainly focuses on the hydrogeological parameter estimation through vcw which is an indispensable and practical supplement to traditional pumping or tracer test theis 1935 gelhar and collins 1971 kabala 1993 proposed the concept of dipole flow test dft in a uniformly anisotropic aquifer and presented a mathematical model of the drawdowns in each chamber of vcw which was used to obtain the vertical distributions of both horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities as well as the specific storage coefficient based on dft sutton et al 2000 proposed a new single borehole tracer test called the dipole flow tracer test dftt their study employed a streamline approach without accounting for the transverse dispersion developing a semi analytical solution of breakthrough curves btcs in the extraction chamber and estimating the dispersivity of the aquifer in the lizzie field site north carolina whereafter reiha 2006 developed a comprehensive model of multi species advection dispersion reaction for dftt using a reactive tracer estimating the in situ reaction coefficient of the aquifer at canadian forces base borden generally speaking vcw has a strong potential in dftt for estimating hydrogeological parameters related to groundwater flow solute transport sorption and even biogeochemical reaction a series of studies on dftt have been conducted using mathematical modeling laboratory experiments and field tests for example chen et al 2010 characterized the distribution of conservative solute concentration around vcw with the laplace transform finite difference ltfd method later chen et al 2011 highlighted that transverse dispersivity had significant effects on the btcs i e ignoring the transverse dispersion might lead to estimation errors of dftt also barns et al 2012 interpreted a two dimensional laboratory experiment of the dftt using a tracer imaging methodology providing theoretical concepts for field dftt meanwhile sutton et al 2000 had estimated the performance of the streamline method through field dftt using rhodamine wt rwt as a tracer in field tests sorption of tracer was found to influence the estimation of the longitudinal dispersivity through dftt sutton et al 2000 as for tracer brusseau and reid 1991 proved experimentally that organic chemicals in porous media tend to present non equilibrium sorption especially when the medium contains a certain amount of organic matter similar to rwt some other commonly used tracers such as rhodamine b and pontacyl brilliant pink b prove to have sorption properties as well shiau et al 1993 close et al 2002 for numerical modelling chen et al 2019 addressed that the non equilibrium transport model fit for reactive solutes with sorption induced source and sink term in the governing equation and it had better performance compared to the local equilibrium models that had been in use in the past in addition sutton et al 2001 confirmed that a two site non equilibrium sorption model had more accurate characterization than a conventional equilibrium model in terms of the transport process of the rwt in the aquifer their results explained the unmatched fitting between the measured data and the calculated results by sutton et al 2000 which simplified the non equilibrium sorption into an equilibrium one to solve the dftt model similarly pang and close 1999 pointed out the necessity of accounting for two region sites with different non equilibrium sorption conditions due to the ease in transforming to a completely instantaneous or rate limited sorption model chen et al 2019 the two site non equilibrium model can fit to more types of tracers in the field test therefore it is important to use a two site non equilibrium sorption model which is a model for reactive solute in dftt accounting for non equilibrium sorption as for the dftt the estimation accuracy of the parameters including hydraulic conductivity anisotropy ratio longitudinal and transverse dispersivities is strongly dependent on the btcs observed in the extraction chamber which is greatly affected by the real time volume of water and mass of tracer inside the extraction chamber as for the well boundary conditions in the solute transport model wang et al 2018 addressed that the assumption of a constant concentration in the wellbore results in remarkable parameter estimation error through single well push pull test as chen et al 2006 and shi et al 2020 indicated the wellbore storage leads to a mixing process when there are concentration differences between the influent and effluent tracers which makes the observed btcs very different from the simulated ones without considering the mixing effects during the mixing process which leads to strong differences from conventional dirichlet or neuman boundaries the wellbore concentration variation is mainly dominated by the net increase after simultaneous inflow and outflow therefore wellbore volume has great effects on the modulation of mixing process the effects on real time concentration due to the mixing process in a wellbore with non negligible volume is called mixing effect as a special kind of well with two separated chambers in the same wellbore the vcw represents more mixing effects than a traditional well because the wellbore storage should be considered in both extraction and injection chambers however existing dftt models have not accounted for the mixing effect leading to poor estimation of parameters therefore it is essential to develop a more sophisticated model that accounts for the mixing effect in the dftt model in summary despite the extensive insights from previous works on dftts the limited application of non reactive transport models to characterize non equilibrium transport of tracer has led to unsatisfactory performances in actual field tests this is even more so when organic tracers are used additionally previous dftt studies have not accounted for the mixing effects on the dftt which are almost inevitable in a wellbore of a certain volume consequently we will develop an improved mathematical model of dftts which consider both the non equilibrium solute transport as well as the mixing effect the impacts of sorption properties and wellbore volume on dftts will be analyzed here in addition the improved model will be employed to interpret the dftt conducted at lizzie field site north carolina 2 problem statement and mathematical model this study considers the problem of non equilibrium solute transport in a vcw induced flow field with a mixing effect in both the extraction and injection chamber the simulated btc data in the extraction chamber is relevant for dftt interpretation as fig 1 indicates the configurations of the well and aquifer are similar to those of sutton et al 2000 however the origin in the cylindrical coordinate is located at the center of the packer the positive z axis extends to the top of the well while the positive r axis extends along the radial direction the distance between the origin and each center of the injection and extraction chambers is l the length of each screen is 2d and the wellbore radius is rw the centers of the extraction and injection screens have the coordinates rw l and rw l groundwater flows into the extraction chamber and releases back to the aquifer from the injection chamber at the same constant rate of q 2 1 groundwater flow model there are two assumptions applied in the groundwater flow model 1 the aquifer is confined homogeneous horizontally isotropic vertically anisotropic and radially infinite with constant thickness b 2 the ambient groundwater flow is neglected relative to the steady state flow field generated by vcw the governing equation with the corresponding initial and boundary conditions is formulated as xiang kabala 1997 chen et al 2010 1

in dftt in this study we developed an improved dftt model considering non equilibrium solute transport a schematic diagram for the conceptual model was shown in fig 2 a two site non equilibrium transport model was considered with sorption sites partitioned into two sites selim et al 1976 in which one is in equilibrium and the other one is assumed to follow first order kinetics jardine et al

important factor in the dftt the mixing effect was usually ignored in the previous models this study assumes the tracer is well mixed in both injection and extraction chambers the concentration of the tracer in two chambers with mixing effect is described as wang et al 2018 on the basis of the mass balance theory 17a v i c i t t q c ex t c 0 t c i t l d z l d 17b v ex c ex t t lw v r θ c t r r w q

represent wellbore tracer concentration in the injection and extraction chambers respectively m l3 and the initial tracer concentration is c i t 0 c ex t 0 0 according to the eqs 17a and 17b it is obvious that the water volume affects the mixing in the wellbore which is mainly dependent on the length of the screened intervals 2d and the radius of the well r w as shown in fig 3 this radial two dimensional numerical solute transport model is solved using finite element comsol multiphysics the parameters used in the model are summarized in table 1 the influence can be negligible when r 10 a l so the radial range of the research region is set up as 40 m zlotnik ledder 1996 the simulation duration is 1000 min with the time step to be 1 min the model domain was discretized into 133 532 elements and the elements are refined for the region near the well screen by increasing 50 of the mesh number the variation degree of the concentration at each node was less than 1 which means the discretization of this study is reliable 2 4 model verification the analytical dftt model developed by sutton et al 2000 which does not consider sorption is employed to check the accuracy of the improved mathematical model the btcs in the extraction chamber can be calculated as follows 18 c ex t lw q r c t lw q r the results simulated by the mathematical model are kept the same to the dimensionless form in sutton et al 2000 as follows 19 t d t t c 20 c exd t c ex t q t c m where t c is the characteristic time which is defined as t c 2 d u c u c is the characteristic pore water velocity at the well face which can be obtained by u c q 4 d π r w θ in the analytical solution by sutton et al 2000 the tracer is treated as a conservative solute without sorption while the transverse dispersion is neglected in the comsol multiphysics software when the injection duration decreases to be short enough with the peak value of btc changes less than 0 01 this extremely short period which is 5 s can be regarded as equivalent to the impulse injection of tracer in sutton et al 2000 in order to verify the accuracy of the numerical model by comparing with the model of sutton et al 2000 the parameters used for the model verification were kept the same as those in sutton et al 2000 which are b 10 m l 0 838 m d 0 432 m rw 0 05725 m θ 0 33 a2 1 αl 1 m αl 2d 0 005 m q 1 577 10 4 m3 s the comparison between the concentrations of this model and the analytical solution of sutton et al 2000 is shown in fig 4 the results obtained in this study agree very well with the analytical solution of sutton et al 2000 highlighting the reliability of this improved model 3 results and discussion 3 1 baseline simulation to assess the influence of non equilibrium sorption and mixing effect on solute plume distribution different modeling results were compared by using various values for k d α and r w in the baseline simulation both non equilibrium sorption and mixing effect are considered using the parameter values listed in table 1 unlike the parameter values for model verification the parameter values listed in table 1 were applied to reveal the influences of non equilibrium sorption and mixing effect on the btc behaviors of dftt with the improved model the parameters about wellbore structure such as l d and rw are given normal values in field tests for example the values of the hydrogeological parameters are the same as those in chen et al 2011 and chen and wang 2021 the parameter values of sorption have the same order of magnitude with those in qi et al 2021 and sharma et al 2021 the re circulation of solute in this study was conducted by the following steps a constant concentration tracer solution was poured with constant flux into the injection chamber within 600 s the poured solute was assumed to be fully mixed with water in the wellbore and then the mixed solute was injected into the aquifer meanwhile the solute was pulled into the extraction chamber after the migration within the aquifer and mixed with the water in the extraction well instantaneously that mixed concentration was then re poured into the injection well and mixed with the present solute recirculating back to the aquifer fig 5 displays the evolution of solute plume in baseline simulation at t 50 t 200 t 500 t 1000 min the solute is mainly distributed near the injection screen the distribution area increases over time but stretches within two meters in the radial direction besides the increasing area and the solute absorbed from the aqueous phase to the solid phase causes diluted concentration since the total mass of the solute is constant using the parameter values listed in table 1 the following sections represent the effects of non equilibrium sorption and wellbore mixing on btc behaviors in dftt 3 2 effects of non equilibrium sorption on btcs the tracer with non equilibrium sorption properties such as rhodamine wt can be described by a two site non equilibrium sorption model there are two factors that play a major role in the sorption process i e distribution coefficient k d and first order rate limited coefficient α fig 6 depicts the comparisons of simulated btcs in the cases of un absorbable tracer and tracers with equilibrium and non equilibrium sorption in which the distribution coefficients of two adsorbent tracers are the same as those listed in table 1 the comparisons between cases 1 2 and 3 as presented in fig 6 indicate that sorption results in a lower btc peak since a part of the tracer is absorbed and becomes immobile meanwhile the equilibrium sorption can be regarded as a special case of two site non equilibrium sorption which always keeps the equilibrium state in both regions accommodating a great amount of absorbed solute so that the equilibrium model yields a smaller btc peak than the non equilibrium one to further explore the effects of distribution coefficients k d on dftt fig 7 a characterizes the btcs in the extraction chamber with five different k d ranging from 1 10 5 m3 kg to 1 10 3 m3 kg for linear adsorption the results indicate that the value of btc is smaller with a greater distribution coefficient which also leads to a later arrival of peak value as well as a more distinct tailing phenomenon this is because a greater distribution coefficient indicates a greater mass of solute absorbed to the solid phase which has been elaborated in fig 7b fig 7b represents temporal absorbed mass with different k d indicating that the total absorbed mass increases much faster in the early time but has very limited accumulation in the late time when the sorption site has been almost occupied this is because the first order mass transfer rate during non equilibrium process is strongly dependent on the concentration difference between the local mobile concentration and the absorbed one as eq 12 indicates in addition a greater distribution coefficient results in a larger storage of mass in the absorbed phase which is released back to the mobile phase and generates a long btc tailing with a gentle slope in the late time to investigate the other parameters of non equilibrium sorption i e first order kinetic rate coefficient α fig 8 a indicates the btcs in the extraction chamber with different α ranging from 1 10 7 1 s to 1 10 3 1 s it can be observed that the peak concentration decreases as α increases and a greater α lead to a more distinct tailing of btc this is because a greater kinetic rate coefficient results in a stronger mass transfer process resulting in less mobile solute concentration in the early stage but releasing more solute back from absorbed phase in the late stage as fig 8b indicates the equilibrium sorption site of the two region non equilibrium model makes the absorbed mass quickly reaches a high level in the early stage whereafter in the late stage a smaller α which dominates the mass transfer process through the non equilibrium site leads to a slower increase in absorbed mass this is the reason why the curve of absorbed mass is almost horizontal in the late stage with an extremely small α which also makes the btc gradually approaches the curve without sorption in the late stage despite the analyses of the btcs above it is indeed that sorption has a great influence on the value and the arrival time of peak concentration the simulation results indicate that dftt will be affected by higher k d and α therefore if the tracer used in dftt has remarkably non equilibrium sorption properties an adsorption experiment in a laboratory is suggested to obtain the sorption parameters as support to the field dftt 3 3 effects of mixing effect on btcs this improved model assumes that the mixing process inside the wellbore happens instantaneously though it actually spends some time in addition the mixing process is assumed to satisfythemassbalancerequirement with the wellbore volume to be a main influencing factor as eqs 17a and 17b indicate fig 6 shows the comparison between the btcs that consider the mixing effect and those without the mixing effect from the comparison between cases 1 and 4 it can be observed that the tracer inside the wellbore is diluted considering the mixing effect resulting in a decreasing peak value additionally as eqs 17a and 17b show the btc induced by the mixing effect is strongly dependent on the wellbore volume which is mainly controlled by the well radius r w in dftt the btcs presented in fig 9 were generated by different r w ranging from 0 03 0 05 0 07 0 1 to 0 15 m respectively the results highlight that the tracer concentration is directly proportional to the increase in r w that is to say if a traditional model that does not consider the mixing effect is employed for practical dftt the dispersivity will be overestimated due to wellbore storage similarly a wellbore with a greater radius will result in a larger estimation error of the aquifer parameter 3 4 sensitivity analysis to evaluate how each parameter affects the behavior of btcs this study conducted a sensitivity analysis on some of the main parameters including k d α and r w here the normalized sensitivity was used to remove the ambuguity in units between different parameters kabala 2001 the equation is illustrated as follows 21 s i j ω j y i ω j where s i j is the normalized sensitivity of the jth analyzed parameter ω j at the ith time where ω j includes distribution coefficient first order kinetic rate coefficient and well radius in this study y i is a function of ω j and t a forward difference formula was proposed by huang and yeh 2007 to approximate the partial derivation and the equation shown in eq 24 22 y i ω j y i ω j δ ω j y i ω j δ ω j where δ ω j is the small increment in the denominator that is usually approximated as the product of the target parameter value and a factor of 10 1 i e δ ω j 10 1 ω j y i represents the dimensionless concentration fig 10 shows the sensitivity analysis of the distribution coefficient first order kinetic rate coefficient and well radius on the btcs in the extraction well the base values of the parameters used in this sensitivity analysis are b 10 m l 0 5 m d 0 1 m rw 0 05 m θ 0 3 ρb 1300 kg m3 a2 1 αl 1 m αt 0 2 m t0 600 s q 1 10 5 m3 s α 1 10 5 1 s k d 1 10 4 m3 kg f 0 5 and c0 1 kg m3 fig 10 reveals that the sensitivities of btc to all of the three parameters are negative the order of the magnitude of the parameter sensitivity is s rw s kd s α in addition the btc is most sensitive to the well radius at the early stage but at the later stage it is minimal furthermore the btc is less sensitive to the distribution coefficient or linear adsorption in contrast to the well radius within the first 160 min but increases after 160 min this is because the spatial concentration difference inside the wellbore is great at the early stage when the mixing effect has strong impacts on the observed btcs the mixing effect becomes weak when the concentration inside the wellbore approaches that of the prepared solute the sensitivity of the btc to k d reaches the highest level and then decreases this is because the equilibrium site is filled in the early stage after which the mass transfer through non equilibrium sorption gradually weakens and the btc is not that sensitive to k d anymore this also explains why btc is not sensitive to α which only dominates the non equilibrium sorption rather than the equilibrium one 4 application of the improved model after extensive theoretical evaluation and analyses of the model we tested its effectiveness by evaluating and validating with dftt work conducted by sutton et al 2000 in which the parameter estimation is strongly dependent on the relationship between the dimensionless peak concentration arrival time and the front arrival time it is defined as the time at which the btc concentration is 5 of the peak value the dftt was conducted at the lizzie field site where the formation mainly consists of gray sandy and shelly material with some clay and the porosity is 0 39 the test well l 32 with a radius of 0 05715 m located 17 17 m below the surface and the configuration parameters as fig 1 shows are l 0 838 m and d 0 1 m rwt was applied as a tracer with flow rate q 3 13 10 4 m3 s the other details about this field test can be found in sutton et al 2000 rwt has two isomers which have the same percentage but different sorption properties the btcs shown in fig 11 indicate the simulation results of dftts using rwt and isomer 1 in which the tracer of the latter one is captured earlier because of smaller retardation among the parameters employed in fig 11 the technological parameters e l d and rw and porosity θ were obtained from the field dftt in lizzie field site in the study of sutton et al 2000 the other parameters were yielded by fitting the observed data with the r square of 0 99 sutton et al 2000 developed a dftt model using stream tube method welty and gelhar 1994 which ignored transverse dispersion estimating the longitudinal dispersivity and the permeability anisotropy ratio although the simulated btc fitted well in the early stage it was less than the observed data which has a btc tailing in the late stage this is because the tracer has non equilibrium sorption and the neglect of non equilibrium resulted in errors in the estimation of dispersivity instead our model considers isomers that have different sorption properties which is depicted by the two site non equilibrium sorption model this two site model assumes that rwt follows linear isotherm sorption and has two types of sorption sites where instantaneous equilibrium sorption and first order rate limited sorption happen separately with a given ratio of the two site numbers f based on the field data in sutton et al 2000 we find that the observed btc can be fitted well with the following parameter values a 2 1 0087 αl 4 12 10 2 m αt 1 52 10 4 m f 0 5 the first order kinetic rate coefficient of isomer 1 α 1 and isomer 2 α 2 are 6 39 10 4 s 1 and 1 02 10 2 s 1 respectively the distribution coefficient of isomer 1 k d 1 and isomer 2 k d 2 are 9 96 10 4 m3 kg and 1 02 10 3 m3 kg respectively the performance of the simulation is estimated by the coefficient of determination r square which is calculated as follows 23 r s q u a r e 1 i 1 n c obs i c sim i 2 i 1 n c obs i c obs 2 where c obs i is the observed dimensionless concentration of the well l 32 at the ith time c sim i is the simulated dimensionless concentration at the ith time n is the number of the observed dimensionless concentration c obs is the average value of the observed dimensionless concentration of all the samples which is characterized as 24 c obs i n 1 c obs n the btcs simulated by sutton et al 2000 and the improved model are presented in fig 11 in which the r square for this model is 0 99 but 4 32 and 0 18 for the models of sutton et al 2000 using rwt which is composed of isomer mixture isomer 1 isomer 2 and only isomer 1 as tracers respectively sutton s modeling results fit with observed data well only in the early period however the improved model performs better for all periods the results indicate that the model accounting for both non equilibrium sorption and mixing effects has better performance in the interpretation of dftt thereby improving the overall accuracy of parameter estimation 5 summary and conclusions the dftt has been presented as a great in situ method to estimate the hydrogeological parameters such as permeability coefficient and dispersivity this study developed an improved model accounting for non equilibrium transport of tracer with mixing effect in the wellbore for a more accurate interpretation of the dftt the solute plume is exhibited under spatiotemporal distribution three parameters including distribution coefficient first order kinetic rate coefficient and radius of the well which strongly affect the observed btcs in the wellbore were analyzed in detail in addition the field data from sutton et al 2000 was used to test the effectiveness of this improved model over the previous one the following conclusions were drawn 1 non equilibrium sorption of tracer decreases the peak concentration of btcs and causes the delay in the arrival of the btc peak preventing the dftt test from being interpreted by conventional dftt models without sorption or with equilibrium sorption 2 the wellbore storage which causes an overestimation in the dispersivity has a great influence on the btcs in the extraction well in the early stage but a negligible effect in the late stage in addition an increasing wellbore volume leads to a decreasing peak concentration as well as a late arrival of the btc peak 3 the improvement of the boundary conditions achieved by developing a module that considers the mixing effect in comsol can calculate the real time concentration in wellbore therefore unlike previous models the improved dftt model is not limited as it is fit for tracers with various types of sorption properties the model has good prospects in future remediation works 4 the results of the sensitivity analysis highlight that the btc is most sensitive to the radius of the well and less sensitive to the distribution coefficient for linear adsorption and least sensitive to the first order kinetic rate coefficient 5 the improved model performs better in parameter estimation than previous models based on the field data collected from sutton et al 2000 credit authorship contribution

al 2014 because winter season temperatures in this area fluctuate around 0 c jennings et al 2018 the snowpack often melts intermittently in parts of the catchment kormos et al 2014a and is susceptible to small changes in atmospheric conditions including warming and shifts in precipitation magnitude and phase seyfried et al 2021 williams et al 2009 the distribution of rainfall and snowmelt is thus heterogeneous in the rain snow transition zone kormos et al 2014a and while this is true in most regions that experience snowfall the precipitation in the rain snow transition zone is often more variable because the physical phase of precipitation i e liquid as rainfall or solid as snowfall can vary at fine scales klos et al 2014 hydrologic characteristics within the rain snow transition zone might exemplify future climatic effects at higher currently snow dominated elevations fyfe et al 2017 klos et al 2014 nayak et al 2010 the observed snowline has already begun to creep toward higher elevations in recent decades as the rain snow transition zone has shifted upward reducing snow covered area and the number of snow covered days at lower elevations affecting the timing and amount of available downstream water hamlet et al 2005 regonda et al 2005 across the western us peak seasonal snowpack storage measured as snow water equivalent swe around april 1 has declined substantially over the last half century mote et al 2005 2018 regonda et al 2005 accompanied by an earlier onset of spring due to increased winter and spring temperatures folland et al 2001 marshall et al 2019a musselman et al 2017 steward et al 2005 variability in swe magnitude and in peak swe timing are expected to increase particularly in regions where rainfall may replace snowfall near the rain snow transition marshall et al 2019b another anticipated change with climate warming is more frequent rain on snow ros events beniston and stoffel 2016 cohen et al 2015 lópez moreno et al 2013 2021 musselman et al 2018 at the current rain snow transition zone ros events already occur frequently especially at low to mid elevations lópez moreno et al 2013 shi and liu 2021 during these events relatively warm rain transfers energy as advected heat into the relatively cold snowpack mccabe et al 2007 when this happens positive sensible and latent heat fluxes dominate the snowpack energy balance marks et al 1998 and can lead to early season snowmelt and flooding as well as late season drought guan et al 2016 warmer shallower snowpacks are more vulnerable to increased energy inputs during ros events nolin and daly 2006 brunengo 2012 which can rapidly increase snowmelt in a short period of time beniston and stoffel 2016 julander and clayton 2018 climatic changes may lead to complex shifts in snowmelt responses during ros events musselman et al 2018 melt from ros events may also be limited if the snowpack is so shallow that it completely melts early during such events würzer et al 2016 kroczynski 2004 in contrast if the snowpack remains consistently deep under warming conditions but rain events are more intense more energy may be added into the snowpack via advection or turbulent fluxes leading to more heterogeneous hydrologic responses than previously observed osterhuber 1999 würzer et al 2016 snowmelt and energetic responses may also vary across the watershed during ros events challenging the expectation that ros events will always generate large amounts of water output garvelmann et al 2015 kormos et al 2014b marks et al 1998 wever et al 2014 würzer et al 2016 to anticipate changes in future water availability from both rainfall and snowmelt we must improve our understanding of the sensitivity of catchments in the rain snow transition zone to the current range of water and energy inputs harpold et al 2017 reported hydrologic patterns and catchment responses typically reflect average spatial and temporal conditions in mostly snow dominated regions mote et al 2018 this leaves a notable gap in our understanding of catchment and sub catchment hydrologic sensitivity to changes in water and energy inputs at the rain snow transition across different timescales and during hydroclimatically different years in addition the sensitivities of particular catchments as in our case johnston draw idaho usa may reflect responses to both static i e relatively constant such as underlying landscape and dynamic i e changing such as wind characteristics and effects controls godsey et al 2018 how defined static and dynamic controls modulate the distribution and driving processes of precipitation inputs can be investigated by simulating the spatiotemporal distribution of snowpack and snowmelt the sum of rainfall and snowmelt at the soil surface is referred to as the surface water inputs swi which summarize the timing and amount of water entering the terrestrial system klos et al 2014 kormos et al 2018 the spatial distribution of swi likewise depends on precipitation magnitude resulting in swi variability across aspects and elevations as well as between scour and drift locations where snowfall has been preferentially deposited or transported by wind kiewiet et al 2022 kormos et al 2014a lehning et al 2008 luce et al 1998 the spatiotemporal distribution of swi might also be impacted by additional static boundary conditions such as vegetation and slope and dynamic boundary conditions including energy fluxes kormos et al 2014a pomeroy et al 2003 because swi influences soil moisture streamflow groundwater recharge plant productivity and nutrient cycling kormos et al 2014a mcnamara et al 2005 quantifying the primary drivers of the spatiotemporal patterns of swi will allow us to understand the impact that swi has on these fundamental processes stores and fluxes and as swi distributions change in a warming climate hale et al 2022 the subsequent distribution of water availability will certainly be further impacted previous research suggests that the drivers of swi may vary annually seasonally and on the event scale annually swi distribution in the snow dominated upper sheep creek catchment was affected by snow drifting and aspect differences with snowpacks persisting longer into the spring season in drift locations and on northeast facing slopes luce et al 1998 seasonally swi timing and amount have been shown to vary across aspects in the rain snow transition zone kormos et al 2014a however the combined effects of elevation snowfall redistribution and differences in inter annual hydrologic behavior have not yet been evaluated in the rain snow transition zone but are likely prevalent across such regions klos et al 2014 further at the ros event scale catchment average precipitation and snowpack characteristics have been related to stream discharge rücker et al 2019 würzer et al 2016 but the spatial origin of swi during these events has not yet been quantified past studies have collectively shown that the drivers of swi vary inter and intra annually but have focused only on single time scales e g annual or seasonal or event scale more recently godsey et al 2018 compiled relevant hydrometeorological data in the rain snow transition and kiewiet et al 2022 explored spatially distributed annual swi within the rain snow transition zone across relatively wet dry rainy and snowy water years in relation to annual streamflow and stream drying we aim to build on these works focusing on the varying drivers of spatially distributed swi across multiple time scales annual and seasonal between multiple years specifically a wet and a dry year and during hydro meteorological anomalies e g ros events which remain important knowledge gaps particularly in the dynamic rain snow transition zone in the western us to address these research gaps we evaluated variations in spatial and temporal swi precipitation snow water equivalent swe and energy fluxes across aspects elevation bands and drift and scour locations to identify the drivers of swi we evaluated water and energy fluxes annually seasonally and across multiple ros events for two water years wys 2011 wet and 2014 dry defined from october 1 to september 30 in a catchment located in the rain snow transition zone at reynolds creek experimental watershed rcew the rcew was selected as an experimental watershed because of its representativeness of the region seyfried et al 2000 2001 we used the isnobal automated water supply model awsm havens et al 2020 marks et al 1999 at the catchment scale forced with an extensive hydro meteorological dataset godsey et al 2018 the following research questions were addressed for this watershed in the semi arid intermountain west rain snow transition zone 1a how do the spatial patterns of annual surface water inputs swi vary across a wet and a dry year in the rain snow transition zone 1b which water or energy balance variables drive these annual spatial patterns and how do they vary seasonally 2a where is swi generated during ros events in the rain snow transition zone 2b what inputs or underlying conditions influence swi at the ros event scale the use of the physics based snow model isnobal permits us to evaluate these questions with a focus on the physical processes that are representative of swi production and ros events across rain snow transition zones in the intermountain west of the us 2 methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in johnston draw fig 1 a c a catchment located in the rain snow transition within the rcew rcew is part of the critical zone observatory czo network and located in the owyhee continental mountain range of southwest idaho us 100 km southwest of boise idaho and 30 km east of the idaho oregon border fig 1a rcew is managed by the us department of agriculture usda agricultural research service ars as a representative watershed in the us intermountain west seyfried et al 2000 2001 and covers a 239 km2 area ranging from snow dominated fig 1b white mixed phase precipitation fig 1b gray to rain dominated fig 1b black sub catchments modified from godsey et al 2018 johnston draw is a 1 8 km2 headwater catchment within the rcew with an average elevation of 1719 m range of 1497 m 1869 m godsey et al 2018 the catchment includes an east west oriented valley an east flowing stream and opposing north south aspect hillslopes fig 1c between 2004 and 2014 johnston draw experienced a yearly mean temperature of 8 1 c and mean annual precipitation map of 600 mm where 39 53 of map fell as snow godsey et al 2018 annual runoff ratios ranged from 0 08 to 0 45 godsey et al 2018 wind typically comes from the south and southwest with an annual average wind speed range between 2 8 m s 1 across most of the catchment measured at all but one site described in section 2 2 and 4 5 m s 1 in the windiest areas measured at one relatively exposed site site 124 godsey et al 2018 wind in johnston draw preferentially redistributes and deposits snow from windy scour zones to form drifts in the southwest part of the catchment which faces predominantly to the northeast vegetation on the north facing slopes includes snowberry symphoricarpos big sagebrush artemisia tridentate aspen populus tremuloides groves and low sagebrush artemisia arbuscula with wheatgrass elymus trachycaulus south facing vegetation consists of artemisia arbuscula elymus trachycaulus mountain mahogany cercocarpus ledifolius and bitter brush purshia tridentate godsey et al 2018 stephenson 1970 under this vegetation sandy loam soils with an average depth of 0 96 m make up the land surface and shallow subsurface of johnston draw patton et al 2018 2 2 datasets eleven stations monitored atmospheric conditions in johnston draw and were used to force a snowpack model for this analysis fig 1c the stations are positioned in the watershed so that one station exists on both the north and south facing slopes at roughly the same elevation every 50 m in elevation from the bottom east end to the top west end of the catchment marks et al 2013 seyfried et al 2021 table 1 measurements of solar radiation si wind

available at 1 m resolution from a 2014 airborne lidar flight shrestha and glenn 2016 to evaluate the range of water inputs to johnston draw two wys were assessed 2011 a relatively wet year total annual precipitation 709 mm 120 of map and 2014 a relatively dry year 528 mm 86 of map these two water years had very similar mean annual air temperatures 0 2 c difference yet the differences in precipitation contributed to a 4 difference in discharge kiewiet et al 2022 in addition one large ros event along with multiple smaller ros events occurred in both water years making these wys suitable to evaluate swi generation at event and annual time scales 2 3 modeling we used the isnobal automated water supply model awsm which was developed at the usda agricultural research service ars in boise id to estimate catchment snow water supply havens et al 2020 marks et al 1999 awsm standardizes the steps needed to 1 distribute weather station data using the spatial modeling for resources framework smrf havens et al 2018 2020 2 run the energy and mass balance model isnobal as described below marks et al 1999 and 3 compile the results as user friendly output havens et al 2018 2020 hourly meteorological data precipitation air temperature solar radiation vapor pressure wind speed and direction are distributed in smrf via the elevation gradient presented in the digital elevation model dem havens et al 2020 isnobal a physics based spatially distributed energy and mass balance snow model then generates spatially distributed swe and swi marks et al 1999 isnobal is driven by the distributed meteorological and precipitation data to model the snowpack evolution throughout the accumulation and ablation seasons across a gridded spatial domain e g a watershed isnobal represents the snowpack as two layers a surface layer that is in contact with the air and a bottom layer that is in contact with the soil marks et al 1999 the mass and energy balance terms and fluxes are tracked for both snow layers and each layer is presumed to be homogeneous garen and marks 2005 isnobal uses the spatially distributed meteorological forcings listed in table 1 to solve the energy and mass balance at each snow covered grid cell e g 10 m 10 m the snowpack energy balance is expressed as 1 δ q rn h le g m δ t where δq the change in snowpack energy storage w m 2 t is time s rn net radiation

snowpack and the atmosphere and between the snowpack and the underlying soil surface in addition the model computes the snowpack temperature mass snow depth swe and snow coverage for the watershed during a model run when additional energy is added to the snowpack and exceeds a specified liquid water content threshold 1 of swe volume isnobal calculates melt based on the available energy eq 4 marks et al 1999 marks and winstral 2001 liquid water leaving the snowpack at the base is calculated after considering snowpack water holding capacity and refreezing this mass output is then recorded as swi after each time step isnobal readjusts the structural e g swe and depth and thermal snowpack properties of each layer kumar et al 2013 finally isnobal computes various energy fluxes within the snowpack havens et al 2020 here we considered five components of the energy balance latent heat sensible heat heat from the interaction between the snowpack and soil advected energy heat that enters the snowpack as precipitation net radiation and the sum of all energy balance terms these components were then compared to the cold content of the snowpack variables listed and defined in table 2 we ran the model at a 10 m resolution which was coarse enough to smooth small scale variations in topography but fine enough to capture the processes that drive differential melt we relied on the well established interannual consistency in snow distributions pflug and lundquist 2020 schirmer et al 2011 sturm and wagner 2010 to rescale interpolated precipitation and snowfall fields using the vöegeli et al 2016 approach for both simulated years using one available lidar snow depth survey near peak snowpack conditions march 2009 tinkham et al 2014 the vöegeli et al 2016 approach implicitly captures the spatial heterogeneity of snow using distributed snow depth information e g from lidar or structure from motion and assimilates this information into physically based models such as isnobal awsm thus this methodology was used to rescale precipitation to represent the redistribution of snowfall by wind and topographic effects leading to the development of drifts and scour areas in the johnston draw catchment in this way we reproduced the observed snowpack distribution patterns while conserving the initial mass estimation despite a relatively dense array of 11 meteorological stations described in section 2 2 and listed in table 1 precipitation rescaling was found to improve the representation of the catchment wide snowpack kiewiet et al 2022 trujillo et al 2019 the precipitation rescaling approach was implemented only when snowfall was present because wind is a dominant control on snow redistribution especially in johnston draw marks et al 1998 molotch et al 2011 winstral et al 2002 consequently we expected the spatial distribution of swi to partially reflect the spatial distribution of snowfall and total precipitation resulting from this rescaling approach the limitations presented by this approach including the rescaling model choice available datasets and their potential uncertainties are discussed in section 4 3 1 finally the isnobal model was run hourly with the rescaled precipitation as an input model generated snow thicknesses were verified spatially against lidar snow depths r2 0 88 and temporally against snow depth time series at each of the meteorological stations median nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 65 see kiewiet et al 2022 for a detailed description of the model performance and related uncertainties 2 4 relationship between spatially distributed swi and water and energy balance variables across temporal scales to evaluate the spatial and temporal drivers of swi in johnston draw at the annual seasonal and ros event scales across the two different wys we quantified precipitation swe swi and snowpack energy balance variables listed and described in table 2 the methodology for determining the drivers of swi at each temporal scale is described in the following paragraphs annually correlation analyses were conducted using 11 aspect elevation bins to cluster grid cells into north facing south facing and other facing areas neither south nor north facing thus either east or west facing or flat at low mid and high elevations as well as drift locations at mid and high elevations shown in fig 1c and listed in table 3 drifts were defined as grid cells with annual peak swe in the top 10 within the catchment which were validated against available observation lidar data kiewiet et al 2022 the aspects of the catchment were calculated from the dem where north facing was defined between 330 and 30 and south facing between 150 and 210 other facing includes all remaining degree values and locations where the slope is 5 the elevation bins were assigned by dividing the full catchment elevation range into three equal parts thus the elevation bin labels low 1496 1620 m mid 1620 1745 m and high 1745 1869 m are relative to the catchment elevation range i e high refers to locally high elevations we calculated total annual precipitation and swi and mean swe during the snow season which was defined as the period when snow covered area 0 0 km2 for each of these aspect elevation bins we assessed the strength and direction of correlations between swe precipitation and swi seasonal variability in swi precipitation swe and energy balance fluxes was also evaluated by plotting and interpreting time series data across both water years using the same 11 aspect elevation bins available spatially distributed topographic variables of slope angle convexity elevation soil type soil depth and vegetation height showed no relationship with the spatial distribution of annual and seasonal swi and were not further considered advected energy a model output was also not further considered after showing no relationship with spatial swi distribution finally at the event scale we defined ros events as precipitation events that received more than 5 mm basin averaged precipitation of which the majority fell as rain snowfall fraction 0 5 while at least 3 of the land surface was covered with snow roughly the areal extent of the defined snow drifts when periods of rainfall were separated by a dry period of less than 6 h they were considered a single event these constraints resulted in a total of seven ros events in 2011 and nine in 2014 for each event we calculated the precipitation magnitude mm and intensity mm h 1 event snowfall fraction unitless excess swi any swi generated in addition to total event precipitation mm snow covered area km2 basin wide mean swe mm at the start of the event snowpack cold content mj m 2 and liquid water content mm when comparing cold content and liquid water content to excess swi via linear regressions we normalized each variable by the snow covered area to account for the fact that these variables are only calculated for model grid cells where swe 0 mm thus the results reflect excess swi as a product of the grid cell cold content and liquid water content from only the snow covered area liquid water content while limited to 1 of the grid cell modeled swe in the model was used for relative comparisons of snowpack saturation across ros events finally we assessed whether the date of the event occurred before or after catchment average peak swe and quantified the spatial centroid of swi generation within the catchment both the annual average and event specific centroid locations of swi generation were calculated and reported as the weighted average location of swi a spatial offset was calculated as any difference between the event specific swi centroid location and the yearly centroid location 2011 or 2014 annual centroids were calculated separately but were nearly the same 3 results at the 10 m spatial resolution the modeled snow depths strongly agreed with observational lidar snow depths r2 0 88 see kiewiet et al 2022 lending confidence to the use of modeled spatially distributed surface water inputs swi at event to annual scales to address our specific research questions we have separated our results by temporal scales drivers of annual and seasonal scale swi research questions 1a and 1b and drivers of rain on snow event swi research questions 2a and 2b at both temporal scales we address differences between the wet and dry water years the discussion follows a similar order 3 1 drivers of annual and seasonal swi 3 1 1 annual scale total annual precipitation and mean and peak swe were greater in 2011 than in 2014 table 3 the catchment received 34 more precipitation in 2011 than in 2014 catchment mean precipitation 709 mm vs 528 mm the snowfall fraction was 14 greater 0 48 vs 0 34 which equated to 161 mm more snow in 2011 than in 2014 catchment mean snowfall 340 vs 179 mm the higher precipitation inputs resulted in 172 mm more swi in 2011 than in 2014 catchment mean swi 692 mm vs 520 mm fig 2 a b in 2011 swe reached a maximum of 897 mm at the grid cell scale in the drift locations whereas maximum swe was 401 mm in 2014 peak swe occurred in similar areas in both years but exceeded mean catchment precipitation only in 2011 table 3 differences in winter monthly mean air temperatures between the wet and dry years were as follows 5 c warmer in 2014 in nov 3 6 c warmer in 2011 in dec and jan 7 c warmer in 2014 in february 2 c warmer in 2014 in march and equal temperatures in april see fig 2 in godsey et al 2018 the mean air temperatures in november february in these years spanned the 0 c mark affecting the phase of falling precipitation and monthly snowfall fraction godsey et al 2018 areas of highest annual swi coincided with snow drifts in the southwestern part of the catchment fig 2a c where mean annual swi in the drift locations ranged from 1383 1886 mm in 2011 and 898 1257 mm in 2014 fig 2d table 3 on average 8 0 of total annual swi in 2011 and 6 6 of total annual swi in 2014 was generated from the snow drifts in addition to the large swi volume generated at the snow drifts north facing slopes and other facing slopes generated more swi than the south facing slopes in both water years especially in 2011 diamonds circle crosses and triangles respectively in fig 3 a b non drift high elevation regions often generated the least amount of swi in both years due to wind scouring implicitly represented with the snowfall rescaling approach compared to the same aspects at lower elevations table 3 differences in precipitation swe and swi between the two water years were largest at the snow drifts average δswi of 1130 mm and north facing slopes average δswi of 346 mm and smaller on the south facing slopes fig 2c at the annual scale precipitation and swi were strongly correlated fig 3a b r2 0 98 and p value 0 05 in both years in both years modeled snow drifts received the most redistributed swe and generated the most swi fig 3a b stars higher swe also occurred in drift locations and north and other facing at low elevations but the relationship with swi was not as strong fig 3c d r2 0 57 and 0 66 in 2011 and 2014 respectively p value 0 05 in both years 3 1 2 seasonal scale water balance variables seasonal differences in swi across johnston draw were a result of snowfall and thus swe and the spatial variability in temporal delays of snowmelt although precipitation was rare in johnston draw when temperatures were consistently above 0 c jul sep during 2011 and 2014 when it did occur rainfall was distributed uniformly across all aspect elevation bins visible as periods when all lines overlap in figs 4 a and s1a in contrast during december april in both years precipitation magnitude varied across the catchment particularly in drift locations because snowfall is susceptible to preferential deposition and wind redistribution figs 4a and s1a elevational lines with the least variability are plotted on top of elevational lines with more variability the accumulation of snowfall in drifts is clearly visible in the drift swe time series as it starkly contrasts with lower swe in all other aspect elevation bins figs 4b and s1b north facing slopes at low and mid elevations had higher seasonal swe than other facing regions figs 4b and s1b north facing and other facing and the lowest seasonal swe occurred in the high elevation non drift regions figs 4b and s1b light blue lines which is likely due to snow scouring from these regions within the low and mid elevation bins the north facing slopes retained more precipitation as snowfall and thus swe daily swi was often high during the snowmelt period between april and july in both years maximum daily swi during snowmelt period 43 mm in 2011 and 41 mm in 2014 figs 4c and s1c respectively during this period on average swi was consistently highest in the drift locations followed by the north facing slopes where there was more swe available to melt snowmelt occurred up to two months earlier on south and other facing slopes compared to north facing slopes i e march april vs may june in 2011 figs 4c and s1c snow cover energy balance components when and where snowmelt occurred depended on energy fluxes that differed by elevation aspect and snowpack accumulation until the onset of the ablation season e g april july in 2011 the overall net energy flux was low 100 w m 2 in both years and across all aspect elevation bins figs 5 a and s2a with deviations from the catchment average that were smaller than 5 in the latter part of the snowmelt season the snowpack persisted only in the drift locations and so the energy balance variables were only calculated in these areas havens et al 2018 2020 the spatial energy balance patterns were similar across both years shown for 2011 in fig 5 and for 2014 in s2 and differences existed primarily in the magnitude of each energy flux which was on average 15 larger in 2011 consistent with the deeper snowpack and longer snow season in this year thus differences in energy fluxes between the two years existed near the beginning of snow accumulation and snowmelt periods the next paragraphs outline the temporal differences in each energy flux in relation to snowmelt generation across aspect elevation bins and through the two water years net radiation was typically negative in the winter months and except for drift locations net radiation was higher at lower elevations green or dark blue lines figs 5b and s2b than at higher elevations light blue lines figs 5b and s2b net radiation became positive across all aspects and elevations in march in 2011 fig 5b and in april in 2014 fig s2b and continued to increase until the snowpack had fully melted may june the ground energy flux was noticeably lower in drift locations throughout the mid winter season and only exceeded the ground flux of the other aspect elevation bins after the snowpack had melted from all other areas in the catchment figs 5c and s2c between december and april in both years the ground heat flux was highest on the south facing slopes and higher at mid and high elevation relative to the lower elevations the latent heat flux was greater in magnitude at higher elevations than at mid and low elevations figs 5d and s2d high elevation latent heat peaked with positive values in december january and reached its lowest negative values in april may when most aspect elevation bins experienced snowmelt latent heat at high elevations became positive again in june similarly the sensible heat flux was most often highest at high elevations light blue lines figs 5e and s2e especially on the north facing aspects during most of the winter months december april both latent heat and sensible heat fluxes were highest in drift locations only late in the snowmelt period may july in both years as the snowpack had melted from all other aspect elevation bins lastly the snowpack cold content was greatest within the thickest snowpacks which corresponded to drift locations figs 5f and s2f followed by the north facing slopes at low and mid elevations the shallow snowpacks on the south facing slopes and high elevation scour zones were warmest i e a less negative cold content resulting in earlier melt out than deeper snowpacks on north facing slopes and at drift locations these trends also persisted throughout both water years 3 2 drivers of swi during ros events sixteen ros events were identified and examined table 4 during which the catchment received 5 37 mm of precipitation median 12 mm occurring over 9 37 h median 22 h initial snow covered area was greater than 5 of the catchment in all events the snowfall fraction during these events ranged from 0 to 0 30 catchment average peak swe occurred on march 7 in 2011 and february 9 in 2014 six of the sixteen events occurred before peak swe four in 2011 two in 2014 and the remaining ten events occurred after peak swe compared to ros events occurring after peak swe events occurring before peak swe happened when the pre event snow covered area was slightly larger mean sd 0 34 0 06 km2 compared to 0 21 0 19 km2 the snowpack was significantly colder cold content 3 58 2 2 10 3 mj m 2 compared to 1 19 0 77 10 3 mj m 2 and there was slightly more initial swe basin average swe0 33 3 22 2 mm compared to 31 8 13 0 mm during the majority of the ros events net radiation decreased but sensible and latent heat fluxes increased fig 5b d e and corresponding s2 panels resulting in energy flux increases during the events events are shown as black vertical dashes in all figs 5 and s2 panels specifically ros events coincided with an upward or downward spike in latent heat figs 5d and s2d and increases in sensible heat particularly at higher elevations light blue lines in figs 5e and s2e different locations in the catchment produced swi during different ros events depending on the initial snowpack and atmospheric conditions which shifted the catchment centroid location of swi generation the annual centroid of swi in 2011 and 2014 was similar the difference in centroid location across these years was 30 4 m across all events for the two years the centroid of swi for individual events extended to 45 m south 64 m north 104 m east and 68 m west of the annual swi centroid fig 6 a table 4 spatial offsets from the annual centroid of swi generation toward the south i e on north facing slopes negative δy occurred only during events after peak swe triangles in fig 6a and had on average smaller snow covered area at the start of the event average sca0 0 15 km2 compared to 0 28 km2 swi centroid offsets toward the east i e lower elevations positive δx and towards the west i e higher elevations negative δx were equally divided between events before and after peak swe positive versus negative values along x axis in fig 6a but ros events with a spatial offset towards the west were on average associated with a higher cold content i e warmer snowpack than ros events with a spatial offset to the east average cold content 1 9 10 3 mj m 2 compared to 3 5 10 3 mj m 2 indicating that thicker snowpacks at higher elevations in the western part of the catchment needed to seasonally warm before generating snowmelt during ros events thus even during ros events snow drifts modulated the timing of basin swi because they were less susceptible to melt finally events that delivered more than 20 mm of precipitation had a smaller north south offset from the yearly centroid mean sd δy 23 12 m compared to events that brought less than 20 mm of precipitation over the basin δy 29 2 m table 4 the amount of excess swi i e any swi in addition to total event precipitation produced during the ros events ranged from 6 to 7 mm negative excess swi indicates a net storage of precipitation in the snowpack and or refreezing and nearly all ros events prior to peak swe resulted in negative excess swi excess swi depended on the existing snowpack and event specific characteristics two characteristics were typically associated with higher excess swi generation though neither relationship was statistically significant higher liquid water content fig 6b r2 0 26 p value 0 3 and lower cold content fig 6c r2 0 34 p value 0 2 on average however ros events occurring after peak swe triangles in fig 6b c generated more excess swi corresponding with a warmer snowpack with a higher lwc exceptions to this included a few smaller ros events other factors such as basin average initial swe swe0 precipitation intensity and initial snow covered area sca0 did not appear to independently influence excess swi production summarized in table 4 the area of the catchment generating swi during ros events depended strongly on the season during events before peak swe smaller volumes of swi were generated on the north facing slopes and from the snow drifts fig 7 a and d corresponding to centroid offsets to the north i e swi generated on south facing slopes this pattern shifted after basin average peak swe when most swi was generated on the north facing slopes resulting in a centroid offset to the south fig 7b and e during the large ros event in 2011 fig 7c swi generated on the north facing slopes and from snow drifts increased with elevation and differences between snow covered and snow free areas were larger than during the largest event of 2014 fig 7c vs f 4 discussion 4 1 annual and seasonal drivers of swi 4 1 1 annual scale in both a wet and a dry water year the spatial distribution of swi in johnston draw was driven primarily by precipitation magnitude and the degree of spatial heterogeneity in swi depended on the phase of precipitation when precipitation fell as snow the spatial distribution of precipitation and thus swe and swi was more heterogeneous than during rainfall events accurate representation of high elevation drift zones adjacent to scour zones required both the elevational and orographic precipitation gradients represented in smrf havens et al 2018 and the implicit representation of wind redistribution through the snowfall rescaling method by vöegeli et al 2016 in johnston draw see section 4 3 1 for further discussion of model assumptions together these results highlight the importance of evaluating swi beyond calculating the simple catchment scale average in a rain snow transition catchment because the locations of drifts scour regions and aspect elevation combinations were consistent across relatively wet and dry years a single study season may reveal the relative spatial pattern of swi generation but not its magnitude across a range of climatic conditions differences in swi associated with changing snowfall fraction the amount of annual precipitation falling as rainfall vs snowfall was beyond the scope of this work but has been addressed in a comparison of rainy vs snowy years in this catchment kiewiet et al 2022 it may be surprising that an accurate snow drift representation is important at the rain snow transition zone where the snowpack is shallow and sometimes transient indeed we found that the presence of drifts in this study primarily drove the spatial patterns of swi similar to their role in snow dominated catchments at higher elevations than the typical rain snow transition zone it is well established that snow drifts significantly affect annual snowmelt e g anderton et al 2004 kretchun et al 2020 marshall et al 2019a williams et al 2009 winstral et al 2013 and although snow drifts in johnston draw generated proportionally less swi than higher elevation snow dominated catchments e g maximum 3 m of total daily swi in upper sheep creek compared to maximum 0 5 m of total daily swi in johnston draw fig 4c marshall et al 2019a winstral et al 2013 the amount of water stored in the drifts in both a wet and a dry year was substantial 8 in 2011 and 6 6 in 2014 of total catchment swi in 3 of the spatial area compared to the surrounding landscape in turn melt out dates strongly influence streamflow dry out dates in johnston draw kiewiet et al 2022 soderquist et al 2018 emphasizing the importance of capturing snow drifts even in the rain snow transition zone drift representation is important for accurate and informed choices about water resources and adaptation to climate change and variability in snow influenced regions dozier et al 2016 luce et al 1998 mote et al 2018 4 1 2 seasonal scale water balance variables whereas rainfall immediately becomes swi across the catchment the storage of water in the snowpack delays the generation of swi in the form of snowmelt for hours to months in johnston draw the magnitude of this delay depended on the aspect elevation and depth of the snowpack across the catchment further emphasizing the need to blend a spatial and temporal analysis of swi notably we found similar spatiotemporal swi patterns in both a wet and a dry year swi was highest during rainfall and snowmelt events and snowmelt began on south facing slopes prior to north facing slopes and then drifts seasonally swi was relatively less variable across the catchment at the beginning of the water year because precipitation fell as rain in early and mid winter months snowmelt was generated primarily on south facing slopes when snow melted on this aspect whereas snowmelt was generated from primarily north facing and snow drifts slopes in late winter and spring months from late season snowmelt finally swi was again less variable across aspects in summer and early fall months because precipitation fell as rain during those months figs 4c and s1c similar to a study during a typical year within a much smaller catchment located to the north 0 015 km2 kormos et al 2014a seasonal to annual swi generation in johnston draw 1 8 km2 was influenced by both elevation and snow drift locations this was true during both wet and dry years snow cover energy balance components our work extends previous efforts to compare energy fluxes across the rain snow transition zone by modeling at a spatial scale that is fine enough to capture scour drift aspect and elevation effects with this detailed comparative approach we found that energy fluxes in johnston draw differed spatially within the year but the patterns were similar across a wet and dry year with only few exceptions the largest difference between the two years was a shift in the energy balance due to a more persistent snowpack in the wetter year past work exploring the energy balance of swi production has otherwise typically been limited in space and or time kormos et al 2014a pohl and marsh 2006 shakoor and ejaz 2019 in johnston draw net radiation strongly affected the spatial and temporal patterns of swi from snowmelt low elevations and south and other facing slopes had a greater sum of energy fluxes in the entire snowpack and received more net radiation between january and april resulting in earlier snowmelt at these locations similar to results found in both alpine lópez moreno et al 2013 and previous rain snow transition kormos et al 2014a analyses net radiation increased on north facing slopes and at drift locations later in the year april june and continued to increase into the summer months june july we expected that turbulent heat fluxes would affect johnston draw s snowpack throughout the catchment regardless of elevation and aspect since sensible and latent heat fluxes are known to affect snowmelt across various alpine hartman et al 1999 prowse and owens 1982 moore and owens 1984 and grassland sites yang et al 1999 however in johnston draw sensible heat fluxes were consistently more positive i e energy entering the snowpack at higher elevations whereas latent heat fluxes were more pronounced i e more negative or more positive at high elevations compared to mid and low elevations fig 5d e these turbulent flux patterns suggest larger variations at locally higher elevations likely due to higher wind speeds which might be expected in an area that includes both snow drifts and scour zones consistent with schlögl et al 2018 the variation of the surface energy fluxes particularly turbulent fluxes was larger within modeled complex terrain than for an idealized flat lower elevation test site we did not see obvious seasonal differences in turbulent fluxes across aspects but we did see differences at drift locations fig 5d e finally spatial differences in snowpack thickness greatly influenced the subsequent timing of swi generation especially the fraction derived from snowmelt because thicker snowpacks had a greater cold content than shallower snowpacks in johnston draw in turn these areas required more energy to induce snowmelt delaying the generation of snowmelt until later in the year similar to musselman et al 2017 our results show that relatively consistent spatial cold content and energy balance patterns persisted throughout all snow covered seasons in both water years until only isothermal snow remained on north facing slopes and at drift locations figs 5f and s2f the increased snowpack depth in johnston draw was a result of redistributed snowfall due to wind creating spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the snowpack and its energy balance and subsequently swi derived from snowmelt winstral et al 2013 without the redistribution of snowfall cold content of the snowpack and snowmelt timing would be markedly less variable across johnston draw under predicted warming the spatial heterogeneity of swi will decrease due to decreased snowfall and thus decreased precipitation redistribution which will lead to decreased thickness and cold content of the catchment snowpack mote et al 2005 2018 musselman et al 2017 these potential changes to the snowpack will increase sensitivity to energy balance variables and will induce snowmelt earlier in the water year musselman et al 2017 2021 a change from the historical temporal patterns of swi in the catchment will ultimately change the timing of water availability that feeds downstream water needs and users mote et al 2005 2018 increasing water stress later in the season knowles et al 2015 thus capturing energy balance effects on swi patterns across multiple years and at the rain snow transition zone is critical now and in the future as local and regional snowpacks become more sensitive and are subject to warming and increased interannual variability mote et al 2005 2018 4 2 drivers of swi during ros events the rain snow transition zone is by nature susceptible to ros events due to its location near the winter snowline kormos et al 2014b depending on the temperature and the amount and intensity of rainfall onto the snowpack large volumes of the snowpack might melt rapidly and in some situations generate considerable fluxes of water beniston and stoffel 2016 the amount of excess swi produced during the ros events in johnston draw in 2011 and 2014 was small maximum 7 mm or 1 of annual swi table 4 in johnston draw and consistent with previous work the development of a ripe snowpack was on average an important factor for excess swi generation during ros events julander and clayton 2018 jennings and jones 2015 exceptions to this averaged relationship included ros events where initial conditions may have played a compounding role in excess swi generation e g initial snow covered area initial swe snow fraction of event higher excess swi often occurred with a higher snow covered area at the beginning of the ros event 35 and 65 of the catchment was covered in snow prior to the two ros events where 5 mm of excess swi was produced table 4 the remainder of the catchment experienced precipitation onto bare ground finally after peak swe the snowpack present during ros events was warmer contained more liquid water and generated more excess swi thus while initial snowpack conditions including the initial amount of swe and the snow covered area did not correlate strongly with swi or excess swi generation these variables were significantly related to the swi centroid of each ros event in johnston draw upwards of 25 of total annual swi was generated during the ros events which came from 10 to 100 of the catchment from both snow covered and non snow covered grid cells table 4 south facing slopes generated most of the swi as both rainfall and snowmelt during ros events before peak swe where the remaining snowpack on this aspect was often near 0 c and thus susceptible to melting with added advected energy north facing slopes generated most of the swi as both rainfall and snowmelt during ros events after peak swe as the snowpack on this aspect persisted later in the year allowing for increased snowmelt i e additional swi production beyond the event precipitation during these events in addition after peak swe snow was often no longer present on south facing slopes and thus only swi as rainfall was generated on snow free aspects unlike the annual and seasonal swi analyses during most ros events snow drifts did not produce substantial swi since the deeper drifts had a greater cold content and were thus less vulnerable to melt in most rainfall events the shallower non drift locations which produced less swi at the annual scale produced more swi at the ros event scale the increased response time between rainfall and swi production and higher snowpack depths is consistent with past work in both alpine and sub alpine regions jennings and jones 2015 marks et al 2001 würzer et al 2016 the transient nature of the rain snow transition zone suggests that in low and mid elevation mountain catchments like johnston draw the snowpack may completely ablate multiple times per winter season making the timing of excess swi production less predictable and potentially more frequent despite lower water storage in the snowpack this may be especially true under future warming conditions when the number of ros events is expected to increase by close to 50 in mountain and alpine catchments beniston and stoffel 2016 and as warming becomes of greater concern in present day ros events have already begun to increase in montane regions barnett et al 2005 freudiger et al 2014 gergel et al 2017 finally though other studies have found that precipitation intensity and event magnitude are important drivers of snowmelt generation during ros events they were not critical drivers of excess swi production in johnston draw and while rainfall event totals were much lower than peak intensities in other works e g beniston and stoffel 2016 to investigate rainfall thresholds at which more excess swi may be generated in johnston draw more years more meteorological variables e g wind humidity and air temperature and more ros events should be considered 4 3 assumptions and implications 4 3 1 assumptions the assumptions underlying the interpolation methods employed by the awsm isnobal model have critical implications for the precipitation and swi analyses here particularly when snowfall occurred this model was chosen because it is a high resolution e g 10 100 m physics based spatially distributed model that explicitly simulates swi the hydrologic variable of interest havens et al 2020 precipitation interpolation within awsm was based on an elevation gradient that led to more precipitation both snowfall and rainfall at higher elevations because snowfall inputs were rescaled using snow depths from the same lidar observation small differences between years may have been smoothed resulting in more spatially similar snowpacks between the two years further the lidar snowfall redistribution pattern representing peak snow depth from 2009 was used to rescale snowfall at all time steps of year in the model this limitation forced the assumption that snow drifts form in the same location regardless of season or event dynamics this assumption may not always be accurate leading to model uncertainty further using peak snow depth to redistribute snowfall throughout the entire snow season may overestimate the difference in snowfall between areas with deep vs shallow snowpacks in the catchment this is due to the imperfect relationship between snowfall and snow on the ground at one snapshot in time because portions of the rain snow transition zone experience intermittent melt kormos et al 2014a peak snow depth cannot capture snowfall that may have melted earlier in the year which is more likely in non drift areas thus the magnitude of differences in snow depth and thus spatially distributed swi magnitude may be exaggerated across the catchment to reduce model uncertainty of the snow distribution in johnston draw additional catchment wide lidar flights accompanied by sufficient on the ground observations of the snowpack throughout the snow season and across different years would be valuable subsequently because only small amounts of precipitation were expected to evaporate or sublimate swi strongly reflected spatial and temporal precipitation patterns model accuracy particularly of the redistribution of precipitation and thus swi throughout the two water years of interest has been shown to be robust kiewiet et al 2022 this accuracy and consistency between years reflects underlying static environmental variables e g topography and relatively consistent dynamic variables e g wind patterns that affect the distribution of precipitation and thus swi marks et al 1998 molotch et al 2011 stähli et al 1999 ultimately while the model results depend on the precipitation redistribution method this approach is justified at multiple time scales providing useful insights into the water and energy balance at the rain snow transition in both wet and dry years finally while the intent of this work was to explore differences in catchment hydrological response to different weather conditions and water inputs i e swi responses to dry and wet years modeling catchment behavior during additional water years and in response to incrementally variable inputs including phase would provide further insight to historical and potential future swi and subsequent streamflow dynamics at the rain snow transition zone 4 3 2 implications swi is the variable that most directly controls soil moisture and thus subsurface water storage seyfried et al 2009 williams et al 2009 groundwater recharge aishlin and mcnamara 2011 scanlon et al 2006 nutrient cycling schmidt and lipson 2004 and streamflow liu et al 2013 mcnamara et al 2005 moore et al 1991 the use of the awsm isnobal model generates a high resolution 10 100 m spatially distributed account of swi allowing this investigation of swi drivers in space and through time swi varied over one catchment in this work and was generated from different locations in the catchment during different seasons and ros events depending on the local water and energy balance fluxes modeling and understanding the drivers of swi on multiple temporal scales suggests that in the rain snow transition zone as snowfall continues to decrease in a warming climate redistribution of snowfall might also decrease resulting in earlier snowmelt musselman et al 2017 badger et al 2021 in turn earlier snowmelt will result in more swi earlier in the year and less swi later in the year hale et al 2022 potentially inducing water stress and differences in seasonal plant water use if there is no summer rainfall to compensate mcnamara et al 2005 wieder et al 2022 these deductions apply to both wet and dry water years where the water and energy sensitivities at the rain snow transition were similar across aspects and elevations regardless of annual and seasonal precipitation magnitude thus similar patterns in catchment responses to changes in climate may be expected in both wet and dry years the model allowed for a close examination of snow drifts features strongly affecting swi distribution in most catchments receiving snowfall in the mountainous western us ikeda et al 2021 we show that this importance extends to the rain snow transition zone even though most snowpacks in this zone are relatively shallow and transient our results illuminate the importance of capturing snow drift formation in catchments to accurately capture the timing of catchment swi and its origin across all temporal scales consistent with similar work done in a nearby snow dominated catchment luce et al 1998 as well as in other regions e g brauchli et al 2017 yet in the rain snow transition zone in particular previous analyses focused more on aspect controls than snow drifting and elevation controls on swi kormos et al 2014a 2018 additional works targeting swi have not represented drifts due to model choice or spatial resolutions or have represented drifts using a drift factor chauvin et al 2011 liu et al 2013 luce 1998 our work suggests that drifts even in the rain snow transition zone are important in this region because they drive a strong relationship between annual precipitation and annual swi fig 4a and c modulate swi generation at seasonal timeframes and ros events create more heterogeneous swe patterns across elevation bands via scour and deposition fig 4b and generate a substantial proportion of annual swi in a small fraction of the catchment section 4 1 in addition to the importance of drifts in controlling the spatial and temporal patterns of swi drifts may be more sensitive to warming than the surrounding landscape marshall et al 2019a this might be especially true in mid elevation mountains and at the rain snow transition zone which is shown to be highly sensitive to increases in atmospheric temperatures and changes in the present day climate kormos et al 2014a williams et al 2009 4 4 conclusion the purpose of this work was to evaluate the spatial patterns of surface water inputs swi the summation of rainfall and snowmelt onto the soil on annual seasonal and event scales across two water years and to determine the driving forces of this primary water resource in the rain snow transition zone of the western us annually swi distribution was driven primarily by precipitation in johnston draw across both a wet and dry water year snow drifts covering approximately 3 of the catchment area generated the most swi 8 0 in wet 2011 and 6 6 in dry 2014 highlighting the importance of snow drifts in swi distribution conversely high elevation scoured areas produced the least amount of swi across the defined aspect elevation bins seasonally total energy fluxes were typically higher on the south and other facing slopes during mid winter months which coincided with early swi generation as snowmelt energy balance variables and swi production increased on north facing slopes and drift locations later in the spring and summer at the ros event scale on average more excess swi was generated during events later in the year where the snowpack was warmer and contained more liquid water and was near isothermal i e ripe and warm across ros events more snowmelt occurred in the shallow warm snowpacks before peak swe and on north facing slopes and at higher elevations after peak swe snow drifts were often too cold to produce snowmelt during ros events further demonstrating the importance of drifts as a significant regulator of swi generation as the climate continues to warm the water inputs that drive swi in the rain snow transition zone will trend toward rainfall instead of snowfall not only will the snow line shift toward higher elevations but the distribution and timing of swi generation across the catchment might also change affecting downstream streamflow dynamics and influencing the ecosystems and end

2546,spatial and temporal dynamics of rainfall and snowmelt i e surface water inputs swi control soil moisture groundwater recharge and streamflow at annual seasonal and event scales in the rain snow transition zone comprising a large portion of the mountainous western united states there is limited understanding of the sensitivity of spatiotemporal swi dynamics across hydrologically variable water years wys we modeled rainfall and snowpack dynamics in a small headwater catchment 1 8 km2 spanning the rain snow transition in southwestern idaho usa for two hydrologically distinct wys 2011 and 2014 in wet wy 2011 and dry wy 2014 total precipitation drove spatial variability in annual swi snow drifts generated more swi 901 2080 mm than high elevation scour zones 442 640 mm which generated less swi than mid elevation non drift locations 452 784 mm seasonally energy fluxes differed most during the snowmelt period where higher net radiation at lower elevations and south facing slopes drove swi production at the rain on snow ros event scale higher elevations and north facing slopes generated 15 20 of annual swi due mainly to higher turbulent fluxes the most productive ros events occurred after peak snow water equivalent swe when rainfall fell onto ripe snowpacks snow drift locations were less susceptible to melt during ros events offset by the larger cold content and snowpack mass thus catchment water resources depend on swi magnitude location and timing which are moderated by drift persistence at all temporal scales as the climate warms shifts in spatiotemporal

warming recharge data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction during winter and spring the spatial transition between rainfall and snowfall in the mountainous western united states us can result in a jagged line separating white covered terrain above and snow free surfaces below the elevation of the snow line might change with aspect and over time and vary with air temperatures and incoming precipitation klos et al 2014 mote et al 2018 this affects the timing of infiltration and runoff of rainfall and snowmelt with cascading effects on catchment ecohydrological cycles including evapotranspiration kraft and mcnamara 2021 and growing season duration poulos et al 2021 comparing the spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall and snowmelt across water years helps to reveal which water balance components are most sensitive to different hydroclimatic conditions the rain snow transition zone has previously been defined as areas that receive at least 7 of total annual precipitation as mixed rainfall and snowfall precipitation events kormos et al 2018 and following this definition covers approximately 40 of the mountainous landscape in the western us klos et al 2014 because winter season temperatures in this area fluctuate around 0 c jennings et al 2018 the snowpack often melts intermittently in parts of the catchment kormos et al 2014a and is susceptible to small changes in atmospheric conditions including warming and shifts in precipitation magnitude and phase seyfried et al 2021 williams et al 2009 the distribution of rainfall and snowmelt is thus heterogeneous in the rain snow transition zone kormos et al 2014a and while this is true in most regions that experience snowfall the precipitation in the rain snow transition zone is often more variable because the physical phase of precipitation i e liquid as rainfall or solid as snowfall can vary at fine scales klos et al 2014 hydrologic characteristics within the rain snow transition zone might exemplify future climatic effects at higher currently snow dominated elevations fyfe et al 2017 klos et al 2014 nayak et al 2010 the observed snowline has already begun to creep toward higher elevations in recent decades as the rain snow transition zone has shifted upward reducing snow covered area and the number of snow covered days at lower elevations affecting the timing and amount of available downstream water hamlet et al 2005 regonda et al 2005 across the western us peak seasonal snowpack storage measured as snow water equivalent swe around april 1 has declined substantially over the last half century mote et al 2005 2018 regonda et al 2005 accompanied by an earlier onset of spring due to increased winter and spring temperatures folland et al 2001 marshall et al 2019a musselman et al 2017 steward et al 2005 variability in swe magnitude and in peak swe timing are expected to increase particularly in regions where rainfall may replace snowfall near the rain snow transition marshall et al 2019b another anticipated change with climate warming is more frequent rain on snow ros events beniston and stoffel 2016 cohen et al 2015 lópez moreno et al 2013 2021 musselman et al 2018 at the current rain snow transition zone ros events already occur frequently especially at low to mid elevations lópez moreno et al 2013 shi and liu 2021 during these events relatively warm rain transfers energy as advected heat into the relatively cold snowpack mccabe et al 2007 when this happens positive sensible and latent heat fluxes dominate the snowpack energy balance marks et al 1998 and can lead to early season snowmelt and flooding as well as late season drought guan et al 2016 warmer shallower snowpacks are more vulnerable to increased energy inputs during ros events nolin and daly 2006 brunengo 2012 which can rapidly increase snowmelt in a short period of time beniston and stoffel 2016 julander and clayton 2018 climatic changes may lead to complex shifts in snowmelt responses during ros events musselman et al 2018 melt from ros events may also be limited if the snowpack is so shallow that it completely melts early during such events würzer et al 2016 kroczynski 2004 in contrast if the snowpack remains consistently deep under warming conditions but rain events are more intense more energy may be added into the snowpack via advection or turbulent fluxes leading to more heterogeneous hydrologic responses than previously observed osterhuber 1999 würzer et al 2016 snowmelt and energetic responses may also vary across the watershed during ros events challenging the expectation that ros events will always generate large amounts of water output garvelmann et al 2015 kormos et al 2014b marks et al 1998 wever et al 2014 würzer et al 2016 to anticipate changes in future water availability from both rainfall and snowmelt we must improve our understanding of the sensitivity of catchments in the rain snow transition zone to the current range of water and energy inputs harpold et al 2017 reported hydrologic patterns and catchment responses typically reflect average spatial and temporal conditions in mostly snow dominated regions mote et al 2018 this leaves a notable gap in our understanding of catchment and sub catchment hydrologic sensitivity to changes in water and energy inputs at the rain snow transition across different timescales and during hydroclimatically different years in addition the sensitivities of particular catchments as in our case johnston draw idaho usa may reflect responses to both static i e relatively constant such as underlying landscape and dynamic i e changing such as wind characteristics and effects controls godsey et al 2018 how defined static and dynamic controls modulate the distribution and driving processes of precipitation inputs can be investigated by simulating the spatiotemporal distribution of snowpack and snowmelt the sum of rainfall and snowmelt at the soil surface is referred to as the surface water inputs swi which summarize the timing and amount of water entering the terrestrial system klos et al 2014 kormos et al 2018 the spatial distribution of swi likewise depends on precipitation magnitude resulting in swi variability across aspects and elevations as well as between scour and drift locations where snowfall has been preferentially deposited or transported by wind kiewiet et al 2022 kormos et al 2014a lehning et al 2008 luce et al 1998 the spatiotemporal distribution of swi might also be impacted by additional static boundary conditions such as vegetation and slope and dynamic boundary conditions including energy fluxes kormos et al 2014a pomeroy et al 2003 because swi influences soil moisture streamflow groundwater recharge plant productivity and nutrient cycling kormos et al 2014a mcnamara et al 2005 quantifying the primary drivers of the spatiotemporal patterns of swi will allow us to understand the impact that swi has on these fundamental processes stores and fluxes and as swi distributions change in a warming climate hale et al 2022 the subsequent distribution of water availability will certainly be further impacted previous research suggests that the drivers of swi may vary annually seasonally and on the event scale annually swi distribution in the snow dominated upper sheep creek catchment was affected by snow drifting and aspect differences with snowpacks persisting longer into the spring season in drift locations and on northeast facing slopes luce et al 1998 seasonally swi timing and amount have been shown to vary across aspects in the rain snow transition zone kormos et al 2014a however the combined effects of elevation snowfall redistribution and differences in inter annual hydrologic behavior have not yet been evaluated in the rain snow transition zone but are likely prevalent across such regions klos et al 2014 further at the ros event scale catchment average precipitation and snowpack characteristics have been related to stream discharge rücker et al 2019 würzer et al 2016 but the spatial origin of swi during these events has not yet been quantified past studies have collectively shown that the drivers of swi vary inter and intra annually but have focused only on single time scales e g annual or seasonal or event scale more recently godsey et al 2018 compiled relevant hydrometeorological data in the rain snow transition and kiewiet et al 2022 explored spatially distributed annual swi within the rain snow transition zone across relatively wet dry rainy and snowy water years in relation to annual streamflow and stream drying we aim to build on these works focusing on the varying drivers of spatially distributed swi across multiple time scales annual and seasonal between multiple years specifically a wet and a dry year and during hydro meteorological anomalies e g ros events which remain important knowledge gaps particularly in the dynamic rain snow transition zone in the western us to address these research gaps we evaluated variations in spatial and temporal swi precipitation snow water equivalent swe and energy fluxes across aspects elevation bands and drift and scour locations to identify the drivers of swi we evaluated water and energy fluxes annually seasonally and across multiple ros events for two water years wys 2011 wet and 2014 dry defined from october 1 to september 30 in a catchment located in the rain snow transition zone at reynolds creek experimental watershed rcew the rcew was selected as an experimental watershed because of its representativeness of the region seyfried et al 2000 2001 we used the isnobal automated water supply model awsm havens et al 2020 marks et al 1999 at the catchment scale forced with an extensive hydro meteorological dataset godsey et al 2018 the following research questions were addressed for this watershed in the semi arid intermountain west rain snow transition zone

spatial patterns and how do they vary seasonally 2a where is swi generated during ros events in the rain snow transition zone 2b what inputs or underlying conditions influence swi at the ros event scale the use of the physics based snow model isnobal permits us to evaluate these questions with a focus on the physical processes that are representative of swi production and ros events across rain snow transition zones in the intermountain west of the us 2 methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in johnston draw fig 1 a c a catchment located in the rain snow transition within the rcew rcew is part of the critical zone observatory czo network and located in the owyhee continental mountain range of southwest idaho us 100 km southwest of boise idaho and 30 km east of the idaho oregon border fig 1a rcew is managed by the us department of agriculture usda agricultural research service ars as a representative watershed in the us intermountain west seyfried et al 2000 2001 and covers a 239 km2 area ranging from snow dominated fig 1b white mixed phase precipitation fig 1b gray to rain dominated fig 1b black sub catchments modified from godsey et al 2018 johnston draw is a 1 8 km2 headwater catchment within the rcew with an average elevation of 1719 m range of 1497 m 1869 m godsey et al 2018 the catchment includes an east west oriented valley an east flowing stream and opposing north south aspect hillslopes fig 1c between 2004 and 2014 johnston draw experienced a yearly mean temperature of 8 1 c and mean annual precipitation map of 600 mm where 39 53 of map fell as snow godsey et al 2018 annual runoff ratios ranged from 0 08 to 0 45 godsey et al 2018 wind typically comes from the south and southwest with an annual average wind speed range between 2 8 m s 1 across most of the catchment measured at all but one site described in section 2 2 and 4 5 m s 1 in the windiest areas measured at one relatively exposed site site 124 godsey et al 2018 wind in johnston draw preferentially redistributes and deposits snow from windy scour zones to form drifts in the southwest part of the catchment which faces predominantly to the northeast vegetation on the north facing slopes includes snowberry symphoricarpos big sagebrush artemisia tridentate aspen populus tremuloides groves and low sagebrush artemisia arbuscula with wheatgrass elymus trachycaulus south facing vegetation consists of artemisia arbuscula elymus trachycaulus mountain mahogany cercocarpus ledifolius and bitter brush purshia tridentate godsey et al 2018 stephenson 1970 under this vegetation sandy loam soils with an average depth of 0 96 m make up the land surface and shallow subsurface of johnston draw patton et al 2018 2 2 datasets eleven stations monitored atmospheric conditions in johnston draw and were used to force a snowpack model for this analysis fig 1c the stations are positioned in the watershed so that one station exists on both the north and south facing slopes at roughly the same elevation every 50 m in elevation from the bottom east end to the top west end of the catchment marks et al 2013 seyfried et al 2021 table 1 measurements of solar radiation si wind

available at 1 m resolution from a 2014 airborne lidar flight shrestha and glenn 2016 to evaluate the range of water inputs to johnston draw two wys were assessed 2011 a relatively wet year total annual precipitation 709 mm 120 of map and 2014 a relatively dry year 528 mm 86 of map these two water years had very similar mean annual air temperatures 0 2 c difference yet the differences in precipitation contributed to a 4 difference in discharge kiewiet et al 2022 in addition one large ros event along with multiple smaller ros events occurred in both water years making these wys suitable to evaluate swi generation at event and annual time scales 2 3 modeling we used the isnobal automated water supply model awsm which was developed at the usda agricultural research service ars in boise id to estimate catchment snow water supply havens et al 2020 marks et al 1999 awsm standardizes the steps needed to 1 distribute weather station data using the spatial modeling for resources framework smrf havens et al 2018 2020 2 run the energy and mass balance model isnobal as described below marks et al 1999 and 3 compile the results as user friendly output havens et al 2018 2020 hourly meteorological data precipitation air temperature solar radiation vapor pressure wind speed and direction are distributed in smrf via the elevation gradient presented in the digital elevation model dem havens et al 2020 isnobal a physics based spatially distributed energy and mass balance snow model then generates spatially distributed swe and swi marks et al 1999 isnobal is driven by the distributed meteorological and precipitation data to model the snowpack evolution throughout the accumulation and ablation seasons across a gridded spatial domain e g a watershed isnobal represents the snowpack as two layers a surface layer that is in contact with the air and a bottom layer that is in contact with the soil marks et al 1999 the mass and energy balance terms and fluxes are tracked for both snow layers and each layer is presumed to be homogeneous garen and marks 2005 isnobal uses the spatially distributed meteorological forcings listed in table 1 to solve the energy and mass balance at each snow covered grid cell e g 10 m 10 m the snowpack energy balance is expressed as 1 δ q rn h le g m δ t where δq the change in snowpack energy storage w m 2 t is time s rn net radiation

snowpack and the atmosphere and between the snowpack and the underlying soil surface in addition the model computes the snowpack temperature mass snow depth swe and snow coverage for the watershed during a model run when additional energy is added to the snowpack and exceeds a specified liquid water content threshold 1 of swe volume isnobal calculates melt based on the available energy eq 4 marks et al 1999 marks and winstral 2001 liquid water leaving the snowpack at the base is calculated after considering snowpack water holding capacity and refreezing this mass output is then recorded as swi after each time step isnobal readjusts the structural e g swe and depth and thermal snowpack properties of each layer kumar et al 2013 finally isnobal computes various energy fluxes within the snowpack havens et al 2020 here we considered five components of the energy balance latent heat sensible heat heat from the interaction between the snowpack and soil advected energy heat that enters the snowpack as precipitation net radiation and the sum of all energy balance terms these components were then compared to the cold content of the snowpack variables listed and defined in table 2 we ran the model at a 10 m resolution which was coarse enough to smooth small scale variations in topography but fine enough to capture the processes that drive differential melt we relied on the well established interannual consistency in snow distributions pflug and lundquist 2020 schirmer et al 2011 sturm and wagner 2010 to rescale interpolated precipitation and snowfall fields using the vöegeli et al 2016 approach for both simulated years using one available lidar snow depth survey near peak snowpack conditions march 2009 tinkham et al 2014 the vöegeli et al 2016 approach implicitly captures the spatial heterogeneity of snow using distributed snow depth information e g from lidar or structure from motion and assimilates this information into physically based models such as isnobal awsm thus this methodology was used to rescale precipitation to represent the redistribution of snowfall by wind and topographic effects leading to the development of drifts and scour areas in the johnston draw catchment in this way we reproduced the observed snowpack distribution patterns while conserving the initial mass estimation despite a relatively dense array of 11 meteorological stations described in section 2 2 and listed in table 1 precipitation rescaling was found to improve the representation of the catchment wide snowpack kiewiet et al 2022 trujillo et al 2019 the precipitation rescaling approach was implemented only when snowfall was present because wind is a dominant control on snow redistribution especially in johnston draw marks et al 1998 molotch et al 2011 winstral et al 2002 consequently we expected the spatial distribution of swi to partially reflect the spatial distribution of snowfall and total precipitation resulting from this rescaling approach the limitations presented by this approach including the rescaling model choice available datasets and their potential uncertainties are discussed in section 4 3 1 finally the isnobal model was run hourly with the rescaled precipitation as an input model generated snow thicknesses were verified spatially against lidar snow depths r2 0 88 and temporally against snow depth time series at each of the meteorological stations median nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 65 see kiewiet et al 2022 for a detailed description of the model performance and related uncertainties 2 4 relationship between spatially distributed swi and water and energy balance variables across temporal scales to evaluate the spatial and temporal drivers of swi in johnston draw at the annual seasonal and ros event scales across the two different wys we quantified precipitation swe swi and snowpack energy balance variables listed and described in table 2 the methodology for determining the drivers of swi at each temporal scale is described in the following paragraphs annually correlation analyses were conducted using 11 aspect elevation bins to cluster grid cells into north facing south facing and other facing areas neither south nor north facing thus either east or west facing or flat at low mid and high elevations as well as drift locations at mid and high elevations shown in fig 1c and listed in table 3 drifts were defined as grid cells with annual peak swe in the top 10 within the catchment which were validated against available observation lidar data kiewiet et al 2022 the aspects of the catchment were calculated from the dem where north facing was defined between 330 and 30 and south facing between 150 and 210 other facing includes all remaining degree values and locations where the slope is 5 the elevation bins were assigned by dividing the full catchment elevation range into three equal parts thus the elevation bin labels low 1496 1620 m mid 1620 1745 m and high 1745 1869 m are relative to the catchment elevation range i e high refers to locally high elevations we calculated total annual precipitation and swi and mean swe during the snow season which was defined as the period when snow covered area 0 0 km2 for each of these aspect elevation bins we assessed the strength and direction of correlations between swe precipitation and swi seasonal variability in swi precipitation swe and energy balance fluxes was also evaluated by plotting and interpreting time series data across both water years using the same 11 aspect elevation bins available spatially distributed topographic variables of slope angle convexity elevation soil type soil depth and vegetation height showed no relationship with the spatial distribution of annual and seasonal swi and were not further considered advected energy a model output was also not further considered after showing no relationship with spatial swi distribution finally at the event scale we defined ros events as precipitation events that received more than 5 mm basin averaged precipitation of which the majority fell as rain snowfall fraction 0 5 while at least 3 of the land surface was covered with snow roughly the areal extent of the defined snow drifts when periods of rainfall were separated by a dry period of less than 6 h they were considered a single event these constraints resulted in a total of seven ros events in 2011 and nine in 2014 for each event we calculated the precipitation magnitude mm and intensity mm h 1 event snowfall fraction unitless excess swi any swi generated in addition to total event precipitation mm snow covered area km2 basin wide mean swe mm at the start of the event snowpack cold content mj m 2 and liquid water content mm when comparing cold content and liquid water content to excess swi via linear regressions we normalized each variable by the snow covered area to account for the fact that these variables are only calculated for model grid cells where swe 0 mm thus the results reflect excess swi as a product of the grid cell cold content and liquid water content from only the snow covered area liquid water content while limited to 1 of the grid cell modeled swe in the model was used for relative comparisons of snowpack saturation across ros events finally we assessed whether the date of the event occurred before or after catchment average peak swe and quantified the spatial centroid of swi generation within the catchment both the annual average and event specific centroid locations of swi generation were calculated and reported as the weighted average location of swi a spatial offset was calculated as any difference between the event specific swi centroid location and the yearly centroid location 2011 or 2014 annual centroids were calculated separately but were nearly the same 3 results at the 10 m spatial resolution the modeled snow depths strongly agreed with observational lidar snow depths r2 0 88 see kiewiet et al 2022 lending confidence to the use of modeled spatially distributed surface water inputs swi at event to annual scales to address our specific research questions we have separated our results by temporal scales drivers of annual and seasonal scale swi research questions 1a and 1b and drivers of rain on snow event swi research questions 2a and 2b at both temporal scales we address differences between the wet and dry water years the discussion follows a similar order 3 1 drivers of annual and seasonal swi 3 1 1 annual scale total annual precipitation and mean and peak swe were greater in 2011 than in 2014 table 3 the catchment received 34 more precipitation in 2011 than in 2014 catchment mean precipitation 709 mm vs 528 mm the snowfall fraction was 14 greater 0 48 vs 0 34 which equated to 161 mm more snow in 2011 than in 2014 catchment mean snowfall 340 vs 179 mm the higher precipitation inputs resulted in 172 mm more swi in 2011 than in 2014 catchment mean swi 692 mm vs 520 mm fig 2 a b in 2011 swe reached a maximum of 897 mm at the grid cell scale in the drift locations whereas maximum swe was 401 mm in 2014 peak swe occurred in similar areas in both years but exceeded mean catchment precipitation only in 2011 table 3 differences in winter monthly mean air temperatures between the wet and dry years were as follows 5 c warmer in 2014 in nov 3 6 c warmer in 2011 in dec and jan 7 c warmer in 2014 in february 2 c warmer in 2014 in march and equal temperatures in april see fig 2 in godsey et al 2018 the mean air temperatures in november february in these years spanned the 0 c mark affecting the phase of falling precipitation and monthly snowfall fraction godsey et al 2018 areas of highest annual swi coincided with snow drifts in the southwestern part of the catchment fig 2a c where mean annual swi in the drift locations ranged from 1383 1886 mm in 2011 and 898 1257 mm in 2014 fig 2d table 3 on average 8 0 of total annual swi in 2011 and 6 6 of total annual swi in 2014 was generated from the snow drifts in addition to the large swi volume generated at the snow drifts north facing slopes and other facing slopes generated more swi than the south facing slopes in both water years especially in 2011 diamonds circle crosses and triangles respectively in fig 3 a b non drift high elevation regions often generated the least amount of swi in both years due to wind scouring implicitly represented with the snowfall rescaling approach compared to the same aspects at lower elevations table 3 differences in precipitation swe and swi between the two water years were largest at the snow drifts average δswi of 1130 mm and north facing slopes average δswi of 346 mm and smaller on the south facing slopes fig 2c at the annual scale precipitation and swi were strongly correlated fig 3a b r2 0 98 and p value 0 05 in both years in both years modeled snow drifts received the most redistributed swe and generated the most swi fig 3a b stars higher swe also occurred in drift locations and north and other facing at low elevations but the relationship with swi was not as strong fig 3c d r2 0 57 and 0 66 in 2011 and 2014 respectively p value 0 05 in both years 3 1 2 seasonal scale water balance variables seasonal differences in swi across johnston draw were a result of snowfall and thus swe and the spatial variability in temporal delays of snowmelt although precipitation was rare in johnston draw when temperatures were consistently above 0 c jul sep during 2011 and 2014 when it did occur rainfall was distributed uniformly across all aspect elevation bins visible as periods when all lines overlap in figs 4 a and s1a in contrast during december april in both years precipitation magnitude varied across the catchment particularly in drift locations because snowfall is susceptible to preferential deposition and wind redistribution figs 4a and s1a elevational lines with the least variability are plotted on top of elevational lines with more variability the accumulation of snowfall in drifts is clearly visible in the drift swe time series as it starkly contrasts with lower swe in all other aspect elevation bins figs 4b and s1b north facing slopes at low and mid elevations had higher seasonal swe than other facing regions figs 4b and s1b north facing and other facing and the lowest seasonal swe occurred in the high elevation non drift regions figs 4b and s1b light blue lines which is likely due to snow scouring from these regions within the low and mid elevation bins the north facing slopes retained more precipitation as snowfall and thus swe daily swi was often high during the snowmelt period between april and july in both years maximum daily swi during snowmelt period 43 mm in 2011 and 41 mm in 2014 figs 4c and s1c respectively during this period on average swi was consistently highest in the drift locations followed by the north facing slopes where there was more swe available to melt snowmelt occurred up to two months earlier on south and other facing slopes compared to north facing slopes i e march april vs may june in 2011 figs 4c and s1c snow cover energy balance components when and where snowmelt occurred depended on energy fluxes that differed by elevation aspect and snowpack accumulation until the onset of the ablation season e g april july in 2011 the overall net energy flux was low 100 w m 2 in both years and across all aspect elevation bins figs 5 a and s2a with deviations from the catchment average that were smaller than 5 in the latter part of the snowmelt season the snowpack persisted only in the drift locations and so the energy balance variables were only calculated in these areas havens et al 2018 2020 the spatial energy balance patterns were similar across both years shown for 2011 in fig 5 and for 2014 in s2 and differences existed primarily in the magnitude of each energy flux which was on average 15 larger in 2011 consistent with the deeper snowpack and longer snow season in this year thus differences in energy fluxes between the two years existed near the beginning of snow accumulation and snowmelt periods the next paragraphs outline the temporal differences in each energy flux in relation to snowmelt generation across aspect elevation bins and through the two water years net radiation was typically negative in the winter months and except for drift locations net radiation was higher at lower elevations green or dark blue lines figs 5b and s2b than at higher elevations light blue lines figs 5b and s2b net radiation became positive across all aspects and elevations in march in 2011 fig 5b and in april in 2014 fig s2b and continued to increase until the snowpack had fully melted may june the ground energy flux was noticeably lower in drift locations throughout the mid winter season and only exceeded the ground flux of the other aspect elevation bins after the snowpack had melted from all other areas in the catchment figs 5c and s2c between december and april in both years the ground heat flux was highest on the south facing slopes and higher at mid and high elevation relative to the lower elevations the latent heat flux was greater in magnitude at higher elevations than at mid and low elevations figs 5d and s2d high elevation latent heat peaked with positive values in december january and reached its lowest negative values in april may when most aspect elevation bins experienced snowmelt latent heat at high elevations became positive again in june similarly the sensible heat flux was most often highest at high elevations light blue lines figs 5e and s2e especially on the north facing aspects during most of the winter months december april both latent heat and sensible heat fluxes were highest in drift locations only late in the snowmelt period may july in both years as the snowpack had melted from all other aspect elevation bins lastly the snowpack cold content was greatest within the thickest snowpacks which corresponded to drift locations figs 5f and s2f followed by the north facing slopes at low and mid elevations the shallow snowpacks on the south facing slopes and high elevation scour zones were warmest i e a less negative cold content resulting in earlier melt out than deeper snowpacks on north facing slopes and at drift locations these trends also persisted throughout both water years 3 2 drivers of swi during ros events sixteen ros events were identified and examined table 4 during which the catchment received 5 37 mm of precipitation median 12 mm occurring over 9 37 h median 22 h initial snow covered area was greater than 5 of the catchment in all events the snowfall fraction during these events ranged from 0 to 0 30 catchment average peak swe occurred on march 7 in 2011 and february 9 in 2014 six of the sixteen events occurred before peak swe four in 2011 two in 2014 and the remaining ten events occurred after peak swe compared to ros events occurring after peak swe events occurring before peak swe happened when the pre event snow covered area was slightly larger mean sd 0 34 0 06 km2 compared to 0 21 0 19 km2 the snowpack was significantly colder cold content 3 58 2 2 10 3 mj m 2 compared to 1 19 0 77 10 3 mj m 2 and there was slightly more initial swe basin average swe0 33 3 22 2 mm compared to 31 8 13 0 mm during the majority of the ros events net radiation decreased but sensible and latent heat fluxes increased fig 5b d e and corresponding s2 panels resulting in energy flux increases during the events events are shown as black vertical dashes in all figs 5 and s2 panels specifically ros events coincided with an upward or downward spike in latent heat figs 5d and s2d and increases in sensible heat particularly at higher elevations light blue lines in figs 5e and s2e different locations in the catchment produced swi during different ros events depending on the initial snowpack and atmospheric conditions which shifted the catchment centroid location of swi generation the annual centroid of swi in 2011 and 2014 was similar the difference in centroid location across these years was 30 4 m across all events for the two years the centroid of swi for individual events extended to 45 m south 64 m north 104 m east and 68 m west of the annual swi centroid fig 6 a table 4 spatial offsets from the annual centroid of swi generation toward the south i e on north facing slopes negative δy occurred only during events after peak swe triangles in fig 6a and had on average smaller snow covered area at the start of the event average sca0 0 15 km2 compared to 0 28 km2 swi centroid offsets toward the east i e lower elevations positive δx and towards the west i e higher elevations negative δx were equally divided between events before and after peak swe positive versus negative values along x axis in fig 6a but ros events with a spatial offset towards the west were on average associated with a higher cold content i e warmer snowpack than ros events with a spatial offset to the east average cold content 1 9 10 3 mj m 2 compared to 3 5 10 3 mj m 2 indicating that thicker snowpacks at higher elevations in the western part of the catchment needed to seasonally warm before generating snowmelt during ros events thus even during ros events snow drifts modulated the timing of basin swi because they were less susceptible to melt finally events that delivered more than 20 mm of precipitation had a smaller north south offset from the yearly centroid mean sd δy 23 12 m compared to events that brought less than 20 mm of precipitation over the basin δy 29 2 m table 4 the amount of excess swi i e any swi in addition to total event precipitation produced during the ros events ranged from 6 to 7 mm negative excess swi indicates a net storage of precipitation in the snowpack and or refreezing and nearly all ros events prior to peak swe resulted in negative excess swi excess swi depended on the existing snowpack and event specific characteristics two characteristics were typically associated with higher excess swi generation though neither relationship was statistically significant higher liquid water content fig 6b r2 0 26 p value 0 3 and lower cold content fig 6c r2 0 34 p value 0 2 on average however ros events occurring after peak swe triangles in fig 6b c generated more excess swi corresponding with a warmer snowpack with a higher lwc exceptions to this included a few smaller ros events other factors such as basin average initial swe swe0 precipitation intensity and initial snow covered area sca0 did not appear to independently influence excess swi production summarized in table 4 the area of the catchment generating swi during ros events depended strongly on the season during events before peak swe smaller volumes of swi were generated on the north facing slopes and from the snow drifts fig 7 a and d corresponding to centroid offsets to the north i e swi generated on south facing slopes this pattern shifted after basin average peak swe when most swi was generated on the north facing slopes resulting in a centroid offset to the south fig 7b and e during the large ros event in 2011 fig 7c swi generated on the north facing slopes and from snow drifts increased with elevation and differences between snow covered and snow free areas were larger than during the largest event of 2014 fig 7c vs f 4 discussion 4 1 annual and seasonal drivers of swi 4 1 1 annual scale in both a wet and a dry water year the spatial distribution of swi in johnston draw was driven primarily by precipitation magnitude and the degree of spatial heterogeneity in swi depended on the phase of precipitation when precipitation fell as snow the spatial distribution of precipitation and thus swe and swi was more heterogeneous than during rainfall events accurate representation of high elevation drift zones adjacent to scour zones required both the elevational and orographic precipitation gradients represented in smrf havens et al 2018 and the implicit representation of wind redistribution through the snowfall rescaling method by vöegeli et al 2016 in johnston draw see section 4 3 1 for further discussion of model assumptions together these results highlight the importance of evaluating swi beyond calculating the simple catchment scale average in a rain snow transition catchment because the locations of drifts scour regions and aspect elevation combinations were consistent across relatively wet and dry years a single study season may reveal the relative spatial pattern of swi generation but not its magnitude across a range of climatic conditions differences in swi associated with changing snowfall fraction the amount of annual precipitation falling as rainfall vs snowfall was beyond the scope of this work but has been addressed in a comparison of rainy vs snowy years in this catchment kiewiet et al 2022 it may be surprising that an accurate snow drift representation is important at the rain snow transition zone where the snowpack is shallow and sometimes transient indeed we found that the presence of drifts in this study primarily drove the spatial patterns of swi similar to their role in snow dominated catchments at higher elevations than the typical rain snow transition zone it is well established that snow drifts significantly affect annual snowmelt e g anderton et al 2004 kretchun et al 2020 marshall et al 2019a williams et al 2009 winstral et al 2013 and although snow drifts in johnston draw generated proportionally less swi than higher elevation snow dominated catchments e g maximum 3 m of total daily swi in upper sheep creek compared to maximum 0 5 m of total daily swi in johnston draw fig 4c marshall et al 2019a winstral et al 2013 the amount of water stored in the drifts in both a wet and a dry year was substantial 8 in 2011 and 6 6 in 2014 of total catchment swi in 3 of the spatial area compared to the surrounding landscape in turn melt out dates strongly influence streamflow dry out dates in johnston draw kiewiet et al 2022 soderquist et al 2018 emphasizing the importance of capturing snow drifts even in the rain snow transition zone drift representation is important for accurate and informed choices about water resources and adaptation to climate change and variability in snow influenced regions dozier et al 2016 luce et al 1998 mote et al 2018 4 1 2 seasonal scale water balance variables whereas rainfall immediately becomes swi across the catchment the storage of water in the snowpack delays the generation of swi in the form of snowmelt for hours to months in johnston draw the magnitude of this delay depended on the aspect elevation and depth of the snowpack across the catchment further emphasizing the need to blend a spatial and temporal analysis of swi notably we found similar spatiotemporal swi patterns in both a wet and a dry year swi was highest during rainfall and snowmelt events and snowmelt began on south facing slopes prior to north facing slopes and then drifts seasonally swi was relatively less variable across the catchment at the beginning of the water year because precipitation fell as rain in early and mid winter months snowmelt was generated primarily on south facing slopes when snow melted on this aspect whereas snowmelt was generated from primarily north facing and snow drifts slopes in late winter and spring months from late season snowmelt finally swi was again less variable across aspects in summer and early fall months because precipitation fell as rain during those months figs 4c and s1c similar to a study during a typical year within a much smaller catchment located to the north 0 015 km2 kormos et al 2014a seasonal to annual swi generation in johnston draw 1 8 km2 was influenced by both elevation and snow drift locations this was true during both wet and dry years snow cover energy balance components our work extends previous efforts to compare energy fluxes across the rain snow transition zone by modeling at a spatial scale that is fine enough to capture scour drift aspect and elevation effects with this detailed comparative approach we found that energy fluxes in johnston draw differed spatially within the year but the patterns were similar across a wet and dry year with only few exceptions the largest difference between the two years was a shift in the energy balance due to a more persistent snowpack in the wetter year past work exploring the energy balance of swi production has otherwise typically been limited in space and or time kormos et al 2014a pohl and marsh 2006 shakoor and ejaz 2019 in johnston draw net radiation strongly affected the spatial and temporal patterns of swi from snowmelt low elevations and south and other facing slopes had a greater sum of energy fluxes in the entire snowpack and received more net radiation between january and april resulting in earlier snowmelt at these locations similar to results found in both alpine lópez moreno et al 2013 and previous rain snow transition kormos et al 2014a analyses net radiation increased on north facing slopes and at drift locations later in the year april june and continued to increase into the summer months june july we expected that turbulent heat fluxes would affect johnston draw s snowpack throughout the catchment regardless of elevation and aspect since sensible and latent heat fluxes are known to affect snowmelt across various alpine hartman et al 1999 prowse and owens 1982 moore and owens 1984 and grassland sites yang et al 1999 however in johnston draw sensible heat fluxes were consistently more positive i e energy entering the snowpack at higher elevations whereas latent heat fluxes were more pronounced i e more negative or more positive at high elevations compared to mid and low elevations fig 5d e these turbulent flux patterns suggest larger variations at locally higher elevations likely due to higher wind speeds which might be expected in an area that includes both snow drifts and scour zones consistent with schlögl et al 2018 the variation of the surface energy fluxes particularly turbulent fluxes was larger within modeled complex terrain than for an idealized flat lower elevation test site we did not see obvious seasonal differences in turbulent fluxes across aspects but we did see differences at drift locations fig 5d e finally spatial differences in snowpack thickness greatly influenced the subsequent timing of swi generation especially the fraction derived from snowmelt because thicker snowpacks had a greater cold content than shallower snowpacks in johnston draw in turn these areas required more energy to induce snowmelt delaying the generation of snowmelt until later in the year similar to musselman et al 2017 our results show that relatively consistent spatial cold content and energy balance patterns persisted throughout all snow covered seasons in both water years until only isothermal snow remained on north facing slopes and at drift locations figs 5f and s2f the increased snowpack depth in johnston draw was a result of redistributed snowfall due to wind creating spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the snowpack and its energy balance and subsequently swi derived from snowmelt winstral et al 2013 without the redistribution of snowfall cold content of the snowpack and snowmelt timing would be markedly less variable across johnston draw under predicted warming the spatial heterogeneity of swi will decrease due to decreased snowfall and thus decreased precipitation redistribution which will lead to decreased thickness and cold content of the catchment snowpack mote et al 2005 2018 musselman et al 2017 these potential changes to the snowpack will increase sensitivity to energy balance variables and will induce snowmelt earlier in the water year musselman et al 2017 2021 a change from the historical temporal patterns of swi in the catchment will ultimately change the timing of water availability that feeds downstream water needs and users mote et al 2005 2018 increasing water stress later in the season knowles et al 2015 thus capturing energy balance effects on swi patterns across multiple years and at the rain snow transition zone is critical now and in the future as local and regional snowpacks become more sensitive and are subject to warming and increased interannual variability mote et al 2005 2018 4 2 drivers of swi during ros events the rain snow transition zone is by nature susceptible to ros events due to its location near the winter snowline kormos et al 2014b depending on the temperature and the amount and intensity of rainfall onto the snowpack large volumes of the snowpack might melt rapidly and in some situations generate considerable fluxes of water beniston and stoffel 2016 the amount of excess swi produced during the ros events in johnston draw in 2011 and 2014 was small maximum 7 mm or 1 of annual swi table 4 in johnston draw and consistent with previous work the development of a ripe snowpack was on average an important factor for excess swi generation during ros events julander and clayton 2018 jennings and jones 2015 exceptions to this averaged relationship included ros events where initial conditions may have played a compounding role in excess swi generation e g initial snow covered area initial swe snow fraction of event higher excess swi often occurred with a higher snow covered area at the beginning of the ros event 35 and 65 of the catchment was covered in snow prior to the two ros events where 5 mm of excess swi was produced table 4 the remainder of the catchment experienced precipitation onto bare ground finally after peak swe the snowpack present during ros events was warmer contained more liquid water and generated more excess swi thus while initial snowpack conditions including the initial amount of swe and the snow covered area did not correlate strongly with swi or excess swi generation these variables were significantly related to the swi centroid of each ros event in johnston draw upwards of 25 of total annual swi was generated during the ros events which came from 10 to 100 of the catchment from both snow covered and non snow covered grid cells table 4 south facing slopes generated most of the swi as both rainfall and snowmelt during ros events before peak swe where the remaining snowpack on this aspect was often near 0 c and thus susceptible to melting with added advected energy north facing slopes generated most of the swi as both rainfall and snowmelt during ros events after peak swe as the snowpack on this aspect persisted later in the year allowing for increased snowmelt i e additional swi production beyond the event precipitation during these events in addition after peak swe snow was often no longer present on south facing slopes and thus only swi as rainfall was generated on snow free aspects unlike the annual and seasonal swi analyses during most ros events snow drifts did not produce substantial swi since the deeper drifts had a greater cold content and were thus less vulnerable to melt in most rainfall events the shallower non drift locations which produced less swi at the annual scale produced more swi at the ros event scale the increased response time between rainfall and swi production and higher snowpack depths is consistent with past work in both alpine and sub alpine regions jennings and jones 2015 marks et al 2001 würzer et al 2016 the transient nature of the rain snow transition zone suggests that in low and mid elevation mountain catchments like johnston draw the snowpack may completely ablate multiple times per winter season making the timing of excess swi production less predictable and potentially more frequent despite lower water storage in the snowpack this may be especially true under future warming conditions when the number of ros events is expected to increase by close to 50 in mountain and alpine catchments beniston and stoffel 2016 and as warming becomes of greater concern in present day ros events have already begun to increase in montane regions barnett et al 2005 freudiger et al 2014 gergel et al 2017 finally though other studies have found that precipitation intensity and event magnitude are important drivers of snowmelt generation during ros events they were not critical drivers of excess swi production in johnston draw and while rainfall event totals were much lower than peak intensities in other works e g beniston and stoffel 2016 to investigate rainfall thresholds at which more excess swi may be generated in johnston draw more years more meteorological variables e g wind humidity and air temperature and more ros events should be considered 4 3 assumptions and implications 4 3 1 assumptions the assumptions underlying the interpolation methods employed by the awsm isnobal model have critical implications for the precipitation and swi analyses here particularly when snowfall occurred this model was chosen because it is a high resolution e g 10 100 m physics based spatially distributed model that explicitly simulates swi the hydrologic variable of interest havens et al 2020 precipitation interpolation within awsm was based on an elevation gradient that led to more precipitation both snowfall and rainfall at higher elevations because snowfall inputs were rescaled using snow depths from the same lidar observation small differences between years may have been smoothed resulting in more spatially similar snowpacks between the two years further the lidar snowfall redistribution pattern representing peak snow depth from 2009 was used to rescale snowfall at all time steps of year in the model this limitation forced the assumption that snow drifts form in the same location regardless of season or event dynamics this assumption may not always be accurate leading to model uncertainty further using peak snow depth to redistribute snowfall throughout the entire snow season may overestimate the difference in snowfall between areas with deep vs shallow snowpacks in the catchment this is due to the imperfect relationship between snowfall and snow on the ground at one snapshot in time because portions of the rain snow transition zone experience intermittent melt kormos et al 2014a peak snow depth cannot capture snowfall that may have melted earlier in the year which is more likely in non drift areas thus the magnitude of differences in snow depth and thus spatially distributed swi magnitude may be exaggerated across the catchment to reduce model uncertainty of the snow distribution in johnston draw additional catchment wide lidar flights accompanied by sufficient on the ground observations of the snowpack throughout the snow season and across different years would be valuable subsequently because only small amounts of precipitation were expected to evaporate or sublimate swi strongly reflected spatial and temporal precipitation patterns model accuracy particularly of the redistribution of precipitation and thus swi throughout the two water years of interest has been shown to be robust kiewiet et al 2022 this accuracy and consistency between years reflects underlying static environmental variables e g topography and relatively consistent dynamic variables e g wind patterns that affect the distribution of precipitation and thus swi marks et al 1998 molotch et al 2011 stähli et al 1999 ultimately while the model results depend on the precipitation redistribution method this approach is justified at multiple time scales providing useful insights into the water and energy balance at the rain snow transition in both wet and dry years finally while the intent of this work was to explore differences in catchment hydrological response to different weather conditions and water inputs i e swi responses to dry and wet years modeling catchment behavior during additional water years and in response to incrementally variable inputs including phase would provide further insight to historical and potential future swi and subsequent streamflow dynamics at the rain snow transition zone 4 3 2 implications swi is the variable that most directly controls soil moisture and thus subsurface water storage seyfried et al 2009 williams et al 2009 groundwater recharge aishlin and mcnamara 2011 scanlon et al 2006 nutrient cycling schmidt and lipson 2004 and streamflow liu et al 2013 mcnamara et al 2005 moore et al 1991 the use of the awsm isnobal model generates a high resolution 10 100 m spatially distributed account of swi allowing this investigation of swi drivers in space and through time swi varied over one catchment in this work and was generated from different locations in the catchment during different seasons and ros events depending on the local water and energy balance fluxes modeling and understanding the drivers of swi on multiple temporal scales suggests that in the rain snow transition zone as snowfall continues to decrease in a warming climate redistribution of snowfall might also decrease resulting in earlier snowmelt musselman et al 2017 badger et al 2021 in turn earlier snowmelt will result in more swi earlier in the year and less swi later in the year hale et al 2022 potentially inducing water stress and differences in seasonal plant water use if there is no summer rainfall to compensate mcnamara et al 2005 wieder et al 2022 these deductions apply to both wet and dry water years where the water and energy sensitivities at the rain snow transition were similar across aspects and elevations regardless of annual and seasonal precipitation magnitude thus similar patterns in catchment responses to changes in climate may be expected in both wet and dry years the model allowed for a close examination of snow drifts features strongly affecting swi distribution in most catchments receiving snowfall in the mountainous western us ikeda et al 2021 we show that this importance extends to the rain snow transition zone even though most snowpacks in this zone are relatively shallow and transient our results illuminate the importance of capturing snow drift formation in catchments to accurately capture the timing of catchment swi and its origin across all temporal scales consistent with similar work done in a nearby snow dominated catchment luce et al 1998 as well as in other regions e g brauchli et al 2017 yet in the rain snow transition zone in particular previous analyses focused more on aspect controls than snow drifting and elevation controls on swi kormos et al 2014a 2018 additional works targeting swi have not represented drifts due to model choice or spatial resolutions or have represented drifts using a drift factor chauvin et al 2011 liu et al 2013 luce 1998 our work suggests that drifts even in the rain snow transition zone are important in this region because they drive a strong relationship between annual precipitation and annual swi fig 4a and c modulate swi generation at seasonal timeframes and ros events create more heterogeneous swe patterns across elevation bands via scour and deposition fig 4b and generate a substantial proportion of annual swi in a small fraction of the catchment section 4 1 in addition to the importance of drifts in controlling the spatial and temporal patterns of swi drifts may be more sensitive to warming than the surrounding landscape marshall et al 2019a this might be especially true in mid elevation mountains and at the rain snow transition zone which is shown to be highly sensitive to increases in atmospheric temperatures and changes in the present day climate kormos et al 2014a williams et al 2009 4 4 conclusion the purpose of this work was to evaluate the spatial patterns of surface water inputs swi the summation of rainfall and snowmelt onto the soil on annual seasonal and event scales across two water years and to determine the driving forces of this primary water resource in the rain snow transition zone of the western us annually swi distribution was driven primarily by precipitation in johnston draw across both a wet and dry water year snow drifts covering approximately 3 of the catchment area generated the most swi 8 0 in wet 2011 and 6 6 in dry 2014 highlighting the importance of snow drifts in swi distribution conversely high elevation scoured areas produced the least amount of swi across the defined aspect elevation bins seasonally total energy fluxes were typically higher on the south and other facing slopes during mid winter months which coincided with early swi generation as snowmelt energy balance variables and swi production increased on north facing slopes and drift locations later in the spring and summer at the ros event scale on average more excess swi was generated during events later in the year where the snowpack was warmer and contained more liquid water and was near isothermal i e ripe and warm across ros events more snowmelt occurred in the shallow warm snowpacks before peak swe and on north facing slopes and at higher elevations after peak swe snow drifts were often too cold to produce snowmelt during ros events further demonstrating the importance of drifts as a significant regulator of swi generation as the climate continues to warm the water inputs that drive swi in the rain snow transition zone will trend toward rainfall instead of snowfall not only will the snow line shift toward higher elevations but the distribution and timing of swi generation across the catchment might also change affecting downstream streamflow dynamics and influencing the ecosystems and end

2547,in intertidal zones groundwater is often present as seepage that provides freshwater and nutrients to marine ecosystems point discharge or springs in intertidal zones have been observed in many locations often in the form of sand boils the spatial extent temporal variability and source of intertidal springs are rarely documented and typically not well understood this study examined four intertidal groundwater springs at sellicks beach south australia during may 2017 november 2019 and september 2020 using a combination of hydrogeophysical methods a thermal infrared survey undertaken in 2017 showed springs as groupings of closely spaced sand boils that were warmer 15 c than the surrounding saturated beach sediments 7 c the four springs ranged in diameter from 0 20 to 0 45 m electromagnetic geophysical surveys identified a resistive anomaly 3 5 to 5 0 ohm m assumed to represent freshwater upwelling at the location of a spring that extended 10 m horizontally and at least 6 7 m vertically the average electrical conductivity of water discharging from the springs was 18 4 ms cm while seawater was 54 8 ms cm δ18o and δ2h data from the springs showed a variation between winter and spring likely caused by variations in mixing ratios between seawater and groundwater the springs are proximal to major regional fault systems that likely create preferential flow paths that control spring location and flow rates the observations of spring characteristics highlight the critical role of seawater groundwater mixing ratios preferential flow paths and tidal variations in creating temporal variability in spring discharge and salinity keywords springs geophysics temperature stable isotopes intertidal zone data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the intertidal zone is a vital link between terrestrial and marine environments benkendorff et al 2008 that is influenced by sea level fluctuations groundwater discharge meteorological forces and sediment transport smith 1986 intertidal discharge of groundwater is an important phenomenon that shapes ecological and sedimentological processes within intertidal zones and the near shore environment miller and ullman 2004 mcallister et al 2015 for example groundwater is generally nutrient enriched compared to seawater and in many places groundwater discharge provides the primary source e g rather than surface water discharge of nutrients charette et al 2001 lee et al 2009 cave and henry 2011 liu et al 2018 and trace elements charette and sholkovitz 2006 beck et al 2007 rodellas et al 2014 to marine water bodies furthermore groundwater discharge is known to modify the geomorphology of beaches whereby high rates of groundwater discharge tend to destabilise intertidal sediments bokuniewicz et al 2008 post et al 2020 the composition of groundwater discharge within intertidal zones is typically a combination of recycled seawater that entered the subsurface during high tide and usually fresher groundwater resulting from net recharge to aquifers in inland regions moore 1999 li and barry 2000 robinson et al 2007 xin et al 2010 the main processes that control groundwater discharge within intertidal zones include the subsurface hydraulic properties the regional aquifer hydraulic gradient water density variations between the discharging groundwater and seawater and ocean tides and waves taniguchi et al 2002 burnett et al 2003 while intertidal groundwater discharge in the form of diffuse seepage is widespread under certain circumstances localised discrete discharge features may appear dale and miller 2007 röper et al 2014 the former leads to often extensive seepage faces whereby saturated surface conditions are maintained over large areas allowing benthic aquatic organisms to survive within intertidal zones during low tides waska and kim 2011 the latter has been previously described as seeps springs boils and sand boils johannes 1980 stieglitz 2005 de louw et al 2010 moore 2010 intertidal discharge to the ground surface can occur from faults and fractures that provide preferential paths for groundwater flow taboroši et al 2013 an example of fracture controlled point discharge was analysed by el hage et al 2020 who used thermal satellite images from the lebanese coastal region to study groundwater seeps they identified point discharge zones and mapped faults and fractures to assess the possibility of using fracture controlled groundwater discharge as an alternative source of freshwater groundwater discharge through discrete flow features may lead to the ejection of sand from the subsurface e g de louw et al 2010 werner et al 2020 de louw et al 2010 described groundwater vents through which sediment is brought to the surface by the action of groundwater discharge as sand boils in the sand boils that they studied the vents arose from heave and fracturing of peat layers within dutch polders werner et al 2020 distinguished sand boils from boiling sand whereby the latter was used when the sediment surface appears as a boiling fluid of more distributed sediment movement than the isolated vents of sand boils a number of techniques have been applied previously to characterise point discharge features the most common of these methods are based on temperature and salinity variations taniguchi et al 2019 for example thermal infrared tir imaging has been used to map diffuse seepage and point discharge in coastal environments where there is a thermal contrast between groundwater and seawater e g danielescu et al 2009 mulligan and charette 2006 and duarte et al 2006 used airborne tir images to delineate the spatial variability of diffuse discharge in waquoit bay massachusetts and western hawai i respectively röper et al 2014 used ground based handheld tir imagery to detect and map the horizontal extent of intertidal springs in north western germany geochemical tracers are widely used techniques in groundwater discharge studies that provide information on the origin composition and age of groundwater aggarwal et al 2009 the radioactive isotope radon is frequently used in submarine groundwater discharge sgd investigations cable et al 1996 burnett et al 2006 povinec et al 2012 as it is often several orders of magnitude more concentrated in groundwater than in surface waters burnett and dulaiova 2006 tait et al 2013 short et al 2014 used radon measurements of the surf zone and porewater from beach sediments to characterise potential sgd along the coastline of the willunga basin in south australia from moana beach to sellicks beach their results indicated potential groundwater discharge zones along the coastline the stable isotopes of water 2h and 18o have also been used to characterise groundwater and seawater mixing terwey 1984 for example povinec et al 2006 used δ2h and δ18o data to investigate the mixing between groundwater from springs and seawater along the coast of sicily their results showed that the spring water composition consisted of up to 50 continental groundwater in coastal areas electromagnetic em geophysical methods have been applied to study the groundwater salinity variability within subsurface sediments yechieli et al 2001 schneider and kruse 2003 levi et al 2008 for example paepen et al 2020 conducted em surveys to map groundwater discharge along the coast of belgium their results identified a large zone 100 m of low bulk conductivity 3 5 to 6 5 ms cm associated with diffuse groundwater discharge and concluded that em techniques provide valuable information for intertidal groundwater discharge investigations each of the techniques described above hydrochemical and environmental tracers temperature based methods em geophysical methods offer useful insights into subsurface processes within intertidal zones however these methods are more usually adapted in combination rather than in isolation due to limitations in their spatial and temporal resolution and in the information content of each e g stieglitz 2005 swarzenski and izbicki 2009 this way valuable information of point discharge features can be obtained to determine their spatial extent geometry water quality and mixing patterns within dynamic intertidal zones the aim of this study was to characterise intertidal springs discharging from a structurally complex coastal multi aquifer system located in sellicks beach south australia fig 1 shows an example of the springs targeted in this research the methodology applied in this investigation aimed to evaluate their spatial distribution extent temporal variability origins and groundwater seawater mixing patterns a combination of near surface em geophysical techniques stable isotopes 2h and 18o

coastal cliffs fig 3 which have experienced significant erosion deep gullying and rotational slumping creating a series of alluvial fan sediments and platforms bourman et al 2016 in a study by may and bourman 1984 they identified in the southern area of the beach an extensive platform of the pwf that outcrops within the intertidal zone and that contributes to concentrated marine erosion of the cliffs sediments at the beach consist of sand and gravels with seasonal variations in sediment transport leading to geomorphic changes in the beach profile and sediment distribution for example cann et al 2014 observed that in summer the volume of sand is greater compared to winter when higher wave energy exposes the pwf platform leaving gravels and sand visible only in narrow areas along the beach at low tide they also established that the cobble size gravels originate from the neoproterozoic and cambrian rocks outcropping nearby and are transported to the beach by coastal erosion as well

and d were identified while in november 2019 southern hemisphere late spring only two springs were identified springs e and f and september 2020 southern hemisphere early spring only spring g was observed the diameter of the sand boils within the springs also showed distinct differences between field campaigns for example the sand boil within spring f november 2019 fig 1 had an average diameter of 0 1 m while the sand boils from the observed springs identified in the 2017 and 2020 campaigns were considerably smaller with an average diameter of 0 01 m the thickness of the sand layer measured in the 2020 campaign varied from 0 82 m to 0 38 m east west decreasing towards the sea and from 0 45 m to 0 64 m north south particularly the sand thickness at the location of springs a b c d e and f was 0 43 0 41 0 54 0 70 0 69 and 0 45 m respectively 4 2 em geophysical survey the data from the em geophysical survey showed the spatial variability in the resistivity of the subsurface around spring d to a depth of 6 7 m based on the transmitter and receiver separations of the cmd instrument fig 5 the 2 2 m depth slice of the inverted resistivity data shows a central more resistive anomaly 10 12 m of about 5 ohm m compared to the surrounding material located directly beneath the visible surface expression of spring d this central anomaly represents spring discharge of groundwater from the saturated sand and sediments of the underlying pwf the eastern boundary up against the base of the pwf cliffs has resistivity values of 2 0 ohm m and is influenced by an increase in thickness of unsaturated beach sediments including the existence of gravels and boulders to the north and south along the beach of the central anomaly there are resistivity values of 1 5 ohm m associated with seawater saturated sand and pwf sediments the depth slice at 4 2 m depth shows a similar spatial distribution of resistivity values as the shallow layer at 2 2 m depth meanwhile the depth slice at 6 7 m depth shows that the size of the resistivity anomaly is influenced by spring d and increased by 5 m along the length of the western boundary seawards transect line l6 parallel to the coastline shows that the resistive anomaly 5 ohm m located below the surface expression of spring d is present across the vertical extent of the depth profile fig 6 low resistivity 1 5 ohm m zones in the north and south of the profile associated to the seawater saturated sand and pwf sediments extend from the surface to 3 m below the ground in particular a low resistivity feature 1 0 ohm m is present across the profile north south at 0 5 m below the ground level and correlates with the average sand thickness measured in the area 4 3 tir mapping survey the ground based tir mapping was used to identify discrete groundwater discharge features that were not visible to the naked eye during the daytime fig 7 specifically this method detected three additional springs in the vicinity of spring d springs a b and c fig 4 at night during the may 2017 campaign the approximate diameter of springs a d ranged from 0 20 to 0 45 m based on the thermal imagery and where the temperature changed from 7 to 19 c the size of the sand boils within the springs had diameters ranging from 0 005 to 0 15 m the temperature of the springs 19 c was distinctively higher than the adjacent seawater and saturated sand 7 c and the measured ambient air temperature 10 c the heat map showed that the flow direction of the springs followed the downward slope of the beach towards the sea the temperature of the springs detected with the thermal camera was similar to the measured average temperature 21 2 c of the discharging water in spring d using the multi parameter probe at low tide table 1 temperature data from regional groundwater and the springs was higher compared to seawater and ambient air average groundwater temperature from the qa and pwf aquifers was 18 c and 23 4 c respectively whereas average groundwater temperature from the deeper ms and br aquifers was 21 c and 22 8 c respectively table 1 4 4 ec ph and stable isotopes of water ec measure of salinity ph δ18o and δ2h data from the springs seawater and regional groundwater from the willunga basin are given in table 1 there was significant variability in the ec between sampling campaigns and the four major springs spring d 2017 campaign had an average ec value of 24 8 ms cm at low tide whilst at mid to high tide the ec was 47 3 ms cm at low tide the average ec recorded in springs e and f 2019 campaign was 16 7 ms cm whereas spring g 2020 campaign had a lower average ec of 13 1 ms cm at low tide in comparison the measured average seawater ec was 56 ms cm during the 2017 campaign whereas during the 2020 campaign it was 54 4 ms cm average salinity values from regional groundwater from the qa and pwf aquifers see fig 2 for well locations was 15 7 ms cm and 3 95 ms cm respectively whereas average salinity values from the deeper ms and br aquifers see fig 2 was 2 3 ms cm and 5 16 ms cm respectively in the 2017 field campaign spring d had an average ph at low tide and mid high tide of 7 2 and 7 6 respectively springs e and f 2019 campaign had an average ph of 6 9 and spring g 2020 campaign had the lowest average ph 6 8 at low tide the average seawater ph of the 2017 and 2020 field campaigns only varied between 7 7 and 7 8 average ph values from four observation wells in each of the regional qa pwf ms and br aquifers were 7 8 7 4 6 7 and 7 2 respectively ncris groundwater database 2022 overall the recorded ph in the springs from the three field campaigns was lower than in the adjacent seawater samples collected over the mid and high tide periods showed increasing ph which corresponded with increases in salinity rainfall isotope data from may 2017 were obtained from the australian global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip for adelaide bom station 94672 bureau of meteorology 2020 and plot adjacent to the adelaide local meteoric water line lmwl and varied from δ2h 3 5 to 5 3 and δ18o from 12 4 to 24 8 fig 8 regional groundwater samples from the qa aquifer see fig 2 for locations had δ2h values that ranged from 21 6 to 20 7 and δ18o values that ranged from 4 6 to 4 2 in contrast groundwater from the pwf aquifer showed relatively more depleted δ2h and δ18o values ranging from 23 6 to 20 2 and from 4 7 to 4 1 respectively δ2h and δ18o samples from the deeper aquifers the ms and br were more depleted than the overlying pwf and qa aquifers varying from 26 6 to 30 6 and from 5 5 to 4 9 respectively the δ18o and δ2h values of the springs fall to the right of the lmwl with δ2h varying from 20 5 to 6 3 and δ18o from 3 6 to 1 0 for spring d 2017 campaign fig 8 depleted values from spring d were identified at low tide periods δ2h 20 5 and δ18o 3 6 while more enriched δ2h and δ18o values δ2h 6 3 and δ18o 1 0 were recorded during mid to high tide indicating likely mixing with seawater which had average δ2h and δ18o values of 4 3 and 0 8 respectively δ18o and δ2h data from the 2019 field campaign showed depleted values at low tide for spring e and f with δ2h varying from 21 8 to 21 4 and δ18o from 3 9 to 3 8 at low tide average δ2h and δ18o data from spring g 2020 campaign was more depleted 24 9 and 4 4 respectively than the 2017 and 2019 samples while average δ2h and δ18o from seawater 2020 campaign was 5 5 and 0 9 respectively the proportion of regional groundwater gw and seawater sw mixing at spring d was approximated using a simple binary mixing approach table 2 mixing calculations using average δ18o values from spring d at low tide from the 2017 campaign 2 8 pwf 4 6 and seawater 0 9 end members showed that spring discharge was comprised of approximately 67 groundwater pwf at high tide the more enriched average δ18o 1 0 values from spring d showed a high proportion of seawater 86 and lower groundwater contribution 14 mixing calculations for springs e and f november 2019 using average δ18o 3 8 at low tide resulted in a similarly high proportion of groundwater contribution 86 at the springs mixing calculations using average δ18o data from spring g 2020 campaign at low tide 4 4 also showed high groundwater contribution 97 to the spring mixture additional mixing calculations using δ2h and ec data indicate that δ2h data tends to overestimate the groundwater contribution to the springs compared to calculations based on δ18o and ec table 2 the gw sw mixing processes of the springs are presented in the ec vs δ2h plot fig 9 there are two well distinguished groups of samples represented at the left side of the plot by regional gw average δ2h and ec values of 24 8 and 6 0 ms cm respectively and on the right by the sw end member average δ2h values of 4 3 and average ec of 56 6 ms cm the average δ18o and δ2h composition of the springs 3 7 and 20 7 respectively was similar to both the isotopic signature of the nearby qa δ18o 4 5 and δ2h 21 2 and pwf aquifers δ18o 4 6 and δ2h 21 7 but significantly differed from the composition of the ms δ18o 5 2 and δ2h 29 2 and br δ18o 5 1 and δ2h 28 1 aquifers our mixing processes analysis fig 9 shows that the isotopic values of the springs more closely resemble those of the upper aquifers qa and pwf rather than the deeper ms and br aquifers which show isotopic signatures that are more depleted these results indicate that the gw contribution most likely originates from the upper aquifers rather than the ms and br aquifers however given that there is no major difference in their isotopic composition we cannot accurately determine which aquifer is the main supplier of fresh gw to the springs 4 5 time series water level observations time series water level observations from the shallow piezometer installed in spring d together with measured sea levels offshore from the study site for the may 2017 field campaign are shown in fig 10 over the field campaign period sea level reached its maximum at 1 0 m ahd at high tide and then decreased to 0 4 m ahd at low tide during high tide periods spring d was fully inundated by seawater analysis of the measured sea and water levels over the 4 days of monitoring showed that the spring response to tidal sinusoidal oscillations varies asymmetrically at the location of spring d and that spring water levels are dependent on tidal range between 0 65 m ahd high tide to 0 46 m ahd low tide time series measurements of ec at spring d also showed a change in salinity with the tidal cycle fig 10c during high tide periods the average salinity was 44 ms cm compared to low tide where the salinity of spring d reached its minimum of 1 89 ms cm the time series ec results were consistent with measurements that were taken with a handheld ysi ec meter where a maximum ec of 55 8 ms cm was recorded during or shortly after high tide and a minimum ec of 20 2 ms cm observed during low tide periods these salinity fluctuations with time show the influence of mixing seawater at the spring where increasing salinity correlated to high tide periods when spring d was inundated by seawater over the measurement period a time lag in the change in salinity at spring d was occasionally observed for example on may 24 the high tide was recorded at 15 39 while the highest ec 53 3 ms cm was recorded at 19 38 3 h later fig 10 the average water temperature of spring d was 18 4 c with a maximum value of 20 7 c recorded at low tide and minimum of 16 8 c during high tide fig 10b in comparison handheld measurements using tir imagery at low tide showed average spring temperature values of 21 3 c and seawater of 19 4 c the presence of seawater during high tide periods was represented by low temperature values 17 c while daytime observations at low tide i e 23 05 17 11 00 showed increased temperatures values 20 c overall these early winter transient temperature patterns seemed to be influenced by the interaction of ocean tides and solar radiation 5 discussion 5 1 spring and sand boils observations results from the intertidal observations undertaken by this study during the three field campaigns may 2017 nov 2019 and sept 2020 demonstrated the seasonal variability of the surface expression of the sellicks beach springs from visual observations the largest spring spring f fig 1 with an approximate diameter of 0 50 m was identified in the late spring campaign nov 2019 the diameter of the sand boils within spring f were identified as the largest throughout this study 0 1 m in the winter campaign may 2017 spring a was identified at night with the tir camera and had an approximate diameter of 0 30 m however the diameter of the sand boils within spring a were significantly smaller 0 01 m compared to spring f given the close proximity between the locations of springs a and f 1 5 m fig 4 the continual changes in the geomorphology of the beach and the sand deposition these two springs are considered to be the same spring nevertheless the internal mechanisms that control the surface characteristics of the sand boils e g sand boil diameter within the springs should be considered in future studies at sellicks beach previous studies have identified that the pwf cliffs and platforms have experienced significant erosion may and bourman 1984 bourman et al 2016 particularly cann et al 2014 conducted field observations at sellicks beach for over forty years and described the erosion and distribution of beach sediments at sellicks beach they attributed the origin and transport of the gravels located at the high tide level of the beach to coastal and rainfall erosion of the alluvial fan sediments and the pwf cliffs fig 3 they concluded that sediment transport along sellicks beach is predominantly influenced by seasonal changes specifically longshore sediment transport occurs during wintertime when wave energy is high these seasonal erosion and sediment transport mechanisms are likely to influence the surface expression of the intertidal springs for example the seasonal variation of sand thickness that overlays the pwf rocks can provide distinctive preferential flow paths and may be a controlling factor of the temporal changes of the location and occurrence of the springs and sand boils 5 2 structural controls on spring discharge previous studies that focused on groundwater discharge to the sea from the willunga basin martin 1998 lamontagne et al 2008 suggested diffuse discharge along the coastline however this study demonstrated that discrete discharge from the basin can also occur as intertidal springs the reason for the occurrence of this point discharge seems to be structural and linked to the faults and fractures identified in the area associated with neotectonic activity jayawardena 2013 lubiniecki et al 2019 the nearby outcropping willunga fault is a clear example of the structural complexity at sellicks beach where additional active faults deformation bands and land slumping have been identified in the port willunga formation cliffs preiss 2019 and platforms evidence documented by reed 1982 of the faults at the top of the pwf cliffs fig 2 approximately 200 m from the study site brings to mind the possibility that this set of faults can extend towards the ocean and could have a greater influence in the creation of the preferential flow paths that control the intertidal seeps further geophysical investigations can help in the mapping and detection of the faults within the intertidal zone and determine their extent towards the ocean 5 3 em geophysics the em geophysical survey provided a fast non invasive opportunity to map the intertidal zone this technique was able to identify a high resistivity anomaly 5 ohm m that correlated with the location of the visible surface expression of spring d compared to the areas where no spring was identified lower resistivity values 1 5 ohm m were detected by the cmd explorer and correlated to the presence of seawater saturated sand despite the valuable results obtained this technique has not been widely explored in highly conductive environments such as the intertidal zone as suggested by reid and howlett 2001 in highly conductive environments 10 ohm m the depth of investigation is reduced and the measured conductivity tends to underestimate real conductivity values paepen et al 2020 indicated that this limitation is the reason that this technique has not been extensively explored in intertidal environments however this study has shown that in combination with other methods e g tir imaging em geophysical techniques can provide valuable information to describe the spatial extent and geometry of intertidal springs 5 4 ec ph and stable isotopes of water intertidal spring δ18o and δ2h composition is characterised by a considerable tidal and seasonal variability isotope enrichment was observed at high tide where seawater inundates the springs additionally winter samples were more enriched compared to early late spring values water mixing calculations using average δ18o δ2h and ec data also showed seasonal variability in the winter campaign may 2017 at low tide periods the average groundwater contribution to spring discharge was 69 while during high tide periods this decreased to 15 for the late and early spring campaigns nov 2019 and september 2020 respectively the average groundwater contribution to the springs at low tide was 87 and 93 respectively these seasonal comparisons correlate to previous studies of the area that indicate that seasonal changes of seawater levels and wave energy can considerably influence the water composition of intertidal springs short et al 2014 cann et al 2014 ph values also showed seasonal variations during the spring campaign the average ph was 7 4 while for the late and early spring campaigns the ph ranged between 6 8 and 6 9 5 5 time series analysis the response observed in the water level and tidal data can be attributed to filtering processes occurring at the beach lanyon et al 1982 something which has previously been observed in estuarine settings e g carey et al 2009 in fig 10 a the flat sections in the water levels of spring d are indicative of seepage face formation at the beach whereby the head at the point of discharge levels out at an elevation close to the land surface similar patterns have been observed in other studies of intertidal zones e g turner 1993 li et al 2006 carey et al 2009 at low tide periods spring water discharge occurs in the intertidal zone because the water levels in spring d remain above seawater levels meanwhile at high tide periods tidal and wave action drive seawater to the intertidal zone where it infiltrates and mixes with groundwater causing seawater recirculation robinson et al 2007 heiss and michael 2014 6 conclusions this study aimed to characterise intertidal springs identified as groupings of closely spaced sand boils located in sellicks beach south australia to better understand groundwater surface water interactions in coastal environments the combined use of em geophysics and handheld tir imagery proved to be a reliable rapid and non invasive methodology to locate and describe the surface expressions of the intertidal springs and their spatial distribution in the subsurface δ18o and δ2h data indicated that isotope composition of the intertidal springs is characterised by a significant seasonal variability winter and spring and isotope enrichment due to groundwater seawater mixing processes and tidal variations we may conclude that water from the springs is controlled by a mixture of two main end members fresh regional groundwater and seawater with different proportions of groundwater in the mixture i e up to 100 at low tide in early spring 2020 and down to 14 at low tide in early winter 2017 however our results cannot accurately determine which aquifer is feeding the springs or if it is mainly a combined contribution due to the complex multi aquifer setting temperature time series measurements and water levels at spring d showed variations strongly driven by the tidal cycle additional handheld temperature measurements and tir imagery revealed clear contrasts between seawater spring water and the surrounding saturated sediments the presence of intertidal springs in sellicks beach is likely a result of the structurally complex nature of the area the cliffs and outcropping intertidal platforms display faults and fractures that provide preferential flow paths for groundwater flow a more comprehensive characterisation of the fractured rock system underneath the beach sand would enhance our current understanding of the source and structural geological controls of the springs future work should develop a temporal assessment of the springs to better understand their seasonal variability including spring heads and discharge also sediment transport analysis would be greatly

2547,in intertidal zones groundwater is often present as seepage that provides freshwater and nutrients to marine ecosystems point discharge or springs in intertidal zones have been observed in many locations often in the form of sand boils the spatial extent temporal variability and source of intertidal springs are rarely documented and typically not well understood this study examined four intertidal groundwater springs at sellicks beach south australia during may 2017 november 2019 and september 2020 using a combination of hydrogeophysical methods a thermal infrared survey undertaken in 2017 showed springs as groupings of closely spaced sand boils that were warmer 15 c than the surrounding saturated beach sediments 7 c the four springs ranged in diameter from 0 20 to 0 45 m electromagnetic geophysical surveys identified a resistive anomaly 3 5 to 5 0 ohm m assumed to represent freshwater upwelling at the location of a spring that extended 10 m horizontally and at least 6 7 m vertically the average electrical conductivity of water discharging from the springs was 18 4 ms cm while seawater was 54 8 ms cm δ18o and δ2h data from the springs showed a variation between winter and spring likely caused by variations in mixing ratios between seawater and groundwater the springs are proximal to major regional fault systems that likely create preferential flow paths that control spring location and flow rates the observations of spring characteristics highlight the critical role of seawater groundwater mixing ratios preferential flow paths and tidal variations in creating temporal variability in spring discharge and salinity keywords springs geophysics temperature stable isotopes intertidal zone data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the intertidal zone is a vital link between terrestrial and marine environments benkendorff et al 2008 that is influenced by sea level fluctuations groundwater discharge meteorological forces and sediment transport smith 1986 intertidal discharge of groundwater is an important phenomenon that shapes ecological and sedimentological processes within intertidal zones and the near shore environment miller and ullman 2004 mcallister et al 2015 for example groundwater is generally nutrient enriched compared to seawater and in many places groundwater discharge provides the primary source e g rather than surface water discharge of nutrients charette et al 2001 lee et al 2009 cave and henry 2011 liu et al 2018 and trace elements charette and sholkovitz 2006 beck et al 2007 rodellas et al 2014 to marine water bodies furthermore groundwater discharge is known to modify the geomorphology of beaches whereby high rates of groundwater discharge tend to destabilise intertidal sediments bokuniewicz et al 2008 post et al 2020 the composition of groundwater discharge within intertidal zones is typically a combination of recycled seawater that entered the subsurface during high tide and usually fresher groundwater resulting from net recharge to aquifers in inland regions moore 1999 li and barry 2000 robinson et al 2007 xin et al 2010 the main processes that control groundwater discharge within intertidal zones include the subsurface hydraulic properties the regional aquifer hydraulic gradient water density variations between the discharging groundwater and seawater and ocean tides and waves taniguchi et al 2002 burnett et al 2003 while intertidal groundwater discharge in the form of diffuse seepage is widespread under certain circumstances localised discrete discharge features may appear dale and miller 2007 röper et al 2014 the former leads to often extensive seepage faces whereby saturated surface conditions are maintained over large areas allowing benthic aquatic organisms to survive within intertidal zones during low tides waska and kim 2011 the latter has been previously described as seeps springs boils and sand boils johannes 1980 stieglitz 2005 de louw et al 2010 moore 2010 intertidal discharge to the ground surface can occur from faults and fractures that provide preferential paths for groundwater flow taboroši et al 2013 an example of fracture controlled point discharge was analysed by el hage et al 2020 who used thermal satellite images from the lebanese coastal region to study groundwater seeps they identified point discharge zones and mapped faults and fractures to assess the possibility of using fracture controlled groundwater discharge as an alternative source of freshwater groundwater discharge through discrete flow features may lead to the ejection of sand from the subsurface e g de louw et al 2010 werner et al 2020 de louw et al 2010 described groundwater vents through which sediment is brought to the surface by the action of groundwater discharge as sand boils in the sand boils that they studied the vents arose from heave and fracturing of peat layers within dutch polders werner et al 2020 distinguished sand boils from boiling sand whereby the latter was used when the sediment surface appears as a boiling fluid of more distributed sediment movement than the isolated vents of sand boils a number of techniques have been applied previously to characterise point discharge features the most common of these methods are based on temperature and salinity variations taniguchi et al 2019 for example thermal infrared tir imaging has been used to map diffuse seepage and point discharge in coastal environments where there is a thermal contrast between groundwater and seawater e g danielescu et al 2009 mulligan and charette 2006 and duarte et al 2006 used airborne tir images to delineate the spatial variability of diffuse discharge in waquoit bay massachusetts and western hawai i respectively röper et al 2014 used ground based handheld tir imagery to detect and map the horizontal extent of intertidal springs in north western germany geochemical tracers are widely used techniques in groundwater discharge studies that provide information on the origin composition and age of groundwater aggarwal et al 2009 the radioactive isotope radon is frequently used in submarine groundwater discharge sgd investigations cable et al 1996 burnett et al 2006 povinec et al 2012 as it is often several orders of magnitude more concentrated in groundwater than in surface waters burnett and dulaiova 2006 tait et al 2013 short et al 2014 used radon measurements of the surf zone and porewater from beach sediments to characterise potential sgd along the coastline of the willunga basin in south australia from moana beach to sellicks beach their results indicated potential groundwater discharge zones along the coastline the stable isotopes of water 2h and 18o have also been used to characterise groundwater and seawater mixing terwey 1984 for example povinec et al 2006 used δ2h and δ18o data to investigate the mixing between groundwater from springs and seawater along the coast of sicily their results showed that the spring water composition consisted of up to 50 continental groundwater in coastal areas electromagnetic em geophysical methods have been applied to study the groundwater salinity variability within subsurface sediments yechieli et al 2001 schneider and kruse 2003 levi et al 2008 for example paepen et al 2020 conducted em surveys to map groundwater discharge along the coast of belgium their results identified a large zone 100 m of low bulk conductivity 3 5 to 6 5 ms cm associated with diffuse groundwater discharge and concluded that em techniques provide valuable information for intertidal groundwater discharge investigations each of the techniques described above hydrochemical and environmental tracers temperature based methods em geophysical methods offer useful insights into subsurface processes within intertidal zones however these methods are more usually adapted in combination rather than in isolation due to limitations in their spatial and temporal resolution and in the information content of each e g stieglitz 2005 swarzenski and izbicki 2009 this way valuable information of point discharge features can be obtained to determine their spatial extent geometry water quality and mixing patterns within dynamic intertidal zones the aim of this study was to characterise intertidal springs discharging from a structurally complex coastal multi aquifer system located in sellicks beach south australia fig 1 shows an example of the springs targeted in this research the methodology applied in this investigation aimed to evaluate their spatial distribution extent temporal variability origins and groundwater seawater mixing patterns a combination of near surface em geophysical techniques stable isotopes 2h and 18o

intertidal sand boils thereby adding to the existing knowledge base of intertidal hydrological processes 2 study site the study site is located at sellicks beach in the southwest of the willunga basin approximately 46 km south of adelaide south australia fig 2 at this location there are intertidal springs that appear as groupings of sand boils at various locations above the low tide mark the

coastal cliffs fig 3 which have experienced significant erosion deep gullying and rotational slumping creating a series of alluvial fan sediments and platforms bourman et al 2016 in a study by may and bourman 1984 they identified in the southern area of the beach an extensive platform of the pwf that outcrops within the intertidal zone and that contributes to concentrated marine erosion of the cliffs sediments at the beach consist of sand and gravels with seasonal variations in sediment transport leading to geomorphic changes in the beach profile and sediment distribution for example cann et al 2014 observed that in summer the volume of sand is greater compared to winter when higher wave energy exposes the pwf platform leaving gravels and sand visible only in narrow areas along the beach at low tide they also established that the cobble size gravels originate from the neoproterozoic and cambrian rocks outcropping nearby and are transported to the beach by coastal erosion as well

willunga basin s aquifers to the sea has been described in previous studies martin 1998 lamontagne et al 2008 short et al 2014 post et al 2018 the limited groundwater monitoring along the willunga basin coastline makes it challenging to estimate groundwater discharge to the sea lamontagne et al 2008 nevertheless lamontagne et al 2008 used a flow net methodology to calculate discharge rates of 670 ml yr from the pwf and 120 ml yr from the ms aquifers short et al 2014 obtained ec and 222rn measurements of the intertidal zone and within beach sediments from part of the willunga basin coastline and found groundwater discharge to the sea to be spatially intermittent therefore lamontagne et al s 2008 assumption that groundwater discharge occurs along the entire coastline likely overestimated discharge rates to the ocean 3 methods field investigations were designed to explore the characteristics of intertidal springs and were conducted at the southern end of the sellicks beach coastline fig 2 at this location intertidal springs occur as groupings of closely spaced sand boils e g fig 1 field investigations were undertaken between 23 and 26 may 2017 14 november 2019 and 17 to 18 september 2020 in the 2017 field campaign spring d was visible during daytime and springs a b and c were visible to the naked eye only at night we speculate that changes in the beach profile e g sand thickness and tidal fluctuations may explain why springs a b and c were only observed at night and not during daylight hours average daytime low tide was 0 73 m while average night time low tide was 0 45 m bureau of meteorology 2017 further observations are required to improve the current understanding of spring temporal variability at the field site springs e and f were visible in the daytime and only during the 2019 field campaign during the 2020 field campaign spring g was visible in the daytime fig 4 additional intertidal observations from the 2020 campaign included the measurement of the thickness of the sand overlying the pwf this involved the use of a solid metal stake to determine the depth of refusal to the more competent pwf formation em geophysical measurements of the subsurface were collected at low tide over the study site using a cmd explorer instrument https www gfinstruments cz with apparent conductivity ms m measurements recorded every 1

presented as resistivity ohm m equivalent to 1 apparent conductivity s m the em survey comprised a survey grid of 20 transects which included 9 north south transects lines of 50 m length and 11 east west transects lines of 25 m fig 4 the inverted data were collated and nearest neighbour interpolation was used to create resistivity layers of the study site with the software package surfer 11 https www goldensoftware com during the may 2017 field campaign a tir mapping survey was used to evaluate the spatial distribution of the groundwater discharge from the springs within the intertidal zone the survey was conducted using a handheld flir e5 xt thermal camera with a measurement range of 20 to 400 c and measurement accuracy of 2 c the tir mapping was conducted at low tide when the springs were exposed and at night to avoid solar interference on the thermal signature of the springs the 2017 field campaign involved sampling seawater and spring d for salinity ec temperature ph and the stable isotopes of water em geophysical surveys tir mapping of the study site and water level time series measurements from a shallow piezometer installed in spring d was also undertaken during the 2019 field campaign only salinity temperature ph and the stable isotopes of water were sampled in springs e and f the 2020 field campaign involved seawater and spring g sampling for salinity temperature ph the stable isotopes of water and sand thickness measurements water samples were collected from springs d e f g and the sea using a hand pump connected to a 1 m length of flexible hosing ec ph and temperature were measured in the field using a handheld ysi multi parameter probe spring and seawater samples were obtained approximately every 12 h for 3 days during the 2017 field campaign in the 2019 campaign three spring and seawater samples were obtained at 30 min intervals during low tide spring and seawater samples were obtained approximately every 15 min for 2 days at low tide during the 2020 field campaign samples were filtered 0 45 µm and collected in 2 ml glass vials to analyse the stable isotopes of hydrogen 2h and oxygen 18o using a picarro l2130 i isotope δ18o δ2h ultra high precision isotopic water analyser picarro 2020 results are reported against the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow in per mil using delta δ notation a shallow polyvinyl chloride pvc piezometer was installed in spring d see fig 4 to a depth of 0 76 m and protruded to a height of 0 5 m above ground the piezometer had a 0 1 m long slotted screen and was equipped with an in situ aqua troll 200 datalogger to record temperature pressure and ec at 1 minute intervals from 23 to 26 may 2017 due to the location of the spring in the intertidal zone seawater entered the piezometer during high tide periods another in situ aqua troll 200 datalogger was deployed offshore of the study site to measure the tidal fluctuations during the 2017 field campaign 4 results 4 1 spring observations the physical location and size of the springs within the intertidal zone of sellicks beach changed between the three field campaigns in may 2017 southern hemisphere winter four springs springs a b c and d were identified while in november 2019 southern hemisphere late spring only two springs were identified springs e and f and september 2020 southern hemisphere early spring only spring g was observed the diameter of the sand boils within the springs also showed distinct differences between field campaigns for example the sand boil within spring f november 2019 fig 1 had an average diameter of 0 1 m while the sand boils from the observed springs identified in the 2017 and 2020 campaigns were considerably smaller with an average diameter of 0 01 m the thickness of the sand layer measured in the 2020 campaign varied from 0 82 m to 0 38 m east west decreasing towards the sea and from 0 45 m to 0 64 m north south particularly the sand thickness at the location of springs a b c d e and f was 0 43 0 41 0 54 0 70 0 69 and 0 45 m respectively 4 2 em geophysical survey the data from the em geophysical survey showed the spatial variability in the resistivity of the subsurface around spring d to a depth of 6 7 m based on the transmitter and receiver separations of the cmd instrument fig 5 the 2 2 m depth slice of the inverted resistivity data shows a central more resistive anomaly 10 12 m of about 5 ohm m compared to the surrounding material located directly beneath the visible surface expression of spring d this central anomaly represents spring discharge of groundwater from the saturated sand and sediments of the underlying pwf the eastern boundary up against the base of the pwf cliffs has resistivity values of 2 0 ohm m and is influenced by an increase in thickness of unsaturated beach sediments including the existence of gravels and boulders to the north and south along the beach of the central anomaly there are resistivity values of 1 5 ohm m associated with seawater saturated sand and pwf sediments the depth slice at 4 2 m depth shows a similar spatial distribution of resistivity values as the shallow layer at 2 2 m depth meanwhile the depth slice at 6 7 m depth shows that the size of the resistivity anomaly is influenced by spring d and increased by 5 m along the length of the western boundary seawards transect line l6 parallel to the coastline shows that the resistive anomaly 5 ohm m located below the surface expression of spring d is present across the vertical extent of the depth profile fig 6 low resistivity 1 5 ohm m zones in the north and south of the profile associated to the seawater saturated sand and pwf sediments extend from the surface to 3 m below the ground in particular a low resistivity feature 1 0 ohm m is present across the profile north south at 0 5 m below the ground level and correlates with the average sand thickness measured in the area 4 3 tir mapping survey the ground based tir mapping was used to identify discrete groundwater discharge features that were not visible to the naked eye during the daytime fig 7 specifically this method detected three additional springs in the vicinity of spring d springs a b and c fig 4 at night during the may 2017 campaign the approximate diameter of springs a d ranged from 0 20 to 0 45 m based on the thermal imagery and where the temperature changed from 7 to 19 c the size of the sand boils within the springs had diameters ranging from 0 005 to 0 15 m the temperature of the springs 19 c was distinctively higher than the adjacent seawater and saturated sand 7 c and the measured ambient air temperature 10 c the heat map showed that the flow direction of the springs followed the downward slope of the beach towards the sea the temperature of the springs detected with the thermal camera was similar to the measured average temperature 21 2 c of the discharging water in spring d using the multi parameter probe at low tide table 1 temperature data from regional groundwater and the springs was higher compared to seawater and ambient air average groundwater temperature from the qa and pwf aquifers was 18 c and 23 4 c respectively whereas average groundwater temperature from the deeper ms and br aquifers was 21 c and 22 8 c respectively table 1 4 4 ec ph and stable isotopes of water ec measure of salinity ph δ18o and δ2h data from the springs seawater and regional groundwater from the willunga basin are given in table 1 there was significant variability in the ec between sampling campaigns and the four major springs spring d 2017 campaign had an average ec value of 24 8 ms cm at low tide whilst at mid to high tide the ec was 47 3 ms cm at low tide the average ec recorded in springs e and f 2019 campaign was 16 7 ms cm whereas spring g 2020 campaign had a lower average ec of 13 1 ms cm at low tide in comparison the measured average seawater ec was 56 ms cm during the 2017 campaign whereas during the 2020 campaign it was 54 4 ms cm average salinity values from regional groundwater from the qa and pwf aquifers see fig 2 for well locations was 15 7 ms cm and 3 95 ms cm respectively whereas average salinity values from the deeper ms and br aquifers see fig 2 was 2 3 ms cm and 5 16 ms cm respectively in the 2017 field campaign spring d had an average ph at low tide and mid high tide of 7 2 and 7 6 respectively springs e and f 2019 campaign had an average ph of 6 9 and spring g 2020 campaign had the lowest average ph 6 8 at low tide the average seawater ph of the 2017 and 2020 field campaigns only varied between 7 7 and 7 8 average ph values from four observation wells in each of the regional qa pwf ms and br aquifers were 7 8 7 4 6 7 and 7 2 respectively ncris groundwater database 2022 overall the recorded ph in the springs from the three field campaigns was lower than in the adjacent seawater samples collected over the mid and high tide periods showed increasing ph which corresponded with increases in salinity rainfall isotope data from may 2017 were obtained from the australian global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip for adelaide bom station 94672 bureau of meteorology 2020 and plot adjacent to the adelaide local meteoric water line lmwl and varied from δ2h 3 5 to 5 3 and δ18o from 12 4 to 24 8 fig 8 regional groundwater samples from the qa aquifer see fig 2 for locations had δ2h values that ranged from 21 6 to 20 7 and δ18o values that ranged from 4 6 to 4 2 in contrast groundwater from the pwf aquifer showed relatively more depleted δ2h and δ18o values ranging from 23 6 to 20 2 and from 4 7 to 4 1 respectively δ2h and δ18o samples from the deeper aquifers the ms and br were more depleted than the overlying pwf and qa aquifers varying from 26 6 to 30 6 and from 5 5 to 4 9 respectively the δ18o and δ2h values of the springs fall to the right of the lmwl with δ2h varying from 20 5 to 6 3 and δ18o from 3 6 to 1 0 for spring d 2017 campaign fig 8 depleted values from spring d were identified at low tide periods δ2h 20 5 and δ18o 3 6 while more enriched δ2h and δ18o values δ2h 6 3 and δ18o 1 0 were recorded during mid to high tide indicating likely mixing with seawater which had average δ2h and δ18o values of 4 3 and 0 8 respectively δ18o and δ2h data from the 2019 field campaign showed depleted values at low tide for spring e and f with δ2h varying from 21 8 to 21 4 and δ18o from 3 9 to 3 8 at low tide average δ2h and δ18o data from spring g 2020 campaign was more depleted 24 9 and 4 4 respectively than the 2017 and 2019 samples while average δ2h and δ18o from seawater 2020 campaign was 5 5 and 0 9 respectively the proportion of regional groundwater gw and seawater sw mixing at spring d was approximated using a simple binary mixing approach table 2 mixing calculations using average δ18o values from spring d at low tide from the 2017 campaign 2 8 pwf 4 6 and seawater 0 9 end members showed that spring discharge was comprised of approximately 67 groundwater pwf at high tide the more enriched average δ18o 1 0 values from spring d showed a high proportion of seawater 86 and lower groundwater contribution 14 mixing calculations for springs e and f november 2019 using average δ18o 3 8 at low tide resulted in a similarly high proportion of groundwater contribution 86 at the springs mixing calculations using average δ18o data from spring g 2020 campaign at low tide 4 4 also showed high groundwater contribution 97 to the spring mixture additional mixing calculations using δ2h and ec data indicate that δ2h data tends to overestimate the groundwater contribution to the springs compared to calculations based on δ18o and ec table 2 the gw sw mixing processes of the springs are presented in the ec vs δ2h plot fig 9 there are two well distinguished groups of samples represented at the left side of the plot by regional gw average δ2h and ec values of 24 8 and 6 0 ms cm respectively and on the right by the sw end member average δ2h values of 4 3 and average ec of 56 6 ms cm the average δ18o and δ2h composition of the springs 3 7 and 20 7 respectively was similar to both the isotopic signature of the nearby qa δ18o 4 5 and δ2h 21 2 and pwf aquifers δ18o 4 6 and δ2h 21 7 but significantly differed from the composition of the ms δ18o 5 2 and δ2h 29 2 and br δ18o 5 1 and δ2h 28 1 aquifers our mixing processes analysis fig 9 shows that the isotopic values of the springs more closely resemble those of the upper aquifers qa and pwf rather than the deeper ms and br aquifers which show isotopic signatures that are more depleted these results indicate that the gw contribution most likely originates from the upper aquifers rather than the ms and br aquifers however given that there is no major difference in their isotopic composition we cannot accurately determine which aquifer is the main supplier of fresh gw to the springs 4 5 time series water level observations time series water level observations from the shallow piezometer installed in spring d together with measured sea levels offshore from the study site for the may 2017 field campaign are shown in fig 10 over the field campaign period sea level reached its maximum at 1 0 m ahd at high tide and then decreased to 0 4 m ahd at low tide during high tide periods spring d was fully inundated by seawater analysis of the measured sea and water levels over the 4 days of monitoring showed that the spring response to tidal sinusoidal oscillations varies asymmetrically at the location of spring d and that spring water levels are dependent on tidal range between 0 65 m ahd high tide to 0 46 m ahd low tide time series measurements of ec at spring d also showed a change in salinity with the tidal cycle fig 10c during high tide periods the average salinity was 44 ms cm compared to low tide where the salinity of spring d reached its minimum of 1 89 ms cm the time series ec results were consistent with measurements that were taken with a handheld ysi ec meter where a maximum ec of 55 8 ms cm was recorded during or shortly after high tide and a minimum ec of 20 2 ms cm observed during low tide periods these salinity fluctuations with time show the influence of mixing seawater at the spring where increasing salinity correlated to high tide periods when spring d was inundated by seawater over the measurement period a time lag in the change in salinity at spring d was occasionally observed for example on may 24 the high tide was recorded at 15 39 while the highest ec 53 3 ms cm was recorded at 19 38 3 h later fig 10 the average water temperature of spring d was 18 4 c with a maximum value of 20 7 c recorded at low tide and minimum of 16 8 c during high tide fig 10b in comparison handheld measurements using tir imagery at low tide showed average spring temperature values of 21 3 c and seawater of 19 4 c the presence of seawater during high tide periods was represented by low temperature values 17 c while daytime observations at low tide i e 23 05 17 11 00 showed increased temperatures values 20 c overall these early winter transient temperature patterns seemed to be influenced by the interaction of ocean tides and solar radiation 5 discussion 5 1 spring and sand boils observations results from the intertidal observations undertaken by this study during the three field campaigns may 2017 nov 2019 and sept 2020 demonstrated the seasonal variability of the surface expression of the sellicks beach springs from visual observations the largest spring spring f fig 1 with an approximate diameter of 0 50 m was identified in the late spring campaign nov 2019 the diameter of the sand boils within spring f were identified as the largest throughout this study 0 1 m in the winter campaign may 2017 spring a was identified at night with the tir camera and had an approximate diameter of 0 30 m however the diameter of the sand boils within spring a were significantly smaller 0 01 m compared to spring f given the close proximity between the locations of springs a and f 1 5 m fig 4 the continual changes in the geomorphology of the beach and the sand deposition these two springs are considered to be the same spring nevertheless the internal mechanisms that control the surface characteristics of the sand boils e g sand boil diameter within the springs should be considered in future studies at sellicks beach previous studies have identified that the pwf cliffs and platforms have experienced significant erosion may and bourman 1984 bourman et al 2016 particularly cann et al 2014 conducted field observations at sellicks beach for over forty years and described the erosion and distribution of beach sediments at sellicks beach they attributed the origin and transport of the gravels located at the high tide level of the beach to coastal and rainfall erosion of the alluvial fan sediments and the pwf cliffs fig 3 they concluded that sediment transport along sellicks beach is predominantly influenced by seasonal changes specifically longshore sediment transport occurs during wintertime when wave energy is high these seasonal erosion and sediment transport mechanisms are likely to influence the surface expression of the intertidal springs for example the seasonal variation of sand thickness that overlays the pwf rocks can provide distinctive preferential flow paths and may be a controlling factor of the temporal changes of the location and occurrence of the springs and sand boils 5 2 structural controls on spring discharge previous studies that focused on groundwater discharge to the sea from the willunga basin martin 1998 lamontagne et al 2008 suggested diffuse discharge along the coastline however this study demonstrated that discrete discharge from the basin can also occur as intertidal springs the reason for the occurrence of this point discharge seems to be structural and linked to the faults and fractures identified in the area associated with neotectonic activity jayawardena 2013 lubiniecki et al 2019 the nearby outcropping willunga fault is a clear example of the structural complexity at sellicks beach where additional active faults deformation bands and land slumping have been identified in the port willunga formation cliffs preiss 2019 and platforms evidence documented by reed 1982 of the faults at the top of the pwf cliffs fig 2 approximately 200 m from the study site brings to mind the possibility that this set of faults can extend towards the ocean and could have a greater influence in the creation of the preferential flow paths that control the intertidal seeps further geophysical investigations can help in the mapping and detection of the faults within the intertidal zone and determine their extent towards the ocean 5 3 em geophysics the em geophysical survey provided a fast non invasive opportunity to map the intertidal zone this technique was able to identify a high resistivity anomaly 5 ohm m that correlated with the location of the visible surface expression of spring d compared to the areas where no spring was identified lower resistivity values 1 5 ohm m were detected by the cmd explorer and correlated to the presence of seawater saturated sand despite the valuable results obtained this technique has not been widely explored in highly conductive environments such as the intertidal zone as suggested by reid and howlett 2001 in highly conductive environments 10 ohm m the depth of investigation is reduced and the measured conductivity tends to underestimate real conductivity values paepen et al 2020 indicated that this limitation is the reason that this technique has not been extensively explored in intertidal environments however this study has shown that in combination with other methods e g tir imaging em geophysical techniques can provide valuable information to describe the spatial extent and geometry of intertidal springs 5 4 ec ph and stable isotopes of water intertidal spring δ18o and δ2h composition is characterised by a considerable tidal and seasonal variability isotope enrichment was observed at high tide where seawater inundates the springs additionally winter samples were more enriched compared to early late spring values water mixing calculations using average δ18o δ2h and ec data also showed seasonal variability in the winter campaign may 2017 at low tide periods the average groundwater contribution to spring discharge was 69 while during high tide periods this decreased to 15 for the late and early spring campaigns nov 2019 and september 2020 respectively the average groundwater contribution to the springs at low tide was 87 and 93 respectively these seasonal comparisons correlate to previous studies of the area that indicate that seasonal changes of seawater levels and wave energy can considerably influence the water composition of intertidal springs short et al 2014 cann et al 2014 ph values also showed seasonal variations during the spring campaign the average ph was 7 4 while for the late and early spring campaigns the ph ranged between 6 8 and 6 9 5 5 time series analysis the response observed in the water level and tidal data can be attributed to filtering processes occurring at the beach lanyon et al 1982 something which has previously been observed in estuarine settings e g carey et al 2009 in fig 10 a the flat sections in the water levels of spring d are indicative of seepage face formation at the beach whereby the head at the point of discharge levels out at an elevation close to the land surface similar patterns have been observed in other studies of intertidal zones e g turner 1993 li et al 2006 carey et al 2009 at low tide periods spring water discharge occurs in the intertidal zone because the water levels in spring d remain above seawater levels meanwhile at high tide periods tidal and wave action drive seawater to the intertidal zone where it infiltrates and mixes with groundwater causing seawater recirculation robinson et al 2007 heiss and michael 2014 6 conclusions this study aimed to characterise intertidal springs identified as groupings of closely spaced sand boils located in sellicks beach south australia to better understand groundwater surface water interactions in coastal environments the combined use of em geophysics and handheld tir imagery proved to be a reliable rapid and non invasive methodology to locate and describe the surface expressions of the intertidal springs and their spatial distribution in the subsurface δ18o and δ2h data indicated that isotope composition of the intertidal springs is characterised by a significant seasonal variability winter and spring and isotope enrichment due to groundwater seawater mixing processes and tidal variations we may conclude that water from the springs is controlled by a mixture of two main end members fresh regional groundwater and seawater with different proportions of groundwater in the mixture i e up to 100 at low tide in early spring 2020 and down to 14 at low tide in early winter 2017 however our results cannot accurately determine which aquifer is feeding the springs or if it is mainly a combined contribution due to the complex multi aquifer setting temperature time series measurements and water levels at spring d showed variations strongly driven by the tidal cycle additional handheld temperature measurements and tir imagery revealed clear contrasts between seawater spring water and the surrounding saturated sediments the presence of intertidal springs in sellicks beach is likely a result of the structurally complex nature of the area the cliffs and outcropping intertidal platforms display faults and fractures that provide preferential flow paths for groundwater flow a more comprehensive characterisation of the fractured rock system underneath the beach sand would enhance our current understanding of the source and structural geological controls of the springs future work should develop a temporal assessment of the springs to better understand their seasonal variability including spring heads and discharge also sediment transport analysis would be greatly beneficial to characterise and understand the release of water and sediment from intertidal sand boils within springs declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

2548,this paper reviews the current knowledge of hydrological processes in chilean temperate forests which extend along western south america from latitude 29 s to 56 s this geographic region includes a diverse range of natural and planted forests and a broad sweep of vegetation edaphic topographic geologic and climatic settings which create a unique natural laboratory many local communities endangered freshwater ecosystems and downstream economic activities in chile rely on water flows from forested catchments this review aims to i provide a comprehensive overview of chilean forest hydrology to ii review prior research in forest hydrology in chile and to iii identify knowledge gaps and provide a vision for future research on forest hydrology in chile we reviewed the relation between native forests commercial plantations and other land uses on water yield and water quality from the plot to the catchment scale much of the global understanding of forests and their relationship with the water cycle is in line with the findings of the studies reviewed here streamflow from forested catchments increases after timber harvesting native forests appear to use less water than plantations and streams draining native forest yield less sediment than streams draining plantations or grassland shrublands we identified 20 key knowledge gaps such as forest groundwater systems soil plant atmosphere interactions native forest hydrology and the effect of forest management and restoration on hydrology also we found a paucity of research in the northern geographic areas and forest types 35 36 s most forest hydrology studies in chile 56 have been conducted in the southern area los rios region around 39 40 s there is limited knowledge of the geology and soils in many forested areas and how surface and groundwater are affected by changes in land cover there is an opportunity to advance our understanding using process based investigations linking field studies and modeling through the establishment of a forest hydrology science society to coordinate efforts regional and national scale land use planning might be supported our review ends with a vision to advance a cross scale collaborative effort to use new nation wide catchment scale networks long term ecosystem research lter sites to promote common and complementary techniques in these studies and to conduct transdisciplinary research to advance sound and integrated planning of forest lands in chile keywords exotic plantations chilean native forests sediment yield water yield land use planning data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction in chile forests occupy 17 7 106 ha or 23 of the country and presently comprise 3 1 106 ha of exotic plantations and 14 6 106 ha of native forests ministry of agriculture 2021 this represents about 0 4 of the more than four billion hectares of global forests food and agriculture organization 2020 approximately 278 million hectares of which are commercial plantations payn et al 2015 since the mid 20th century plantation forests for wood production have profoundly changed the landscapes across all permanently inhabited continents the current land cover of central chile is the result of a long history of food and wood production in both the pre and post columbian periods the expansion of timber plantations commenced in the 1970 s mostly on the coastal mountains of central chile heilmayr et al 2016 the remaining native forests are a globally important repository for mediterranean and temperate forest species and biodiversity myers et al 2000 this is particularly true in the coastal mountains and the central valley where native forests have been fragmented by agriculture and commercial plantations of mostly pinus spp and eucalyptus spp e g miranda et al 2016 echeverría et al 2006 2008 for example from the post columbian ca 1550 to 2007 51 of native forests were lost due to land cover conversion to grassland and agriculture lara et al 2012 when plantations replace native forest cover there is concern about reduction of ecosystem services including recreation biodiversity and water supply han et al 2017 kim et al 2017 for instance a long standing debate about where forests should be located particularly on the coastal mountains originated decades ago torrejón et al 2011 cunill 1970 elizalde 1970 this debate continues but there is now an emphasis on how to locate plantations and manage native forest to maximize carbon sequestration and wood production while preserving water yield and other ecosystems services managing the trade offs between carbon sequestration wood production and water security will require an understanding of the regional relationship between forests productivity and water use in terms of water footprint and carbon sequestration capability wood stands over other structural materials see falk 2009 for wood and steel comparison water supply is the most significant concern regarding the effect of plantations and a great deal of research has been conducted to quantify the effect of commercial plantations on water yield and quality the area occupied by plantation forests is also the most densely populated region of chile armesto et al 2007 fuentealba et al 2021 creating significant pressures on the land s availability for food production timber growth and water supply the need to store carbon in this region to achieve the global needs for emissions neutrality by 2050 höhne et al 2020 will intensify pressures on this area of chile in response chile has committed to the national determined contributions ndc which included the afforestation or recovery of 200 000 ha with a minimum of 70 000 ha of native forest and 100 000 ha of permanent forests by 2030 in conservation priority areas and or in suitable sites for tree growth chilean government 2021 therefore a solid base of knowledge regarding forest hydrology and its drivers is critical to better management of land and water in chile with a future net zero emission status höhne et al 2020 commercial plantations have also been associated with a range of negative effects on a broad range of environmental values these include increased rates of evapotranspiration huber et al 1985 2008 oliveira et al 2005 oyarzún and huber 1999 reduced streamflow and water yield lara et al 2009 little et al 2009 water quality changes fierro et al 2016 2017 stream disturbances guevara cardona et al 2006 guevara et al 2018 nutrient cycling oyarzún et al 2005 2007 reduced biodiversity nahuelhual et al 2012 zhang 2012 and socio cultural and environmental issues cannell 1999 durán and barbosa 2019 among the positive effects of forests the erodibility of soils on the coastal range has been reduced by deep rooted vegetation enhancing a sustainable option represented by less intensively managed planted forests or native forests also it has been discussed the potential benefits of plantations such as the reduction of the runoff and therefore the deep percolation of water into soil pizarro et al 2022 an additional positive effect of plantations is the potential for efficient carbon sequestration white et al 2021 found that e globulus can be five times more efficient in wood production per unit of water consumed than a native

sediment and nutrient export have not been synthesized although no general review has been published some aspects have been covered in previous synthesis papers these include jofré et al 2014 who analyzed the link between forest science and policy garcía chevesich et al 2017 evaluated the link between forest management and water yield in 13 countries including chile and pizarro et al 2019 who addressed common questions regarding the effects of land use comparing exotic plantations and native forest on water supply soto schönherr and iroumé 2016 reviewed all published studies about interception losses in native forests and commercial plantations in chile finally jones et al 2017 looked at the state of forests in south america and reviewed forest science and practice in the continent while these papers recommended some research actions they were either specific to one topic or too broad to the forest hydrology research variability within chile therefore a comprehensive review with a common research vision is necessary to identify knowledge gaps for future landscape planning and forest management 1 1 objectives approach and reference framework the objectives of this review are i to provide a comprehensive overview of chilean forest hydrology to ii review prior research in forest hydrology in chile and iii to identify knowledge gaps and provide a vision for future research on forest hydrology in chile we summarize 47 years 1975 2022 of research on forest hydrology in chile with a focus on understanding the effects of land cover change from native vegetation to forest plantations and grasslands shrublands on the water cycle and sediment yield at different scales while we focused on chile we expect that this review will contribute to a global understanding of forest hydrology the review is organized as follows i chilean forest hydrology climate hydrology land cover history human impacts in water demands and climate change ii prior research in forest hydrology in chile which addresses questions and topics prevalent in the literature and among stakeholders particularly the community these questions include do forests consume more water than grassland and shrublands in chile do plantations consume more water than native forest in chile do eucalyptus plantations use more water than pinus plantations in chile how do plantations affect peak flow and low flow how does the water balance of plantations and native forest vary across the plantation management cycle how do plantations and their management affect water quality the answer to these questions form the basis for iii filling knowledge gaps and a vision for the future of chilean forest hydrology we used web of science and google scholar to find articles to include in this review using search strings including chile land cover change chile water balance chile forest hydrology chile hydrology native forest chile evapotranspiration plantations native forest and looking for terms related to runoff low flow baseflow transpiration interception throughfall and stemflow suspended sediment yield forest plantation water quality forest management sediment and water and modelling and climate change streamflow and water balance topics the studies were grouped by the main areas of consensus and questions that emerge from the global research on forest hydrology and their application in chile namely 1 forests use more water and yield less streamflow than annual pastures or dryland non irrigated and agriculture olivera guerra et al 2014 van dijk and keenan 2007 farley et al 2005 zhang et al 2001 2 exotic plantations appear to consume more water than native forest and reduce streamflow but this result is less universal than the comparison between forest and grassland or shrublands e g galleguillos et al 2021 smethurst et al 2015 3 eucalyptus plantations appear to use more water and the resulting streamflow reduction is more pronounced than that has been observed in pinus radiata plantations e g scott and lesch 1997 4 removal of forest cover increases streamflow bosch and hewlett 1982 hornbeck et al 1993 ice and stednick 2004 jones and post 2004 brown

et al 2020 gomi et al 2005 5 the effect of minor forest disturbances such as thinning pruning or disease control are often difficult to detect at the catchment scale therefore stand scale studies are more appropriate for detecting change on hydrological processes e g nikooy et al 2020 similarly to a partial afforestation the removal of 20 of a catchment cover appears not to be detectable in paired catchment studies brown et al 2005 6 the presence of forest cover plays an important role in the reduction of soil erosion and sediment loss see marden 2012 but the difference between the cover of different forest types is still unclear e g pizarro et al 2020 especially when different soil parental materials and the lithology of the headwater catchment are considered e g bywater reyes et al 2017 7 even though the effects of land cover and forest management on low flows are usually associated with a reduction of stream flows e g coble et al 2020 perry and jones 2017 iroumé and palacios

on priorities for supporting science for policy makers and the sustainable management of water resources 2 an overview of the chilean forest hydrology 2 1 climate and hydrology chile has 18 köppen geiger climate types beck et al 2018 the distribution of which is affected by latitude and topography fig 1 a a common feature in all these climatic zones is that the rainfall is concentrated in winter annual rainfall increases from 100 mm at semiarid latitudes 30 s to 3 000 mm at temperate latitudes about 40 s fig 1b orographic effects create zones of high and low rainfall one example is the coastal range where the highest peak 1 300 m asl of the nahuelbuta range 37 s creates an area of very high rainfall gonzález and garreaud 2019 fig 1b south central chile has four main topographic features moving from west to east through the coastal plain the coastal mountain range the intermediate depression or central valley and the andes mountain range with altitudes above 5 000 m this topography influences precipitation and temperature and therefore the distribution of vegetation along the latitudinal 17 s to 56 s range chile comprises 101 basins fig 1c according to chile s general water department dga of these 101 basins 88 are covered by forest including commercial plantations the hydrological regimes of these basins include rain dominated snow dominated and a mix of both mcphee 2018 the intermediate depression the coastal plains and the coastal mountain range are mainly rain dominated with some snow dominated areas in the higher peaks of the coastal mountain range such as the nahuelbuta range the basins in the andes are mainly snow dominated and where water is stored as snow in winter and released in spring to feeding springs and rivers that flow to the pacific ocean most summer flows are sourced from water storage of the 101 defined basins the average annual precipitation is 1 525 mm and the mean runoff is 1 220 mm dirección general de aguas 2016 boisier et

plantations are pinus radiata and 33 are eucalyptus spp mainly e globulus e nitens and e globulus nitens hybrids ministry of agriculture 2021 plantations were introduced in 1907 albert 1907 to control soil erosion that arose from clearing and burning of native forest for agriculture stretching back to the pre hispanic period pizarro tapia et al 2021a armesto et al 2010 since then large areas of native forest have been logged to produce lumber for mining and cleared for cattle grazing which led to 200 years of intense deforestation concentrated in south central chile armesto et al 2010 land clearing across many areas was largely unplanned and by 1950 19 million hectares of chile were assessed as severely eroded garcía chevesich et al 2017 erosion was particularly severe on the highly erodible metamorphic sediments of the western coastal mountains elgueta and jirkal 1942 and the granite derived soils of the eastern coastal ranges monterrey pine pinus radiata d don were then chosen for reclamation of this severely eroded land in central chile albert 1907 camus 2003 ramírez 1992 erosion continued to worsen into the 1970 s until the chilean government generated incentives for afforestation providing decree law 701 of 1974 jelvez et al 1990 the impetus for the creation of the chilean forestry sector cabaña 2010 the rapid early growth and resultant short rotation lengths of p radiata made it more profitable than other alternatives and gave the chilean forestry sector a competitive advantage over other countries other exotic species were later introduced between 1960 and 1980 and large scale afforestation with these tree species in addition to p radiata ensued fuentealba et al 2021 these exotic species used for reclamation included eucalyptus nitens deane et maiden

plantations has increased by several million hectares in the last 50 years fig 3 a proportion of this area represented substitution of native forest for instance the rio maule cobquecura area ca 600 000 ha around 35 36 s suffered a decline in native forest surface from 21 to 7 1975 2000 which was attributed to exotic plantation expansion echeverría et al 2007 specifically commercial plantations exotic and native forest including forestation and reforestation increased on average around 50 000 ha per year between 2000 and 2010 while the 2015 2019 period this area diminished to ca 2 000 ha per year corporación nacional forestal 2022b available at https www conaf cl nuestros bosques bosques en chile estadisticas forestales food and agriculture organization 2020 thus there is a growing

rivas et al 2020 more than 3 million people live in the coastal cities of concepción valparaiso and valdivia 33 40 s and many smaller cities and towns that receive water from rivers that originate in the heavily forested headwater catchments of the coastal mountain range much of the commercial forestry is also located in these catchments armesto et al 1998 salas et al 2016 fig 2 the establishment of these plantations has resulted in alterations of water quality cuevas et al 2006 2018 hervé fernández et al 2016a oyarzún et al 2007 2015 uyttendaele and iroumé 2002 quantity little et al 2009 2015 and timing of streamflow and spring flow rivas et al 2020 recently the pressure on water resources created by this co location of major population centers with commercial timber pulp production has been intensified by a pronounced drying trend in the local climate runoff generation and water supply could be affected because water demand is projected to increase within this region during the coming decades fernández et al 2018 and that current negative trends of rainfall are expected to increase under climate change scenarios barría et al 2017 bozkurt et al 2018 therefore a detailed knowledge of the water balance of plantations and alternatives with high resolution in time and space are needed to ensure appropriate water resources planning into the future ellison et al 2012 for instance water restrictions were common in rural sectors molinos senante and donoso 2021 water scarcity has been associated with both climate change and water use patterns as important drivers barría

additionally table a1 presents reported hydrologic information i e precipitation streamflow low flow baseflow runoff throughfall stemflow interception and evapotranspiration the first forest hydrology work published using a chilean dataset compared three small catchments 3 4 28 ha in central chile 35 s jones et al 1975 these catchments were covered by small native trees and shrubs and two of them were partially burned this study found that peak flows and sediment yield were higher within the burned catchments in the period immediately after the fire studies regarding water quality and quantity are mainly concentrated between 35 s and 41 s fig 4 of the 73 studies 38 of them 56 minus the extreme south studies below 41 s were conducted in the los rios region i e at least 1 site was located in this region most of the studies were conducted between 2010 and 2022 after 18 years with very few publications fig 5 long term experimental data is very scarce and since 1950 has been focused on

throughfall 3 1 1 partitioning of rainfall among interception throughfall and evapotranspiration effects of forest type interception varies between vegetation and forest types table 1 it is also influenced by rainfall intensity and amount and plantation density and leaf area index in a comprehensive study of canopy interception by plantations and broadleaf species soto schönherr and iroumé 2016 presented interception values for different plantation and native forest ages across a rainfall gradient the average annual interception across all rainfall and forest type combinations was around 21 of rainfall and interception losses were correlated with annual rainfall and basal area results show that broadleaf native forests intercepted more water than pine plantations the reported value matches global observations yue et al 2021 for example frêne et al 2022 found in average a 33 of interception in a native forest plot study in southern chile 42 s ca 2 000 2 500 rainfall there was a higher throughfall in coniferous alerce monterrey pine and douglas fir than in broadleaved forests native and e nitens but no significant differences in a 29 plot study over different land covers across central southern chile huber and iroumé 2001 throughfall was similar in a broadleaf native forest and in planted douglas fir in the southern andes 79 in broadleaved and 72 for douglas fir but interception was higher in douglas fir 22 versus 14 iroumé and huber 2002 however the difference was more attributable to the rainfall type and the meteorological conditions in mature pine plantations near valdivia 39 s average annual canopy interception was 10 but the proportion of canopy interception varied monthly and was negatively correlated with rainfall intensity huber and oyarzún 1983 in a subsequent study in southern chile 39 s interception losses were in the order of 15 and throughfall of ca 85 with all these values also affected by rainfall intensity and amount and the temporal distribution of rainfall huber and oyarzún 1990 in general higher intensity and longer duration rainfall is associated with lower interception as a proportion of rainfall huber and oyarzún 1984 in a more recent study conducted along a rainfall gradient in central chile 35 s 37 s and 39 s the rainfall interception by p radiata on high rainfall sites 2 000 mm was 15 but when rainfall was 1 200 mm interception was much higher at 36 to 40 of annual rainfall huber et al 2008 results of chilean studies on pines and eucalyptus are consistent with global comparison that is for a given rainfall regime the proportion of rainfall intercepted by eucalyptus canopy is lower than the proportion intercepted by a pinus canopy benyon and doody 2015 for instance oyarzún and huber 1999 reported averaged values of 4 4 for e globulus and 3 8 for the p radiata of canopy interception in another pine and e globulus comparison canopy interception varied from 10 to 17 with e globulus the lowest huber et al 2010 in the period following the recent chilean megadrought the proportion of annual rainfall intercepted by 21 year old p radiata and e globulus stands were 15 and 13 of rainfall white et al 2021 and were similar to the range of values observed for the same species in southern australia benyon and doody 2015 3 2 forest evapotranspiration one of the key questions in forest hydrology research is how much water is taken up by forest prior research has examined how evapotranspiration et differs between grasslands shrublands native forest and plantation forests unfortunately there are few published studies that have measured evapotranspiration under forested systems i e white et al 2021 with sap flow sensors and meza et al 2018 and melo et al 2021 with eddy covariance systems all other studies have derived indirectly et from water balance approaches complemented with remote sensing information in a few cases 3 2 1 do forests consume more water than grassland or shrubland in chile in valdivia 39 s south central chile where annual rainfall often exceeds 2 300 mm evapotranspiration was approximately 76 of net precipitation in mature and young pine plantations and only 29 of rainfall in grassland huber et al 1985 when grassland is compared to a native forest in southern chile 38 s 25 km northeast from valdivia evapotranspiration was only 13 of rainfall 3 204 mm between september 1992 and august 1993 in grasslands while it was 33 in native forest echeverría et al 2007 all studies that have compared grassland with plantations in chile have confirmed that runoff from forests is lower than runoff from grass covered catchments huber and lópez 1993 huber et al 1985 other studies have demonstrated lower et values for shrubland and grassland when compared to forest covers this is the case of the study of galleguillos et al 2021 who computed lower et values at the hydrological response unit hru scale for shrublands in south central chile 430 mm in average instead of 709 to 623 mm from pinus radiata using the swat process based model those differences are consistent with results obtained from aster satellite imagery where surface energy models showed similar differences among shrublands and forests for the same study region olivera guerra et al 2014 this study also reported lower water consumption of grassland than forests these higher et values in forest are in agreement with direct measurements of transpiration and et white et al 2020 reported values of 514 mm of evapotranspiration for native forests in central chile 35 s and meza et al 2018 reported values of et obtained from a eddy covariance systems in the order of 150 mm in shrublands in a more arid context 33 s in chile the greatest absolute differences in evapotranspiration between different land uses occur in high rainfall areas table 2 which is consistent with the conclusion of zhang et al 2001 who analyzed studies from around the world table 3 3 2 2 do plantations consume more water than native forest in chile there is now evidence collected at both the catchment iroumé et al 2021 lara et al 2009 and the stand scales white et al 2021 that commercial tree plantations consume more water and consequently release less water downstream than mature native forest the greater water consumption from commercial plantations is particularly high when compared to native forests of north central chile mainly covered by nothofagus species white et al 2021 recently found that trees of e globulus 21 years old in central sites and p radiata 13 years old in dry sites and 21 years old in central sites used a little over 100 mm more water around 5 to 6 of the precipitation per year than native tree species nothofagus obliqua nothofagus glauca 80 years old on average forest in a dry 1 000 mm precipitation and central 1 340 mm precipitation locations within the coastal range at stand scale the greater water consumption of plantations compared to native roble hualo forest type was also observed at catchment scale studies 140 to 1 462 ha for instance lara et al 2009 found a greater annual direct runoff quickflow precipitation as the native forest cover increased old growth and second growth native forest when compared with commercial plantations p radiata e nitens and e globulus gimeno et al 2022 analyzed et dynamics at the hydrological response unit hru scale in a catchment in central southern chile 38 s and showed that the ratio of the actual evapotranspiration eta and rainfall was 70 for tree farms plantations and 50 in native forest table 2 the agreement of catchment and stand scale studies supports the conclusion that native forests consume less water than commercial plantations in central chile while it seems that intensively managed plantations consume on average more water than native forests some empirical studies have not found a significant difference in the water balance between native forest and plantations in fact there is one study that reported greater native forest evapotranspiration 89 of rainfall values than a pinus plantation between 66 and 72 fuentes et al 1994 in the semiarid north central chile 35 s pizarro et al 2005 found that 50 substitution of native forest by plantations in a 264 km2 basin did not affect annual water yield over 40 years however in the same basin a decrease in summer runoff due to the increase in the percentage of plantations was found little et al 2009 in contrast at the wetter end of the rainfall range in central chile 2 000 mm precipitation iroumé and palacios 2013 observed that a 16 substitution of native forest by plantations was sufficient to reduce streamflow in their six large study basins 94 to 1 545 km2 huber et al 2008 study found that net evapotranspiration values varied from 32 of the incoming precipitation in the south 40 s to 55 of the incoming precipitation in northernmost and drier sites 33 s a remote sensing study estimating evapotranspiration on agricultural land native forest plantations and shrubland found that the rates of evapotranspiration in commercial plantations were higher than in native forests and these latter were higher than the mixed forests olivera guerra et al 2014 while these results may appear contradictory when they are considered in the context of the model of zhang et al 2001 some patterns emerge the largest proportional difference between plantations and native forests seems to occur in chile s medium volume rainfall area where the climate wetness index cwi ratio of precipitation to potential evaporation is between 0 8 and 1 2 e g white et al 2021 areas with climate wetness index 0 7 are water limited whereas areas with climate wetness index 1 5 are energy limited these limitations lead to smaller differences in transpiration between species the cwi definition does not mean that differences do not exist in water or energy energy limited areas only that they are more challenging to detect in this sense the study of alvarez garreton et al 2019 reported the same patterns with higher streamflow differences when forest plantations replaced other land cover in drier than in humid catchments tree water sources revealed by stable isotopes in the water molecule i e δ2h and δ18o have shown that native evergreen forests in southern chile use water that has been interpreted as slow or static water and replenished during autumn precipitation events in comparison exotic eucalyptus nitens appear to use more mobile water that is recharged during the year hervé fernández et al 2016b 3 2 3 do eucalyptus plantations use more water than pinus plantations in chile there is a common expectation that plantations of eucalyptus species evapotranspire more water and therefore have a larger effect on streamflow than plantations of p radiata this view is prevalent in both the general public and amongst scientists and is prevalent worldwide given the ubiquity of this view it is surprising that very few papers worldwide have directly compared estimates of evapotranspiration of pinus and eucalyptus plantations in fact we could only find two such publications scott and lesch 1997 benyon and doody 2015 in chile studies that showed greater water use in eucalyptus than pinus were all conducted at the catchment scale e g huber et al 2010 however stand scale measurements did not detect a difference in annual evapotranspiration between e globulus and p radiata within northern 35 s and central 37 s sites white et al 2021 after radial sapflux density corrections these latter authors found annual transpiration values of 492 mm for p radiata and 472 mm for e globulus with no significant differences between tree species turning first to the catchment studies huber et al 2010 measured streamflow in two pine and two eucalyptus catchments 12 6 to 21 1 ha in central chile 37 s and found that catchments with eucalyptus had lower streamflow than those with pine 469 vs 706 mm using the simplified catchment scale equation p q e t δ s and assuming no change in storage huber et al 2010 calculated an average evapotranspiration of 1 468 mm for the e globulus rainfall was 2 060 mm and 1 384 mm for pinus rainfall was 1 930 mm it is not possible to test for statistical significance of this difference but these amounts of water may be important the priestley taylor potential evaporation for the area where these measurements were made is 1 300 mm so these estimates of evapotranspiration give crop factors of about 1 1 for both species these results suggest that some water may have been passing below the measurement v notch weirs in these catchments or that soil storage increased by around 100 mm in the measurement year thus the absolute values of streamflow should be treated cautiously but they may be important and should be corroborated by other studies in a recent stand scale comparison white et al 2021 measured much lower rates of annual evapotranspiration than huber et al 2010 in stands of e globulus and p radiata species 745 mm in e globulus and 731 mm in p radiata and found no difference between these species the white et al sites were about 60 km north of the huber et al 2010 sites in central chile 37 s but with about 500 mm less rain per year white et al 2021 observed that annual water use et by both species e globulus and p radiata was around 740 mm about 60 of rainfall but that water use by e globulus was very rapid early in spring while p radiata deferred water use until later in the dry season not all catchment studies have shown differences between the water balances of eucalyptus and pinus covered catchments an analysis of water storage within 15 catchments 7 411 ha in central southern chile 37 s with different land cover pine eucalyptus and mixed showed highly variable results barrientos and iroumé 2018 in these studies plantation density age growth and soil water storage were all correlated with water consumption in the same study rainfall and elevation were the main drivers of catchment storage capacity in the same location and at 11 of the 15 catchments described above another study reported a greater reduction in deep percolation under eucalyptus than under pinus iroumé et al 2021 also after 10 years of streamflow measurements iroumé et al 2021 did not find significant differences between eucalyptus and pinus covered catchments however the age of the pine plantations was greater than the usual commercial harvesting rotation 21 33 years old for example huber and trecaman 2004 at plot scale compared evapotranspiration rate net et tree volumetric increase of p radiata within a latitudinal gradient 35 s 37 s and 39 s and at same age 11 15 years old the highest evapotranspiration rates were found in the northern and driest sites the observation of differences between catchments may not be inconsistent with the absence of differences at the catchment scale also catchment studies integrate all the land uses in a catchment it is possible that areas not occupied by plantations such as the riparian edges behaved differently in eucalyptus and pinus covered catchments due to the different water use seasons i e e globulus used water much more rapidly in spring than p radiata while p radiata used more water than e globulus late in summer white et al 2021 whatever the reasons for the apparent differences between catchment and stand studies in chile and elsewhere it is crucial that the results across scales are reconciled most easily using a combination of long term catchment datasets particularly actual evapotranspiration measurements along streamflow and soil moisture combined with remotely sensed data and modelling approaches 3 3 streamflow in forested catchments differences in transpiration between forest types can lead to variation in streamflow and in the extent of the effect of land use change and forest management on low flow peak flow streamflow and the catchment water balance alvarez garreton et al 2019 fitted a regression model to runoff data from 25 forested catchments and the proportion of land cover they showed that annual runoff decreased with increased plantation of 10 000 ha by between 2 2 and 7 2 across a gradient of rainfall from higher to lower pizarro et al 2022 found contrasting results in a study based of 42 large catchment 200 to 24 000 km2 mainly covered by native forest plantation or a mix of both and showed similar streamflow even in a period of low rainfall see esse et al 2021 for similar results using swat hydrological model 3 3 1 how does the water balance of plantations and native forest vary across the plantation management cycle 3 3 1 1 plantation management most of the results summarized in section 3 2 are concerned with annual catchment and stand water balances measured at a particular time within a rotation the management or life cycle is very different for different types of native forest and particularly for pine and eucalyptus plantations in chile the forestry operations and natural disturbances e g effect of wildfires over the water balance in balocchi et al 2020 2022a and white et al 2020 that occur during the life cycles of native forests and plantations may all change the water balance and therefore affect the water supply for other users the comparison between forest types at different life stages is limited for chile and elsewhere in the world but there have been several studies in each forest type under consideration perhaps the most dramatic operation in a plantation s life cycle is the harvest after harvesting pinus plantations are replanted with improved site matched genotypes while plantations of eucalyptus can be either replanted or allowed to re sprout from stumps in general streamflow increases for a period after the harvest of a pinus plantation after harvesting of 79 of a p radiata plantation that covered 34 4 ha catchment in southern chile 39 40 s runoff increased by 110 compared to pre harvest mean iroumé et al 2006 and in another study of the same 34 4 ha runoff increased significantly for four years after harvesting and this runoff increase persisted for over eight years iroume et al 2010 in a similar high rainfall area 39 s p radiata used about 13 less water after harvest than before but continued to use more water than the neighboring grassland huber and lópez 1993 however a more recent study did not observe marked increase in runoff after harvesting of either 20 22 old year pine or 7 8 old year eucalyptus catchments in central chile iroumé et al 2021 in chile we lack data quantifying the effect of initial stocking or thinning on either stand or catchment scale water balance in one plot scale study evapotranspiration estimated in low medium and high tree densities of an 8 year old e nitens plot was 79 77 and 71 of annual rainfall huber et al 1998 while in a similar study of two densities of 12 year old p radiata in central chile 37 s net evapotranspiration was similar in both stands huber and trecaman 2002 the results for thinning plantations are consistent with results from australia white et al 2014 it is reasonably well established that tree water use increases up to the time of canopy closure less than four years in eucalyptus and seven to nine years in pinus e g white et al 2010 this pattern of water use by plantations was also found in a study in e globulus in chile where evapotranspiration rates values were up to 30 of the annual rainfall in the first year and to 58 in the third year of measurements oyarzún and huber 1999 3 3 1 2 native forest several studies have observed increased runoff associated with wider riparian buffers of native forest e g alvarenga et al 2017 little et al 2015 estimated that for each increase of 1 m in the width of the native forest riparian buffer runoff increased by 1 4 in southern chile 39 s in a northernmost site iroumé et al 2021 found that in central chile 37 s catchments with a wider native forest buffer not only yielded more water but were also more resilient to drought there is little information from around the world on the water balance of recently planted native forest lara et al 2021 in a decadal restoration study from eucalyptus cover to native forest in southern chile in a high rainfall area near valdivia 39 s found that after 9 years of native forest growth within 3 catchments of 3 74 3 43 and 4 28 ha streamflow and baseflow increased gradually when compared to the eucalyptus plantation streamflow 5 26 ha frêne et al 2020 analyzed the effects of different successional native forest stages near valdivia 39 s on streamflow they found a greater streamflow in the old growth catchment compared to a secondary 110 old year forest and shrub covered catchments within the same study site frêne et al 2021 analyzed streamflow yield at different rainfall intensities they found a greater streamflow in a secondary forest than in old growth forest and dense scrub vegetation within a high rainfall intensity in another study in an old growth patagonian rainforest 42 s stand evapotranspiration was greater than that of a younger stand gutiérrez et al 2014 in an andean range native forest water balance study around 5 000 mm rainfall in southern chile 39 s oyarzún et al 2011a compared seven stands of evergreen deciduous and mixed native forest species pristine harvested unmanaged and managed a relationship was found between the structure of the forests and the rainfall partitioning throughfall stemflow and interception for instance interception varied from 11 to 36 median monthly with one of the evergreen pristine stands with the highest interception values and the harvested evergreen stand with the lowest these results suggest that revegetation with native forest will enhance streamflow regardless of which type of mature forest is replaced 3 3 2 how do plantations affect peak flow and low flow while the effects of native forests and different plantation species on annual streamflow are important for large scale water planning the effect on summer or low streamflow is more important for the rural communities which extract water directly from streams and wells within and near the forests peak storm flows and the rate of recession are important hydrological parameters that can be used in the prediction of low or summer flow e g eng and milly 2007 3 3 3 low flows baseflow and summer flows the establishment of plantations has generally been associated with reduced summer december to march flow and baseflow oyarzún and huber 1999 replacement of native forest with pine plantations can reduce streamflow in summer by as much as 28 although in some cases pine has also been associated with an increase in flow 359 l s 1 km 2 in pine and 274 l s 1 km 2 in native forest in high rainfall period near valdivia otero et al 1994 lara et al 2009 developed a relationship considering six 140 to 1 462 ha catchments between proportional native forest cover and summer flow and found that a 10 increase in native forest cover resulted in a 14 increase in average summer flow relative to that coming from commercial plantations the same difference was found in larger catchments in central chile e g little et al 2009 but other authors did not find significant differences in the other larger catchments in south central chile 38 s e g iroumé and palacios 2013 while most studies show that plantation expansion and land cover change might reduce flows during the summer months january february and march there are some exceptions in the literature one way of quantifying the effect of a change in land cover on streamflow responses and baseflow is to fit an exponential decay function to the relationship between flow and time and estimate the decay parameter α in a latitudinal transect 35 to 40 s latitude considering eight 13 to 112 ha catchments in south central chile balocchi et al 2021a showed that α was not affected by forest type p radiata e globulus e nitens and native forest in winter may to september but however more evident but not significantly different between the different forest types including native forest in summer october to april average α values were not significantly different between native forest and pine plantations nor between native forest and eucalyptus spp plantations after harvesting summer streamflow increased over the preharvest values iroumé et al 2005 and this effect of water loss persists for up to seven years after harvesting and re planting iroume et al 2010 3 3 4 peak flows the peak flow in response to a rainfall event is also an important characteristic of the hydrograph which is relevant to rural communities due to potential damage to water supply facilities and water quality issues e g sediment load peak flows are also affected by the establishment and management of plantations when 79 of a 34 4 ha p radiata catchment in southern chile 39 s 40 s was harvested a mean increase in peak flow of 32 was observed iroumé et al 2006 and the effect was similar for winter and summer storms iroumé et al 2005 the post harvesting effect of increased peak flow can persist for up to eight years after replanting iroumé et al 2011 while most studies have observed an increase in peak flows after harvesting at least one example shows no change in peak flow after 80 removal of the pine plantations birkinshaw et al 2011 bathurst et al 2020 found for a 34 4 ha catchment 40 s that at lower rainfall events forest cover may decrease peak discharge but at higher rainfall events forest cover appears to have a lesser effect on the reduction of peak flows which likely depend on the antecedent soil moisture bathurst et al 2022 analyzed the effect of afforestation on peak flow in four 434 1 545 km2 large catchments in southern chile while they found differences when land cover change occurs i e changes in annual evapotranspiration and runoff the effect on peak flows was unclear four studies have compared peak flow among catchments with different forest types and none have observed any differences the latter is true for a comparison of e nitens and younger p radiata iroumé et al 2006 conversion from native forest to plantations pizarro et al 2005 2006 and a meta analysis of data from 42 200 24 000 km2 catchments with native forest plantation and agriculture as land cover pizarro et al 2022 2021 3 4 water quality 3 4 1 how do plantations and their management affect water quality 3 4 1 1 sediment yield and assessment mechanisms we found 21 studies that reported results on forest cover and management effects on sediment transport suspended sediment and or sediment modelling in chile this work commenced in the early 1990 s iroumé 1990 1992 as noted earlier afforestation with p radiata was an important strategy for controlling erosion and soil loss from land previously cleared for agriculture toro and gessel 1999 forest cover including p radiata stands of different ages and management and second growth n obliqua stands were found to reduce sediment yield 97 5 in native forest to 94 in pine plantations relative to agricultural land cover ibarra et al 1996 the native forest stands had the lowest erosion rates otero et al 1994 results from comparisons between plantation types and comparison between plantations and native forest are variable and seem very dependent on the age and successional stage of the plantation at hillslope scale annual soil loss was in general not significantly different between native forest and plantations five treatments two 1 year old two mature and one harvested stand in south central chile 37 s but soil loss was highest from the youngest 1 year old pine plantations aburto et al 2021 at the catchment scale 200 km2 sediment exports decreased after plantation establishment pizarro et al 2020 in one comparison between pine and e globulus plantations pine yielded more sediment than eucalyptus huber et al 2010 but again this may be so because canopy closure in pine occurs at a later growth stage when an e globulus planted catchment was compared to a native forest suspended sediment was a bit higher in e globulus 368 kg ha 1 than native forest 305 kg ha 1 and these differences were due to fact that the plantation was recently established so it was in a transition from prairie to plantation oyarzún et al 2011b however other results showed no significant differences between the pre and post harvest sediment yield in southern chile in e globulus catchments cuevas et al 2018 yet this same study agreed with the minimum requirement for native forest riparian strips 22 m wide for catchment protection for post harvesting sediment yield although little et al 2015 concluded that an increasing width of riparian native forest can diminish nutrient loss within a study of native forest stages near valdivia old growth shrubs and successional forest frêne et al 2021 found a greater suspended sediment yield from catchments cover with shrub vegetation than in catchments cover with old growth and secondary forest in summary we found no measurable difference between the sediment yield from closed canopy plantations 7 years and native forest but before canopy closure more sediment can enter stream from plantations than from undisturbed native forest the distribution of harvesting operations in catchments and the management of harvesting residues will both have important consequences for reducing the potential for sediment transport after harvesting plantations a comparison of harvested and undisturbed p radiata oyarzún and peña 1995 found that soil losses were much more significant from the harvested area than from the unharvested area as the harvested area produced greater runoff oyarzún 1993 found greater soil loss when residues burning was performed after clearcutting it was also found that microtopography acts as the first order control of runoff generation and erosion processes in a small scale rainfall simulation study in central chile mohr et al 2013 mohr et al 2014 within 3 small catchments 12 9 ha in south central chile annual suspended sediment increased between increased by 46 86 after clearcutting of p radiata compared to an uncut control iroume et al 2010 studied the sediment yield within three small catchments 94 12 and 17 ha in southern chile and they found a greater sediment load in the catchment with the lowest plantation cover 33 of p radiata and eucalyptus and the lowest sediment load in the bigger plantation area 81 eucalyptus in another study before and after harvesting within a small p radiata catchment 34 4 ha 40 s measurements were not conclusive regarding the effects on sediment yield birkinshaw et al 2011 in a paired catchment sediment study schüller et al 2021 analyzed forest activities harvesting and replanting they found that the stream channel was the main source of sediment load pre harvest and a catchment with forest activities yielded twice as much sediment compared to the control catchment this higher sediment load was due to the activation of catchment slopes and forest roads for example from a sediment core analysis in the lanalhue lake in central chile 37 s alaniz et al 2021 found a correlation of the increasing erosion and organic matter content within this lake and the afforestation with exotic plantations within the last 30 years tracers have frequently been used to study hydrological processes biogeochemistry and sediment sources at plot and catchment scale among the most used tracers in chile fallout radionuclides frn have been used to trace and fingerprint sediment sources schüller et al 2013 characterized sediment sources in a p radiata covered catchments under a low 1 200 mm yr 1 and high 2 500 mm yr 1 rainfall regime using 137cs and 210pbex the relative contribution after harvest from slopes increased from 16 to 25 while the contribution from road increase from 37 to 45 bravo linares et al 2020 studied sediment sources in different land covers history they found a greater sedimentation processes in forestry activities compared to wheat land cover however wheat farmland added an important sediment contribution in the 1950 s and 1970 s recently studies using compound specific stable isotopes cssi done by bravo linares et al 2018 and muñoz arcos et al 2021 identified the sediment source within an exotic plantation catchment before and after wildfire the main conclusion was that before the wildfire sediment came mostly from unpaved roads but the hillslope became the dominant source after wildfires similar changes in source contributions associated with clearcutting were documented for the high rainfall regime where the relative contribution of slopes increased from 10 5 to 30 while the contribution from roads grew from 10 to 20 these results indicate that changes in sediment sources are closely related to clearcutting however they are also influenced by the amount of rainfall that occurs after clearcutting the authors emphasize the need to implement better management practices during forest harvesting to reduce the increase in sediment mobilization from catchment slopes and roads which can result in the loss of valuable soil and nutrients from the forest floor causing degradation of the water quality of adjacent streams some of the applied solutions to this problem include using woody debris to create sediment barriers schüller et al 2010 and using riparian strip vegetation to enhance sediment trapping and nutrient retention cuevas et al 2018 little et al 2015 oyarzún et al 2007 oyarzún et al 2011a wang et al 2005 some mathematical modelling has also been applied to suspended sediment in p radiata covered catchments and after forest operations fuentes et al 2001a 2001b found that the best predictive variables in a model to predict suspended sediments were monthly precipitation water discharge truck traffic and forest road length 3 5 hydrological modelling and climate change although empirical studies of forest hydrology and ecohydrology are made under a unique set of climatic and hydrogeological conditions their results have helped to feed hydrological models i e for calibration purposes this section looks at the process based modelling that has been done in chile to analyze and disentangle the effects of land use change and climate trends in the local forests and their hydrology table 3 in general hydrological modelling is scarce in chile particularly it has been performed through two models i e a physically based distributed precipitation runoff model swat and tetis an exception is flores et al 2021 study who analyzed the performance of three 1d lumped hydrological models over four small catchments 22 40 ha with different land cover in south central chile i e native forest monterrey pine and eucalyptus nitens they found the best potential evapotranspiration method for modelling streamflow within catchments as well the best hydrological model i e gr6j using the swat model at a mesoscale andean watershed with changes in land use in central chile it was predicted that the mean annual discharge increased 7 under agriculture from that under native forest and decreased 10 under pine plantation management stehr et al 2010 in the same catchment the effect of future climate on streamflow particularly during summer was modelled and this indicated that from 2018 to 2028 and then to 2038 trends of reduced rainfall will cause a further reduction in streamflow from the present levels aguayo et al 2016 and in some scenarios reductions in summer flow of up to 50 were predicted another swat study about the effect of land cover change in central chile indicated that a decrease in annual streamflow within the three scenarios studied plantation coverage from 35 to 63 for 1986 2001 and 2011 with an increased evapotranspiration and surface flow and a reduced percolation and lateral flow martínez retureta et al 2020 gimeno et al 2022 used swat to simulate the effect of an earlier application of forest conservation policies in a large catchment 1 026 km2 in southern chile within three scenarios baseline native forest recovery protection and pristine they found little differences in inflow from baseline of 0 3 in the native forest recovery scenarios and 3 5 within the pristine scenario however larger differences are obtained reaching until 3 1 and 21 2 during the dry summer periods climate change analysis was introduced in the study of martínez retureta et al 2021 also with swat where various components of the hydrological cycle in two 299 651 km2 large catchments located in the foothills of the andes 38 s the model predicted increases in average annual evapotranspiration of 5 6 a decrease in percolation of 9 10 a reduction of surface flow of 2 and 7 8 increase in depth to groundwater these changes were associated with 5 decrease in streamflow in the same catchments the disentangling of land cover and climate changes effect on hydrological variables was investigated by galleguillos et al 2021 also using swat and results showed that change from shrubland to pine plantations decrease the annual mean streamflow between 2 5 and 17 3 according to the amount of cover replaced in a coastal semi arid catchment in central chile the study also forecast an increase in water yield of between 2 and 11 when pine was removed from the catchment headwater although when future climate change scenarios are mixed with land use changes annual streamflow decreases are much more severe and predicted to be between 23 and 46 according to contrasting climate change projections and the same land cover replacement scenarios galleguillos et al 2021 a simulation of trends for three forest management scenarios over 25 climate scenarios within eight forested catchments in the south central chile using tetis vélez et al 2005 indicated that smaller catchments 20 ha in the drier scenarios deliver more streamflow when reducing the forest cover either plantations or native forest larger catchments 50 ha in all climate scenarios deliver more water when full forest cover is present these results show how climate change i e reduction of rainfall and or increasing evapotranspiration significantly influenced water yield barrientos et al 2020 4 a vision for chilean forest hydrology research gaps identification here we summarize the primary research gaps that we have identified from this review in brackets is specified each research gap found 1 long term ecosystem research lter sites the only two publicly available and continuous dataset from small catchments 100 km2 are balocchi et al 2021b which comprises data from ten 5 to 112 ha catchments in southern central chile private catchment network since 2008 https www hydroshare org resource 4b517deaa07243aa8c46a58646dd4281 and lara et al 2021 which comprises data from four 3 43 to 5 26 ha catchments in southern chile since 2006 https www cr2 cl datos cuencas restauracion reservavaldiviana a detailed description of the catchments under research provides a comprehensive 1 forest structure characterization soil types root densities and other available characteristics which is uncommon in national forest studies however each dataset relies in streamflow and very little extra information i e rainfall is collected more widely available data sets of these variables would help standardize studies and expand understanding of forest dynamics and water resources at a regional and national scale the camels dataset alvarez garreton et al 2018 holds hydrological variables such as daily streamflow rainfall from different sources reference evaporation eto and the land uses within each large catchment https doi org 10 1594 pangaea 894885 however this dataset is the only one with free access in the country at landscape level monitoring despite the numerous small catchments most of them paired monitored by government and private institutions the majority below to the privates most water balance data are for closed canopy plantations and mature native forests therefore there is an urgent need to quantify the water balance and its variables at plot stand and catchment scale of young stands of native species and plantations the quantification of the water balance is needed to support vegetation recovery programs and to integrate space and time to scale the effects of plantations on water balance in addition to designing catchments with a range of plantation ages to mitigate risks to the local water supply therefore these lter sites should collect data and information for from 2 water demands from forested catchments 3 streamflow change among land cover the 4 effects on timing and seasonality of peak flows between land covers and the 5 availability of small catchment data within the country 2 sediment and water quality given the widely known impact of forest roads on stream water quality there is a surprising lack of studies on roads and their relationship to water inputs and sediment to streams forest activities require roads gullies etc and their impact on water resources is still poorly known even though these are the primary sources of sediment yield within forested catchments e g marden et al 2014 while there are few research studies on sediment production in native forest and plantations e g pizarro et al 2020 many more are needed there is a gap in quantification of sediment production within forested catchments in the country another gap is the effect on water quality of forest activities such as pruning thinning logging terrestrial and aerial and harvesting as well as the size necessary for buffer zones thus 6 the effect of the forest operations impacts over water quality site specific i e slopes soil types etc and 7 forest roads and its relationship with water and sediment yield peak flows is required 3 unknown forest groundwater systems despite the attempts by some papers to address groundwater topics no boreholes exist in any forest catchments in the country also the national hydrogeologic map is at a scale of 1 1 000 000 servicio nacional de geología y minería 2003 that makes it difficult to develop more complex studies at this resolution especially within small catchments surface groundwater interactions are also unknown as well as the relationship between soil water storage and the soil vegetation complex detailed catchment studies require detailed digital elevation models and detailed geology thus increasing the resolution of the national hydrogeologic map would greatly assist attempts to understand the groundwater and the vadose zone additionally it would significantly enhance progress if each new activity in monitored catchments includes activities such as geophysics soil survey etc to verify and estimate below ground characteristics thus we need better known 8 aquifer configuration and surface groundwater interactions 9 forest groundwater systems within coastal range e g detailed geology geophysics and 10 the effects on timing and seasonality of low flows and link to meteorological droughts 4 lack of knowledge of soil properties in the andes and coastal range in chile there is only information on soils in the agricultural zones and therefore we have severe limitations in undertaking hydrological studies in forested catchments there is a clear need for increased focus on soil properties studies and especially of native forest and plantations soils where to our knowledge there has been little or no previous work see soto et al 2019 study for soil physical properties in different land covers in fact although the natural resources information centre of chile ciren soil database the only publicly available dataset in chile covers around 24 of the chilean territory padarian et al 2017 with an inadequate cover of native forest and plantation zones additionally since private forest companies usually have valuable information such as lidar data and several soil properties derived from soil pits the science would be greatly enhanced if such data and products were more widely available then the 11 soil physico chemical and hydropedological properties of soils the 12 erosion control soil activities i e evaluation of tillage trenches etc is required for example a follow up study of huber and trecaman 2000 would have been valuable knowledge regarding soil water distribution under pine plantation 5 development recovery of soils under forest cover most of the forest plantations were previously planted on land with wheat crops native forest or were heavily burned for agriculture and settlement expansion there has been some research regarding soil characteristics see soto et al 2019 and cifuentes croquevielle et al 2020 however there is not a single study on soil recovery from wheat burned land on the coastal range which later was afforested or under forest restoration as with hydrology time matters and the effect of changes in soil properties can take several years or even centuries to become apparent andréassian 2004 therefore 13 soil properties evolution should be carefully studied to determine whether afforestation can recover water storage and carbon sequestration properties of these soils 6 extent of the effect of forest management and restoration it has been a common approach in small catchment research to focus mainly on the effect of harvesting activities on streamflow however there is a lack of connections between large catchments and the effect of land cover change and other activities over the hydrological processes or the scaling effects from small catchments to large river basins water resources management in the public sector usually applies over large watersheds 100 km2 it has been discussed that extrapolating from small to large scale catchments can produce errors in the hydrological estimation kirchner 2006 and therefore when relying on observations at the small scale in policy making strategies additionally an important topic is the ecological restoration and its effect on the water cycle we are aware of only one study regarding hydroecological restoration i e lara et al 2021 in chile the 14 extent of the effect of forest management and restoration and 15 plantation densities and its effect in et is require coping the effect of forest management 7 riparian buffer effects while riparian vegetation effects have been studied for impacts on water quality and biotic composition before and after forestry activities e g fierro et al 2017 guevara et al 2018 or riparian restoration for forest fauna connectivity e g rojas et al 2020 the effects of riparian zones on streamflow in forested catchments has been poorly explored in chile i e little et al 2015 although riparian strips are part of stream management and land use activities so the effect on streamflow of a new riparian zone or an increase or reduction of such versus a young or old plantation riparian zone is still not well understood segura et al 2020 also the 16 native forest structure and composition in riparian zones and its effect over water balance and sediment yield is also required 8 native forest ecohydrological effects little is known regarding 17 native forest water balance within chile we can see that there are not many studies in native forest in the central zone e g huerta et al 2019 balocchi et al 2020 nor in sclerophyllous forest or in sectors of pristine native forests in the central coastal mountain range e g galleguillos et al 2021 as an alternative land use to plantations the gap in native forest studies and their hydrological function should be addressed and particularly regarding the effects of climate change 9 climate change effects on water resources and land use change we have strong evidence of the effects of climate change in chile garreaud et al 2017 2020 on precipitation and temperature patterns however very little is known about its effect on water resources within forested and afforested catchments particularly in central southern chile while there are three studies that involve climate change and land use change i e barrientos et al 2020 martínez retureta et al 2020 galleguillos et al 2021 they are recent denoting a lack in our knowledge in future climate scenarios additionally we have not explored how land use change will impact regional climate precipitation temperature and humidity and how this impact will interact with climate change and the hydrologic cycle salazar et al 2015 special attention should be given to the trade off between carbon and water cycle since tree planting is proposed as a strong mitigation option to climate change bastin et al 2019 thus the 18 effect of climate change over a bigger number of catchments the 19 understanding of the tradeoff water yield and carbon sequestration and 20 a multimodel approach for a decision support system for public policies is required 5 towards a collective vision for the future of chilean forest hydrology research overall the science in the chilean forest hydrology literature was found to be consistent with other studies worldwide for instance after a review of up to 75 scientific papers on hydrology in chile a an increasing water yield was found in all studies after harvesting or forest cover removal which is similar to other findings worldwide e g bosch and hewlett 1982 similar findings in b peak flows increasing after forest canopy removal harvesting to other studies e g beschta et al 2010 and consequently a c detriment in water quality as well e g safeeq et al 2020 also most paired watershed studies have focused on the effect of forest harvest and regeneration on streamflow mcdonnell et al 2018 however these studies are small in spatial scale 100 km2 and therefore there is no quantifiable expression of the hydrogeological variability nearly all paired watershed studies show an initial increase in streamflow after forest harvest followed by a gradual decline as forests regenerate and in many cases seasonal or annual water yield falls below water yield in the reference catchment see goeking and tarboton 2020 despite these similarities to other studies there remain questions on the hydrological relationships between our mediterranean climate ecosystems the complex geology and topography in chile predicting the impacts of forestry on catchment processes and their associated effects on water flow is complicated and climate variability sometimes hides the cause effect relationships that can exist between forest and streamflow thus hindering or misinterpreting the effects of management forest on the water resources alila and beckers 2001 hence there is the need for attribution studies to disentangle impacts of different factors on the water balance at the catchment scale given this background field measurements should be complemented with numerical modeling which helps to understand better the cumulative effects of forest management on watersheds ziemer et al 1991 dunne 2001 from a scientific perspective models are important tools that help to interpret data and relationships between measurements at the plot and watershed scales hillel 1986 and provide a medium to test our hypotheses and understanding of catchment processes modelling also provides an opportunity at minimal costs and time to investigate forest management effects on the water resources currently there are numerous reviews of hydrological models with a marked emphasis on being able to interpret effects across forest management or climate change pike 2003 2007 hutchinson 2007 werner and bennett 2009 which allows improved decision making and reduced negative effects of forests on water resources we propose five key elements to advance a cross scale collaborative effort to use new nation wide catchment scale networks to promote common and complementary techniques in these studies and to conduct transdisciplinary research to advance sound planning of forest lands in chile we strongly believe that the chilean forest hydrology field can contribute not only locally but globally especially in the context of climate change and the ndc framework in the following section we discuss research gaps and we propose a research agenda a long term ecosystem research lter sites small catchment 100 ha datasets have provided insightful knowledge regarding basic understanding on the land use change over the hydrologic cycle therefore the implementation of a permanent monitoring program in small catchments with all the equipment needed to collect detailed field data on the water cycle variables and complementing these in larger catchments to capture hydrogeologic signals that in small catchments are not possible the latter might be the case in soft rock systems and in areas where there has been much tectonic activity such as chile muñoz et al 2016 these should represent different forest conditions across the country from catchments with native forest central zone to catchments with only plantations whenever possible with this information process based models can be implemented to study the effects of climate change and land cover change with greater precision to identify resilient landscapes additionally an intense program collecting rain stream soil and other water sources samples for isotope analysis oxygen 18 deuterium tritium etc which will add relevant information regarding water sources and ages e g cartwright et al 2018 dynamic distribution of tree water sources is an active field in hydrological sciences and should be further studied stable isotopes provide a myriad of simple yet significant information which could help provide reliable data to stakeholders to be informed and decide regarding catchment water management decisions stable isotope signatures have been used to calculate the proportion of water that has been evaporated from soil gibson et al 1993 liu et al 2006 tsujimura and tanaka 1998 although these estimations were yearly the cost and processing time of these analyses has fallen significantly in recent years and providing accurate and meaningful quantities this would be a very worthwhile component of a monitoring program in this regard a network of several catchments monitors across the country can provide a unique dataset with the collaboration of several institutions universities research centers and the government that can join in a multidisciplinary program this will involve hydrologists soil scientists ecophysiologists among other disciplines for instance the forest hydrology program from arauco balocchi et al 2021b and cmpc timber companies e g dataset in iroumé et al 2021 the forest institute infor forest and water program and some others private forest companies such as masisa data not published the drinking water companies i e essbio and the forecos foundation ong for the native forest conservation therefore a robust hydrology database developed with the private sector and the national universities should be created as an open database e g hydroshare website the participation of the community and general public in the research is necessary a community forest hydrology program could expand the current knowledge of forest systems in the coastal range community data into a central location data sharing and a long term monitoring such as long term ecological research network lter critical zone observatories research and application ozcar ri in france critical zone observatories czo in the usa etc b emerging technologies that can be applied in hydrology open an opportunity to fill in gaps remote sensing is a valuable and precise tool to study the water budget lillo saavedra et al 2021 since in chile there are large areas of forest and plantations this tool will help us to cover larger areas that are not possible to cover with plots or small catchments it would be possible to understand larger areas and how can influence water cycle its utility includes the transport and storage of water snow and water vapor in the soil plant atmosphere system and addresses the complex interaction between forest vegetation and the abiotic system e g water uptake by roots which is controlled by atmospheric conditions and photosynthetic activity of plants however remote sensing is only a tool measuring from a great distance and requires careful ground truthing to convert large scale images to quantitative measures of ground conditions and processes to understand and predict energy driven processes such as evapotranspiration or snowmelt it is necessary to know the radiation and energy balances of a forest watershed for example cubesats can estimate river flow junqueira et al 2021 satellite borne gnss r for soil moisture measurements li et al 2021 or other novel remote sensing data to determine reservoir characteristics guan et al 2021 high accuracy lidar products can address important questions such as forest growth canopy and branch structure jaskierniak et al 2021 neuville et al 2021 together with forest composition lopatin et al 2015 within large areas it also can be possible to characterize understory riparian and weed plant structure e g tatum and wallin 2021 and detailed geomorphology e g scheip 2021 internet of things iot will also add new insights in forest hydrology through the readily accessible data in real time on any number of environmental attributes new technologies could measure at a high accuracy for example how trees growth transpire and their spectral characteristics valentini et al 2019 another innovation for transpiration measurements is the ribbonized sap flow rsf jones et al 2020 rsf avoids the use of needles or thermocouples inserted in the tree trunk and replaces this with a tape with sensors that is inserted in the trunk avoiding misalignment problems of other equipment ren et al 2017 also advances in mobile mass spectrometry ms will help to reduce the laborious work to analyze environmental traces in hydrology popp et al 2021a this advance would allow us to involve different techniques to achieve new hydrologic analysis mobile ms in conjunction with radon measurement will help find groundwater seepages to streams or young water travel times popp et al 2021b c a robust strategy for measuring water diversion from streams and rivers the national water directorate dga measures the main rivers in the country and the private water vigilance associations the main irrigations channels agriculture use mainly nevertheless there is a gap in knowledge for small communities that rely on water from headwaters which are most dependent on forest and forested catchments forest companies have been concerned about this issue and now some initiatives have been proposed to guarantee freshwater from forested land e g desafio agua arauco but also from the sites protected by the research community universities and public sector e g simol project for water community management and community based water monitoring involving the people who rely on this resource in this monitoring is essential the participation of the community can be through the well known positive impact of the citizen science kobori et al 2016 that can contribute to expand particularly small catchments dataset e g streamflow and rainfall measurements to improve hydrological modelling for water management d a chilean forest hydrology science group the national science funding institution anid chilean national agency for research and development has no guideline regarding the forest water supply and hydrology monitoring nor a specific expert committee even though an important proportion of the water used by humans in chile comes from forested catchment headwaters e g balocchi et al 2022b for communication we propose to start with an annual conference symposium to generate a national report document as a result this paper should be updated regularly to track improvements and promote collaboration a hydrological knowledge improvement which might be a 2 3 day workshop where the scientific community analyzes what we have done and what type of measurement instruments are held by each group what data to can be shared or further investigated also because there are many chilean experts in the field there is the opportunity to run short courses or summer schools which can improve the local understanding and knowledge in the field to complement all these endeavors a chilean water science society group could be formed as a unified voice for the scientific societies stakeholders and particularly to the local communities taking advantage of ongoing science education program such as explora that systematically approaches primary schools e involvement of stakeholders and the community onto the forest hydrology science a decision support system dss for water managers stakeholder engagement is needed experimental catchments with community stakeholders involvement can ensure that they are understanding how the system behaves in their area this dss should be based on a broader understanding of the landscape in terms of when and where we can plant or restore these activities must include serious efforts in data collection to assure the long term monitoring in order to ensure reliable modeling output results therefore there should be a program in forest hydrology modelling scenarios including future climate and the definition of key indicators for national spatial planning legislation this concerted cooperative effort outlined above should result in better coordination between catchment management and forest laws 6 conclusion the rainfall variation across chile and the history of land uses changes creates a unique natural laboratory in which to study climate change and forest hydrology much of the global understanding of forests and their effect on the water cycle is complemented by this review of chilean studies streamflow from forested catchments increases after harvesting native forests use less water than plantations and native forests yield less sediment than plantation and grassland shrublands however mechanisms that control groundwater flow and availability in forested systems and their differences and how climate change would affect native and plantations ecosystems remain unclear in this regard we found 20 research gaps which are related to lack of basic information particularly in groundwater topics climate the need to improve the understanding of key hydrological processes and the relationship between forests streams and the ecosystem one of our findings is that the southern chile 39 s is intensely studied therefore we propose that the focus for conducting research and developing strategies for managing the trade off between timber carbon and water production should be placed in low rainfall areas including the mediterranean climate area and the boundary with the temperate zone 500 1 000 mm where climate change scenarios project sharply rainfall reductions and thus affecting water resources future research should focus on tackling down groundwater surface water interaction in both native forest and plantations mcdonnell et al 2018 and how plantations rotations and management affect hydrologic cycle and water quality all this must be performed through the formatting and expansion of lter sites across native forest and plantations between different management scenarios and climates always bearing in mind that the conclusions that can be drawn at one spatial scale cannot necessarily be extrapolated to other spatial scales and that more case studies are needed to advance the knowledge of this research topic also to investigate the effects of climate change and land use change and the proportion of both variables affecting water quantity and quality we need also further collaboration between public and private institutions sharing research data sites and results and we need to incorporate in our research proposals and research teams other disciplines to understand our complex forest environment from top to bottom and bottom up approaches e g pizarro et al 2021 fuentealba et al 2021 for example reviewed the impact of forest science in chile but despite the importance of water water resources topic was absent from their analysis traditionally the effects of forests and mainly plantations on downstream water supply have been analysed studying only part of the forest cycle this partial analysis since tree establishment to the final harvest and subsequent reforestation does not allow exploration the relations between forests and water from a larger perspective the use of process based modelling including scenario analysis could tackle this issue alongside measurements however in poorly gauged catchments simplified modelling tools could also represent a valuable solution finally potential downstream effects must be reduced or mitigated to

2548,this paper reviews the current knowledge of hydrological processes in chilean temperate forests which extend along western south america from latitude 29 s to 56 s this geographic region includes a diverse range of natural and planted forests and a broad sweep of vegetation edaphic topographic geologic and climatic settings which create a unique natural laboratory many local communities endangered freshwater ecosystems and downstream economic activities in chile rely on water flows from forested catchments this review aims to i provide a comprehensive overview of chilean forest hydrology to ii review prior research in forest hydrology in chile and to iii identify knowledge gaps and provide a vision for future research on forest hydrology in chile we reviewed the relation between native forests commercial plantations and other land uses on water yield and water quality from the plot to the catchment scale much of the global understanding of forests and their relationship with the water cycle is in line with the findings of the studies reviewed here streamflow from forested catchments increases after timber harvesting native forests appear to use less water than plantations and streams draining native forest yield less sediment than streams draining plantations or grassland shrublands we identified 20 key knowledge gaps such as forest groundwater systems soil plant atmosphere interactions native forest hydrology and the effect of forest management and restoration on hydrology also we found a paucity of research in the northern geographic areas and forest types 35 36 s most forest hydrology studies in chile 56 have been conducted in the southern area los rios region around 39 40 s there is limited knowledge of the geology and soils in many forested areas and how surface and groundwater are affected by changes in land cover there is an opportunity to advance our understanding using process based investigations linking field studies and modeling through the establishment of a forest hydrology science society to coordinate efforts regional and national scale land use planning might be supported our review ends with a vision to advance a cross scale collaborative effort to use new nation wide catchment scale networks long term ecosystem research lter sites to promote common and complementary techniques in these studies and to conduct transdisciplinary research to advance sound and integrated planning of forest lands in chile keywords exotic plantations chilean native forests sediment yield water yield land use planning data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction in chile forests occupy 17 7 106 ha or 23 of the country and presently comprise 3 1 106 ha of exotic plantations and 14 6 106 ha of native forests ministry of agriculture 2021 this represents about 0 4 of the more than four billion hectares of global forests food and agriculture organization 2020 approximately 278 million hectares of which are commercial plantations payn et al 2015 since the mid 20th century plantation forests for wood production have profoundly changed the landscapes across all permanently inhabited continents the current land cover of central chile is the result of a long history of food and wood production in both the pre and post columbian periods the expansion of timber plantations commenced in the 1970 s mostly on the coastal mountains of central chile heilmayr et al 2016 the remaining native forests are a globally important repository for mediterranean and temperate forest species and biodiversity myers et al 2000 this is particularly true in the coastal mountains and the central valley where native forests have been fragmented by agriculture and commercial plantations of mostly pinus spp and eucalyptus spp e g miranda et al 2016 echeverría et al 2006 2008 for example from the post columbian ca 1550 to 2007 51 of native forests were lost due to land cover conversion to grassland and agriculture lara et al 2012 when plantations replace native forest cover there is concern about reduction of ecosystem services including recreation biodiversity and water supply han et al 2017 kim et al 2017 for instance a long standing debate about where forests should be located particularly on the coastal mountains originated decades ago torrejón et al 2011 cunill 1970 elizalde 1970 this debate continues but there is now an emphasis on how to locate plantations and manage native forest to maximize carbon sequestration and wood production while preserving water yield and other ecosystems services managing the trade offs between carbon sequestration wood production and water security will require an understanding of the regional relationship between forests productivity and water use in terms of water footprint and carbon sequestration capability wood stands over other structural materials see falk 2009 for wood and steel comparison water supply is the most significant concern regarding the effect of plantations and a great deal of research has been conducted to quantify the effect of commercial plantations on water yield and quality the area occupied by plantation forests is also the most densely populated region of chile armesto et al 2007 fuentealba et al 2021 creating significant pressures on the land s availability for food production timber growth and water supply the need to store carbon in this region to achieve the global needs for emissions neutrality by 2050 höhne et al 2020 will intensify pressures on this area of chile in response chile has committed to the national determined contributions ndc which included the afforestation or recovery of 200 000 ha with a minimum of 70 000 ha of native forest and 100 000 ha of permanent forests by 2030 in conservation priority areas and or in suitable sites for tree growth chilean government 2021 therefore a solid base of knowledge regarding forest hydrology and its drivers is critical to better management of land and water in chile with a future net zero emission status höhne et al 2020 commercial plantations have also been associated with a range of negative effects on a broad range of environmental values these include increased rates of evapotranspiration huber et al 1985 2008 oliveira et al 2005 oyarzún and huber 1999 reduced streamflow and water yield lara et al 2009 little et al 2009 water quality changes fierro et al 2016 2017 stream disturbances guevara cardona et al 2006 guevara et al 2018 nutrient cycling oyarzún et

of soils on the coastal range has been reduced by deep rooted vegetation enhancing a sustainable option represented by less intensively managed planted forests or native forests also it has been discussed the potential benefits of plantations such as the reduction of the runoff and therefore the deep percolation of water into soil pizarro et al 2022 an additional positive effect of plantations is the potential for efficient carbon sequestration white et al 2021 found that e globulus can be five times more efficient in wood production per unit of water consumed than a native forest thus sustainably managed plantations can mitigate the effects of climate change despite the relevance of natural forests and tree plantations for the environment regional economies and quality of life glatzer 2014 there has not yet been a complete synthesis of the biophysics of forest hydrology in chile the chilean research on forest hydrology has focused mainly on the water balance of commercial plantations e g huber and lópez 1993 huber et al 1998 huber and iroumé 2001 huber and trecaman 2004 pizarro et al 2006 echeverría et al 2007 huber et al 2010 and much less is known about the hydrological cycle in native forests frêne et al 2020 gutiérrez et al 2014 oyarzún et al 2011a donoso et al 2014 also the effects of forest management practices on streamflow and water quality e g sediment and nutrient export have not been synthesized although no general review has been published some aspects have been covered in previous synthesis papers these include jofré et al 2014 who analyzed the link between forest science and policy garcía chevesich et al 2017 evaluated the link between forest management and water yield in 13 countries including chile and pizarro et al 2019 who addressed common questions regarding the effects of land use comparing exotic plantations and native forest on water supply soto schönherr and iroumé 2016 reviewed all published studies about interception losses in native forests and commercial plantations in chile finally jones et al 2017 looked at the state of forests in south america and reviewed forest science and practice in the continent while these papers recommended some research actions they were either specific to one topic or too broad to the forest hydrology research variability within chile therefore a comprehensive review with a common research vision is necessary to identify knowledge gaps for future landscape planning and forest management 1 1 objectives approach and reference framework the objectives of this review are i to provide a comprehensive overview of chilean forest hydrology to ii review prior research in forest hydrology in chile and iii to identify knowledge gaps and provide a vision for future research on forest hydrology in chile we summarize 47 years 1975 2022 of research on forest hydrology in chile with a focus on understanding the effects of land cover change from native vegetation to forest plantations and grasslands shrublands on the water cycle and sediment yield at different scales while we focused on chile we expect that this review will contribute to a global understanding of forest hydrology the review is organized as follows i chilean forest hydrology climate hydrology land cover history human impacts in water demands and climate change ii prior research in forest hydrology in chile which addresses questions and topics prevalent in the literature and among stakeholders particularly the community these questions include do forests consume more water than grassland and shrublands in chile do plantations consume more water than native forest in chile do eucalyptus plantations use more water than pinus plantations in chile how do plantations affect peak flow and low flow how does the water balance of plantations and native forest vary across the plantation management cycle how do plantations and their management affect water quality the answer to these questions form the basis for iii filling knowledge gaps and a vision for the future of chilean forest hydrology we used web of science and google scholar to find articles to include in this review using search strings including chile land cover change chile water balance chile forest hydrology chile hydrology native forest chile evapotranspiration plantations native forest and looking for terms related to runoff low flow baseflow transpiration interception throughfall and stemflow suspended sediment yield forest plantation water quality forest management sediment and water and modelling and climate change streamflow and water balance topics the studies were grouped by the main areas of consensus and questions that emerge from the global research on forest hydrology and their application in chile namely 1 forests use more water and yield less streamflow than annual pastures or dryland non irrigated and agriculture olivera guerra et al 2014 van dijk and keenan 2007 farley et al 2005 zhang et al 2001 2 exotic plantations appear to consume more water than native forest and reduce streamflow but this result is less universal than the comparison between forest and grassland or shrublands e g galleguillos et al 2021 smethurst et al 2015 3 eucalyptus plantations appear to use more water and the resulting streamflow reduction is more pronounced than that has been observed in pinus radiata plantations e g scott and lesch 1997 4 removal of forest cover increases streamflow bosch and hewlett 1982 hornbeck et al 1993 ice and stednick 2004 jones and post 2004 brown et al 2005 jones et al 2009 dai et al 2010 lara et al 2021 resulting in larger peak flows beschta et al 2000 buttle et al 2019 and increases the sediment export from catchments or logged stands safeeq et al 2020 gomi et al 2005 5 the effect of minor forest disturbances such as thinning pruning or disease control are often difficult to detect at the catchment scale therefore stand scale studies are more appropriate for detecting change on hydrological processes e g nikooy et al 2020 similarly to a partial afforestation the removal of 20 of a catchment cover appears not to be detectable in paired catchment studies brown et al 2005 6 the presence of forest cover plays an important role in the reduction of soil erosion and sediment loss see marden 2012 but the difference between the cover of different forest types is still unclear e g pizarro et al 2020 especially when different soil parental materials and the lithology of the headwater catchment are considered e g bywater reyes et al 2017 7 even though the effects of land cover and forest management on low flows are usually associated with a reduction of stream flows e g coble et al 2020 perry and jones 2017 iroumé and palacios 2013 the direction of change magnitude and the scale of the impact on catchment water storage appear to be unclear and highly site specific e g goeking and tarboton 2020 8 climate change will exacerbate the hydrological responses in forested catchment with decreasing streamflows due to higher evapotranspiration requirements of trees with higher temperatures and when decreases in precipitations are projected e g galleguillos et al 2021 martínez retureta et al 2021 our review includes but distinguishes between measurements made at the plot scale stand scale and catchment scale the implications of discrepancies between studies made at different scales are discussed this collaborative document brings together the active and diverse national forest hydrology community to agree on priorities for supporting science for policy makers and the sustainable management of water resources 2 an overview of the chilean forest hydrology 2 1 climate and hydrology chile has 18 köppen geiger climate types beck et al 2018 the distribution of which is affected by latitude and topography fig 1 a a common feature in all these climatic zones is that the rainfall is concentrated in winter annual rainfall increases from 100 mm at semiarid latitudes 30 s to 3 000 mm at temperate latitudes about 40 s fig 1b orographic effects create zones of high and low rainfall one example is the coastal range where the highest peak 1 300 m asl of the nahuelbuta range 37 s creates an area of very high rainfall gonzález and garreaud 2019 fig 1b south central chile has four main topographic features moving from west to east through the coastal plain the coastal mountain range the intermediate depression or central valley and the andes mountain range with altitudes above 5 000 m this topography influences precipitation and temperature and therefore the distribution of vegetation along the latitudinal 17 s to 56 s range chile comprises 101 basins fig 1c according to chile s general water department dga of these 101 basins 88 are covered by forest including commercial plantations the hydrological regimes of these basins include rain dominated snow dominated and a mix of both mcphee 2018 the intermediate depression the coastal plains and the coastal mountain range are mainly rain dominated with some snow dominated areas in the higher peaks of the coastal mountain range such as the nahuelbuta range the basins in the andes are mainly snow dominated and where water is stored as snow in winter and released in spring to feeding springs and rivers that flow to the pacific ocean most summer flows are sourced from water storage of the 101 defined basins the average annual precipitation is 1 525 mm and the mean runoff is 1 220 mm dirección general de aguas 2016 boisier et al 2018 reported negative trends in rainfall in central and south central chile during the last four decades in the last two decades chile has experienced one of the driest periods on record boisier et al 2016 in the last decade an unprecedented megadrought has affected an extensive latitudinal range 30 s to 38 s with reduced rainfall of about 40 below the long term average garreaud et al 2017

strand boards and sawn timber or for firewood production often with poor management practices lara et al 2006 2009 2018 the mediterranean and the valdivian native forest in south central chile are one of the 35 biodiversity hotspots recognized globally due to their high degree of endemism and the increasing number of threatened species myers et al 2000 mittermeier et al 2004 more than 50 of the

plantations are pinus radiata and 33 are eucalyptus spp mainly e globulus e nitens and e globulus nitens hybrids ministry of agriculture 2021 plantations were introduced in 1907 albert 1907 to control soil erosion that arose from clearing and burning of native forest for agriculture stretching back to the pre hispanic period pizarro tapia et al 2021a armesto et al 2010 since then large areas of native forest have been logged to produce lumber for mining and cleared for cattle grazing which led to 200 years of intense deforestation concentrated in south central chile armesto et al 2010 land clearing across many areas was largely unplanned and by 1950 19 million hectares of chile were assessed as severely eroded garcía chevesich et al 2017 erosion was particularly severe on the highly erodible metamorphic sediments of the western coastal mountains elgueta and jirkal 1942 and the granite derived soils of the eastern coastal ranges monterrey pine pinus radiata d don were then chosen for reclamation of this severely eroded land in central chile albert 1907 camus 2003 ramírez 1992 erosion continued to worsen into the 1970 s until the chilean government generated incentives for afforestation providing decree law 701 of 1974 jelvez et al 1990 the impetus for the creation of the chilean forestry sector cabaña 2010 the rapid early growth and resultant short rotation lengths of p radiata made it more profitable than other alternatives and gave the chilean forestry sector a competitive advantage over other countries other exotic species were later introduced between 1960 and 1980 and large scale afforestation with these tree species in addition to p radiata ensued fuentealba et al 2021 these exotic species used for reclamation included eucalyptus nitens deane et maiden

plantations has increased by several million hectares in the last 50 years fig 3 a proportion of this area represented substitution of native forest for instance the rio maule cobquecura area ca 600 000 ha around 35 36 s suffered a decline in native forest surface from 21 to 7 1975 2000 which was attributed to exotic plantation expansion echeverría et al 2007 specifically commercial plantations exotic and native forest including forestation and reforestation increased on average around 50 000 ha per year between 2000 and 2010 while the 2015 2019 period this area diminished to ca 2 000 ha per year corporación nacional forestal 2022b available at https www conaf cl nuestros bosques bosques en chile estadisticas forestales food and agriculture organization 2020 thus there is a growing

the heavily forested headwater catchments of the coastal mountain range much of the commercial forestry is also located in these catchments armesto et al 1998 salas et al 2016 fig 2 the establishment of these plantations has resulted in alterations of water quality cuevas et al 2006 2018 hervé fernández et al 2016a oyarzún et al 2007 2015 uyttendaele and iroumé 2002 quantity little et al 2009 2015 and timing of streamflow and spring flow rivas et al 2020 recently the pressure on water resources created by this co location of major population centers with commercial timber pulp production has been intensified by a pronounced drying trend in the local climate runoff generation and water supply could be affected because water demand is projected to increase within this region during the coming decades fernández et al 2018 and that current negative trends of rainfall are expected to increase under climate change scenarios barría et al 2017 bozkurt et al 2018 therefore a detailed knowledge of the water balance of plantations and alternatives with high resolution in time and space are needed to ensure appropriate water resources planning into the future ellison et al 2012 for instance water restrictions were common in rural sectors molinos senante and donoso 2021 water scarcity has been associated with both climate change and water use patterns as important drivers barría

work published using a chilean dataset compared three small catchments 3 4 28 ha in central chile 35 s jones et al 1975 these catchments were covered by small native trees and shrubs and two of them were partially burned this study found that peak flows and sediment yield were higher within the burned catchments in the period immediately after the fire studies regarding water quality and quantity are mainly concentrated between 35 s and 41 s fig 4 of the 73 studies 38 of them 56 minus the extreme south studies below 41 s were conducted in the los rios region i e at least 1 site was located in this region most of the studies were conducted between 2010 and 2022 after 18 years with very few publications fig 5 long term experimental data is very scarce and since 1950 has been focused on

throughfall 3 1 1 partitioning of rainfall among interception throughfall and evapotranspiration effects of forest type interception varies between vegetation and forest types table 1 it is also influenced by rainfall intensity and amount and plantation density and leaf area index in a comprehensive study of canopy interception by plantations and broadleaf species soto schönherr and iroumé 2016 presented interception values for different plantation and native forest ages across a rainfall gradient the average annual interception across all rainfall and forest type combinations was around 21 of rainfall and interception losses were correlated with annual rainfall and basal area results show that broadleaf native forests intercepted more water than pine plantations the reported value matches global observations yue et al 2021 for example frêne et al 2022 found in average a 33 of interception in a native forest plot study in southern chile 42 s ca 2 000 2 500 rainfall there was a higher throughfall in coniferous alerce monterrey pine and douglas fir than in broadleaved forests native and e nitens but no significant differences in a 29 plot study over different land covers across central southern chile huber and iroumé 2001 throughfall was similar in a broadleaf native forest and in planted douglas fir in the southern andes 79 in broadleaved and 72 for douglas fir but interception was higher in douglas fir 22 versus 14 iroumé and huber 2002 however the difference was more attributable to the rainfall type and the meteorological conditions in mature pine plantations near valdivia 39 s average annual canopy interception was 10 but the proportion of canopy interception varied monthly and was negatively correlated with rainfall intensity huber and oyarzún 1983 in a subsequent study in southern chile 39 s interception losses were in the order of 15 and throughfall of ca 85 with all these values also affected by rainfall intensity and amount and the temporal distribution of rainfall huber and oyarzún 1990 in general higher intensity and longer duration rainfall is associated with lower interception as a proportion of rainfall huber and oyarzún 1984 in a more recent study conducted along a rainfall gradient in central chile 35 s 37 s and 39 s the rainfall interception by p radiata on high rainfall sites 2 000 mm was 15 but when rainfall was 1 200 mm interception was much higher at 36 to 40 of annual rainfall huber et al 2008 results of chilean studies on pines and eucalyptus are consistent with global comparison that is for a given rainfall regime the proportion of rainfall intercepted by eucalyptus canopy is lower than the proportion intercepted by a pinus canopy benyon and doody 2015 for instance oyarzún and huber 1999 reported averaged values of 4 4 for e globulus and 3 8 for the p radiata of canopy interception in another pine and e globulus comparison canopy interception varied from 10 to 17 with e globulus the lowest huber et al 2010 in the period following the recent chilean megadrought the proportion of annual rainfall intercepted by 21 year old p radiata and e globulus stands were 15 and 13 of rainfall white et al 2021 and were similar to the range of values observed for the same species in southern australia benyon and doody 2015 3 2 forest evapotranspiration one of the key questions in forest hydrology research is how much water is taken up by forest prior research has examined how evapotranspiration et differs between grasslands shrublands native forest and plantation forests unfortunately there are few published studies that have measured evapotranspiration under forested systems i e white et al 2021 with sap flow sensors and meza et al 2018 and melo et al 2021 with eddy covariance systems all other studies have derived indirectly et from water balance approaches complemented with remote sensing information in a few cases 3 2 1 do forests consume more water than grassland or shrubland in chile in valdivia 39 s south central chile where annual rainfall often exceeds 2 300 mm evapotranspiration was approximately 76 of net precipitation in mature and young pine plantations and only 29 of rainfall in grassland huber et al 1985 when grassland is compared to a native forest in southern chile 38 s 25 km northeast from valdivia evapotranspiration was only 13 of rainfall 3 204 mm between september 1992 and august 1993 in grasslands while it was 33 in native forest echeverría et al 2007 all studies that have compared grassland with plantations in chile have confirmed that runoff from forests is lower than runoff from grass covered catchments huber and lópez 1993 huber et al 1985 other studies have demonstrated lower et values for shrubland and grassland when compared to forest covers this is the case of the study of galleguillos et al 2021 who computed lower et values at the hydrological response unit hru scale for shrublands in south central chile 430 mm in average instead of 709 to 623 mm from pinus radiata using the swat process based model those differences are consistent with results obtained from aster satellite imagery where surface energy models showed similar differences among shrublands and forests for the same study region olivera guerra et al 2014 this study also reported lower water consumption of grassland than forests these higher et values in forest are in agreement with direct measurements of transpiration and et white et al 2020 reported values of 514 mm of evapotranspiration for native forests in central chile 35 s and meza et al 2018 reported values of et obtained from a eddy covariance systems in the order of 150 mm in shrublands in a more arid context 33 s in chile the greatest absolute differences in evapotranspiration between different land uses occur in high rainfall areas table 2 which is consistent with the conclusion of zhang et al 2001 who analyzed studies from around the world table 3 3 2 2 do plantations consume more water than native forest in chile there is now evidence collected at both the catchment iroumé et al 2021 lara et al 2009 and the stand scales white et al 2021 that commercial tree plantations consume more water and consequently release less water downstream than mature native forest the greater water consumption from commercial plantations is particularly high when compared to native forests of north central chile mainly covered by nothofagus species white et al 2021 recently found that trees of e globulus 21 years old in central sites and p radiata 13 years old in dry sites and 21 years old in central sites used a little over 100 mm more water around 5 to 6 of the precipitation per year than native tree species nothofagus obliqua nothofagus glauca 80 years old on average forest in a dry 1 000 mm precipitation and central 1 340 mm precipitation locations within the coastal range at stand scale the greater water consumption of plantations compared to native roble hualo forest type was also observed at catchment scale studies 140 to 1 462 ha for instance lara et al 2009 found a greater annual direct runoff quickflow precipitation as the native forest cover increased old growth and second growth native forest when compared with commercial plantations p radiata e nitens and e globulus gimeno et al 2022 analyzed et dynamics at the hydrological response unit hru scale in a catchment in central southern chile 38 s and showed that the ratio of the actual evapotranspiration eta and rainfall was 70 for tree farms plantations and 50 in native forest table 2 the agreement of catchment and stand scale studies supports the conclusion that native forests consume less water than commercial plantations in central chile while it seems that intensively managed plantations consume on average more water than native forests some empirical studies have not found a significant difference in the water balance between native forest and plantations in fact there is one study that reported greater native forest evapotranspiration 89 of rainfall values than a pinus plantation between 66 and 72 fuentes et al 1994 in the semiarid north central chile 35 s pizarro et al 2005 found that 50 substitution of native forest by plantations in a 264 km2 basin did not affect annual water yield over 40 years however in the same basin a decrease in summer runoff due to the increase in the percentage of plantations was found little et al 2009 in contrast at the wetter end of the rainfall range in central chile 2 000 mm precipitation iroumé and palacios 2013 observed that a 16 substitution of native forest by plantations was sufficient to reduce streamflow in their six large study basins 94 to 1 545 km2 huber et al 2008 study found that net evapotranspiration values varied from 32 of the incoming precipitation in the south 40 s to 55 of the incoming precipitation in northernmost and drier sites 33 s a remote sensing study estimating evapotranspiration on agricultural land native forest plantations and shrubland found that the rates of evapotranspiration in commercial plantations were higher than in native forests and these latter were higher than the mixed forests olivera guerra et al 2014 while these results may appear contradictory when they are considered in the context of the model of zhang et al 2001 some patterns emerge the largest proportional difference between plantations and native forests seems to occur in chile s medium volume rainfall area where the climate wetness index cwi ratio of precipitation to potential evaporation is between 0 8 and 1 2 e g white et al 2021 areas with climate wetness index 0 7 are water limited whereas areas with climate wetness index 1 5 are energy limited these limitations lead to smaller differences in transpiration between species the cwi definition does not mean that differences do not exist in water or energy energy limited areas only that they are more challenging to detect in this sense the study of alvarez garreton et al 2019 reported the same patterns with higher streamflow differences when forest plantations replaced other land cover in drier than in humid catchments tree water sources revealed by stable isotopes in the water molecule i e δ2h and δ18o have shown that native evergreen forests in southern chile use water that has been interpreted as slow or static water and replenished during autumn precipitation events in comparison exotic eucalyptus nitens appear to use more mobile water that is recharged during the year hervé fernández et al 2016b 3 2 3 do eucalyptus plantations use more water than pinus plantations in chile there is a common expectation that plantations of eucalyptus species evapotranspire more water and therefore have a larger effect on streamflow than plantations of p radiata this view is prevalent in both the general public and amongst scientists and is prevalent worldwide given the ubiquity of this view it is surprising that very few papers worldwide have directly compared estimates of evapotranspiration of pinus and eucalyptus plantations in fact we could only find two such publications scott and lesch 1997 benyon and doody 2015 in chile studies that showed greater water use in eucalyptus than pinus were all conducted at the catchment scale e g huber et al 2010 however stand scale measurements did not detect a difference in annual evapotranspiration between e globulus and p radiata within northern 35 s and central 37 s sites white et al 2021 after radial sapflux density corrections these latter authors found annual transpiration values of 492 mm for p radiata and 472 mm for e globulus with no significant differences between tree species turning first to the catchment studies huber et al 2010 measured streamflow in two pine and two eucalyptus catchments 12 6 to 21 1 ha in central chile 37 s and found that catchments with eucalyptus had lower streamflow than those with pine 469 vs 706 mm using the simplified catchment scale equation p q e t δ s and assuming no change in storage huber et al 2010 calculated an average evapotranspiration of 1 468 mm for the e globulus rainfall was 2 060 mm and 1 384 mm for pinus rainfall was 1 930 mm it is not possible to test for statistical significance of this difference but these amounts of water may be important the priestley taylor potential evaporation for the area where these measurements were made is 1 300 mm so these estimates of evapotranspiration give crop factors of about 1 1 for both species these results suggest that some water may have been passing below the measurement v notch weirs in these catchments or that soil storage increased by around 100 mm in the measurement year thus the absolute values of streamflow should be treated cautiously but they may be important and should be corroborated by other studies in a recent stand scale comparison white et al 2021 measured much lower rates of annual evapotranspiration than huber et al 2010 in stands of e globulus and p radiata species 745 mm in e globulus and 731 mm in p radiata and found no difference between these species the white et al sites were about 60 km north of the huber et al 2010 sites in central chile 37 s but with about 500 mm less rain per year white et al 2021 observed that annual water use et by both species e globulus and p radiata was around 740 mm about 60 of rainfall but that water use by e globulus was very rapid early in spring while p radiata deferred water use until later in the dry season not all catchment studies have shown differences between the water balances of eucalyptus and pinus covered catchments an analysis of water storage within 15 catchments 7 411 ha in central southern chile 37 s with different land cover pine eucalyptus and mixed showed highly variable results barrientos and iroumé 2018 in these studies plantation density age growth and soil water storage were all correlated with water consumption in the same study rainfall and elevation were the main drivers of catchment storage capacity in the same location and at 11 of the 15 catchments described above another study reported a greater reduction in deep percolation under eucalyptus than under pinus iroumé et al 2021 also after 10 years of streamflow measurements iroumé et al 2021 did not find significant differences between eucalyptus and pinus covered catchments however the age of the pine plantations was greater than the usual commercial harvesting rotation 21 33 years old for example huber and trecaman 2004 at plot scale compared evapotranspiration rate net et tree volumetric increase of p radiata within a latitudinal gradient 35 s 37 s and 39 s and at same age 11 15 years old the highest evapotranspiration rates were found in the northern and driest sites the observation of differences between catchments may not be inconsistent with the absence of differences at the catchment scale also catchment studies integrate all the land uses in a catchment it is possible that areas not occupied by plantations such as the riparian edges behaved differently in eucalyptus and pinus covered catchments due to the different water use seasons i e e globulus used water much more rapidly in spring than p radiata while p radiata used more water than e globulus late in summer white et al 2021 whatever the reasons for the apparent differences between catchment and stand studies in chile and elsewhere it is crucial that the results across scales are reconciled most easily using a combination of long term catchment datasets particularly actual evapotranspiration measurements along streamflow and soil moisture combined with remotely sensed data and modelling approaches 3 3 streamflow in forested catchments differences in transpiration between forest types can lead to variation in streamflow and in the extent of the effect of land use change and forest management on low flow peak flow streamflow and the catchment water balance alvarez garreton et al 2019 fitted a regression model to runoff data from 25 forested catchments and the proportion of land cover they showed that annual runoff decreased with increased plantation of 10 000 ha by between 2 2 and 7 2 across a gradient of rainfall from higher to lower pizarro et al 2022 found contrasting results in a study based of 42 large catchment 200 to 24 000 km2 mainly covered by native forest plantation or a mix of both and showed similar streamflow even in a period of low rainfall see esse et al 2021 for similar results using swat hydrological model 3 3 1 how does the water balance of plantations and native forest vary across the plantation management cycle 3 3 1 1 plantation management most of the results summarized in section 3 2 are concerned with annual catchment and stand water balances measured at a particular time within a rotation the management or life cycle is very different for different types of native forest and particularly for pine and eucalyptus plantations in chile the forestry operations and natural disturbances e g effect of wildfires over the water balance in balocchi et al 2020 2022a and white et al 2020 that occur during the life cycles of native forests and plantations may all change the water balance and therefore affect the water supply for other users the comparison between forest types at different life stages is limited for chile and elsewhere in the world but there have been several studies in each forest type under consideration perhaps the most dramatic operation in a plantation s life cycle is the harvest after harvesting pinus plantations are replanted with improved site matched genotypes while plantations of eucalyptus can be either replanted or allowed to re sprout from stumps in general streamflow increases for a period after the harvest of a pinus plantation after harvesting of 79 of a p radiata plantation that covered 34 4 ha catchment in southern chile 39 40 s runoff increased by 110 compared to pre harvest mean iroumé et al 2006 and in another study of the same 34 4 ha runoff increased significantly for four years after harvesting and this runoff increase persisted for over eight years iroume et al 2010 in a similar high rainfall area 39 s p radiata used about 13 less water after harvest than before but continued to use more water than the neighboring grassland huber and lópez 1993 however a more recent study did not observe marked increase in runoff after harvesting of either 20 22 old year pine or 7 8 old year eucalyptus catchments in central chile iroumé et al 2021 in chile we lack data quantifying the effect of initial stocking or thinning on either stand or catchment scale water balance in one plot scale study evapotranspiration estimated in low medium and high tree densities of an 8 year old e nitens plot was 79 77 and 71 of annual rainfall huber et al 1998 while in a similar study of two densities of 12 year old p radiata in central chile 37 s net evapotranspiration was similar in both stands huber and trecaman 2002 the results for thinning plantations are consistent with results from australia white et al 2014 it is reasonably well established that tree water use increases up to the time of canopy closure less than four years in eucalyptus and seven to nine years in pinus e g white et al 2010 this pattern of water use by plantations was also found in a study in e globulus in chile where evapotranspiration rates values were up to 30 of the annual rainfall in the first year and to 58 in the third year of measurements oyarzún and huber 1999 3 3 1 2 native forest several studies have observed increased runoff associated with wider riparian buffers of native forest e g alvarenga et al 2017 little et al 2015 estimated that for each increase of 1 m in the width of the native forest riparian buffer runoff increased by 1 4 in southern chile 39 s in a northernmost site iroumé et al 2021 found that in central chile 37 s catchments with a wider native forest buffer not only yielded more water but were also more resilient to drought there is little information from around the world on the water balance of recently planted native forest lara et al 2021 in a decadal restoration study from eucalyptus cover to native forest in southern chile in a high rainfall area near valdivia 39 s found that after 9 years of native forest growth within 3 catchments of 3 74 3 43 and 4 28 ha streamflow and baseflow increased gradually when compared to the eucalyptus plantation streamflow 5 26 ha frêne et al 2020 analyzed the effects of different successional native forest stages near valdivia 39 s on streamflow they found a greater streamflow in the old growth catchment compared to a secondary 110 old year forest and shrub covered catchments within the same study site frêne et al 2021 analyzed streamflow yield at different rainfall intensities they found a greater streamflow in a secondary forest than in old growth forest and dense scrub vegetation within a high rainfall intensity in another study in an old growth patagonian rainforest 42 s stand evapotranspiration was greater than that of a younger stand gutiérrez et al 2014 in an andean range native forest water balance study around 5 000 mm rainfall in southern chile 39 s oyarzún et al 2011a compared seven stands of evergreen deciduous and mixed native forest species pristine harvested unmanaged and managed a relationship was found between the structure of the forests and the rainfall partitioning throughfall stemflow and interception for instance interception varied from 11 to 36 median monthly with one of the evergreen pristine stands with the highest interception values and the harvested evergreen stand with the lowest these results suggest that revegetation with native forest will enhance streamflow regardless of which type of mature forest is replaced 3 3 2 how do plantations affect peak flow and low flow while the effects of native forests and different plantation species on annual streamflow are important for large scale water planning the effect on summer or low streamflow is more important for the rural communities which extract water directly from streams and wells within and near the forests peak storm flows and the rate of recession are important hydrological parameters that can be used in the prediction of low or summer flow e g eng and milly 2007 3 3 3 low flows baseflow and summer flows the establishment of plantations has generally been associated with reduced summer december to march flow and baseflow oyarzún and huber 1999 replacement of native forest with pine plantations can reduce streamflow in summer by as much as 28 although in some cases pine has also been associated with an increase in flow 359 l s 1 km 2 in pine and 274 l s 1 km 2 in native forest in high rainfall period near valdivia otero et al 1994 lara et al 2009 developed a relationship considering six 140 to 1 462 ha catchments between proportional native forest cover and summer flow and found that a 10 increase in native forest cover resulted in a 14 increase in average summer flow relative to that coming from commercial plantations the same difference was found in larger catchments in central chile e g little et al 2009 but other authors did not find significant differences in the other larger catchments in south central chile 38 s e g iroumé and palacios 2013 while most studies show that plantation expansion and land cover change might reduce flows during the summer months january february and march there are some exceptions in the literature one way of quantifying the effect of a change in land cover on streamflow responses and baseflow is to fit an exponential decay function to the relationship between flow and time and estimate the decay parameter α in a latitudinal transect 35 to 40 s latitude considering eight 13 to 112 ha catchments in south central chile balocchi et al 2021a showed that α was not affected by forest type p radiata e globulus e nitens and native forest in winter may to september but however more evident but not significantly different between the different forest types including native forest in summer october to april average α values were not significantly different between native forest and pine plantations nor between native forest and eucalyptus spp plantations after harvesting summer streamflow increased over the preharvest values iroumé et al 2005 and this effect of water loss persists for up to seven years after harvesting and re planting iroume et al 2010 3 3 4 peak flows the peak flow in response to a rainfall event is also an important characteristic of the hydrograph which is relevant to rural communities due to potential damage to water supply facilities and water quality issues e g sediment load peak flows are also affected by the establishment and management of plantations when 79 of a 34 4 ha p radiata catchment in southern chile 39 s 40 s was harvested a mean increase in peak flow of 32 was observed iroumé et al 2006 and the effect was similar for winter and summer storms iroumé et al 2005 the post harvesting effect of increased peak flow can persist for up to eight years after replanting iroumé et al 2011 while most studies have observed an increase in peak flows after harvesting at least one example shows no change in peak flow after 80 removal of the pine plantations birkinshaw et al 2011 bathurst et al 2020 found for a 34 4 ha catchment 40 s that at lower rainfall events forest cover may decrease peak discharge but at higher rainfall events forest cover appears to have a lesser effect on the reduction of peak flows which likely depend on the antecedent soil moisture bathurst et al 2022 analyzed the effect of afforestation on peak flow in four 434 1 545 km2 large catchments in southern chile while they found differences when land cover change occurs i e changes in annual evapotranspiration and runoff the effect on peak flows was unclear four studies have compared peak flow among catchments with different forest types and none have observed any differences the latter is true for a comparison of e nitens and younger p radiata iroumé et al 2006 conversion from native forest to plantations pizarro et al 2005 2006 and a meta analysis of data from 42 200 24 000 km2 catchments with native forest plantation and agriculture as land cover pizarro et al 2022 2021 3 4 water quality 3 4 1 how do plantations and their management affect water quality 3 4 1 1 sediment yield and assessment mechanisms we found 21 studies that reported results on forest cover and management effects on sediment transport suspended sediment and or sediment modelling in chile this work commenced in the early 1990 s iroumé 1990 1992 as noted earlier afforestation with p radiata was an important strategy for controlling erosion and soil loss from land previously cleared for agriculture toro and gessel 1999 forest cover including p radiata stands of different ages and management and second growth n obliqua stands were found to reduce sediment yield 97 5 in native forest to 94 in pine plantations relative to agricultural land cover ibarra et al 1996 the native forest stands had the lowest erosion rates otero et al 1994 results from comparisons between plantation types and comparison between plantations and native forest are variable and seem very dependent on the age and successional stage of the plantation at hillslope scale annual soil loss was in general not significantly different between native forest and plantations five treatments two 1 year old two mature and one harvested stand in south central chile 37 s but soil loss was highest from the youngest 1 year old pine plantations aburto et al 2021 at the catchment scale 200 km2 sediment exports decreased after plantation establishment pizarro et al 2020 in one comparison between pine and e globulus plantations pine yielded more sediment than eucalyptus huber et al 2010 but again this may be so because canopy closure in pine occurs at a later growth stage when an e globulus planted catchment was compared to a native forest suspended sediment was a bit higher in e globulus 368 kg ha 1 than native forest 305 kg ha 1 and these differences were due to fact that the plantation was recently established so it was in a transition from prairie to plantation oyarzún et al 2011b however other results showed no significant differences between the pre and post harvest sediment yield in southern chile in e globulus catchments cuevas et al 2018 yet this same study agreed with the minimum requirement for native forest riparian strips 22 m wide for catchment protection for post harvesting sediment yield although little et al 2015 concluded that an increasing width of riparian native forest can diminish nutrient loss within a study of native forest stages near valdivia old growth shrubs and successional forest frêne et al 2021 found a greater suspended sediment yield from catchments cover with shrub vegetation than in catchments cover with old growth and secondary forest in summary we found no measurable difference between the sediment yield from closed canopy plantations 7 years and native forest but before canopy closure more sediment can enter stream from plantations than from undisturbed native forest the distribution of harvesting operations in catchments and the management of harvesting residues will both have important consequences for reducing the potential for sediment transport after harvesting plantations a comparison of harvested and undisturbed p radiata oyarzún and peña 1995 found that soil losses were much more significant from the harvested area than from the unharvested area as the harvested area produced greater runoff oyarzún 1993 found greater soil loss when residues burning was performed after clearcutting it was also found that microtopography acts as the first order control of runoff generation and erosion processes in a small scale rainfall simulation study in central chile mohr et al 2013 mohr et al 2014 within 3 small catchments 12 9 ha in south central chile annual suspended sediment increased between increased by 46 86 after clearcutting of p radiata compared to an uncut control iroume et al 2010 studied the sediment yield within three small catchments 94 12 and 17 ha in southern chile and they found a greater sediment load in the catchment with the lowest plantation cover 33 of p radiata and eucalyptus and the lowest sediment load in the bigger plantation area 81 eucalyptus in another study before and after harvesting within a small p radiata catchment 34 4 ha 40 s measurements were not conclusive regarding the effects on sediment yield birkinshaw et al 2011 in a paired catchment sediment study schüller et al 2021 analyzed forest activities harvesting and replanting they found that the stream channel was the main source of sediment load pre harvest and a catchment with forest activities yielded twice as much sediment compared to the control catchment this higher sediment load was due to the activation of catchment slopes and forest roads for example from a sediment core analysis in the lanalhue lake in central chile 37 s alaniz et al 2021 found a correlation of the increasing erosion and organic matter content within this lake and the afforestation with exotic plantations within the last 30 years tracers have frequently been used to study hydrological processes biogeochemistry and sediment sources at plot and catchment scale among the most used tracers in chile fallout radionuclides frn have been used to trace and fingerprint sediment sources schüller et al 2013 characterized sediment sources in a p radiata covered catchments under a low 1 200 mm yr 1 and high 2 500 mm yr 1 rainfall regime using 137cs and 210pbex the relative contribution after harvest from slopes increased from 16 to 25 while the contribution from road increase from 37 to 45 bravo linares et al 2020 studied sediment sources in different land covers history they found a greater sedimentation processes in forestry activities compared to wheat land cover however wheat farmland added an important sediment contribution in the 1950 s and 1970 s recently studies using compound specific stable isotopes cssi done by bravo linares et al 2018 and muñoz arcos et al 2021 identified the sediment source within an exotic plantation catchment before and after wildfire the main conclusion was that before the wildfire sediment came mostly from unpaved roads but the hillslope became the dominant source after wildfires similar changes in source contributions associated with clearcutting were documented for the high rainfall regime where the relative contribution of slopes increased from 10 5 to 30 while the contribution from roads grew from 10 to 20 these results indicate that changes in sediment sources are closely related to clearcutting however they are also influenced by the amount of rainfall that occurs after clearcutting the authors emphasize the need to implement better management practices during forest harvesting to reduce the increase in sediment mobilization from catchment slopes and roads which can result in the loss of valuable soil and nutrients from the forest floor causing degradation of the water quality of adjacent streams some of the applied solutions to this problem include using woody debris to create sediment barriers schüller et al 2010 and using riparian strip vegetation to enhance sediment trapping and nutrient retention cuevas et al 2018 little et al 2015 oyarzún et al 2007 oyarzún et al 2011a wang et al 2005 some mathematical modelling has also been applied to suspended sediment in p radiata covered catchments and after forest operations fuentes et al 2001a 2001b found that the best predictive variables in a model to predict suspended sediments were monthly precipitation water discharge truck traffic and forest road length 3 5 hydrological modelling and climate change although empirical studies of forest hydrology and ecohydrology are made under a unique set of climatic and hydrogeological conditions their results have helped to feed hydrological models i e for calibration purposes this section looks at the process based modelling that has been done in chile to analyze and disentangle the effects of land use change and climate trends in the local forests and their hydrology table 3 in general hydrological modelling is scarce in chile particularly it has been performed through two models i e a physically based distributed precipitation runoff model swat and tetis an exception is flores et al 2021 study who analyzed the performance of three 1d lumped hydrological models over four small catchments 22 40 ha with different land cover in south central chile i e native forest monterrey pine and eucalyptus nitens they found the best potential evapotranspiration method for modelling streamflow within catchments as well the best hydrological model i e gr6j using the swat model at a mesoscale andean watershed with changes in land use in central chile it was predicted that the mean annual discharge increased 7 under agriculture from that under native forest and decreased 10 under pine plantation management stehr et al 2010 in the same catchment the effect of future climate on streamflow particularly during summer was modelled and this indicated that from 2018 to 2028 and then to 2038 trends of reduced rainfall will cause a further reduction in streamflow from the present levels aguayo et al 2016 and in some scenarios reductions in summer flow of up to 50 were predicted another swat study about the effect of land cover change in central chile indicated that a decrease in annual streamflow within the three scenarios studied plantation coverage from 35 to 63 for 1986 2001 and 2011 with an increased evapotranspiration and surface flow and a reduced percolation and lateral flow martínez retureta et al 2020 gimeno et al 2022 used swat to simulate the effect of an earlier application of forest conservation policies in a large catchment 1 026 km2 in southern chile within three scenarios baseline native forest recovery protection and pristine they found little differences in inflow from baseline of 0 3 in the native forest recovery scenarios and 3 5 within the pristine scenario however larger differences are obtained reaching until 3 1 and 21 2 during the dry summer periods climate change analysis was introduced in the study of martínez retureta et al 2021 also with swat where various components of the hydrological cycle in two 299 651 km2 large catchments located in the foothills of the andes 38 s the model predicted increases in average annual evapotranspiration of 5 6 a decrease in percolation of 9 10 a reduction of surface flow of 2 and 7 8 increase in depth to groundwater these changes were associated with 5 decrease in streamflow in the same catchments the disentangling of land cover and climate changes effect on hydrological variables was investigated by galleguillos et al 2021 also using swat and results showed that change from shrubland to pine plantations decrease the annual mean streamflow between 2 5 and 17 3 according to the amount of cover replaced in a coastal semi arid catchment in central chile the study also forecast an increase in water yield of between 2 and 11 when pine was removed from the catchment headwater although when future climate change scenarios are mixed with land use changes annual streamflow decreases are much more severe and predicted to be between 23 and 46 according to contrasting climate change projections and the same land cover replacement scenarios galleguillos et al 2021 a simulation of trends for three forest management scenarios over 25 climate scenarios within eight forested catchments in the south central chile using tetis vélez et al 2005 indicated that smaller catchments 20 ha in the drier scenarios deliver more streamflow when reducing the forest cover either plantations or native forest larger catchments 50 ha in all climate scenarios deliver more water when full forest cover is present these results show how climate change i e reduction of rainfall and or increasing evapotranspiration significantly influenced water yield barrientos et al 2020 4 a vision for chilean forest hydrology research gaps identification here we summarize the primary research gaps that we have identified from this review in brackets is specified each research gap found 1 long term ecosystem research lter sites the only two publicly available and continuous dataset from small catchments 100 km2 are balocchi et al 2021b which comprises data from ten 5 to 112 ha catchments in southern central chile private catchment network since 2008 https www hydroshare org resource 4b517deaa07243aa8c46a58646dd4281 and lara et al 2021 which comprises data from four 3 43 to 5 26 ha catchments in southern chile since 2006 https www cr2 cl datos cuencas restauracion reservavaldiviana a detailed description of the catchments under research provides a comprehensive 1 forest structure characterization soil types root densities and other available characteristics which is uncommon in national forest studies however each dataset relies in streamflow and very little extra information i e rainfall is collected more widely available data sets of these variables would help standardize studies and expand understanding of forest dynamics and water resources at a regional and national scale the camels dataset alvarez garreton et al 2018 holds hydrological variables such as daily streamflow rainfall from different sources reference evaporation eto and the land uses within each large catchment https doi org 10 1594 pangaea 894885 however this dataset is the only one with free access in the country at landscape level monitoring despite the numerous small catchments most of them paired monitored by government and private institutions the majority below to the privates most water balance data are for closed canopy plantations and mature native forests therefore there is an urgent need to quantify the water balance and its variables at plot stand and catchment scale of young stands of native species and plantations the quantification of the water balance is needed to support vegetation recovery programs and to integrate space and time to scale the effects of plantations on water balance in addition to designing catchments with a range of plantation ages to mitigate risks to the local water supply therefore these lter sites should collect data and information for from 2 water demands from forested catchments 3 streamflow change among land cover the 4 effects on timing and seasonality of peak flows between land covers and the 5 availability of small catchment data within the country 2 sediment and water quality given the widely known impact of forest roads on stream water quality there is a surprising lack of studies on roads and their relationship to water inputs and sediment to streams forest activities require roads gullies etc and their impact on water resources is still poorly known even though these are the primary sources of sediment yield within forested catchments e g marden et al 2014 while there are few research studies on sediment production in native forest and plantations e g pizarro et al 2020 many more are needed there is a gap in quantification of sediment production within forested catchments in the country another gap is the effect on water quality of forest activities such as pruning thinning logging terrestrial and aerial and harvesting as well as the size necessary for buffer zones thus 6 the effect of the forest operations impacts over water quality site specific i e slopes soil types etc and 7 forest roads and its relationship with water and sediment yield peak flows is required 3 unknown forest groundwater systems despite the attempts by some papers to address groundwater topics no boreholes exist in any forest catchments in the country also the national hydrogeologic map is at a scale of 1 1 000 000 servicio nacional de geología y minería 2003 that makes it difficult to develop more complex studies at this resolution especially within small catchments surface groundwater interactions are also unknown as well as the relationship between soil water storage and the soil vegetation complex detailed catchment studies require detailed digital elevation models and detailed geology thus increasing the resolution of the national hydrogeologic map would greatly assist attempts to understand the groundwater and the vadose zone additionally it would significantly enhance progress if each new activity in monitored catchments includes activities such as geophysics soil survey etc to verify and estimate below ground characteristics thus we need better known 8 aquifer configuration and surface groundwater interactions 9 forest groundwater systems within coastal range e g detailed geology geophysics and 10 the effects on timing and seasonality of low flows and link to meteorological droughts 4 lack of knowledge of soil properties in the andes and coastal range in chile there is only information on soils in the agricultural zones and therefore we have severe limitations in undertaking hydrological studies in forested catchments there is a clear need for increased focus on soil properties studies and especially of native forest and plantations soils where to our knowledge there has been little or no previous work see soto et al 2019 study for soil physical properties in different land covers in fact although the natural resources information centre of chile ciren soil database the only publicly available dataset in chile covers around 24 of the chilean territory padarian et al 2017 with an inadequate cover of native forest and plantation zones additionally since private forest companies usually have valuable information such as lidar data and several soil properties derived from soil pits the science would be greatly enhanced if such data and products were more widely available then the 11 soil physico chemical and hydropedological properties of soils the 12 erosion control soil activities i e evaluation of tillage trenches etc is required for example a follow up study of huber and trecaman 2000 would have been valuable knowledge regarding soil water distribution under pine plantation 5 development recovery of soils under forest cover most of the forest plantations were previously planted on land with wheat crops native forest or were heavily burned for agriculture and settlement expansion there has been some research regarding soil characteristics see soto et al 2019 and cifuentes croquevielle et al 2020 however there is not a single study on soil recovery from wheat burned land on the coastal range which later was afforested or under forest restoration as with hydrology time matters and the effect of changes in soil properties can take several years or even centuries to become apparent andréassian 2004 therefore 13 soil properties evolution should be carefully studied to determine whether afforestation can recover water storage and carbon sequestration properties of these soils 6 extent of the effect of forest management and restoration it has been a common approach in small catchment research to focus mainly on the effect of harvesting activities on streamflow however there is a lack of connections between large catchments and the effect of land cover change and other activities over the hydrological processes or the scaling effects from small catchments to large river basins water resources management in the public sector usually applies over large watersheds 100 km2 it has been discussed that extrapolating from small to large scale catchments can produce errors in the hydrological estimation kirchner 2006 and therefore when relying on observations at the small scale in policy making strategies additionally an important topic is the ecological restoration and its effect on the water cycle we are aware of only one study regarding hydroecological restoration i e lara et al 2021 in chile the 14 extent of the effect of forest management and restoration and 15 plantation densities and its effect in et is require coping the effect of forest management 7 riparian buffer effects while riparian vegetation effects have been studied for impacts on water quality and biotic composition before and after forestry activities e g fierro et al 2017 guevara et al 2018 or riparian restoration for forest fauna connectivity e g rojas et al 2020 the effects of riparian zones on streamflow in forested catchments has been poorly explored in chile i e little et al 2015 although riparian strips are part of stream management and land use activities so the effect on streamflow of a new riparian zone or an increase or reduction of such versus a young or old plantation riparian zone is still not well understood segura et al 2020 also the 16 native forest structure and composition in riparian zones and its effect over water balance and sediment yield is also required 8 native forest ecohydrological effects little is known regarding 17 native forest water balance within chile we can see that there are not many studies in native forest in the central zone e g huerta et al 2019 balocchi et al 2020 nor in sclerophyllous forest or in sectors of pristine native forests in the central coastal mountain range e g galleguillos et al 2021 as an alternative land use to plantations the gap in native forest studies and their hydrological function should be addressed and particularly regarding the effects of climate change 9 climate change effects on water resources and land use change we have strong evidence of the effects of climate change in chile garreaud et al 2017 2020 on precipitation and temperature patterns however very little is known about its effect on water resources within forested and afforested catchments particularly in central southern chile while there are three studies that involve climate change and land use change i e barrientos et al 2020 martínez retureta et al 2020 galleguillos et al 2021 they are recent denoting a lack in our knowledge in future climate scenarios additionally we have not explored how land use change will impact regional climate precipitation temperature and humidity and how this impact will interact with climate change and the hydrologic cycle salazar et al 2015 special attention should be given to the trade off between carbon and water cycle since tree planting is proposed as a strong mitigation option to climate change bastin et al 2019 thus the 18 effect of climate change over a bigger number of catchments the 19 understanding of the tradeoff water yield and carbon sequestration and 20 a multimodel approach for a decision support system for public policies is required 5 towards a collective vision for the future of chilean forest hydrology research overall the science in the chilean forest hydrology literature was found to be consistent with other studies worldwide for instance after a review of up to 75 scientific papers on hydrology in chile a an increasing water yield was found in all studies after harvesting or forest cover removal which is similar to other findings worldwide e g bosch and hewlett 1982 similar findings in b peak flows increasing after forest canopy removal harvesting to other studies e g beschta et al 2010 and consequently a c detriment in water quality as well e g safeeq et al 2020 also most paired watershed studies have focused on the effect of forest harvest and regeneration on streamflow mcdonnell et al 2018 however these studies are small in spatial scale 100 km2 and therefore there is no quantifiable expression of the hydrogeological variability nearly all paired watershed studies show an initial increase in streamflow after forest harvest followed by a gradual decline as forests regenerate and in many cases seasonal or annual water yield falls below water yield in the reference catchment see goeking and tarboton 2020 despite these similarities to other studies there remain questions on the hydrological relationships between our mediterranean climate ecosystems the complex geology and topography in chile predicting the impacts of forestry on catchment processes and their associated effects on water flow is complicated and climate variability sometimes hides the cause effect relationships that can exist between forest and streamflow thus hindering or misinterpreting the effects of management forest on the water resources alila and beckers 2001 hence there is the need for attribution studies to disentangle impacts of different factors on the water balance at the catchment scale given this background field measurements should be complemented with numerical modeling which helps to understand better the cumulative effects of forest management on watersheds ziemer et al 1991 dunne 2001 from a scientific perspective models are important tools that help to interpret data and relationships between measurements at the plot and watershed scales hillel 1986 and provide a medium to test our hypotheses and understanding of catchment processes modelling also provides an opportunity at minimal costs and time to investigate forest management effects on the water resources currently there are numerous reviews of hydrological models with a marked emphasis on being able to interpret effects across forest management or climate change pike 2003 2007 hutchinson 2007 werner and bennett 2009 which allows improved decision making and reduced negative effects of forests on water resources we propose five key elements to advance a cross scale collaborative effort to use new nation wide catchment scale networks to promote common and complementary techniques in these studies and to conduct transdisciplinary research to advance sound planning of forest lands in chile we strongly believe that the chilean forest hydrology field can contribute not only locally but globally especially in the context of climate change and the ndc framework in the following section we discuss research gaps and we propose a research agenda a long term ecosystem research lter sites small catchment 100 ha datasets have provided insightful knowledge regarding basic understanding on the land use change over the hydrologic cycle therefore the implementation of a permanent monitoring program in small catchments with all the equipment needed to collect detailed field data on the water cycle variables and complementing these in larger catchments to capture hydrogeologic signals that in small catchments are not possible the latter might be the case in soft rock systems and in areas where there has been much tectonic activity such as chile muñoz et al 2016 these should represent different forest conditions across the country from catchments with native forest central zone to catchments with only plantations whenever possible with this information process based models can be implemented to study the effects of climate change and land cover change with greater precision to identify resilient landscapes additionally an intense program collecting rain stream soil and other water sources samples for isotope analysis oxygen 18 deuterium tritium etc which will add relevant information regarding water sources and ages e g cartwright et al 2018 dynamic distribution of tree water sources is an active field in hydrological sciences and should be further studied stable isotopes provide a myriad of simple yet significant information which could help provide reliable data to stakeholders to be informed and decide regarding catchment water management decisions stable isotope signatures have been used to calculate the proportion of water that has been evaporated from soil gibson et al 1993 liu et al 2006 tsujimura and tanaka 1998 although these estimations were yearly the cost and processing time of these analyses has fallen significantly in recent years and providing accurate and meaningful quantities this would be a very worthwhile component of a monitoring program in this regard a network of several catchments monitors across the country can provide a unique dataset with the collaboration of several institutions universities research centers and the government that can join in a multidisciplinary program this will involve hydrologists soil scientists ecophysiologists among other disciplines for instance the forest hydrology program from arauco balocchi et al 2021b and cmpc timber companies e g dataset in iroumé et al 2021 the forest institute infor forest and water program and some others private forest companies such as masisa data not published the drinking water companies i e essbio and the forecos foundation ong for the native forest conservation therefore a robust hydrology database developed with the private sector and the national universities should be created as an open database e g hydroshare website the participation of the community and general public in the research is necessary a community forest hydrology program could expand the current knowledge of forest systems in the coastal range community data into a central location data sharing and a long term monitoring such as long term ecological research network lter critical zone observatories research and application ozcar ri in france critical zone observatories czo in the usa etc b emerging technologies that can be applied in hydrology open an opportunity to fill in gaps remote sensing is a valuable and precise tool to study the water budget lillo saavedra et al 2021 since in chile there are large areas of forest and plantations this tool will help us to cover larger areas that are not possible to cover with plots or small catchments it would be possible to understand larger areas and how can influence water cycle its utility includes the transport and storage of water snow and water vapor in the soil plant atmosphere system and addresses the complex interaction between forest vegetation and the abiotic system e g water uptake by roots which is controlled by atmospheric conditions and photosynthetic activity of plants however remote sensing is only a tool measuring from a great distance and requires careful ground truthing to convert large scale images to quantitative measures of ground conditions and processes to understand and predict energy driven processes such as evapotranspiration or snowmelt it is necessary to know the radiation and energy balances of a forest watershed for example cubesats can estimate river flow junqueira et al 2021 satellite borne gnss r for soil moisture measurements li et al 2021 or other novel remote sensing data to determine reservoir characteristics guan et al 2021 high accuracy lidar products can address important questions such as forest growth canopy and branch structure jaskierniak et al 2021 neuville et al 2021 together with forest composition lopatin et al 2015 within large areas it also can be possible to characterize understory riparian and weed plant structure e g tatum and wallin 2021 and detailed geomorphology e g scheip 2021 internet of things iot will also add new insights in forest hydrology through the readily accessible data in real time on any number of environmental attributes new technologies could measure at a high accuracy for example how trees growth transpire and their spectral characteristics valentini et al 2019 another innovation for transpiration measurements is the ribbonized sap flow rsf jones et al 2020 rsf avoids the use of needles or thermocouples inserted in the tree trunk and replaces this with a tape with sensors that is inserted in the trunk avoiding misalignment problems of other equipment ren et al 2017 also advances in mobile mass spectrometry ms will help to reduce the laborious work to analyze environmental traces in hydrology popp et al 2021a this advance would allow us to involve different techniques to achieve new hydrologic analysis mobile ms in conjunction with radon measurement will help find groundwater seepages to streams or young water travel times popp et al 2021b c a robust strategy for measuring water diversion from streams and rivers the national water directorate dga measures the main rivers in the country and the private water vigilance associations the main irrigations channels agriculture use mainly nevertheless there is a gap in knowledge for small communities that rely on water from headwaters which are most dependent on forest and forested catchments forest companies have been concerned about this issue and now some initiatives have been proposed to guarantee freshwater from forested land e g desafio agua arauco but also from the sites protected by the research community universities and public sector e g simol project for water community management and community based water monitoring involving the people who rely on this resource in this monitoring is essential the participation of the community can be through the well known positive impact of the citizen science kobori et al 2016 that can contribute to expand particularly small catchments dataset e g streamflow and rainfall measurements to improve hydrological modelling for water management d a chilean forest hydrology science group the national science funding institution anid chilean national agency for research and development has no guideline regarding the forest water supply and hydrology monitoring nor a specific expert committee even though an important proportion of the water used by humans in chile comes from forested catchment headwaters e g balocchi et al 2022b for communication we propose to start with an annual conference symposium to generate a national report document as a result this paper should be updated regularly to track improvements and promote collaboration a hydrological knowledge improvement which might be a 2 3 day workshop where the scientific community analyzes what we have done and what type of measurement instruments are held by each group what data to can be shared or further investigated also because there are many chilean experts in the field there is the opportunity to run short courses or summer schools which can improve the local understanding and knowledge in the field to complement all these endeavors a chilean water science society group could be formed as a unified voice for the scientific societies stakeholders and particularly to the local communities taking advantage of ongoing science education program such as explora that systematically approaches primary schools e involvement of stakeholders and the community onto the forest hydrology science a decision support system dss for water managers stakeholder engagement is needed experimental catchments with community stakeholders involvement can ensure that they are understanding how the system behaves in their area this dss should be based on a broader understanding of the landscape in terms of when and where we can plant or restore these activities must include serious efforts in data collection to assure the long term monitoring in order to ensure reliable modeling output results therefore there should be a program in forest hydrology modelling scenarios including future climate and the definition of key indicators for national spatial planning legislation this concerted cooperative effort outlined above should result in better coordination between catchment management and forest laws 6 conclusion the rainfall variation across chile and the history of land uses changes creates a unique natural laboratory in which to study climate change and forest hydrology much of the global understanding of forests and their effect on the water cycle is complemented by this review of chilean studies streamflow from forested catchments increases after harvesting native forests use less water than plantations and native forests yield less sediment than plantation and grassland shrublands however mechanisms that control groundwater flow and availability in forested systems and their differences and how climate change would affect native and plantations ecosystems remain unclear in this regard we found 20 research gaps which are related to lack of basic information particularly in groundwater topics climate the need to improve the understanding of key hydrological processes and the relationship between forests streams and the ecosystem one of our findings is that the southern chile 39 s is intensely studied therefore we propose that the focus for conducting research and developing strategies for managing the trade off between timber carbon and water production should be placed in low rainfall areas including the mediterranean climate area and the boundary with the temperate zone 500 1 000 mm where climate change scenarios project sharply rainfall reductions and thus affecting water resources future research should focus on tackling down groundwater surface water interaction in both native forest and plantations mcdonnell et al 2018 and how plantations rotations and management affect hydrologic cycle and water quality all this must be performed through the formatting and expansion of lter sites across native forest and plantations between different management scenarios and climates always bearing in mind that the conclusions that can be drawn at one spatial scale cannot necessarily be extrapolated to other spatial scales and that more case studies are needed to advance the knowledge of this research topic also to investigate the effects of climate change and land use change and the proportion of both variables affecting water quantity and quality we need also further collaboration between public and private institutions sharing research data sites and results and we need to incorporate in our research proposals and research teams other disciplines to understand our complex forest environment from top to bottom and bottom up approaches e g pizarro et al 2021 fuentealba et al 2021 for example reviewed the impact of forest science in chile but despite the importance of water water resources topic was absent from their analysis traditionally the effects of forests and mainly plantations on downstream water supply have been analysed studying only part of the forest cycle this partial analysis since tree establishment to the final harvest and subsequent reforestation does not allow exploration the relations between forests and water from a larger perspective the use of process based modelling including scenario analysis could tackle this issue alongside measurements however in poorly gauged catchments simplified modelling tools could also represent a valuable solution finally potential downstream effects must be reduced or mitigated to within the framework of hydrosolidarity falkenmark and folke 2002 lima et al 2012 permit to sustain drinking and irrigation water demands declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements we would like to express our gratitude

2549,dewfall is an important source of additional precipitation but it is frequently ignored in water balance calculations in this study the dewfall of 523 weather stations in china was calculated an improved drought index spi cor was proposed by substituting the precipitation with the summation of dewfall and precipitation by the spi calculation method where dewfall was calculated by the penman monteith equation with the gldas 2 data the temporal and spatial distributions characteristics of dewfall were discussed and the spatial applicability of spi and spi cor was determined the results indicated that the dewfall formation is periodic with more than 60 of the dewfall occurring between april and august the amount of dewfall is lower than that of precipitation the dewfall in china has a distribution pattern of high dewfall in the northeast and northwest but low dewfall in the center and south the proportion of dewfall in precipitation increases from south to north with the exception of northwestern china comparing of spi to spi cor the influence of dewfall in arid semi arid sub humid and humid areas declines in turn in accordance with the proportion of dewfall in precipitation of the four regions and is opposite to the correlation coefficients of spi and spi cor dewfall has an average impact of one drought grade on the assessment of drought as long as it works with the performance of spi and spi cor at different weather stations historical drought events and vegetation response to drought spi is better in northeastern china and eastern inner mongolia while spi cor is more applicable in central and northwestern china the difference between spi and spi cor drought grades are not noticeable in southern china therefore adopting spi and spi cor to evaluate drought in different regions can help to make more accurate drought assessment keywords dewfall drought assessment standardized precipitation index spi cor data availability the data used in this study are available from the links provided in this manuscript or upon request from the authors 1 introduction the nocturnal radiative heat loss by a surface leading to vapor condensation results in dewfall xiao et al 2013 small amounts of water formed by dewfall in a short period may have a greatly important impact on biology ecology geomorphology agam and berliner 2006 groh et al 2018 especially in arid and semi arid regions the dewfall in ecology has been researched in past years however its function in drought assessment is still not considered in different climate regions considering dewfall in drought index construction may provide valuable information in drought assessment and mitigation dewfall may have different influences on plants agam and berliner 2006 beysens 2016 it can help with seed germination pan et al 2018 plant longevity flowering and fruiting plant growth and increase aboveground or belowground biomass aguirre gutierrez et al 2019 hao et al 2012 for another thing dewfall on crop leaves can spread diseases and insect pests agam and berliner 2006 living organisms particularly insects and small animals in arid areas agam and berliner 2006 fang 2013 pan and wang 2014 can also obtain liquid water from it jacobs et al 2006 dewfall a crucial input guo et al 2016a for water balance and nutrient cycle in wetland and farmland ecosystems that supplies water for the soil plant system xiao et al 2013 yan et al 2010 makes the difference on the energy balance at the soil plant atmosphere interface pan et al 2018 through promoting the moisture cycle of bare soils dewfall has some effects on the barren landscapes and its micrometeorological conditions agam and berliner 2006 jannis et al 2018 there are currently no international standards for measuring the amounts of dewfall condensing on a given surface jacobs et al 2006 pan et al 2010 zhang et al 2010 the methods are mainly divided into two categories measurement and calculation several methods have been used to directly quantify dewfall such as lysimeters condensing surfaces and the hiltner dewfall balance moro et al 2007 the lysimeter method is considered to be the most precise as it can measure the actual surface dewfall under natural conditions ninari et al 2002 it is measured using direct weighing at the beginning and end of the condensation process zhuang and zhao 2017 measuring dewfall on the artificial surfaces when condensation occurs is another effective approach hao et al 2012 xu et al 2012 surveyed the annual dewfall by woodstick made from poplar tree in sanjiang plain and found that almost daily dewfall occurred in wetland and farmland ecosystems from july to september 2010 with amounts ranging from 30 18 mm to 4 25 mm in wetland soybean land paddy and residential land pan et al 2018 measured the amount of dewfall in the shapotou area of northern china in october 2009 to see how dew formed on different soils shrub species and microhabitats nevertheless the artificial surface materials can often influence the dewfall amounts measured by these methods hao et al 2012 the hiltner dewfall balance is also one of the methods for quantifying dewfall amounts at night jacobs et al 2006 dewfall measurement ideas can also be derived from modeling dewfall potential based on microclimatic conditions and isotopic tracers hill et al 2020 sustainable and long term dewfall experimental research is highly unlikely atashi et al 2020 however methods for dewfall calculation such as eddy covariance ec bowen ratio energy balance breb bowen and the penman monteith equation are superior in terms of calculating a wide range of surface energy flux and obtaining continuous data to determine dewfall duration and quantity beysens 2016 hao et al 2012 zhuang and zhao 2017 the ec method has been widely applied in the dewfall research guo et al 2016b using ec method and a wetness sensor moro et al 2007 discovered that under semi arid conditions actual dewfall accounts for 12 of the precipitation from february to june in 2003 hao et al 2012 illustrated the dew duration and amount in the taklamakan desert in china by the ec system as well as its long term trend wang et al 2019 concluded that dewfall formed on more than 75 days in nine stations of heihe hydrometeorological observation network in 2016 with the monitored dewfall ranging from 6 56 mm to 25 13 mm using the ec method however ec method underestimates the flux during low turbulence periods at night which could lead to an underestimation of dewfall guo et al 2016b based on the environmental factors and the theory of energy balance and water vapor diffusion the penman monteith equation considers the physiological and physical characteristics of crops guo et al 2016b guo et al 2016b used the penman monteith equation to predict the dewfall amounts in a shrubland in northwestern china during growing season assuming that dewfall accounts for 7 2 of rainfall and 8 9 of evapotranspiration respectively they also compared the microlysimeter ec method and penman monteith equation concluding that ec method could bring about an underestimation of dewfall amount whereas the penman monteith equation could calculate it accurately guo et al 2016a dewfall is likely to be the largest part over a week or a month in semi arid and arid areas xiao et al 2009 therefore dewfall occupies an important position in the water cycle drought was previously considered as a lack of precipitation many drought indexes are proposed to describe the characteristics of drought hao et al 2015 palmer drought severity index palmer 1965 abbreviated as pdsi taking antecedent precipitation moisture supply and moisture demand into account to measure cumulative departure in surface water balance yan et al 2014 has been widely used to monitor and analyze droughts wang et al 2022 the standardized precipitation index spi proposed by mckee et al 1993 uses long term precipitation as the primary variable li et al 2016 wu et al 2020 spi can express the dry and wet conditions of the land surface at different temporal scales li et al 2016 being regarded as a reliable indicator of meteorological drought li et al 2020a based on spi the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 was proposed using the water balance concept of climatic water supply and atmospheric evaporation li et al 2020b with regarding temperature as the secondary variable wu et al 2020 spei combined the sensitivity of pdsi to changes in evaporation demand and the robustness of the multi temporal scales of spi li et al 2017 many drought indices have been created to assess drought and most of them are based on the existing study and combined with the regional drought characteristics however dewfall is an important supplementary water source for precipitation and it may affect accurate drought detection in some areas if dew formation is not considered into spi spi may be overestimated in areas where non rainfall water such as dew formation plays an important role therefore the objectives of this paper are to 1 use the penman monteith equation to calculate dewfall and analyze its temporal and spatial distribution characteristics in china from 1975 to 2018 2 compare the spi and the spi cor in which dewfall is used as the supplement to precipitation in the calculation of the spi and discuss the applicability of spi and spi cor in space 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area china is a typical complex terrain area with large area situated in the southeast and middle latitudes of the eurasian continent and lying on the west coast of the pacific ocean liu 2019 wu et al 2015 the terrain of china is high in the west and low in the east the geomorphic types are complex and diverse mainly in mountainous areas mountains can be found in the west while hills and plains can be found in the east the climate soil vegetation hydrology and other environmental conditions differs significantly in time and space liu 2019 yang et al 2008 china is divided into four climate regions by precipitation the area with precipitation less than

et al 2021 2 3 dewfall calculation the penman monteith equation giving consideration to the energy and vapour transport has been widely used in the dewfall formation due to its high accuracy xiao et al 2017 the calculation of dewfall in this study adopts the standardized and unified penman monteith equation guo et al 2016a wang et al 2019 yang 2009 as 1 le 0 408 δ r n g γ c n t s 273 w s e s 0 e

flux was taken as the measured value of dewfall when there is no precipitation the diurnal latent heat net flux is positive upward which is generally attributed to evapotranspiration and the surface water vapor enters the atmosphere through evaporation when the nighttime latent heat net flux is sometimes negative downward it can be attributed to dewfall which is due to the condensation of water vapor in the air resulting in downward latent heat net flux wang et al 2019 the formula for calculating dewfall by latent heat is 8 e l e l where l is the gasification latent heat 2450 kj kg and the negative value e at night is the dewfall mm guo et al 2016a it is considered that dewfall generated on the night without precipitation whether there is precipitation is judged by gldas 2 data the above mentioned 3 h dewfall from 1975 to 2018 is obtained and the daily dewfall is calculated by summation 2 4 spatial interpolation the kriging inverse distance weighted idw anusplin methods were used to perform spatial interpolation of station elements in order to compare the interpolation accuracy and select the optimal strategy to perform high accuracy interpolation shu et al 2011 kriging is a popular interpolation method that is both accurate and simple yu et al 2015 li and wang 2019 as one of the most commonly used spatial interpolation methods tiwari et al 2019 idw robertson 1967 has been applied to interpolate the spatial distribution in the field of hydrology science yang et al 2020 based on thin plate smooth spline interpolation shu et al 2011 anusplin can accurately reflect the spatial distribution of natural elements tan et al 2016 2 5 calculation of spi and spi cor the calculation principle of spi can be seen in mckee et al 1993 the calculation used the spei r library https cran r project org package spei which allows to compute the spi calculation of the spi cor is similar to that of the spi replace the precipitation with the summation of dewfall and precipitation the drought classification based on the spi and spi cor is shown in table 2 general administration of quality supervision inspection and quarantine of the people s republic of china standardization administration 2017 the spi and spi cor are both calculated at 1 month timescale with the meteorological observation data using gamma distribution as the acceptable marginal distribution 2 6 vci calculation the vegetation condition index kogan 1990 permits not only the description of vegetation but also the estimation of temporal and spatial vegetation changes as well as the effects of weather on vegetation zhou et al 2021 the calculation of the vci is shown in equation 9 9 vci 100 ndvi n d v i min ndvi max n d v i min where ndvi ndvimax and ndvimin are the respective monthly ndvi multiyear maximum ndvi and multiyear minimum ndvi for each grid the vci ranges from 0 to 100 indicating that the vegetation condition changes from extremely unfavorable to optimal zhou et al 2021 the vegetation index vci was used as reference when comparing spi and spi cor 2 7 evaluation method of spatial interpolation accuracy six indicators were selected as interpolation performance

calculation in order to verify the accuracy of the calculated dewfall a comparison with the previous research in some small areas was conducted table 3 and the location of dewfall verification station can be seen in fig 2 hao et al 2012 obtained that the dewfall amount on the eastern edge of the taklamakan desert in china from june to october 2011 was 12 87 mm tikanlik station and korla station near taklamakan desert have calculated dewfall values of 9 55 mm and 12 63 mm respectively which are both close to 12 87 mm according to pan et al 2018 the monthly dewfall value of the shapotou desert experimental research station in may 2014 was 1 49 mm while the dewfall value of zhongwei station had a similar calculated value which was 1 01 mm in may 2014 xu et al 2012 measured 30 18 mm of dewfall in sanjiang plain by woodsticks in paddy land from may to october 2010 the dewfall value of fujin station at plain paddy field near sanjiang plain is 27 49 mm which is close to the measured dewfall wang et al 2019 obtained dewfall values of 11 18 mm at dashalong station in 2016 by ec method and the calculated dewfall value of gaotai station is 12 91 mm which is close to that of dashalong station according to the comparison in table 3 the dewfall calculated in this study can be considered reasonable and reliable 3 2 spatial interpolation accuracy evaluation fifty stations were chosen at random from a total of 523 stations then the three interpolation methods were conducted to interpolate the spi cor of the remaining stations nationwide the spi cor at the coordinates of the 50 stations was extracted to evaluate the performance of the three interpolation methods sse mse mae mape rmse and r were calculated for three interpolation methods the average of them is shown in table 4 and the box plots of 6 statistical parameters for the 50 stations are shown in fig 3 the statistical parameters of the three spatial interpolation methods showed that kriging has the highest accuracy for the spi cor spatial interpolation it can be seen from table 4 that the average statistical parameters are the smallest among the three interpolation methods except for r of kriging interpolation which is slightly less than the r of idw according to the box plots in fig 3 the lower and upper quartile for sse mse and rmse of kriging are generally smaller than those of idw and anusplin the upper quartile for mae of kriging is the smallest in the three spatial interpolation methods while the lower quartile for mae of kriging is 0 5536 which is only 0 0062 larger than the smallest lower quartile from idw 0 5474 the lower quartile for mape of kriging is the smallest in the three spatial interpolation methods and the upper quartile for mape of kriging is 3 9066 which is only 0 0112 larger than the smallest upper quartile from idw 3 8953 the lower and upper quartiles for r of kriging are 0 5606 and 0 4545 respectively 0 0142 and 0 0099 less than the largest lower and upper quartiles with 0 5748 from idw and 0 4644 from anusplin the distribution for r of kriging mainly ranges from 0 45 to 0 60 as a result the kriging method is the optimal strategy for spatial interpolation of spi cor 3 3 temporal and spatial distribution of dewfall the average annual total dewfall and precipitation in arid semi arid sub humid and humid areas from 1975 to 2018 were calculated respectively as shown in fig 4 a b with the precipitation calculated using station data it is found that the dewfall values from high to low are sub humid area arid area semi arid area and humid area and the annual average values are 17 86 mm 12 29 mm 12 09 mm and 9 51 mm respectively humid area is mainly distributed in southern china where the temperature is higher whereas dewfall occurs when the temperature falls below the dew point temperature resulting in the smallest amount of dewfall in humid area the dewfall values of arid and semi arid areas are very close only 0 20 mm difference humid area sub humid area semi arid area and arid area are in order of precipitation from high to low with the annual averages of 1219 17 mm 590 94 mm 341 96 mm and 148 08 mm respectively the proportion of dewfall in precipitation varies from high to low with the annual averages of 8 47 3 57 3 06 and 0 78 for arid area semi arid area sub humid area and humid area respectively as shown in fig 4 c the percentage in arid area fluctuates greatly in different years which is as high as 45 50 in 1980 1985 1997 and as low as 10 13 in 1987 1988 1998 1992 2003 the proportions in semi arid sub humid and humid areas fluctuate little and are relatively stable when comparing the monthly total dewfall values from 1975 to 2018 the formation of dewfall has obvious periodicity in the year as can be seen in fig 5 the long term monthly average values and proportions were calculated to better understand the annual temporal characteristic of dewfall values as shown in fig 6 according to fig 6 a b it is found that the dewfall of the four climate regions is concentrated from april to august accounting for more than 60 of the total dewfall for the year the dewfall from may to july accounts for more than 40 of the entire year among them the maximum dewfall in arid area occurs in june while that in semi arid sub humid and humid areas occurs in may with the maximum values of 2 51 mm 2 18 mm 3 53 mm and 1 47 mm respectively the corresponding proportions are 20 41 18 06 19 76 and 15 47 respectively similarly as can be seen from fig 6 c d the precipitation in the four areas is concentrated from may to september accounting for more than 60 of the total annual precipitation furthermore the amount of precipitation from june to august accounts for more than 45 of the entire year the maximum amount of precipitation arises in humid area in june and peaks in arid semi arid and sub humid areas in july with the maximum amount of 193 94 mm 31 82 mm 81 64 mm and 150 04 mm respectively and proportions of 15 91 21 49 23 87 and 25 39 respectively kriging spatial interpolation was performed for the average annual total dewfall the average annual total precipitation and the proportion of dewfall in precipitation as shown in fig 7 combined with the land use of china in 2015 figure s1 and the dem of china figure s2 the rationality of spatial distribution was explained fig 7 a depicts the spatial distribution of dewfall in china with high in northeast and northwest and low in center and south the temperature in northeast china is cold and the temperature difference between day and night is large so dewfall values are high despite the fact that the central and southern areas are relatively humid and abundant in water vapor the higher temperature is not beneficial to the formation of dewfall due to the lower latitude the land use in the qinghai tibet plateau is primarily grass and unused land and the land use in the southwest border area is primarily arable land woodland and grassland the high altitude thin air and lack of water vapor in these two areas limit the formation of dewfall the two peak areas in northeast china are mostly arable land with sufficient water supply and the coastal area around bohai sea has sufficient water vapor which helps dewfall form the peak area of dewfall in northwestern china is primarily grass and unused land with a large diurnal temperature range resulting in the high dewfall values according to fig 7 b the precipitation decreases spatially from the southeast coast to the northwest inland it can be seen from fig 7 c that the proportion of dewfall in precipitation increases from south to north in china with the exception of northwestern china although northwestern china receives a little precipitation dewfall values remain at a high level making a higher proportion of northwestern china at the same time the proportion gradually increased from the outskirts to the hinterland of northwest inland 3 4 comparison of spi to spi cor 3 4 1 comparison in different climate regions the average monthly spi and spi cor in arid semi arid sub humid and humid areas from 1975 to 2018 were calculated respectively as shown in fig 8 according to fig 8 a the peak value of spi in arid area is slightly greater than that of spi cor and the valley value of spi is slightly lower than that of spi cor implying that the variation range of spi is slightly greater than that of spi cor as seen in fig 8 b the peak value of spi in semi arid area is slightly higher than that of spi cor while the valley value of spi is close to that of spi cor it can be seen from fig 8 c d that the value of spi in sub humid and humid areas is close to that of spi cor the correlation coefficients of spi and spi cor in arid semi arid sub humid and humid areas are 0 9633 0 9944 0 9959 and 0 9958 respectively the difference between spi and spi cor decreased from arid to semi arid to sub humid to humid area when comparing fig 8 a d it indicates that when the spi cor is calculated by replacing the precipitation with the summation of dewfall and precipitation by the calculation method of spi the influence of dewfall in arid area semi arid area sub humid area and humid area decreases in turn which is consistent with the proportion of dewfall in precipitation of the four regions the grade of spi and spi cor at each station from 1975 to 2018 528 months were classified according to table 2 and the spi and spi cor were compared respectively the ratio of sidg to tndg was calculated based on the statistics of 1 the total number of different drought grades for spi and spi cor tndg 2 the summation of difference in drought grades for inconsistent spi and spi cor grades sidg and the spatial interpolation of tndg sidg and sidg tndg were carried out as shown in fig 9 it is found that the tndg and sidg of spi have similar distribution characteristics from fig 9 a b according to fig 9 c the maximum sidg tndg is 1 5 in most parts of china the sidg tndg for spi is 1 0 1 1 this shows that the impact is one drought grade on average when the dewfall has an impact on the assessment of drought grade 3 4 2 comparison at the meteorological stations based on the tndg of spi and spi cor at all stations the spatial distribution of tndg is shown in fig 10 according to fig 10 a the order of tndg with 1 grade from large to small is arid area semi arid area sub humid area and humid area which corresponds to the order of proportion of dewfall in precipitation based on fig 10 b c the tndg with 2 and 3 grade is the largest in arid area and the smallest in humid area and the tndg in semi arid area is close to that in sub humid area which also matches the overall distribution of proportion of dewfall in precipitation only one station in arid area had 4 grade difference between spi and spi cor whereas the tndg with 4 grade at other stations were all 0 as shown in fig 10 d the tndg with each grade in arid area semi arid area sub humid area and humid area decreased in turn according to fig 10 a d the inconsistency of spi and spi cor grades is primarily concentrated in arid semi arid and sub humid areas while spi and spi cor grades at most stations in humid area are consistent table 5 only lists the stations and the corresponding time when the difference between drought grades for spi and spi cor is 3 and 4 and the station location can be seen in figure s3 the results are compared with the drought events recorded in historical drought in china in 1949 2000 china meteorological drought atlas and meteorological drought yearbook 2014 2016 zhang et al 2008 china meteorological administration 2010 institute of arid meteorology china meteorological administration 2017 institute of arid meteorology china meteorological administration 2018a institute of arid meteorology china meteorological administration 2018b according to the historical drought in china in 1949 2000 zhang et al 2008 the precipitation of shache station from july to august 1985 was lower than that of the same period of previous year while the evaporation and the average temperature were higher but it was not a severe drought area the spi grade of shache station in august 1985 was 5 extreme drought while the spi cor grade was 2 light drought indicating that the drought grade of spi cor is more appropriate than that of spi gaotai station is located in the hinterland of gansu province the year 1989 was marked by severe drought gansu province had a 15 7 drought rate and a 13 2 disaster rate prolonged drought occurred at the same time the drought disaster of 1990 was a significant one gaotai station was deemed to be suffering from a severe drought in 1989 the spi cor grade is 4 severe drought whereas the spi grade of gaotai station in november 1989 was 1 no drought which shows that the spi cor grade performs better according to the records of the historical drought in china in 1949 2000 zhang et al 2008 the precipitation in the northeast of inner mongolia where manzhouli station is located at was not rare in the spring of 1990 compared with that of normal years and the spring drought was mild the drought grade of manzhouli station in march 1990 was 2 light drought of spi cor instead of 5 extreme drought of spi indicating that spi cor is more reliable minfeng station received less precipitation from april to june 1990 than that during the same period combined with evaporation temperature and other factors summer drought occurred but the severity of drought was not serious as a result the drought grade of minfeng station in june 1990 was classified as light drought the drought grade of spi was 5 extreme drought so the drought grade of spi cor has better performance from july to august 1994 the precipitation in xinjiang where turpan station is located in the middle was lower than that in the same period of previous year while the evaporation and average temperature were higher the summer drought was exacerbated by high temperatures deficit rain and high evaporation because the spi grade was 2 light drought and the spi cor grade was 5 extreme drought the drought grade of spi cor is considered to be more appropriate in may 1986 the monthly precipitation in mandula station in northern inner mongolia was about 60 less than that in a normal year the evaporation was over 10 higher and the monthly average temperature was more than 1 5 c warmer resulting in a serious drought according to table 5 the spi grade of mandula station in may 1986 was 5 extreme drought but its spi cor grade was 2 light drought the drought grade of spi is more reasonable here tailai station tongyu station and changling station are all located in northeast china in april 2014 the drought was concentrated and severe with moderate drought severe drought and even extreme drought drought grade of spi was 5 extreme drought while the drought grade of spi cor was 2 light drought it is clear that the drought grade of spi is more reasonable other stations in table 5 lack drought records table 5 shows that when the drought evaluation of spi is 3 or 4 grades higher than that of spi cor most of the monthly total dewfall is greater than 1 mm based on the above analysis dewfall can be used as the supplement of precipitation to modify spi which is appropriate in most areas 3 4 3 comparison of drought events the drought events for different spi and spi cor based on drought grade were chosen to demonstrate the applicability of spi cor as can be seen in table 6 the spatial interpolation of spi and spi cor values was carried out fig 11 according to the historical drought in china in 1949 2000 zhang et al 2008 southern henan province and central and southern hubei province suffered severe drought in early spring the spi and spi cor grade were 3 moderate drought and 4 severe drought respectively as shown in fig 11 a b and table 6 therefore the drought grade of spi cor is more suitable in southern henan province and northern hubei province precipitation in henan province from december 1980 to early 1981 was lower than that in the same period of previous year the spi and spi cor grade of southern henan province in black were 3 moderate drought and 4 severe drought respectively implying that spi cor performs better in southern henan province as shown in fig 11 c d and table 6 as can be seen in table 6 huaihe river basin in green experienced a serious drought in 1981 comparing with the spi grade of huaihe river basin 3 moderate drought spi cor grade 4 severe drought is more reliable as can be seen from fig 11 c d in december 1981 a serious drought hit central and southern hubei province according to fig 11 e f and table 6 the spi grade was 3 moderate drought while the spi cor grade was 4 severe drought which is more accurate according to table 6 central and eastern liaoning province and northern shaanxi province had 70 90 less precipitation than the same time of previous year in december 1987 and henan province confronted the worst drought in 1988 since 1949 as can be seen in fig 11 g h the spi cor grade for central and eastern liaoning province in blue northern shaanxi province in red northern and southern henan province in green and black were 3 moderate drought 2 light drought 3 moderate drought and 4 severe drought respectively correspondingly the spi grades were 4 severe drought 1 no drought 2 light drought and 3 moderate drought respectively it is clear that spi grade is more reasonable in central and eastern liaoning province and spi cor grade is more reasonable in central and northern shaanxi province and henan province in february 1999 gansu province and henan province suffered from a severe drought shaanxi province confronted a particularly serious winter and spring drought as well according to fig 11 i j and table 6 spi grade in southeast of gansu province in black southern shaanxi province in green and central and southern henan province in red were 5 extreme drought 4 severe drought and 3 moderate drought respectively while the spi cor grade were all 4 severe drought indicating that spi cor is more credible in these regions based on the analysis the regional distribution of spi and spi cor preference in drought assessment is shown in fig 12 spi is suitable for the middle east of liaoning province and spi cor for the middle east of china spi cor is found to be more reasonable than spi for henan province hubei province shaanxi province gansu province and other inland areas of china at the same time the effect of dewfall supplement in precipitation is most noticeable in the semi arid and sub humid areas but less in the humid area of southern china 3 4 4 comparison with vegetation index the response of vegetation to temperature and precipitation have a time lag effect and temperature and precipitation have a direct effect on the occurrence of drought the response lag period of different vegetation to temperature and precipitation is about 1 2 months lu et al 2020 as a result analyzing the response of vegetation to drought when the drought grades of spi and spi cor fig 13 differ further demonstrates the applicability of spi and spi cor in space the lag period of vegetation response to drought is assumed to be one month in this paper if the drought is serious the vegetation index vci will decrease in the coming month however it should be noted that the severity of drought has a direct impact on the reduction extent of vci for the regions with inconsistent drought assessment between spi and spi cor the statistical data of vci values in the current month and next month are calculated as shown in table 7 drought grades for different spi and spi cor with vci are concluded in table 8 comparing with fig 13 a1 b1 spi cor grade of the four regions are all lower than that of spi in combination with table 7 and 8 the vci values of two regions in black and yellow in june are higher than those in may indicating that spi cor is more appropriate to assess drought in may 2000 the vci decreased slightly in central region in blue and the spi and spi cor grade was 4 severe drought and 3 moderate drought respectively concluding that spi cor is suitable in this region higher vci values of the northeastern region in green in may illustrate that the spi is more reasonable in february 2002 spi grade in two regions of northeast china in pink and red were higher than spi cor and the spi cor grade of the two regions in the western china in black and blue were higher as shown in fig 13 a2 b2 according to table 7 with the exception of most northeast region in red where the vegetation in march is better than that in february vci in other three regions has decreased which means that drought occurred and vegetation degenerated it can be considered that the drought grade of spi cor is more reasonable in the western tibetan in black northern gansu province in blue and most eastern part in red while the vci in the north center of inner mongolia in pink reduced and drought occurred so the spi grade in this region is reasonable as shown in table 8 according to fig 13 a3 b3 the drought assessed by spi in the three regions in green black and white except for the most northeast one in pink are more serious than that by spi cor and the vegetation growth in november 2005 are better than that in october in table 7 so the drought assessed by spi cor in these three regions is more reasonable however the spi cor grade of the most northeast region is higher than that of spi but the vci increased from 50 56 to 75 34 on average as a result the spi drought grade there is better than the spi cor drought grade in january 2006 the regions where the drought grade between spi and spi cor differed were the southwest border of china in blue and east of qinghai tibet plateau in green fig 13 a4 b4 spi cor is more optimistic than spi according to tables 7 and 8 vegetation in both regions grew better and vci increased indicating that the spi cor drought evaluation was better it can be seen from fig 13 a5 b5 that among the four regions with different spi and spi cor drought grade spi grade of western xinjiang in blue western qinghai tibet plateau in green and central inner mongolia in black are higher than that of spi cor while spi cor grade is higher in middle qinghai tibet plateau in blue in table 7 vci increased in western xinjiang and middle qinghai tibet plateau but decreased in western qinghai tibet plateau and central inner mongolia therefore spi cor performs better in western xinjiang and spi performs better in middle and western qinghai tibet plateau as well as central inner mongolia as shown in table 8 vci in alpine region is not sensitive to precipitation li et al 2018 which could have an impact on the occurrence of drought according to fig 13 a6 b6 except that the spi grade of northern xinjiang in black is higher than that of spi cor the spi grade of the other four regions is lower than that of spi cor meanwhile the vci of northern xinjiang and most east china in purple in march 2012 was larger than that in february whereas the vci of other three regions in march was lower than that in february as a result with the exception of the most east china where spi drought grade is more reasonable than spi cor drought grade the spi cor drought grade of the other four regions in black pink blue and red are all better than the spi drought grade except in the south of north china in purple where the spi cor grades are lower the spi grades are higher than spi cor drought grades in the other four regions with different spi and spi cor grade as can be seen from fig 13 a7 b7 in october 2016 the vegetation conditions in the three southern regions in purple green and blue improved significantly from september whereas the vegetation conditions in northeastern china in pink and south of north china deteriorated as shown in table 7 as a result as can be seen in table 8 spi performed better in northeastern china while spi cor performed better in the other four regions based on the above analysis the regional distribution of spi and spi cor preference in drought assessment can be seen in fig 14 ignoring the regions on the qinghai tibet plateau where precipitation has little effect on the vegetation and plants or the response of vegetation takes longer it is illustrated that spi drought grade is more appropriate in northeastern china and central and eastern inner mongolia while spi cor is primarily applicable to central and northwestern china the difference between spi and spi cor drought grade is less in southern china 4 discussion dewfall has an important ecological function in ecosystems however it has been relatively neglected in meteorology even though numerous interesting studies such as measuring dewfall formation would attract scholars attention jacobs et al 2002 it is basically impossible to measure dewfall over long time and dewfall measurement is usually short term monitoring of less than five years in small scale areas currently there is no long term dewfall measurement in large scale areas let alone the spatiotemporal distribution of dewfall in this study the dewfall amount in china from 1975 to 2018 is calculated based on the penman monteith equation the dewfall spatiotemporal distribution is discussed as well comparing with field measurements and other analytical models in previous research hao et al 2012 pan et al 2018 xu et al 2012 wang et al 2019 penman monteith equation is a reliable tool for dewfall estimation dewfall represents the latent heat flux towards the surface as opposed to evaporation so it is feasible to calculate dewfall amount with methods for computing evaporation xiao et al 2017 among the widely used methods such as energy balance eb turbulent vapour transport tvt penman monteith and breb equation penman monteith equation is the only one that does not require measurements of the surface temperature which is not a standard meteorological variable guo et al 2022 it has been applied to studies of dewfall formation in different regions due to the few dewfall measurements it is difficult to enhance the verification and further justify the penman monteith equation the penman monteith equation is complex than field measurement and requires plenty of data guo et al 2016b besides c n and c d in equation 1 which are constants that for the reference crop type and time step were set as uniform constants in this study for a more precise dewfall amount setting c n and c d according to the actual vegetation may be beneficial the widespread impacts of drought make it significant for drought assessment spi an univariate drought indicator about precipitation is the most commonly used drought index to assess meteorological drought in reality drought conditions are associated with multiple variables the univariate index is not sufficient to capture drought characteristics hao et al 2015 as an important component in the water cycle dewfall has been neglected in drought assessment in this study a spi based improvement index spi cor taking into account the complementary effect of dewfall on precipitation was proposed spi cor drought index plays a role in central and northwestern china but has little effect in southern china the dewfall cannot be ignored in arid and semi arid regions with sparse rainfall but is less important in southern china with abundant rainfall which increases the rationality of the applicable region of spi cor spi cor obeys a gamma distribution in this study but factors such as location climate and terrain would affect the probability density function that spi cor follows therefore the next step will be to study the applicability of spi and spi cor with alternative distribution functions and discuss the effect of dewfall on the distribution functions though spi cor considered the supplementary function of dewfall on precipitation its significant impact on ecosystem and drought mitigation still deserves further in depth study the time scale of spi and spi cor in the study is both calculated at 1 month timescale focusing on the effect of dewfall on drought assessments over short time the effect on longer time scales such as 3 6 12 and 24 months should be explored in future work the gldas 2 products we used have 3 hourly temporal resolutions which may lead to an underestimation of the dewfall values especially in time with short nights as dew values might be underestimated during the transition times around sunset and sunrise besides a more profound method of the spatial interpolation that takes into account vegetation and climate features may be preferable to the kriging method for providing the spatial characteristic feature 5 conclusions by calculating the dewfall values at 523 meteorological stations in china from 1975 to 2018 with the gldas 2 data the spi cor was calculated by replacing the precipitation with the summation of dewfall and precipitation the temporal and spatial distribution characteristic of dewfall were investigated and the spi and spi cor were compared as well as the applicability of spi and spi cor in space the main conclusions are as follows 1 according to the penman monteith equation the dewfall values were calculated the calculated dewfall was essentially consistent with the previous research in some local areas and credible 2 the accuracy of spatial interpolation was evaluated by the statistical parameters such as sse mse mae mape rmse and r kriging is the optimal strategy of spi cor among kriging idw and anusplin spatial interpolation methods 3 in terms of temporal characteristic of dewfall the formation of dewfall exhibits a clear interannual periodicity more than 60 of the dewfall in the arid semi arid sub humid and humid areas falls from april to august with more than 40 falling between may and july in the whole year the dewfall values are high in northeast and northwest and low in central and south in the spatial distribution the proportion of dewfall in precipitation rises from south to north except in northwestern china where the proportion is high and gradually climbs from the outer edge to the northwest inland 4 comparing the spi and spi cor in different climate regions it is discovered that the correlation coefficients of spi and spi cor increase from arid to humid in the opposite order as the proportion of dewfall in precipitation in the four regions indicating that the influence of dewfall decreases in the same order dewfall supply has an average impact of one drought grade on drought assessment based on the comparison of spi and spi cor in different meteorological stations drought events and response of vegetation to drought it is concluded that spi is suitable in northeastern china and central and eastern inner mongolia in drought assessment while spi cor in central and northwestern china the difference in drought assessment between spi and spi cor in southern china is unapparent credit authorship contribution statement siyao

2549,dewfall is an important source of additional precipitation but it is frequently ignored in water balance calculations in this study the dewfall of 523 weather stations in china was calculated an improved drought index spi cor was proposed by substituting the precipitation with the summation of dewfall and precipitation by the spi calculation method where dewfall was calculated by the penman monteith equation with the gldas 2 data the temporal and spatial distributions characteristics of dewfall were discussed and the spatial applicability of spi and spi cor was determined the results indicated that the dewfall formation is periodic with more than 60 of the dewfall occurring between april and august the amount of dewfall is lower than that of precipitation the dewfall in china has a distribution pattern of high dewfall in the northeast and northwest but low dewfall in the center and south the proportion of dewfall in precipitation increases from south to north with the exception of northwestern china comparing of spi to spi cor the influence of dewfall in arid semi arid sub humid and humid areas declines in turn in accordance with the proportion of dewfall in precipitation of the four regions and is opposite to the correlation coefficients of spi and spi cor dewfall has an average impact of one drought grade on the assessment of drought as long as it works with the performance of spi and spi cor at different weather stations historical drought events and vegetation response to drought spi is better in northeastern china and eastern inner mongolia while spi cor is more applicable in central and northwestern china the difference between spi and spi cor drought grades are not noticeable in southern china therefore adopting spi and spi cor to evaluate drought in different regions can help to make more accurate drought assessment keywords dewfall drought assessment standardized precipitation index spi cor data availability the data used in this

cycle of bare soils dewfall has some effects on the barren landscapes and its micrometeorological conditions agam and berliner 2006 jannis et al 2018 there are currently no international standards for measuring the amounts of dewfall condensing on a given surface jacobs et al 2006 pan et al 2010 zhang et al 2010 the methods are mainly divided into two categories measurement and calculation several methods have been used to directly quantify dewfall such as lysimeters condensing surfaces and the hiltner dewfall balance moro et al 2007 the lysimeter method is considered to be the most precise as it can measure the actual surface dewfall under natural conditions ninari et al 2002 it is measured using direct weighing at the beginning and end of the condensation process zhuang and zhao 2017 measuring dewfall on the artificial surfaces when condensation occurs is another effective approach hao et al 2012 xu et al 2012 surveyed the annual dewfall by woodstick made from poplar tree in sanjiang plain and found that almost daily dewfall occurred in wetland and farmland ecosystems from july to september 2010 with amounts ranging from 30 18 mm to 4 25 mm in wetland soybean land paddy and residential land pan et al 2018 measured the amount of dewfall in the shapotou area of northern china in october 2009 to see how dew formed on different soils shrub species and microhabitats nevertheless the artificial surface materials can often influence the dewfall amounts measured by these methods hao et al 2012 the hiltner dewfall balance is also one of the methods for quantifying dewfall amounts at night jacobs et al 2006 dewfall measurement ideas can also be derived from modeling dewfall potential based on microclimatic conditions and isotopic tracers hill et al 2020 sustainable and long term dewfall experimental research is highly unlikely atashi et al 2020 however methods for dewfall calculation such as eddy covariance ec bowen ratio energy balance breb bowen and the penman monteith equation are superior in terms of calculating a wide range of surface energy flux and obtaining continuous data to determine dewfall duration and quantity beysens 2016 hao et al 2012 zhuang and zhao 2017 the ec method has been widely applied in the dewfall research guo et al 2016b using ec method and a wetness sensor moro et al 2007 discovered that under semi arid conditions actual dewfall accounts for 12 of the precipitation from february to june in 2003 hao et al 2012 illustrated the dew duration and amount in the taklamakan desert in china by the ec system as well as its long term trend wang et al 2019 concluded that dewfall formed on more than 75 days in nine stations of heihe hydrometeorological observation network in 2016 with the monitored dewfall ranging from 6 56 mm to 25 13 mm using the ec method however ec method underestimates the flux during low turbulence periods at night which could lead to an underestimation of dewfall guo et al 2016b based on the environmental factors and the theory of energy balance and water vapor diffusion the penman monteith equation considers the physiological and physical characteristics of crops guo et al 2016b guo et al 2016b used the penman monteith equation to predict the dewfall amounts in a shrubland in northwestern china during growing season assuming that dewfall accounts for 7 2 of rainfall and 8 9 of evapotranspiration respectively they also compared the microlysimeter ec method and penman monteith equation concluding that ec method could bring about an underestimation of dewfall amount whereas the penman monteith equation could calculate it accurately guo et al 2016a dewfall is likely to be the largest part over a week or a month in semi arid and arid areas xiao et al 2009 therefore dewfall occupies an important position in the water cycle drought was previously considered as a lack of precipitation many drought indexes are proposed to describe the characteristics of drought hao et al 2015 palmer drought severity index palmer 1965 abbreviated as pdsi taking antecedent precipitation moisture supply and moisture demand into account to measure cumulative departure in surface water balance yan et al 2014 has been widely used to monitor and analyze droughts wang et al 2022 the standardized precipitation index spi proposed by mckee et al 1993 uses long term precipitation as the primary variable li et al 2016 wu et al 2020 spi can express the dry and wet conditions of the land surface at different temporal scales li et al 2016 being regarded as a reliable indicator of meteorological drought li et al 2020a based on spi the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 was proposed using the water balance concept of climatic water supply and atmospheric evaporation li et al 2020b with regarding temperature as the secondary variable wu et al 2020 spei combined the sensitivity of pdsi to changes in evaporation demand and the robustness of the multi temporal scales of spi li et al 2017 many drought indices have been created to assess drought and most of them are based on the existing study and combined with the regional drought characteristics however dewfall is an important supplementary water source for precipitation and it may affect accurate drought detection in some areas if dew formation is not considered into spi spi may be overestimated in areas where non rainfall water such as dew formation plays an important role therefore the objectives of this paper are to 1 use the penman monteith equation to calculate dewfall and analyze its temporal and spatial distribution characteristics in china from 1975 to 2018 2 compare the spi and the spi cor in which dewfall is used as the supplement to precipitation in the calculation of the spi and discuss the applicability of spi and spi cor in space 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area china is a typical complex terrain area with large area

et al 2021 2 3 dewfall calculation the penman monteith equation giving consideration to the energy and vapour transport has been widely used in the dewfall formation due to its high accuracy xiao et

flux was taken as the measured value of dewfall when there is no precipitation the diurnal latent heat net flux is positive upward which is generally attributed to evapotranspiration and the surface water vapor enters the atmosphere through evaporation when the nighttime latent heat net flux is sometimes negative downward it can be attributed to dewfall which is due to the condensation of water vapor in the air resulting in downward latent heat net flux wang et al 2019 the formula for calculating dewfall by latent heat is 8 e l e l where l is the gasification latent heat 2450 kj kg and the negative value e at night is the dewfall mm guo et al 2016a it is considered that dewfall generated on the night without precipitation whether there is precipitation is judged by gldas 2 data the above mentioned 3 h dewfall from 1975 to 2018 is obtained and the daily dewfall is calculated by summation 2 4 spatial interpolation the kriging inverse distance weighted idw anusplin methods were used to perform spatial interpolation of station elements in order to compare the interpolation accuracy and select the optimal strategy to perform high accuracy interpolation shu et al 2011 kriging is a popular interpolation method that is both accurate and simple yu et al 2015 li and wang 2019 as one of the most commonly used spatial interpolation methods tiwari et al 2019 idw robertson 1967 has been applied to interpolate the spatial distribution in the field of hydrology science yang et al 2020 based on thin plate smooth spline interpolation shu et al 2011 anusplin can accurately reflect the spatial distribution of natural elements tan et al 2016 2 5 calculation of spi and spi cor the calculation principle of spi can be seen in mckee et al 1993 the calculation used the spei r library https cran r project org package spei which allows to compute the spi calculation of the spi cor is similar to that of the spi replace the precipitation with the summation of dewfall and precipitation the drought classification based on the spi and spi cor is shown in table 2 general administration of quality supervision inspection and quarantine of the people s republic of china standardization administration 2017 the spi and spi cor are both calculated at 1 month timescale with the meteorological observation data using gamma distribution as the acceptable marginal distribution 2 6 vci calculation the vegetation condition index kogan 1990 permits not only the description of vegetation but also the estimation of temporal and spatial vegetation changes as well as the effects of weather on vegetation zhou et al 2021 the calculation of the vci is shown in equation 9 9 vci 100 ndvi n d v i min ndvi max n d v i min where ndvi ndvimax and ndvimin are the respective monthly ndvi multiyear maximum ndvi and multiyear minimum ndvi for each grid the vci ranges from 0 to 100 indicating that the vegetation condition changes from extremely unfavorable to optimal zhou et al 2021 the vegetation index vci was used as reference when comparing spi and spi cor 2 7 evaluation method of spatial interpolation accuracy six indicators were selected as interpolation performance

calculation in order to verify the accuracy of the calculated dewfall a comparison with the previous research in some small areas was conducted table 3 and the location of dewfall verification station can be seen in fig 2 hao et al 2012 obtained that the dewfall amount on the eastern edge of the taklamakan desert in china from june to october 2011 was 12 87 mm tikanlik station and korla station near taklamakan desert have calculated dewfall values of 9 55 mm and 12 63 mm respectively which are both close to 12 87 mm according to pan et al 2018 the monthly dewfall value of the shapotou desert experimental research station in may 2014 was 1 49 mm while the dewfall value of zhongwei station had a similar calculated value which was 1 01 mm in may 2014 xu et al 2012 measured 30 18 mm of dewfall in sanjiang plain by woodsticks in paddy land from may to october 2010 the dewfall value of fujin station at plain paddy field near sanjiang plain is 27 49 mm which is close to the measured dewfall wang et al 2019 obtained dewfall values of 11 18 mm at dashalong station in 2016 by ec method and the calculated dewfall value of gaotai station is 12 91 mm which is close to that of dashalong station according to the comparison in table 3 the dewfall calculated in this study can be considered reasonable and reliable 3 2 spatial interpolation accuracy evaluation fifty stations were chosen at random from a total of 523 stations then the three interpolation methods were conducted to interpolate the spi cor of the remaining stations nationwide the spi cor at the coordinates of the 50 stations was extracted to evaluate the performance of the three interpolation methods sse mse mae mape rmse and r were calculated for three interpolation methods the average of them is shown in table 4 and the box plots of 6 statistical parameters for the 50 stations are shown in fig 3 the statistical parameters of the three spatial interpolation methods showed that kriging has the highest accuracy for the spi cor spatial interpolation it can be seen from table 4 that the average statistical parameters are the smallest among the three interpolation methods except for r of kriging interpolation which is slightly less than the r of idw according to the box plots in fig 3 the lower and upper quartile for sse mse and rmse of kriging are generally smaller than those of idw and anusplin the upper quartile for mae of kriging is the smallest in the three spatial interpolation methods while the lower quartile for mae of kriging is 0 5536 which is only 0 0062 larger than the smallest lower quartile from idw 0 5474 the lower quartile for mape of kriging is the smallest in the three spatial interpolation methods and the upper quartile for mape of kriging is 3 9066 which is only 0 0112 larger than the smallest upper quartile from idw 3 8953 the lower and upper quartiles for r of kriging are 0 5606 and 0 4545 respectively 0 0142 and 0 0099 less than the largest lower and upper quartiles with 0 5748 from idw and 0 4644 from anusplin the distribution for r of kriging mainly ranges from 0 45 to 0 60 as a result the kriging method is the optimal strategy for spatial interpolation of spi cor 3 3 temporal and spatial distribution of dewfall the average annual total dewfall and precipitation in arid semi arid sub humid and humid areas from 1975 to 2018 were calculated respectively as shown in fig 4 a b with the precipitation calculated using station data it is found that the dewfall values from high to low are sub humid area arid area semi arid area and humid area and the annual average values are 17 86 mm 12 29 mm 12 09 mm and 9 51 mm respectively humid area is mainly distributed in southern china where the temperature is higher whereas dewfall occurs when the temperature falls below the dew point temperature resulting in the smallest amount of dewfall in humid area the dewfall values of arid and semi arid areas are very close only 0 20 mm difference humid area sub humid area semi arid area and arid area are in order of precipitation from high to low with the annual averages of 1219 17 mm 590 94 mm 341 96 mm and 148 08 mm respectively the proportion of dewfall in precipitation varies from high to low with the annual averages of 8 47 3 57 3 06 and 0 78 for arid area semi arid area sub humid area and humid area respectively as shown in fig 4 c the percentage in arid area fluctuates greatly in different years which is as high as 45 50 in 1980 1985 1997 and as low as 10 13 in 1987 1988 1998 1992 2003 the proportions in semi arid sub humid and humid areas fluctuate little and are relatively stable when comparing the monthly total dewfall values from 1975 to 2018 the formation of dewfall has obvious periodicity in the year as can be seen in fig 5 the long term monthly average values and proportions were calculated to better understand the annual temporal characteristic of dewfall values as shown in fig 6 according to fig 6 a b it is found that the dewfall of the four climate regions is concentrated from april to august accounting for more than 60 of the total dewfall for the year the dewfall from may to july accounts for more than 40 of the entire year among them the maximum dewfall in arid area occurs in june while that in semi arid sub humid and humid areas occurs in may with the maximum values of 2 51 mm 2 18 mm 3 53 mm and 1 47 mm respectively the corresponding proportions are 20 41 18 06 19 76 and 15 47 respectively similarly as can be seen from fig 6 c d the precipitation in the four areas is concentrated from may to september accounting for more than 60 of the total annual precipitation furthermore the amount of precipitation from june to august accounts for more than 45 of the entire year the maximum amount of precipitation arises in humid area in june and peaks in arid semi arid and sub humid areas in july with the maximum amount of 193 94 mm 31 82 mm 81 64 mm and 150 04 mm respectively and proportions of 15 91 21 49 23 87 and 25 39 respectively kriging spatial interpolation was performed for the average annual total dewfall the average annual total precipitation and the proportion of dewfall in precipitation as shown in fig 7 combined with the land use of china in 2015 figure s1 and the dem of china figure s2 the rationality of spatial distribution was explained fig 7 a depicts the spatial distribution of dewfall in china with high in northeast and northwest and low in center and south the temperature in northeast china is cold and the temperature difference between day and night is large so dewfall values are high despite the fact that the central and southern areas are relatively humid and abundant in water vapor the higher temperature is not beneficial to the formation of dewfall due to the lower latitude the land use in the qinghai tibet plateau is primarily grass and unused land and the land use in the southwest border area is primarily arable land woodland and grassland the high altitude thin air and lack of water vapor in these two areas limit the formation of dewfall the two peak areas in northeast china are mostly arable land with sufficient water supply and the coastal area around bohai sea has sufficient water vapor which helps dewfall form the peak area of dewfall in northwestern china is primarily grass and unused land with a large diurnal temperature range resulting in the high dewfall values according to fig 7 b the precipitation decreases spatially from the southeast coast to the northwest inland it can be seen from fig 7 c that the proportion of dewfall in precipitation increases from south to north in china with the exception of northwestern china although northwestern china receives a little precipitation dewfall values remain at a high level making a higher proportion of northwestern china at the same time the proportion gradually increased from the outskirts to the hinterland of northwest inland 3 4 comparison of spi to spi cor 3 4 1 comparison in different climate regions the average monthly spi and spi cor in arid semi arid sub humid and humid areas from 1975 to 2018 were calculated respectively as shown in fig 8 according to fig 8 a the peak value of spi in arid area is slightly greater than that of spi cor and the valley value of spi is slightly lower than that of spi cor implying that the variation range of spi is slightly greater than that of spi cor as seen in fig 8 b the peak value of spi in semi arid area is slightly higher than that of spi cor while the valley value of spi is close to that of spi cor it can be seen from fig 8 c d that the value of spi in sub humid and humid areas is close to that of spi cor the correlation coefficients of spi and spi cor in arid semi arid sub humid and humid areas are 0 9633 0 9944 0 9959 and 0 9958 respectively the difference between spi and spi cor decreased from arid to semi arid to sub humid to humid area when comparing fig 8 a d it indicates that when the spi cor is calculated by replacing the precipitation with the summation of dewfall and precipitation by the calculation method of spi the influence of dewfall in arid area semi arid area sub humid area and humid area decreases in turn which is consistent with the proportion of dewfall in precipitation of the four regions the grade of spi and spi cor at each station from 1975 to 2018 528 months were classified according to table 2 and the spi and spi cor were compared respectively the ratio of sidg to tndg was calculated based on the statistics of 1 the total number of different drought grades for spi and spi cor tndg 2 the summation of difference in drought grades for inconsistent spi and spi cor grades sidg and the spatial interpolation of tndg sidg and sidg tndg were carried out as shown in fig 9 it is found that the tndg and sidg of spi have similar distribution characteristics from fig 9 a b according to fig 9 c the maximum sidg tndg is 1 5 in most parts of china the sidg tndg for spi is 1 0 1 1 this shows that the impact is one drought grade on average when the dewfall has an impact on the assessment of drought grade 3 4 2 comparison at the meteorological stations based on the tndg of spi and spi cor at all stations the spatial distribution of tndg is shown in fig 10 according to fig 10 a the order of tndg with 1 grade from large to small is arid area semi arid area sub humid area and humid area which corresponds to the order of proportion of dewfall in precipitation based on fig 10 b c the tndg with 2 and 3 grade is the largest in arid area and the smallest in humid area and the tndg in semi arid area is close to that in sub humid area which also matches the overall distribution of proportion of dewfall in precipitation only one station in arid area had 4 grade difference between spi and spi cor whereas the tndg with 4 grade at other stations were all 0 as shown in fig 10 d the tndg with each grade in arid area semi arid area sub humid area and humid area decreased in turn according to fig 10 a d the inconsistency of spi and spi cor grades is primarily concentrated in arid semi arid and sub humid areas while spi and spi cor grades at most stations in humid area are consistent table 5 only lists the stations and the corresponding time when the difference between drought grades for spi and spi cor is 3 and 4 and the station location can be seen in figure s3 the results are compared with the drought events recorded in historical drought in china in 1949 2000 china meteorological drought atlas and meteorological drought yearbook 2014 2016 zhang et al 2008 china meteorological administration 2010 institute of arid meteorology china meteorological administration 2017 institute of arid meteorology china meteorological administration 2018a institute of arid meteorology china meteorological administration 2018b according to the historical drought in china in 1949 2000 zhang et al 2008 the precipitation of shache station from july to august 1985 was lower than that of the same period of previous year while the evaporation and the average temperature were higher but it was not a severe drought area the spi grade of shache station in august 1985 was 5 extreme drought while the spi cor grade was 2 light drought indicating that the drought grade of spi cor is more appropriate than that of spi gaotai station is located in the hinterland of gansu province the year 1989 was marked by severe drought gansu province had a 15 7 drought rate and a 13 2 disaster rate prolonged drought occurred at the same time the drought disaster of 1990 was a significant one gaotai station was deemed to be suffering from a severe drought in 1989 the spi cor grade is 4 severe drought whereas the spi grade of gaotai station in november 1989 was 1 no drought which shows that the spi cor grade performs better according to the records of the historical drought in china in 1949 2000 zhang et al 2008 the precipitation in the northeast of inner mongolia where manzhouli station is located at was not rare in the spring of 1990 compared with that of normal years and the spring drought was mild the drought grade of manzhouli station in march 1990 was 2 light drought of spi cor instead of 5 extreme drought of spi indicating that spi cor is more reliable minfeng station received less precipitation from april to june 1990 than that during the same period combined with evaporation temperature and other factors summer drought occurred but the severity of drought was not serious as a result the drought grade of minfeng station in june 1990 was classified as light drought the drought grade of spi was 5 extreme drought so the drought grade of spi cor has better performance from july to august 1994 the precipitation in xinjiang where turpan station is located in the middle was lower than that in the same period of previous year while the evaporation and average temperature were higher the summer drought was exacerbated by high temperatures deficit rain and high evaporation because the spi grade was 2 light drought and the spi cor grade was 5 extreme drought the drought grade of spi cor is considered to be more appropriate in may 1986 the monthly precipitation in mandula station in northern inner mongolia was about 60 less than that in a normal year the evaporation was over 10 higher and the monthly average temperature was more than 1 5 c warmer resulting in a serious drought according to table 5 the spi grade of mandula station in may 1986 was 5 extreme drought but its spi cor grade was 2 light drought the drought grade of spi is more reasonable here tailai station tongyu station and changling station are all located in northeast china in april 2014 the drought was concentrated and severe with moderate drought severe drought and even extreme drought drought grade of spi was 5 extreme drought while the drought grade of spi cor was 2 light drought it is clear that the drought grade of spi is more reasonable other stations in table 5 lack drought records table 5 shows that when the drought evaluation of spi is 3 or 4 grades higher than that of spi cor most of the monthly total dewfall is greater than 1 mm based on the above analysis dewfall can be used as the supplement of precipitation to modify spi which is appropriate in most areas 3 4 3 comparison of drought events the drought events for different spi and spi cor based on drought grade were chosen to demonstrate the applicability of spi cor as can be seen in table 6 the spatial interpolation of spi and spi cor values was carried out fig 11 according to the historical drought in china in 1949 2000 zhang et al 2008 southern henan province and central and southern hubei province suffered severe drought in early spring the spi and spi cor grade were 3 moderate drought and 4 severe drought respectively as shown in fig 11 a b and table 6 therefore the drought grade of spi cor is more suitable in southern henan province and northern hubei province precipitation in henan province from december 1980 to early 1981 was lower than that in the same period of previous year the spi and spi cor grade of southern henan province in black were 3 moderate drought and 4 severe drought respectively implying that spi cor performs better in southern henan province as shown in fig 11 c d and table 6 as can be seen in table 6 huaihe river basin in green experienced a serious drought in 1981 comparing with the spi grade of huaihe river basin 3 moderate drought spi cor grade 4 severe drought is more reliable as can be seen from fig 11 c d in december 1981 a serious drought hit central and southern hubei province according to fig 11 e f and table 6 the spi grade was 3 moderate drought while the spi cor grade was 4 severe drought which is more accurate according to table 6 central and eastern liaoning province and northern shaanxi province had 70 90 less precipitation than the same time of previous year in december 1987 and henan province confronted the worst drought in 1988 since 1949 as can be seen in fig 11 g h the spi cor grade for central and eastern liaoning province in blue northern shaanxi province in red northern and southern henan province in green and black were 3 moderate drought 2 light drought 3 moderate drought and 4 severe drought respectively correspondingly the spi grades were 4 severe drought 1 no drought 2 light drought and 3 moderate drought respectively it is clear that spi grade is more reasonable in central and eastern liaoning province and spi cor grade is more reasonable in central and northern shaanxi province and henan province in february 1999 gansu province and henan province suffered from a severe drought shaanxi province confronted a particularly serious winter and spring drought as well according to fig 11 i j and table 6 spi grade in southeast of gansu province in black southern shaanxi province in green and central and southern henan province in red were 5 extreme drought 4 severe drought and 3 moderate drought respectively while the spi cor grade were all 4 severe drought indicating that spi cor is more credible in these regions based on the analysis the regional distribution of spi and spi cor preference in drought assessment is shown in fig 12 spi is suitable for the middle east of liaoning province and spi cor for the middle east of china spi cor is found to be more reasonable than spi for henan province hubei province shaanxi province gansu province and other inland areas of china at the same time the effect of dewfall supplement in precipitation is most noticeable in the semi arid and sub humid areas but less in the humid area of southern china 3 4 4 comparison with vegetation index the response of vegetation to temperature and precipitation have a time lag effect and temperature and precipitation have a direct effect on the occurrence of drought the response lag period of different vegetation to temperature and precipitation is about 1 2 months lu et al 2020 as a result analyzing the response of vegetation to drought when the drought grades of spi and spi cor fig 13 differ further demonstrates the applicability of spi and spi cor in space the lag period of vegetation response to drought is assumed to be one month in this paper if the drought is serious the vegetation index vci will decrease in the coming month however it should be noted that the severity of drought has a direct impact on the reduction extent of vci for the regions with inconsistent drought assessment between spi and spi cor the statistical data of vci values in the current month and next month are calculated as shown in table 7 drought grades for different spi and spi cor with vci are concluded in table 8 comparing with fig 13 a1 b1 spi cor grade of the four regions are all lower than that of spi in combination with table 7 and 8 the vci values of two regions in black and yellow in june are higher than those in may indicating that spi cor is more appropriate to assess drought in may 2000 the vci decreased slightly in central region in blue and the spi and spi cor grade was 4 severe drought and 3 moderate drought respectively concluding that spi cor is suitable in this region higher vci values of the northeastern region in green in may illustrate that the spi is more reasonable in february 2002 spi grade in two regions of northeast china in pink and red were higher than spi cor and the spi cor grade of the two regions in the western china in black and blue were higher as shown in fig 13 a2 b2 according to table 7 with the exception of most northeast region in red where the vegetation in march is better than that in february vci in other three regions has decreased which means that drought occurred and vegetation degenerated it can be considered that the drought grade of spi cor is more reasonable in the western tibetan in black northern gansu province in blue and most eastern part in red while the vci in the north center of inner mongolia in pink reduced and drought occurred so the spi grade in this region is reasonable as shown in table 8 according to fig 13 a3 b3 the drought assessed by spi in the three regions in green black and white except for the most northeast one in pink are more serious than that by spi cor and the vegetation growth in november 2005 are better than that in october in table 7 so the drought assessed by spi cor in these three regions is more reasonable however the spi cor grade of the most northeast region is higher than that of spi but the vci increased from 50 56 to 75 34 on average as a result the spi drought grade there is better than the spi cor drought grade in january 2006 the regions where the drought grade between spi and spi cor differed were the southwest border of china in blue and east of qinghai tibet plateau in green fig 13 a4 b4 spi cor is more optimistic than spi according to tables 7 and 8 vegetation in both regions grew better and vci increased indicating that the spi cor drought evaluation was better it can be seen from fig 13 a5 b5 that among the four regions with different spi and spi cor drought grade spi grade of western xinjiang in blue western qinghai tibet plateau in green and central inner mongolia in black are higher than that of spi cor while spi cor grade is higher in middle qinghai tibet plateau in blue in table 7 vci increased in western xinjiang and middle qinghai tibet plateau but decreased in western qinghai tibet plateau and central inner mongolia therefore spi cor performs better in western xinjiang and spi performs better in middle and western qinghai tibet plateau as well as central inner mongolia as shown in table 8 vci in alpine region is not sensitive to precipitation li et al 2018 which could have an impact on the occurrence of drought according to fig 13 a6 b6 except that the spi grade of northern xinjiang in black is higher than that of spi cor the spi grade of the other four regions is lower than that of spi cor meanwhile the vci of northern xinjiang and most east china in purple in march 2012 was larger than that in february whereas the vci of other three regions in march was lower than that in february as a result with the exception of the most east china where spi drought grade is more reasonable than spi cor drought grade the spi cor drought grade of the other four regions in black pink blue and red are all better than the spi drought grade except in the south of north china in purple where the spi cor grades are lower the spi grades are higher than spi cor drought grades in the other four regions with different spi and spi cor grade as can be seen from fig 13 a7 b7 in october 2016 the vegetation conditions in the three southern regions in purple green and blue improved significantly from september whereas the vegetation conditions in northeastern china in pink and south of north china deteriorated as shown in table 7 as a result as can be seen in table 8 spi performed better in northeastern china while spi cor performed better in the other four regions based on the above analysis the regional distribution of spi and spi cor preference in drought assessment can be seen in fig 14 ignoring the regions on the qinghai tibet plateau where precipitation has little effect on the vegetation and plants or the response of vegetation takes longer it is illustrated that spi drought grade is more appropriate in northeastern china and central and eastern inner mongolia while spi cor is primarily applicable to central and northwestern china the difference between spi and spi cor drought grade is less in southern china 4 discussion dewfall has an important ecological function in ecosystems however it has been relatively neglected in meteorology even though numerous interesting studies such as measuring dewfall formation would attract scholars attention jacobs et al 2002 it is basically impossible to measure dewfall over long time and dewfall measurement is usually short term monitoring of less than five years in small scale areas currently there is no long term dewfall measurement in large scale areas let alone the spatiotemporal distribution of dewfall in this study the dewfall amount in china from 1975 to 2018 is calculated based on the penman monteith equation the dewfall spatiotemporal distribution is discussed as well comparing with field measurements and other analytical models in previous research hao et al 2012 pan et al 2018 xu et al 2012 wang et al 2019 penman monteith equation is a reliable tool for dewfall estimation dewfall represents the latent heat flux towards the surface as opposed to evaporation so it is feasible to calculate dewfall amount with methods for computing evaporation xiao et al 2017 among the widely used methods such as energy balance eb turbulent vapour transport tvt penman monteith and breb equation penman monteith equation is the only one that does not require measurements of the surface temperature which is not a standard meteorological variable guo et al 2022 it has been applied to studies of dewfall formation in different regions due to the few dewfall measurements it is difficult to enhance the verification and further justify the penman monteith equation the penman monteith equation is complex than field measurement and requires plenty of data guo et al 2016b besides c n and c d in equation 1 which are constants that for the reference crop type and time step were set as uniform constants in this study for a more precise dewfall amount setting c n and c d according to the actual vegetation may be beneficial the widespread impacts of drought make it significant for drought assessment spi an univariate drought indicator about precipitation is the most commonly used drought index to assess meteorological drought in reality drought conditions are associated with multiple variables the univariate index is not sufficient to capture drought characteristics hao et al 2015 as an important component in the water cycle dewfall has been neglected in drought assessment in this study a spi based improvement index spi cor taking into account the complementary effect of dewfall on precipitation was proposed spi cor drought index plays a role in central and northwestern china but has little effect in southern china the dewfall cannot be ignored in arid and semi arid regions with sparse rainfall but is less important in southern china with abundant rainfall which increases the rationality of the applicable region of spi cor spi cor obeys a gamma distribution in this study but factors such as location climate and terrain would affect the probability density function that spi cor follows therefore the next step will be to study the applicability of spi and spi cor with alternative distribution functions and discuss the effect of dewfall on the distribution functions though spi cor considered the supplementary function of dewfall on precipitation its significant impact on ecosystem and drought mitigation still deserves further in depth study the time scale of spi and spi cor in the study is both calculated at 1 month timescale focusing on the effect of dewfall on drought assessments over short time the effect on longer time scales such as 3 6 12 and 24 months should be explored in future work the gldas 2 products we used have 3 hourly temporal resolutions which may lead to an underestimation of the dewfall values especially in time with short nights as dew values might be underestimated during the transition times around sunset and sunrise besides a more profound method of the spatial interpolation that takes into account vegetation and climate features may be preferable to the kriging method for providing the spatial characteristic feature 5 conclusions by calculating the dewfall values at 523 meteorological stations in china from 1975 to 2018 with the gldas 2 data the spi cor was calculated by replacing the precipitation with the summation of dewfall and precipitation the temporal and spatial distribution characteristic of dewfall were investigated and the spi and spi cor were compared as well as the applicability of spi and spi cor in space the main conclusions are as follows 1 according to the penman monteith equation the dewfall values were calculated the calculated dewfall was essentially consistent with the previous research in some local areas and credible 2 the accuracy of spatial interpolation was evaluated by the statistical parameters such as sse mse mae mape rmse and r kriging is the optimal strategy of spi cor among kriging idw and anusplin spatial interpolation methods 3 in terms of temporal characteristic of dewfall the formation of dewfall exhibits a clear interannual periodicity more than 60 of the dewfall in the arid semi arid sub humid and humid areas falls from april to august with more than 40 falling between may and july in the whole year the dewfall values are high in northeast and northwest and low in central and south in the spatial distribution the proportion of dewfall in precipitation rises from south to north except in northwestern china where the proportion is high and gradually climbs from the outer edge to the northwest inland 4 comparing the spi and spi cor in different climate regions it is discovered that the correlation coefficients of spi and spi cor increase from arid to humid in the opposite order as the proportion of dewfall in precipitation in the four regions indicating that the influence of dewfall decreases in the same order dewfall supply has an average impact of one drought grade on drought assessment based on the comparison of spi and spi cor in different meteorological stations drought events and response of vegetation to drought it is concluded that spi is suitable in northeastern china and central and eastern inner mongolia in drought assessment while spi cor in central and northwestern china the difference in drought assessment between spi and spi cor in southern china is unapparent credit authorship contribution statement siyao
