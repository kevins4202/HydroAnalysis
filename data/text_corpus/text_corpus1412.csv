7060,regionalization plays an important role in climatology and hydrology research as it can be used to understand the changing pattern of a hydroclimate variable better and explore its underlying drivers effectively by identifying homogeneous regions which are determined by topography and climatic conditions however as climatic drivers change over time homogeneous regions should vary when the intra annual patterns are of interest in this paper we investigate the regionalization and changing patterns of maximum daily temperature in china based on the maximum air temperature tmax derived from the cn05 1 daily surface air temperature gridded data from 1981 to 2010 we also propose an objective variable based regionalization approach by combining the rotated empirical orthogonal function reof method and k means clustering analysis to determine homogeneous regions effectively for such a large volume of daily grid data the reof approach is not able to identify discrete regional boundaries easily but it is efficient at determining the number of regions and their rough spatial location furthermore while clustering analysis suffers from convergence when the number of observations is large it is able to provide clean boundaries between regions the hybrid method tends to overcome their individual disadvantages while maintaining their individual advantages the results show that the patterns of homogeneous regions have distinct features in both summer and winter seasons the reasonableness of regionalization is then examined by the first principal component within regions which shows the homogeneity within regions and the scatterplots of tmax time series between regions which show the heterogeneity between regions furthermore the boxplots of normalized tmax within regions for both summer and winter seasons also clearly show the different characteristics of inter annual variability in each region in order to reveal detailed process of the change in the number and pattern of regions we further conducted the regionalization for individual months and explored the potential linkages between regionalization and climatic conditions over time this research is noteworthy in promoting research on regionalization with consideration of seasonal and intra annual variation as well as extreme temperature events the proposed hybrid regionalization method is broadly applicable to other regionalization studies keywords cn05 1 daily grid data intra annual variation k mean clustering analysis daily maximum temperature regionalization rotated empirical orthogonal functions reof 1 introduction it is important but difficult to conduct spatial and temporal research in climatology and hydrology due to spatial heterogeneity regionalization provides a simple and efficient way to handle spatial heterogeneity on account of the regional difference in the changing process of climatic variables knapp et al 2002 ding et al 2007 yang et al 2010 for a given research objective conducting research in a region with similar changing pattern on the data series or model parameter of interest can significantly reduce modelling complexity because the variable can be investigated as a whole or the model parameter can be transferable there are two types of regionalization ideas in hydroclimate research regionalization of model equation and or parameter see for example blöschl and sivapalan 1995 and regionalization of data series see for example white et al 1991 the regionalization of model equation or parameter aims to transfer calibrated model from one sub region to another sub region within the homogeneous region see for example sivapalan et al 2003 blöschl 2005 while the regionalization of data series identifies homogenous region in certain aspect of a hydroclimate variable of interest and is frequently used to explore the underlying drivers see for example rao and srinivas 2006a 2006b regonda et al 2016 for ease of notation we name the regionalization of model equation and or parameter as model parameter regionalization and regionalization of data series as variable based regionalization among the various model parameter regionalization approaches regression analysis is one of the most widely used methods lesage 1997 vogel et al 1999 swain and patra 2017 using model parameter and catchment attributes as dependent and independent variables respectively the spatial proximity approach is also widely used for streamflow regionalization in ungauged catchments merz and blöschl 2004 parajka et al 2005 masih et al 2010 samuel et al 2011 physical similarity approach is another regionalization technique which uses catchment attributes to find out physical similarity between donor and receiver catchments nathan and mcmahon 1990 hosking and wallis 2005 parajka et al 2005 kay et al 2006 samuel et al 2011 the model parameter regionalization approaches aim to transfer the optimized model equation and or parameter set from one or more gauged catchments to an ungauged catchment but the existence of spatial heterogeneity prevents such transferring without regionalization for the variable based regionalization the approaches based on unsupervised learning are widely used to identify homogeneous regions of hydroclimate variables including ward s method rao and srinivas 2006a darand and daneshvar 2014 asadi et al 2018 k means clustering hartigan and wong 1979 diaz et al 2001 williams and webb 2009 clifton and lundquist 2012 cao et al 2018 and self organizing maps farsadnia et al 2014 berkovic 2017 with consideration of spatial connection rotated empirical orthogonal function reof method richman 1986 is another popular technique of variable based regionalization white et al 1991 drosdowsky 1993 comrie and glenn 1998 wang et al 2012 particularly for climate variables such as temperature and precipitation reof is developed from eof which is similar with principal components analysis pca except that the eof method finds both time series and spatial patterns in variable based regionalization regional spatial heterogeneity means that the changing patterns of variable in different regions are not consistent and the changes in different regions are driven by different physical mechanisms as a result the different regions cannot be analyzed together as a whole in some recent works high spatial resolution data such as grid data are used to obtain better regionalization but the temporal scale of the data used in the analysis are generally large e g half year or one year satyanarayana and srinivas 2011 han et al 2013 note that climatic conditions change in different period of the year and so do climate variables harrison et al 1990 qian et al 2002 loo et al 2015 the changing patterns in different months and seasons deserve attention to reveal more physical mechanisms for effectively exploring its underlying drivers these two types of regionalization approaches are applied in different fields in this study we focus on the variable based regionalization from computing point of view it is challenging to identify homogeneous regions when the data size is large especially when the spatial connectivity needs to be retained different approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages methods like the k means clustering belong to heuristic data mining methods without likelihood based statistical inference in model selection cowpertwait 2011 so the results are mainly based on minimizing error without considering spatial characteristics and the number of clusters k value for the k means needs to be given beforehand for clustering analysis it is not an easy task to determine the best number of clusters and subjective judgments may play a significant role furthermore without the manually determined initial cluster centroid positions the clustering process will converge slowly or even be trapped in a local optima making the results unstable it is particularly true when the number of samples is large however these methods always assign a clear category for each data point and provide clear boundaries differently other kind of regionalization methods for example reof aim to decompose the data set based on spatial variability and temporal variability in term of orthogonal basis functions and obtain the regionalization by the distribution of loadings with the consideration of spatial characteristics these methods also provide a means to determine the number of homogeneous regions and their spatial locations according to the explained variances however the loading value used to determine the boundaries between homogeneous regions is subjective and more seriously leads to some overlaps between homogeneous regions therefore hybrid methods are proposed for better regionalization farsadnia et al 2014 rao and srinivas 2006b in this study a hybrid regionalization approach is proposed by combining the reof and k means clustering reof is taken as the pre step to optimize the initial settings of k means clustering analysis by doing this the clustering process becomes more objective and the result is more stable as a case study we apply the proposed hybrid approach to the daily maximum air temperature tmax data in china high temperature events affect the society and ecosystem directly and has been one of the major topics for hydro climate research community over the past decade domonkos et al 2003 zhai and pan 2003 liu et al 2006 siliverstovs et al 2010 fischer and knutti 2015 it is found from observations and modelling results that heat waves are becoming more intense more frequent and longer lasting in the 21st century meehl and tebaldi 2004 gershunov et al 2009 kuglitsch et al 2010 some researchers also pointed out that heat waves may affect areas in higher latitudes but the natural environment is ill prepared to adapt the effect luber and mcgeehin 2008 meanwhile with warming climate the winter temperatures in particular homogeneous regions are experiencing rapid increases warm winter events affect snow cover areas decker et al 2003 and lead to more long term and wider impact due to climate change for example less snow cover over the tibetan plateau will lead to the strength of asian summer monsoon thereby affecting the summer temperature and rainfall wu and qian 2003 zhang et al 2004 qin et al 2006 in addition warm winters also directly influence the plant growth for example high temperatures after melt out invariably resulted in a shortened growth period especially in high altitude areas jonas et al 2008 wipf et al 2009 yu et al 2010 china is a country with varied topography and climate regions and suffers from frequent extreme events e g flooding drought extreme temperature events from a climatic perspective one big challenge is that extreme events can be expressed differently and respond to different mechanisms in different locations of china gong et al 2004 ning and qian 2009 zhang et al 2009 zhou et al 2009 liu et al 2013 wang et al 2013 therefore we concentrate on the daily maximum air temperature in china in this study reliable and detailed regionalization study is needed for china because it includes topographically and climatically diverse regions which is also important for extreme events research in literature both climate indices and processed subsets rather than the original data are used to conduct regionalization analysis in terms of extreme analysis the data above or below a predefined threshold are frequently used using thresholds significantly reduces the size of the data and therefore the amount of calculation but can lead to problematic conclusions due to the loss of data continuity and subjective selection of threshold different thresholds can be preferred for different studies therefore raw daily data is preferred and is used in our study to ensure all the information is retained the paper is organized as below the study area and dataset are given in the next section followed by the method description of the proposed hybrid reof k mean method the detailed regionalization results for both the summer and winter seasons are presented in section 4 with some demonstration of the usefulness of our regionalization method in order to understand the changing patterns of regionalization better over time the monthly results are also given the discussion on the possible causes of the changes by exploring the linkage with climate drivers are presented in section 5 conclusions are given in section 6 2 study area and data china covering approximately 9 6 million km2 is a country with varied topography and climate regions china s landscape varies significantly across its vast width broad grasslands dominate on the edges of the inner mongolian plateau in the north there are extensive plains along the shores of yellow sea and the east china sea in the east the central east hosts the yellow river delta and the yangtze river delta while southern china is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges the tibetan plateau sits in southwest china northwest china is arid with large desert and mountain ranges china s climate is mainly dominated by winter and summer monsoons which lead to pronounced differences in temperature between winter and summer in winter northern winds coming from high latitude areas are cold and dry in summer southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist the climate in china differs from region to region also because of the highly complex topography the newly released cn05 1 gridded daily maximum surface air temperature data by the national climate center in china with a high spatial resolution 0 25 for the period of 1981 2010 is used in this study wu and gao 2013 the data was derived from the interpolation from 2416 observation stations in china the anomaly approach new et al 2002 xie et al 2007 in which a gridded mean climatology 1971 2000 is first calculated by thin plate smoothing splines and then a gridded daily anomaly derived by an angular weighting method is added to it is used this dataset has been widely used in analyzing observed climate characteristics over china and in assessing global and regional model performance sun and wang 2015 yang and jiang 2014 lin et al 2016 bucchignani et al 2017 wu et al 2017 3 methods 3 1 reof analysis data normalization is required as pretreatment before reof analysis the normalization used in this study is described below given a data series x 0 representing the raw daily tmax data in a grid the normalization is 1 x x 0 x 0 s x 0 where x 0 is the mean of tmax series s x 0 is the standard deviation of the series and x is the normalized series the eof analysis is a decomposition of a signal or data set in terms of orthogonal basis functions which are determined from the data similar with pca it tends to find a relatively small number of independent variables which convey as much of the original information as possible without redundancy the eigenvectors i e eofs are usually plotted as vector maps to describe spatial variability by showing the regions which are related or not eof analysis has been widely used in meteorology and climatology bess et al 1992 biggerstaff and seo 2010 zveryaev and allan 2010 however sometimes the high order eofs have smaller spatial scales and are not physically meaningful due to the orthogonality su et al 2008 page 24 and the obtained spatial structure will change with the selected region and bring difficulties in physical interpretation the reof analysis is developed to overcome these limitations the correlation based varimax reof is used in this study initial eof modes are linearly transformed with the varimax method which maximizes the variance of the squared correlation coefficient between the time series of each reof mode and each original eof mode this method increases the spatial variability in the modes and the significant anomalies appear where regional phenomena are dominant richman 1986 3 2 k means clustering method the k means cluster algorithm aims to find a partition so that the squared error between empirical mean of a cluster and points in the cluster is minimized the squared error for each cluster with cluster centroid μ k is defined as jain 2010 2 j c k x i c k x i μ k 2 where x i is the variable normalized tmax value in i th grid x i i 1 n is clustered into a set of k clusters μ k is the cluster center of cluster c k j c k is the squared error of cluster c k let c c k k 1 k for a given number of clusters k value the objective of k means cluster analysis is to minimize the sum of squared error in all k clusters 3 j c k 1 k x i c k x i μ k 2 in computing the positions of the initial cluster centroid can be given manually and will be set randomly in default method if not provided 3 3 hybrid regionalization approach the detailed process of the hybrid regionalization approach is given in fig 1 the varimax reof results provide a suitable number of clusters and the positions with the highest value of the rotated loading vector they are used to determine the k value and the initial cluster centroid positions in k means analysis the proposed hybrid approach for seasonal data includes three steps the monthly regionalization is conducted with same steps and the only difference is the seasonal data will be replaced by monthly data 1 summer june to august and winter december to february daily tmax data from 1981 to 2010 in the case study are extracted e g june 1 to august 31 belong to summer and the matrix size of data in each grid will be 92 30 the tmax data series is normalized grid by grid for example in the analysis of summer season the length of data series used in the normalization is 92 days 30 years in each grid 2 in this study the first n eofs which together explain more than 85 of the variance are retained and rotated for the use by varimax then the reofs which together explain more than 75 of the variance are selected furthermore a reof in the remaining terms will also be retained if it explains more than 5 of the variance here the threshold value of 85 for eof s cumulative variance follows the suggestions in literature wei 2007 wang et al 2013 because this threshold value is sufficient to retain enough spatial characteristics for analysis the threshold value of 75 in reof step is adopted to eliminate the secondary regions and retain the dominant regions at the same time wang et al 2013 however it should be noted that the threshold values can be properly changed in different applications depending on the complexity of the studied regions 3 the number of the retained reofs is used as the k value in k means analysis the grids with highest loading factor values in selected n reof modes are identified and the corresponding tmax data series at the identified grids are used as initial cluster centroid positions which are also named as seeds to start the k means analysis a comparison between the hybrid regionalization and k means approaches based on the case study is provided in the appendix to demonstrate the advantage of hybrid approach in more detail 4 results 4 1 regionalization in summer and winter seasons the clustering algorithms are first performed on the summer tmax anomalies data the first 18 out of 2760 30x93 eofs together explain 85 57 of the variance a new set of reof modes are produced by rotating the first 18 loading vectors of the initial eofs of the variance the percentages of variance captured by each eof and reof are listed in table 1 the first 13 reofs are retained as they together explain 78 01 of the variance and the modes are shown as fig 2 a the k value is therefore determined as 13 the positions with highest loading value in each reof modes pointed in figure as red triangles are used as initial positions of cluster centroid then k means analysis derives the final 13 homogeneous regions fig 3 a the homogeneity is assessed by computing the variance contribution of first principal components with normalized data in each homogeneous region the results can capture the domination and indicate if the tmax of grids in the same homogeneous region have similar changing process in summer the variance contribution rate of the first principal components in most homogeneous regions except region xii and region xiii are all greater than 60 table 2 however the variance contribution rates in region xii and region xiii are 58 43 and 54 71 respectively which are still acceptable high values and can show the homogeneity of these two homogeneous regions on the other hand the heterogeneity between homogeneous regions obtained from the regionalization approach is assessed by the scatter plots of summer daily tmax time series fig 4 the distribution of regional tmax and the correlation coefficient between each homogeneous region is also included it can be seen that the relationship among the homogeneous regions are generally weak and it is hard to find significant linear correlation between the changes of tmax in different homogeneous regions however some pairs of homogeneous regions have relatively high correlations e g region i and region vii region v and region xii region viii and region x region ii and region iii these pairs of homogeneous region are all adjacent and their high correlations are because of the similar climatic condition in summer the boxplot of the summer tmax values are given in fig 5 it can be seen that regional summer tmax values between adjacent homogeneous regions with high correlations are considered as different homogenous regions because of high inter annual variability note that although daily normalized tmax values 92 days 30 years are used in regionalization approach the length of the daily array is too long to show the boxplot clearly in the figure the boxplots at seasonal scale i e for the normalized data within a homogeneous region in each year are presented as they still retain the inter annual characteristics the boxplots clearly show the inter annual changes within homogeneous regions and the inter annual variability and the overall trend are quite different between homogeneous regions for example the tmax in region vii has cooling trend in the 80 s but warming trend from 1991 to 1993 and then remained in a relatively stable level region i has no significant turning point and shows only a slightly increasing trend from the end of the 80 s to 2010 that is why they are classified as different homogeneous regions in the regionalization this is also true to the other pairs of homogeneous regions with relatively high correlations furthermore the change of tmax in region v has four clear turning points in 1989 1993 1998 and 2006 differently the change of tmax in region xii fluctuated in the 80 s turned to cooling trend from 1990 to 1992 became warmer from 1992 to 1994 and remained in a stable level after that region viii has four significant turning points in 1984 1991 2003 and 2006 with complicated inter annual variability in the 1990s and an overall cooling trend the changing process in region x is relatively simple showing a warming trend from the 80 s to 1996 before turning to a cooling trend the change of tmax in region ii has three turning points in 1994 1999 and 2002 while region iii showed totally different patterns with four clear turning points in 1985 1996 2002 and 2005 in brief the features of inter annual variability in different homogeneous region are significantly different demonstrating the inter regional heterogeneity compared with the summer results the number and pattern of regions have significant changes in winter the first 8 eofs together explain 85 24 of the variance and the first five reofs together can explain 75 49 of the variance table 1 and fig 2b the fact that more than 75 of the total variability can be captured by only six eofs suggests that the spatial complexity of tmax over the mainland china in winter can largely be explained by a small number of spatial structures it is noteworthy that the variance contributions of first five reofs are all greater than 10 while sixth reof mode is only 3 93 different from the regionalization in summer with many small homogeneous regions the regionalization in winter results in five homogeneous regions fig 3b it also implies the dominant weather system in china becomes simpler and leads to the consistent temperature change in large areas the variance contribution rate of the first principal components of five homogeneous regions in winter are all greater than 65 table 2 which means the change of the winter daily tmax in the same homogeneous region is uniform the dominant weather system in china in winter is much simpler over the region of the siberian high strong radiative cooling and large scale descending motion contributes to a rapid buildup of the siberian high ding and krishnamurti 1987 fig 6 shows the relationship between homogeneous regions huanghuai jianghuai basin region iv is located in the transition zone from the area directly affected by the winter monsoon region i to the area almost not affected by the winter monsoon region v and hence has some correlation with both region i and region v fig 7 gives the boxplots of the winter tmax value in all the 5 regions it shows different inter annual variability in different homogeneous regions region i has a warming trend in 1980s and then a cooling trend until 2000 before becomes warmer after that region ii has a more complex changing process with five significant turning points in 1985 1989 1994 2003 and 2005 the trend in region iii is relatively simple with a decreasing trend from the middle of 1980s to 2005 except two abnormally warm years 1989 and 1990 and an increasing trend from 2005 to 2010 the tmax in region iv has inter annual turbulences in the 1980s with overall warming trend decreases from 1983 to 2000 then remains warming until 2004 it has a significant warming trend after an abnormal year 2005 the inter annual changing process in region v is relatively complex and has seven turning points in 1986 1990 1994 1997 2001 2004 and 2007 4 2 monthly regionalization in summer and winter seasons the spatial patterns of temperature change in different part of china are stable and show clear spatial consistencies and therefore the regional features are prominent however in spring and autumn the temperature change significantly over time in most region of china due to consistent warming and cooling trends respectively leading to the unstable regionalization results when different number of months were used detrending is needed for analysis but may cause the result to be unsuitable for comparison as such we did not investigate the results for spring and autumn instead we reported the monthly results to show the changing pattern in the number of homogeneous regions and explained the possible mechanisms that drive this change as the trends at monthly level were smaller fig 8 shows the regionalization results for individual months by our hybrid approach as expected the monthly regionalization results are associated with seasonal results but more features are identified in shorter time scale with the monthly results as shown in fig 9 the changing patterns in the regionalization occur over time and the number of homogeneous regions displays a regular cycle over the year the variation of tmax is relatively stable in cold months with smaller number of homogeneous regions and the smallest number in february when spring march to may comes weather systems become more variable with the increasing solar radiation leading to complex and changeable temperatures in different homogeneous regions the number of homogeneous regions also increases gradually in spring until abrupt change occurs from may to june with the onset of the summer monsoon systems especially in the east china where the monsoon systems have more significant influence as a result the number of homogeneous regions increases rapidly as the hottest season june to august approaches and the number of homogeneous regions peaks in july the number of homogeneous regions drops from 13 to 7 in three months from august to october with the process of monsoon systems withdraw it is particularly interesting to point out the use of winter half year and summer half year in literature in china october to march are traditionally regarded as winter half year song et al 2014 ge et al 2003 defined october to april as winter half year while wei and feng 2008 defined november to next april as winter half year as we found in this study that the number of homogeneous regions is small in cold and cool months and increases to a large level as the temperature increases then falls back to a small value after hot months end the turning points occur nearly in may and october in terms of the tmax variation we tend to define may to september as summer half year and october to april as winter half year 5 discussion 5 1 regionalization in summer and winter seasons the climatic factors that makes the summer regionalization so complicated are mainly attributed to the monsoon climate complex and changeable monsoon circle systems like northwest pacific subtropical high south asia high meiyu front monsoon trough etc lu and dong 2001 qian et al 2002 zhang et al 2002 zhou et al 2004 ding and chan 2005 are active in china and the mechanism to impact precipitation and temperature is different in various regions with different latitude altitude and regional topography in details china can be divided into monsoon and non monsoon regions based on whether the region is influenced by monsoon flow and monsoon rainfall qian et al 2009 in summer region i region ii and region iii locating in the interior area of northwest china belong to non monsoon regions the climatic condition in these regions are obviously different from monsoon regions which are dry and covered by a large quantity of desert while tarim basin and qaidam basin have different conditions of heat accumulation and tianshan mountains block the cold air from north shi et al 2007 this region is therefore partitioned into three parts the summer temperature in the northeast china is influenced by the polar vortex the north pacific oscillation sea surface temperature zhang et al 1985 lian et al 2013 snow cover li and mi 1983 and summer monsoon in regionalization this area is divided into two homogeneous regions region viii and region x according to the analysis of sun and wang 2006 the main features of the atmospheric general circulation and sea surface temperature associating with the temperature of these two homogeneous regions are different in addition the temperature of north region region viii has a significant correlation with east asian summer monsoon whereas the south region region x does not the complexity in the eastern china with region v region vi region ix and region xii is mainly attributed to the oscillation of summer rainfall belt under the control of summer monsoon which impact temperature directly detailed processes will be revealed later in the monthly regionalization region vii is the loess plateau which is located in a semi arid and semi humid area also has special topography and underlying surface chen et al 2008 it leads to the consistent temperature change in this region northeast of tibetan plateau region region xi includes sichuan basin and western sichuan plateau generally sichuan basin is considered as a particular region in climate research it also can be seen that the western sichuan plateau is not covered by reof modes which means the temperature change in this region is not consistent according to the results the western sichuan plateau s temperature is more similar with sichuan basin compared to other adjacent homogeneous regions one possible explanation is the forcing of the tibetan plateau duan and wu 2005 lau et al 2006 transferring from the plateau to basin and is the main factor of the temperature change in this region this pattern mainly occurs in july according to the monthly regionalization fig 8 it is noted that region xii and region xiii locating in the south china coast and yunnan plateau have special climatic conditions in summer which can partly explain why the variance contribution rates of first component are smaller in these two homogeneous regions this less consistent change in temperature in the south china coast is mainly attributed to the influence of complex summer monsoon system the tropical cyclones landfall along the south china coast during summer also cause huge impacts to temperature liu and chan 2003 chan et al 2004 goh and chan 2010 yunnan plateau is a mountainous area with an average altitude of 1980 m with the high mountains of eastern himalayas in the west because of the complex topography the climatic trends and variability over yunnan plateau are far from uniform fan et al 2011 leading to the relatively lower contribution to the first principal component additionally summer climate over yunnan plateau is co dominated by the southwest and east asian summer monsoons during summer thomas 1993 which also increases the complexity of temperature change the hybrid approach can be further applied to explore the sub regions and explain the relatively weaker consistency compared with summer season smaller number of homogeneous regions in winter implies relatively higher degree of consistency in maximum daily temperatures under the control of siberian high cold and dry winter monsoon blows from eurasia to the ocean the cold air from siberian makes the temperature of the northwest china change consistently region i in winter regionalization matches well with the area which is directly influenced by winter monsoon while the qinghai tibet plateau region iii is hardly affected by the winter monsoon because of the high altitude qinling mountains is located approximately at the boundary of region i and region iv blocks the cold air from north and make the huanghuai jianghuai basin region iv less affected south china and sichuan basin region v in relatively lower latitude is far from the core of siberian high the effect of winter monsoon in this region is limited northeast china region ii is in a special geographic location with the highest latitude of china and is neighbors with the east siberian and mongolian plateau the cold waves from arctic ocean and siberian effect northeast china and it is the coldest region of china in winter it would be interesting to explore and understand why the number of homogeneous regions in summer is much more than that in winter because of the bigger land sea thermal difference in winter the winter monsoon is much more robust than summer monsoon wen et al 2000 and the summer monsoon blows from low altitude area to high altitude area thus is vulnerable to topography on the contrary winter monsoon blows from high altitude area is less blocked by terrain chang 2004 furthermore in summer the rising warm air is imprisoned in lowland and the regional temperature change is independent with adjacent areas thus many homogeneous regions are identified in summer regionalization the sinking cold air is easier to flow into the lowland from higher altitude area in cooler seasons which leads to the large consistent regions in winter 5 2 monthly regionalization monthly regionalizations reveal relationships to climate conditions that are distinct from the seasonal regionalizations for example tianshan mountain isolates north xinjiang from other parts of northwest china and makes it an independent region of tmax change from march to november north xinjiang is in a westerly zone and is always affected by cold air from the north south xinjiang is normally controlled by south asia high and subtropical high but less affected by northern cold air making different temperature change from north xinjiang especially in summer however in the winter months temperature variation in whole northwest china become more consistent under the control of powerful siberian high and the north xinjiang is not an isolated region as it is in the summer months wang and yang 2007 from may to september the number of homogeneous regions in east china are larger than other months one significant feature is in huanghuai plain and the yangtze river basin which are partitioned into two homogeneous regions it is mainly caused by the process of the summer monsoon and western pacific subtropical high which have significant influence to summer rainfall and temperature the rainy season in china generally begins with the onset of the summer monsoon and ends with its withdrawal cao et al 2018 on account of monsoon and subtropical high the rain belt oscillates between south china and north china from may to september since the rain belt lands at south china around may and gradually moves north until it reach northeast china in august at the end of august the rain belt crosses yellow river and moves back to south china again in early september ding 1992 the movement of the rain belt and subtropical high play an important role in the complicated climate pattern of east china in the summer and result in the different features of temperature change at huanghuai plain and yangtze river basin from june to september in the remaining months the tmax changes in these two homogeneous regions become more consistent without the impact of the monsoon and subtropical high as mentioned previously several homogeneous regions appear only in hot months such as sichuan basin june to august loess plateau june to august and the north of daxing anling june to september the temperature variation in these homogeneous regions present different spatial features from adjacent homogeneous regions due to specific terrain patterns and the influence of weather system in summer for example sichuan basin is surrounded by daba mountains hengduan mountains and wuling mountains as a lowland region in southwest china with the influence of the summer monsoon subtropical high westerly circulation and plateau low vortex the basin is hot and humid in summer peng et al 2007 rising warm air is imprisoned in the lowland in hot days and leads to the lock of heat exchange and surface convection with adjacent areas on the contrary the sinking cold air is easier to flow into the basin from higher altitude area in cooler seasons therefore although sichuan basin is always a separate homogeneous region the remarkable within region consistency of tmax change only occurs in summer at the same time some regions are stable throughout the whole year such as the tibet plateau mainly because of the high altitude the climatic factors in this region always change as a whole as well known tibet plateau is a stable heat source in summer and cool source in winter which not only means that it play an important role in atmospheric circulation but also indicates the consistency of temperature variation in the plateau 6 conclusions because of the different climatic conditions and topography over the world regionalization is an essential step in climatology and hydrology research high temperature is an important variable in hydro climate research as extreme events affects the society and ecosystem directly based on the latest cn05 1 gridded daily tmax data the changing patterns of homogeneous regions in china in different periods of the year is revealed results showed that the pattern is complicated in summer with the number of homogeneous regions reaches to 13 while the pattern is much simpler in winter with the number of homogeneous regions being only five to further reveal the linkage of the changing patterns in regionalization with climate conditions the monthly data are further explored the change in the pattern of homogeneous regions occurs over time and the number of homogeneous regions displays a regular cycle over the year regionalization is stable in cold months but changes rapidly in hot months the number of homogeneous regions is smallest five in february and peaks to 14 in july it is found that the number of homogeneous regions increases gradually in spring until abrupt changes in the number and pattern of regions occur in may with the onset of the summer monsoon systems and the number of homogeneous regions drops rapidly in october after the summer monsoon systems withdraw this result agrees with the study of han et al 2013 which supported the results under the same definition of winter half year and summer half year furthermore the changing characteristics in specific homogeneous regions over time are explained the results show that the patterns of homogeneous regions have distinct monthly features which has not been emphasized in the literatures to determine the homogeneous regions for the large volume of data in this study we proposed a hybrid regionalization approach based on reof method and k means clustering analysis in the hybrid approach reof is taken as the pre step to optimize the initial settings of k means clustering analysis the varimax reof results provide a suitable number of homogeneous regions and the positions with the highest value of rotated loading vector the reof results are used to objectively determine the k value and the initial cluster centroid positions in k means analysis unlike the reof method the hybrid regionalization approach can obtain clear boundaries and therefore avoid the subjective judgment required in a traditional k means analysis at the same time once reof results are applied the lack of spatial consideration in the k means analysis is improved the reasonableness of our approach is further tested by examining the variation contribution of the first principal component within homogeneous regions and the rates are generally greater than 60 in summer and 65 in winter the correlation coefficients of regional average daily tmax time series shows the relationship between different homogeneous regions although significant linear correlation among regions has not been found some pairs of homogeneous regions with relatively high correlation are identified however the boxplots for the normalized tmax data series within homogeneous regions further reveal the different characteristics of inter annual variability in each homogeneous region and explain the reason that adjacent homogeneous regions have similar sequences of temperature change are partitioned into two homogeneous regions furthermore the regionalization with consideration of seasonal and intra annual variation should motivate more research interest in furthering the use of regionalization and the proposed hybrid regionalization method is broadly applicable to other

anonymous reviewers are gratefully acknowledged appendix comparison between the hybrid regionalization and k means approaches the reof method cannot determine clear boundaries between homogeneous regions which are subject to the threshold of loading value e g 0 6 in fig 2 the regions are overlapping with each other and leave many gaps which are uncovered while k means analysis does not suffer from the boundary problem it suffers from convergence problem when the observation series is large and or the number of clusters is large even if the number of clusters has been determined without the pre established initial cluster centroid positions k means analysis will converge slowly and present unstable results in optimization taking the summer regionalization as an example after the k value is determined as 13 according to reof result 1000 k means analysis to the normalized summer daily tmax data are conducted to test the stability of convergence results random initial centroid values are used and the first 100 resulted values of squared error are shown in fig 10 from which it can be found that the values of squared error are quite different the minimum of squared error which we seek for by k means is near 850 the squared errors lower than this value occur only 243 times in 1000 analyses and 23 times in the first 100 results while we use the highest loading points in reof modes to pre establish the initial cluster centroid positions the clustering results remain stable and the value of squared error is always equal to 849 06 see fig 3a the smallest value in 1000 tests this attributes to the extra consideration on spatial characteristics with reof results which is lacking in k means method furthermore the differences of the squared error also represent changeable pattern of regionalization as a comparison two regionalization with different values of squared error are shown in fig 11 the patterns are obviously different when the value of squared error is large fig 11a even though the values of squared error are close to 850 the approximate minimum the difference of pattern still cannot be ignored fig 11b the k mean analysis for the winter regionalization and the following monthly regionalization also has similar convergence problems to see this convergence problem 100 k mean analysis to the normalized winter daily tmax data are conducted by using randomly generated centroid values and the sorted values of squared error are shown in fig 12 from which it can be seen that the values of squared error still vary although there are only several different values 
7060,regionalization plays an important role in climatology and hydrology research as it can be used to understand the changing pattern of a hydroclimate variable better and explore its underlying drivers effectively by identifying homogeneous regions which are determined by topography and climatic conditions however as climatic drivers change over time homogeneous regions should vary when the intra annual patterns are of interest in this paper we investigate the regionalization and changing patterns of maximum daily temperature in china based on the maximum air temperature tmax derived from the cn05 1 daily surface air temperature gridded data from 1981 to 2010 we also propose an objective variable based regionalization approach by combining the rotated empirical orthogonal function reof method and k means clustering analysis to determine homogeneous regions effectively for such a large volume of daily grid data the reof approach is not able to identify discrete regional boundaries easily but it is efficient at determining the number of regions and their rough spatial location furthermore while clustering analysis suffers from convergence when the number of observations is large it is able to provide clean boundaries between regions the hybrid method tends to overcome their individual disadvantages while maintaining their individual advantages the results show that the patterns of homogeneous regions have distinct features in both summer and winter seasons the reasonableness of regionalization is then examined by the first principal component within regions which shows the homogeneity within regions and the scatterplots of tmax time series between regions which show the heterogeneity between regions furthermore the boxplots of normalized tmax within regions for both summer and winter seasons also clearly show the different characteristics of inter annual variability in each region in order to reveal detailed process of the change in the number and pattern of regions we further conducted the regionalization for individual months and explored the potential linkages between regionalization and climatic conditions over time this research is noteworthy in promoting research on regionalization with consideration of seasonal and intra annual variation as well as extreme temperature events the proposed hybrid regionalization method is broadly applicable to other regionalization studies keywords cn05 1 daily grid data intra annual variation k mean clustering analysis daily maximum temperature regionalization rotated empirical orthogonal functions reof 1 introduction it is important but difficult to conduct spatial and temporal research in climatology and hydrology due to spatial heterogeneity regionalization provides a simple and efficient way to handle spatial heterogeneity on account of the regional difference in the changing process of climatic variables knapp et al 2002 ding et al 2007 yang et al 2010 for a given research objective conducting research in a region with similar changing pattern on the data series or model parameter of interest can significantly reduce modelling complexity because the variable can be investigated as a whole or the model parameter can be transferable there are two types of regionalization ideas in hydroclimate research regionalization of model equation and or parameter see for example blöschl and sivapalan 1995 and regionalization of data series see for example white et al 1991 the regionalization of model equation or parameter aims to transfer calibrated model from one sub region to another sub region within the homogeneous region see for example sivapalan et al 2003 blöschl 2005 while the regionalization of data series identifies homogenous region in certain aspect of a hydroclimate variable of interest and is frequently used to explore the underlying drivers see for example rao and srinivas 2006a 2006b regonda et al 2016 for ease of notation we name the regionalization of model equation and or parameter as model parameter regionalization and regionalization of data series as variable based regionalization among the various model parameter regionalization approaches regression analysis is one of the most widely used methods lesage 1997 vogel et al 1999 swain and patra 2017 using model parameter and catchment attributes as dependent and independent variables respectively the spatial proximity approach is also widely used for streamflow regionalization in ungauged catchments merz and blöschl 2004 parajka et al 2005 masih et al 2010 samuel et al 2011 physical similarity approach is another regionalization technique which uses catchment attributes to find out physical similarity between donor and receiver catchments nathan and mcmahon 1990 hosking and wallis 2005 parajka et al 2005 kay et al 2006 samuel et al 2011 the model parameter regionalization approaches aim to transfer the optimized model equation and or parameter set from one or more gauged catchments to an ungauged catchment but the existence of spatial heterogeneity prevents such transferring without regionalization for the variable based regionalization the approaches based on unsupervised learning are widely used to identify homogeneous regions of hydroclimate variables including ward s method rao and srinivas 2006a darand and daneshvar 2014 asadi et al 2018 k means clustering hartigan and wong 1979 diaz et al 2001 williams and webb 2009 clifton and lundquist 2012 cao et al 2018 and self organizing maps farsadnia et al 2014 berkovic 2017 with consideration of spatial connection rotated empirical orthogonal function reof method richman 1986 is another popular technique of variable based regionalization white et al 1991 drosdowsky 1993 comrie and glenn 1998 wang et al 2012 particularly for climate variables such as temperature and precipitation reof is developed from eof which is similar with principal components analysis pca except that the eof method finds both time series and spatial patterns in variable based regionalization regional spatial heterogeneity means that the changing patterns of variable in different regions are not consistent and the changes in different regions are driven by different physical mechanisms as a result the different regions cannot be analyzed together as a whole in some recent works high spatial resolution data such as grid data are used to obtain better regionalization but the temporal scale of the data used in the analysis are generally large e g half year or one year satyanarayana and srinivas 2011 han et al 2013 note that climatic conditions change in different period of the year and so do climate variables harrison et al 1990 qian et al 2002 loo et al 2015 the changing patterns in different months and seasons deserve attention to reveal more physical mechanisms for effectively exploring its underlying drivers these two types of regionalization approaches are applied in different fields in this study we focus on the variable based regionalization from computing point of view it is challenging to identify homogeneous regions when the data size is large especially when the spatial connectivity needs to be retained different approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages methods like the k means clustering belong to heuristic data mining methods without likelihood based statistical inference in model selection cowpertwait 2011 so the results are mainly based on minimizing error without considering spatial characteristics and the number of clusters k value for the k means needs to be given beforehand for clustering analysis it is not an easy task to determine the best number of clusters and subjective judgments may play a significant role furthermore without the manually determined initial cluster centroid positions the clustering process will converge slowly or even be trapped in a local optima making the results unstable it is particularly true when the number of samples is large however these methods always assign a clear category for each data point and provide clear boundaries differently other kind of regionalization methods for example reof aim to decompose the data set based on spatial variability and temporal variability in term of orthogonal basis functions and obtain the regionalization by the distribution of loadings with the consideration of spatial characteristics these methods also provide a means to determine the number of homogeneous regions and their spatial locations according to the explained variances however the loading value used to determine the boundaries between homogeneous regions is subjective and more seriously leads to some overlaps between homogeneous regions therefore hybrid methods are proposed for better regionalization farsadnia et al 2014 rao and srinivas 2006b in this study a hybrid regionalization approach is proposed by combining the reof and k means clustering reof is taken as the pre step to optimize the initial settings of k means clustering analysis by doing this the clustering process becomes more objective and the result is more stable as a case study we apply the proposed hybrid approach to the daily maximum air temperature tmax data in china high temperature events affect the society and ecosystem directly and has been one of the major topics for hydro climate research community over the past decade domonkos et al 2003 zhai and pan 2003 liu et al 2006 siliverstovs et al 2010 fischer and knutti 2015 it is found from observations and modelling results that heat waves are becoming more intense more frequent and longer lasting in the 21st century meehl and tebaldi 2004 gershunov et al 2009 kuglitsch et al 2010 some researchers also pointed out that heat waves may affect areas in higher latitudes but the natural environment is ill prepared to adapt the effect luber and mcgeehin 2008 meanwhile with warming climate the winter temperatures in particular homogeneous regions are experiencing rapid increases warm winter events affect snow cover areas decker et al 2003 and lead to more long term and wider impact due to climate change for example less snow cover over the tibetan plateau will lead to the strength of asian summer monsoon thereby affecting the summer temperature and rainfall wu and qian 2003 zhang et al 2004 qin et al 2006 in addition warm winters also directly influence the plant growth for example high temperatures after melt out invariably resulted in a shortened growth period especially in high altitude areas jonas et al 2008 wipf et al 2009 yu et al 2010 china is a country with varied topography and climate regions and suffers from frequent extreme events e g flooding drought extreme temperature events from a climatic perspective one big challenge is that extreme events can be expressed differently and respond to different mechanisms in different locations of china gong et al 2004 ning and qian 2009 zhang et al 2009 zhou et al 2009 liu et al 2013 wang et al 2013 therefore we concentrate on the daily maximum air temperature in china in this study reliable and detailed regionalization study is needed for china because it includes topographically and climatically diverse regions which is also important for extreme events research in literature both climate indices and processed subsets rather than the original data are used to conduct regionalization analysis in terms of extreme analysis the data above or below a predefined threshold are frequently used using thresholds significantly reduces the size of the data and therefore the amount of calculation but can lead to problematic conclusions due to the loss of data continuity and subjective selection of threshold different thresholds can be preferred for different studies therefore raw daily data is preferred and is used in our study to ensure all the information is retained the paper is organized as below the study area and dataset are given in the next section followed by the method description of the proposed hybrid reof k mean method the detailed regionalization results for both the summer and winter seasons are presented in section 4 with some demonstration of the usefulness of our regionalization method in order to understand the changing patterns of regionalization better over time the monthly results are also given the discussion on the possible causes of the changes by exploring the linkage with climate drivers are presented in section 5 conclusions are given in section 6 2 study area and data china covering approximately 9 6 million km2 is a country with varied topography and climate regions china s landscape varies significantly across its vast width broad grasslands dominate on the edges of the inner mongolian plateau in the north there are extensive plains along the shores of yellow sea and the east china sea in the east the central east hosts the yellow river delta and the yangtze river delta while southern china is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges the tibetan plateau sits in southwest china northwest china is arid with large desert and mountain ranges china s climate is mainly dominated by winter and summer monsoons which lead to pronounced differences in temperature between winter and summer in winter northern winds coming from high latitude areas are cold and dry in summer southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist the climate in china differs from region to region also because of the highly complex topography the newly released cn05 1 gridded daily maximum surface air temperature data by the national climate center in china with a high spatial resolution 0 25 for the period of 1981 2010 is used in this study wu and gao 2013 the data was derived from the interpolation from 2416 observation stations in china the anomaly approach new et al 2002 xie et al 2007 in which a gridded mean climatology 1971 2000 is first calculated by thin plate smoothing splines and then a gridded daily anomaly derived by an angular weighting method is added to it is used this dataset has been widely used in analyzing observed climate characteristics over china and in assessing global and regional model performance sun and wang 2015 yang and jiang 2014 lin et al 2016 bucchignani et al 2017 wu et al 2017 3 methods 3 1 reof analysis data normalization is required as pretreatment before reof analysis the normalization used in this study is described below given a data series x 0 representing the raw daily tmax data in a grid the normalization is 1 x x 0 x 0 s x 0 where x 0 is the mean of tmax series s x 0 is the standard deviation of the series and x is the normalized series the eof analysis is a decomposition of a signal or data set in terms of orthogonal basis functions which are determined from the data similar with pca it tends to find a relatively small number of independent variables which convey as much of the original information as possible without redundancy the eigenvectors i e eofs are usually plotted as vector maps to describe spatial variability by showing the regions which are related or not eof analysis has been widely used in meteorology and climatology bess et al 1992 biggerstaff and seo 2010 zveryaev and allan 2010 however sometimes the high order eofs have smaller spatial scales and are not physically meaningful due to the orthogonality su et al 2008 page 24 and the obtained spatial structure will change with the selected region and bring difficulties in physical interpretation the reof analysis is developed to overcome these limitations the correlation based varimax reof is used in this study initial eof modes are linearly transformed with the varimax method which maximizes the variance of the squared correlation coefficient between the time series of each reof mode and each original eof mode this method increases the spatial variability in the modes and the significant anomalies appear where regional phenomena are dominant richman 1986 3 2 k means clustering method the k means cluster algorithm aims to find a partition so that the squared error between empirical mean of a cluster and points in the cluster is minimized the squared error for each cluster with cluster centroid μ k is defined as jain 2010 2 j c k x i c k x i μ k 2 where x i is the variable normalized tmax value in i th grid x i i 1 n is clustered into a set of k clusters μ k is the cluster center of cluster c k j c k is the squared error of cluster c k let c c k k 1 k for a given number of clusters k value the objective of k means cluster analysis is to minimize the sum of squared error in all k clusters 3 j c k 1 k x i c k x i μ k 2 in computing the positions of the initial cluster centroid can be given manually and will be set randomly in default method if not provided 3 3 hybrid regionalization approach the detailed process of the hybrid regionalization approach is given in fig 1 the varimax reof results provide a suitable number of clusters and the positions with the highest value of the rotated loading vector they are used to determine the k value and the initial cluster centroid positions in k means analysis the proposed hybrid approach for seasonal data includes three steps the monthly regionalization is conducted with same steps and the only difference is the seasonal data will be replaced by monthly data 1 summer june to august and winter december to february daily tmax data from 1981 to 2010 in the case study are extracted e g june 1 to august 31 belong to summer and the matrix size of data in each grid will be 92 30 the tmax data series is normalized grid by grid for example in the analysis of summer season the length of data series used in the normalization is 92 days 30 years in each grid 2 in this study the first n eofs which together explain more than 85 of the variance are retained and rotated for the use by varimax then the reofs which together explain more than 75 of the variance are selected furthermore a reof in the remaining terms will also be retained if it explains more than 5 of the variance here the threshold value of 85 for eof s cumulative variance follows the suggestions in literature wei 2007 wang et al 2013 because this threshold value is sufficient to retain enough spatial characteristics for analysis the threshold value of 75 in reof step is adopted to eliminate the secondary regions and retain the dominant regions at the same time wang et al 2013 however it should be noted that the threshold values can be properly changed in different applications depending on the complexity of the studied regions 3 the number of the retained reofs is used as the k value in k means analysis the grids with highest loading factor values in selected n reof modes are identified and the corresponding tmax data series at the identified grids are used as initial cluster centroid positions which are also named as seeds to start the k means analysis a comparison between the hybrid regionalization and k means approaches based on the case study is provided in the appendix to demonstrate the advantage of hybrid approach in more detail 4 results 4 1 regionalization in summer and winter seasons the clustering algorithms are first performed on the summer tmax anomalies data the first 18 out of 2760 30x93 eofs together explain 85 57 of the variance a new set of reof modes are produced by rotating the first 18 loading vectors of the initial eofs of the variance the percentages of variance captured by each eof and reof are listed in table 1 the first 13 reofs are retained as they together explain 78 01 of the variance and the modes are shown as fig 2 a the k value is therefore determined as 13 the positions with highest loading value in each reof modes pointed in figure as red triangles are used as initial positions of cluster centroid then k means analysis derives the final 13 homogeneous regions fig 3 a the homogeneity is assessed by computing the variance contribution of first principal components with normalized data in each homogeneous region the results can capture the domination and indicate if the tmax of grids in the same homogeneous region have similar changing process in summer the variance contribution rate of the first principal components in most homogeneous regions except region xii and region xiii are all greater than 60 table 2 however the variance contribution rates in region xii and region xiii are 58 43 and 54 71 respectively which are still acceptable high values and can show the homogeneity of these two homogeneous regions on the other hand the heterogeneity between homogeneous regions obtained from the regionalization approach is assessed by the scatter plots of summer daily tmax time series fig 4 the distribution of regional tmax and the correlation coefficient between each homogeneous region is also included it can be seen that the relationship among the homogeneous regions are generally weak and it is hard to find significant linear correlation between the changes of tmax in different homogeneous regions however some pairs of homogeneous regions have relatively high correlations e g region i and region vii region v and region xii region viii and region x region ii and region iii these pairs of homogeneous region are all adjacent and their high correlations are because of the similar climatic condition in summer the boxplot of the summer tmax values are given in fig 5 it can be seen that regional summer tmax values between adjacent homogeneous regions with high correlations are considered as different homogenous regions because of high inter annual variability note that although daily normalized tmax values 92 days 30 years are used in regionalization approach the length of the daily array is too long to show the boxplot clearly in the figure the boxplots at seasonal scale i e for the normalized data within a homogeneous region in each year are presented as they still retain the inter annual characteristics the boxplots clearly show the inter annual changes within homogeneous regions and the inter annual variability and the overall trend are quite different between homogeneous regions for example the tmax in region vii has cooling trend in the 80 s but warming trend from 1991 to 1993 and then remained in a relatively stable level region i has no significant turning point and shows only a slightly increasing trend from the end of the 80 s to 2010 that is why they are classified as different homogeneous regions in the regionalization this is also true to the other pairs of homogeneous regions with relatively high correlations furthermore the change of tmax in region v has four clear turning points in 1989 1993 1998 and 2006 differently the change of tmax in region xii fluctuated in the 80 s turned to cooling trend from 1990 to 1992 became warmer from 1992 to 1994 and remained in a stable level after that region viii has four significant turning points in 1984 1991 2003 and 2006 with complicated inter annual variability in the 1990s and an overall cooling trend the changing process in region x is relatively simple showing a warming trend from the 80 s to 1996 before turning to a cooling trend the change of tmax in region ii has three turning points in 1994 1999 and 2002 while region iii showed totally different patterns with four clear turning points in 1985 1996 2002 and 2005 in brief the features of inter annual variability in different homogeneous region are significantly different demonstrating the inter regional heterogeneity compared with the summer results the number and pattern of regions have significant changes in winter the first 8 eofs together explain 85 24 of the variance and the first five reofs together can explain 75 49 of the variance table 1 and fig 2b the fact that more than 75 of the total variability can be captured by only six eofs suggests that the spatial complexity of tmax over the mainland china in winter can largely be explained by a small number of spatial structures it is noteworthy that the variance contributions of first five reofs are all greater than 10 while sixth reof mode is only 3 93 different from the regionalization in summer with many small homogeneous regions the regionalization in winter results in five homogeneous regions fig 3b it also implies the dominant weather system in china becomes simpler and leads to the consistent temperature change in large areas the variance contribution rate of the first principal components of five homogeneous regions in winter are all greater than 65 table 2 which means the change of the winter daily tmax in the same homogeneous region is uniform the dominant weather system in china in winter is much simpler over the region of the siberian high strong radiative cooling and large scale descending motion contributes to a rapid buildup of the siberian high ding and krishnamurti 1987 fig 6 shows the relationship between homogeneous regions huanghuai jianghuai basin region iv is located in the transition zone from the area directly affected by the winter monsoon region i to the area almost not affected by the winter monsoon region v and hence has some correlation with both region i and region v fig 7 gives the boxplots of the winter tmax value in all the 5 regions it shows different inter annual variability in different homogeneous regions region i has a warming trend in 1980s and then a cooling trend until 2000 before becomes warmer after that region ii has a more complex changing process with five significant turning points in 1985 1989 1994 2003 and 2005 the trend in region iii is relatively simple with a decreasing trend from the middle of 1980s to 2005 except two abnormally warm years 1989 and 1990 and an increasing trend from 2005 to 2010 the tmax in region iv has inter annual turbulences in the 1980s with overall warming trend decreases from 1983 to 2000 then remains warming until 2004 it has a significant warming trend after an abnormal year 2005 the inter annual changing process in region v is relatively complex and has seven turning points in 1986 1990 1994 1997 2001 2004 and 2007 4 2 monthly regionalization in summer and winter seasons the spatial patterns of temperature change in different part of china are stable and show clear spatial consistencies and therefore the regional features are prominent however in spring and autumn the temperature change significantly over time in most region of china due to consistent warming and cooling trends respectively leading to the unstable regionalization results when different number of months were used detrending is needed for analysis but may cause the result to be unsuitable for comparison as such we did not investigate the results for spring and autumn instead we reported the monthly results to show the changing pattern in the number of homogeneous regions and explained the possible mechanisms that drive this change as the trends at monthly level were smaller fig 8 shows the regionalization results for individual months by our hybrid approach as expected the monthly regionalization results are associated with seasonal results but more features are identified in shorter time scale with the monthly results as shown in fig 9 the changing patterns in the regionalization occur over time and the number of homogeneous regions displays a regular cycle over the year the variation of tmax is relatively stable in cold months with smaller number of homogeneous regions and the smallest number in february when spring march to may comes weather systems become more variable with the increasing solar radiation leading to complex and changeable temperatures in different homogeneous regions the number of homogeneous regions also increases gradually in spring until abrupt change occurs from may to june with the onset of the summer monsoon systems especially in the east china where the monsoon systems have more significant influence as a result the number of homogeneous regions increases rapidly as the hottest season june to august approaches and the number of homogeneous regions peaks in july the number of homogeneous regions drops from 13 to 7 in three months from august to october with the process of monsoon systems withdraw it is particularly interesting to point out the use of winter half year and summer half year in literature in china october to march are traditionally regarded as winter half year song et al 2014 ge et al 2003 defined october to april as winter half year while wei and feng 2008 defined november to next april as winter half year as we found in this study that the number of homogeneous regions is small in cold and cool months and increases to a large level as the temperature increases then falls back to a small value after hot months end the turning points occur nearly in may and october in terms of the tmax variation we tend to define may to september as summer half year and october to april as winter half year 5 discussion 5 1 regionalization in summer and winter seasons the climatic factors that makes the summer regionalization so complicated are mainly attributed to the monsoon climate complex and changeable monsoon circle systems like northwest pacific subtropical high south asia high meiyu front monsoon trough etc lu and dong 2001 qian et al 2002 zhang et al 2002 zhou et al 2004 ding and chan 2005 are active in china and the mechanism to impact precipitation and temperature is different in various regions with different latitude altitude and regional topography in details china can be divided into monsoon and non monsoon regions based on whether the region is influenced by monsoon flow and monsoon rainfall qian et al 2009 in summer region i region ii and region iii locating in the interior area of northwest china belong to non monsoon regions the climatic condition in these regions are obviously different from monsoon regions which are dry and covered by a large quantity of desert while tarim basin and qaidam basin have different conditions of heat accumulation and tianshan mountains block the cold air from north shi et al 2007 this region is therefore partitioned into three parts the summer temperature in the northeast china is influenced by the polar vortex the north pacific oscillation sea surface temperature zhang et al 1985 lian et al 2013 snow cover li and mi 1983 and summer monsoon in regionalization this area is divided into two homogeneous regions region viii and region x according to the analysis of sun and wang 2006 the main features of the atmospheric general circulation and sea surface temperature associating with the temperature of these two homogeneous regions are different in addition the temperature of north region region viii has a significant correlation with east asian summer monsoon whereas the south region region x does not the complexity in the eastern china with region v region vi region ix and region xii is mainly attributed to the oscillation of summer rainfall belt under the control of summer monsoon which impact temperature directly detailed processes will be revealed later in the monthly regionalization region vii is the loess plateau which is located in a semi arid and semi humid area also has special topography and underlying surface chen et al 2008 it leads to the consistent temperature change in this region northeast of tibetan plateau region region xi includes sichuan basin and western sichuan plateau generally sichuan basin is considered as a particular region in climate research it also can be seen that the western sichuan plateau is not covered by reof modes which means the temperature change in this region is not consistent according to the results the western sichuan plateau s temperature is more similar with sichuan basin compared to other adjacent homogeneous regions one possible explanation is the forcing of the tibetan plateau duan and wu 2005 lau et al 2006 transferring from the plateau to basin and is the main factor of the temperature change in this region this pattern mainly occurs in july according to the monthly regionalization fig 8 it is noted that region xii and region xiii locating in the south china coast and yunnan plateau have special climatic conditions in summer which can partly explain why the variance contribution rates of first component are smaller in these two homogeneous regions this less consistent change in temperature in the south china coast is mainly attributed to the influence of complex summer monsoon system the tropical cyclones landfall along the south china coast during summer also cause huge impacts to temperature liu and chan 2003 chan et al 2004 goh and chan 2010 yunnan plateau is a mountainous area with an average altitude of 1980 m with the high mountains of eastern himalayas in the west because of the complex topography the climatic trends and variability over yunnan plateau are far from uniform fan et al 2011 leading to the relatively lower contribution to the first principal component additionally summer climate over yunnan plateau is co dominated by the southwest and east asian summer monsoons during summer thomas 1993 which also increases the complexity of temperature change the hybrid approach can be further applied to explore the sub regions and explain the relatively weaker consistency compared with summer season smaller number of homogeneous regions in winter implies relatively higher degree of consistency in maximum daily temperatures under the control of siberian high cold and dry winter monsoon blows from eurasia to the ocean the cold air from siberian makes the temperature of the northwest china change consistently region i in winter regionalization matches well with the area which is directly influenced by winter monsoon while the qinghai tibet plateau region iii is hardly affected by the winter monsoon because of the high altitude qinling mountains is located approximately at the boundary of region i and region iv blocks the cold air from north and make the huanghuai jianghuai basin region iv less affected south china and sichuan basin region v in relatively lower latitude is far from the core of siberian high the effect of winter monsoon in this region is limited northeast china region ii is in a special geographic location with the highest latitude of china and is neighbors with the east siberian and mongolian plateau the cold waves from arctic ocean and siberian effect northeast china and it is the coldest region of china in winter it would be interesting to explore and understand why the number of homogeneous regions in summer is much more than that in winter because of the bigger land sea thermal difference in winter the winter monsoon is much more robust than summer monsoon wen et al 2000 and the summer monsoon blows from low altitude area to high altitude area thus is vulnerable to topography on the contrary winter monsoon blows from high altitude area is less blocked by terrain chang 2004 furthermore in summer the rising warm air is imprisoned in lowland and the regional temperature change is independent with adjacent areas thus many homogeneous regions are identified in summer regionalization the sinking cold air is easier to flow into the lowland from higher altitude area in cooler seasons which leads to the large consistent regions in winter 5 2 monthly regionalization monthly regionalizations reveal relationships to climate conditions that are distinct from the seasonal regionalizations for example tianshan mountain isolates north xinjiang from other parts of northwest china and makes it an independent region of tmax change from march to november north xinjiang is in a westerly zone and is always affected by cold air from the north south xinjiang is normally controlled by south asia high and subtropical high but less affected by northern cold air making different temperature change from north xinjiang especially in summer however in the winter months temperature variation in whole northwest china become more consistent under the control of powerful siberian high and the north xinjiang is not an isolated region as it is in the summer months wang and yang 2007 from may to september the number of homogeneous regions in east china are larger than other months one significant feature is in huanghuai plain and the yangtze river basin which are partitioned into two homogeneous regions it is mainly caused by the process of the summer monsoon and western pacific subtropical high which have significant influence to summer rainfall and temperature the rainy season in china generally begins with the onset of the summer monsoon and ends with its withdrawal cao et al 2018 on account of monsoon and subtropical high the rain belt oscillates between south china and north china from may to september since the rain belt lands at south china around may and gradually moves north until it reach northeast china in august at the end of august the rain belt crosses yellow river and moves back to south china again in early september ding 1992 the movement of the rain belt and subtropical high play an important role in the complicated climate pattern of east china in the summer and result in the different features of temperature change at huanghuai plain and yangtze river basin from june to september in the remaining months the tmax changes in these two homogeneous regions become more consistent without the impact of the monsoon and subtropical high as mentioned previously several homogeneous regions appear only in hot months such as sichuan basin june to august loess plateau june to august and the north of daxing anling june to september the temperature variation in these homogeneous regions present different spatial features from adjacent homogeneous regions due to specific terrain patterns and the influence of weather system in summer for example sichuan basin is surrounded by daba mountains hengduan mountains and wuling mountains as a lowland region in southwest china with the influence of the summer monsoon subtropical high westerly circulation and plateau low vortex the basin is hot and humid in summer peng et al 2007 rising warm air is imprisoned in the lowland in hot days and leads to the lock of heat exchange and surface convection with adjacent areas on the contrary the sinking cold air is easier to flow into the basin from higher altitude area in cooler seasons therefore although sichuan basin is always a separate homogeneous region the remarkable within region consistency of tmax change only occurs in summer at the same time some regions are stable throughout the whole year such as the tibet plateau mainly because of the high altitude the climatic factors in this region always change as a whole as well known tibet plateau is a stable heat source in summer and cool source in winter which not only means that it play an important role in atmospheric circulation but also indicates the consistency of temperature variation in the plateau 6 conclusions because of the different climatic conditions and topography over the world regionalization is an essential step in climatology and hydrology research high temperature is an important variable in hydro climate research as extreme events affects the society and ecosystem directly based on the latest cn05 1 gridded daily tmax data the changing patterns of homogeneous regions in china in different periods of the year is revealed results showed that the pattern is complicated in summer with the number of homogeneous regions reaches to 13 while the pattern is much simpler in winter with the number of homogeneous regions being only five to further reveal the linkage of the changing patterns in regionalization with climate conditions the monthly data are further explored the change in the pattern of homogeneous regions occurs over time and the number of homogeneous regions displays a regular cycle over the year regionalization is stable in cold months but changes rapidly in hot months the number of homogeneous regions is smallest five in february and peaks to 14 in july it is found that the number of homogeneous regions increases gradually in spring until abrupt changes in the number and pattern of regions occur in may with the onset of the summer monsoon systems and the number of homogeneous regions drops rapidly in october after the summer monsoon systems withdraw this result agrees with the study of han et al 2013 which supported the results under the same definition of winter half year and summer half year furthermore the changing characteristics in specific homogeneous regions over time are explained the results show that the patterns of homogeneous regions have distinct monthly features which has not been emphasized in the literatures to determine the homogeneous regions for the large volume of data in this study we proposed a hybrid regionalization approach based on reof method and k means clustering analysis in the hybrid approach reof is taken as the pre step to optimize the initial settings of k means clustering analysis the varimax reof results provide a suitable number of homogeneous regions and the positions with the highest value of rotated loading vector the reof results are used to objectively determine the k value and the initial cluster centroid positions in k means analysis unlike the reof method the hybrid regionalization approach can obtain clear boundaries and therefore avoid the subjective judgment required in a traditional k means analysis at the same time once reof results are applied the lack of spatial consideration in the k means analysis is improved the reasonableness of our approach is further tested by examining the variation contribution of the first principal component within homogeneous regions and the rates are generally greater than 60 in summer and 65 in winter the correlation coefficients of regional average daily tmax time series shows the relationship between different homogeneous regions although significant linear correlation among regions has not been found some pairs of homogeneous regions with relatively high correlation are identified however the boxplots for the normalized tmax data series within homogeneous regions further reveal the different characteristics of inter annual variability in each homogeneous region and explain the reason that adjacent homogeneous regions have similar sequences of temperature change are partitioned into two homogeneous regions furthermore the regionalization with consideration of seasonal and intra annual variation should motivate more research interest in furthering the use of regionalization and the proposed hybrid regionalization method is broadly applicable to other

anonymous reviewers are gratefully acknowledged appendix comparison between the hybrid regionalization and k means approaches the reof method cannot determine clear boundaries between homogeneous regions which are subject to the threshold of loading value e g 0 6 in fig 2 the regions are overlapping with each other and leave many gaps which are uncovered while k means analysis does not suffer from the boundary problem it suffers from convergence problem when the observation series is large and or the number of clusters is large even if the number of clusters has been determined without the pre established initial cluster centroid positions k means analysis will converge slowly and present unstable results in optimization taking the summer regionalization as an example after the k value is determined as 13 according to reof result 1000 k means analysis to the normalized summer daily tmax data are conducted to test the stability of convergence results random initial centroid values are used and the first 100 resulted values of squared error are shown in fig 10 from which it can be found that the values of squared error are quite different the minimum of squared error which we seek for by k means is near 850 the squared errors lower than this value occur only 243 times in 1000 analyses and 23 times in the first 100 results while we use the highest loading points in reof modes to pre establish the initial cluster centroid positions the clustering results remain stable and the value of squared error is always equal to 849 06 see fig 3a the smallest value in 1000 tests this attributes to the extra consideration on spatial characteristics with reof results which is lacking in k means method furthermore the differences of the squared error also represent changeable pattern of regionalization as a comparison two regionalization with different values of squared error are shown in fig 11 the patterns are obviously different when the value of squared error is large fig 11a even though the values of squared error are close to 850 the approximate minimum the difference of pattern still cannot be ignored fig 11b the k mean analysis for the winter regionalization and the following monthly regionalization also has similar convergence problems to see this convergence problem 100 k mean analysis to the normalized winter daily tmax data are conducted by using randomly generated centroid values and the sorted values of squared error are shown in fig 12 from which it can be seen that the values of squared error still vary although there are only several different values 
7061,land use changes may modify ecohydrological processes in soil altering groundwater quantity and quality in arid and semi arid regions the effects of land use change were well documented on flatlands but the effect of rooting depth on groundwater recharge is poorly understood this study is to evaluate how conversion of shallow rooted to deep rooted vegetation affects groundwater recharge at different landscape positions i e tableland upslope midslope and downslope two adjacent transects were selected for a paired plot design one was covered with shallow rooted perennial grasses and the other was planted with deep rooted apple trees or apricot trees in 1990s soil cores as deep as 13 25 m were collected at each of the four landscape positions along the two transects for the determination of soil water contents root distributions and soil tritium contents groundwater recharge rates beneath shallow rooted vegetation were determined from the tritium peak method and that beneath deep rooted vegetation were calculated by subtracting the annual soil water deficit from recharge rates beneath shallow rooted vegetation results show that there is no significant difference in groundwater recharge between the four landscape positions under shallow rooted vegetation p 0 05 however there is a substantial difference between different slope positions along the other transect p 0 05 cross comparison between the two transects show that conversion from the shallow rooted to deep rooted vegetation resulted in a significant reduction of groundwater recharge p 0 05 which reduced to virtually zero when the rooting depth is deeper than 15 m therefore we conclude that rooting depth is a major control of groundwater recharge this study is the first attempt to evaluate the effect of deep rooted vegetation in the deep unsaturated zone on groundwater recharge on hillslopes with terraces having important implications to afforestation and to understanding ecohydrological processes in natural ecosystems keywords land use change groundwater recharge tritium profile terraced hillslope 1 introduction groundwater is essential both as an economic resource for human development to meet the urban industrial and agricultural water requirements and for maintaining ecological functions in natural systems de vries and simmers 2002 tashie et al 2016 however the demand on limited water supplies in arid and semi arid regions is still increasing the international atomic energy agency iaea estimates that large amounts of groundwater being developed in arid and semi arid regions are mainly from the paleo groundwater and are not reusable scanlon et al 2006 therefore sustainable groundwater use and management are critical to human and ecosystems taylor et al 2012 groundwater recharge provides an important link between the surface water and groundwater and thus dictates the quality and quantity of groundwater therefore it is paramount to obtain accurate estimates of groundwater recharge kim and jackson 2012 scanlon et al 2006 however groundwater recharge is a complex ecohydrological process that is controlled by many factors such as climate land use cover soil type topography and landforms bennett et al 2013 jasechko et al 2014 kim and jackson 2012 petheram et al 2002 scanlon et al 2006 among those factors the land use cover has been found to be the second most important determinant for groundwater recharge following the precipitation but topography effect is often weak kim and jackson 2012 petheram et al 2002 land use change affects water quantity and quality through modifying groundwater recharge walker et al 2002 jobbágy and jackson 2004 scanlon et al 2005 for example land clearing to convert natural forest to rain fed agriculture may lead to an increase by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude in recharge and a rise in water table level in australia allison et al 1990 the elevated groundwater table may degrade groundwater quality due to flushing salts stored in the unsaturated zone into groundwater favreau et al 2009 leduc et al 2001 scanlon et al 2007 conversely land use change from farmland or annual grassland to woodland forest have caused decreased groundwater recharge bari and schofield 1992 gates et al 2011 huang and pang 2010 these changes of groundwater recharge can be attributed to different evapotranspiration between different vegetation types which in turn results from changes in the interception of solar radiation due to the different canopy cover and access to water due to differences in rooting depth zhang et al 2001 the vegetation induced groundwater recharge changes are especially pronounced in water limited environments where plants actively regulate their rooting depths to combat droughts calder 1998 mátyás and sun 2014 nepstad et al 1994 walker et al 2002 zhang et al 2001 however there is little information on the quantitative relationship between rooting depth and groundwater recharge hillslopes as a main land form on terrestrial land surface play an important role in hydrological cycle and land surface process for example overland flow is affected by rainfall intensity vegetation hillslope characteristic like hillslope length gradient and others chen and shao 2003 in general downslope having a larger contributing area receives more incoming water from upslope which may lead to higher infiltration and recharge than upslope positions after conversion to terraces the altered land surface properties may also change soil water infiltration the partition of precipitation to runoff on hillslope zhang et al 2015 and consequently may modify groundwater recharge rates the loess plateau of china lpc mostly located in semi arid and sub humid regions is in the northwest inland of china due to its relatively low annual precipitation 200 800 mm soil water is a main limiting factor for plant growth wang et al 2011 this problem has been exacerbated by the heavy erosive loss of soil and water to combat the erosion large amounts of terrace on hillslopes were constructed and the terraced area increased from 22 7 km2 to 2356 7 km2 during the period of 1956 1996 ning et al 2016 since 1999 conservation practices such as the introduction of trees shrubs and alfalfa have led to rapid land use cover changes and significantly increased vegetation cover during the past a few decades as a result surface runoff and water yield decreased by 90 over 50 of which are attributed to land use cover changes huang and zhang 2004 huang et al 2003 zhang et al 2008 concurrently the land use cover change has been found to cause deep soil desiccation weakening the soil water reservoir chen et al 2005 li 2001 yang 2001 although previous studies showed that vegetation types affect groundwater recharge quantitative relationships between vegetation and groundwater recharge remains poorly understood furthermore only a few studies investigated how land use change modifies groundwater recharge on hillslopes and hillslopes with terraces walker et al 2002 knight et al 2005 cartwright et al 2007 especially conversion from shallow rooted to deep rooted vegetation the reason may be in part due to the lack of an appropriate method to determine groundwater recharge on hillslopes and when the rooting depth is great zhang et al 2017a groundwater recharge is relatively small in arid and semi arid regions and difficult to quantify accurately allison et al 1994 gee and hillel 1988 and thus remains highly uncertain to estimate many methods have been developed to estimate groundwater recharge including the water balance method numerical simulations and environmental tracer methods the certainty is especially true with water balance and numerical simulation methods bennett et al 2013 de vries and simmers 2002 gee and hillel 1988 gong et al 2012 as a result tracer methods have been widely used allison et al 1994 scanlon et al 2006 common environmental tracers include chloride and water isotope tritium as often used in chloride mass balance cmb method and tritium peak tracing methods respectively the application of cmb is hampered by the uncertainty of chloride input fluxes and transient water flow in the unsaturated zone whereas the tritium peak method capitalizes on the nuclear bomb tritium input and has the following advantages 1 it does not require a steady state flow 2 it does not need the exact input amount and 3 it reflects recent land use cover change due to its short half life period the bomb tritium signal in soil is currently undetectable in many areas on the earth now fortunately the 1963 tritium peak is still clearly detectable in some loess areas baran et al 2007 lin and wei 2006 zhang et al 1990 2017b in this study we take advantage of the tritium signal in soil on the lpc to evaluate groundwater recharge rates at four different landscape positions tableland upslope midslope and downslope under two types of land use shallow rooted vegetation and deep rooted trees we will address two scientific questions 1 do landscape positions affect groundwater recharge on terraced hillslopes and 2 how do deep rooted and shallow rooted vegetation affect groundwater recharge 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is in the wangdonggou watershed 35 12 35 16 n 107 40 107 42 e fig 1 on the southeastern portion of the lpc the watershed with an area of 6 3 km2 is subject to warm temperate semi humid zone and continental monsoon climate the long term 1957 2015 average annual temperature is 9 4 c the average annual reference evapotranspiration is 893 69 mm and the average annual precipitation is 578 125 mm with about 55 falling between july and september the topography and landform include loess flat plateau tableland ridge and gully with the elevation varying from 946 m to 1226 m the soil is predominantly silty loam with a silt content over 50 the volumetric water contents at field capacity and at permanent wilting point are 0 28 and 0 11 m3 m 3 respectively the water table varies between 60 and 100 m depth depending on the landscape positions the deep loess profile consists of alternating glacial loess and interglacial paleosol the loess being yellowish and silt loam textured has no or few restrictions for root penetration or water infiltration however the paleosol were more reddish slightly cemented and higher in clay content although still having a silt loam texture this layer may give rise to some restriction to root penetration and water infiltration messing et al 2003 the land use almost all rainfed includes farmland wheat maize and orchards apple on the tableland and mostly grasslands with some bush encroachment or woody species apricot robinia on hillslopes 2 2 sampling and analytical methods two adjacent hillslopes the shallow rooted grassland at east hillslope and deep rooted woodland at west hillslope were selected for a paired plot design the two hillslopes were only 30 m apart separated by a steep and narrow 8 m with gully in between both hillslopes were natural grassland until 1960 when they were converted to terraces and started growing wheat or corn by local farmers in 1992 the west terraced hillslope was turned into with apple trees in upslope positions and apricot trees in midslope and downslope positions the paired sites on the tableland are about 2 km away from the upslope positions and there is only 10 m away between the sampling cores of continuous annual maize and 17 year apple orchard planted in 1998 for the grassland hillslope the lai leaf area index was measured by the li 2000 for each site aboveground biomass was chosen by random quadrat method replicated three times in the field the aboveground biomass was harvested by a pair of scissors then were oven dried for two days at 70 c and weighed for the woodland hillslope lai and biomass were not measured 1 soil sampling for each of the four landscape positions of the two hillslopes a deep soil core was obtained with a hollow stem auger with stem extension at a sampling interval of 0 20 m to a depth of 13 25 m the detailed sampling depths are shown in fig 2 the three grassland hillslopes were sampled between june 21 and june 26 2014 and the three hillslopes of woodland and two tablelands were sampled between june 10 and june 22 2015 in total there were eight cores four pairs between shallow rooted and deep rooted vegetation at the upslope of grassland a replicate soil core was taken between june 12 and15 2015 which is 2 m away from the sampling core taken in 2014 the differences in soil water content between 2014 and 2015 are negligible fig 2b the elevation of the sampling cores at tableland upslope midslope and downslope positions were 1230 1189 1163 and 1134 masl respectively the average bulk density is 1 42 g cm 3 unpublished data of deep profile each soil sample was split into two parts one was placed immediately into polyethylene plastic bottle with parafilm sealed and kept frozen for further isotopic composition analysis the other was put into an aluminous specimen box to measure the gravimetric soil water content for the two cores at grassland upslope position soil water contents were measured for both cores because of the similar soil water content profiles only the core taken in 2014 was processed for further 3h analysis to reduce the cost for the water isotope analysis soil water was extracted by cryogenic vacuum distillation and then about 8 ml of them was then mixed with 12 ml scintillation solution hisafe3 in a 25 ml standard plastic bottle after 24 hour dark adaptation the tritium count was directly recorded with a low background liquid scintillation counter quantulus 1220 perkinelmer singapore in the northwest a f university china net counts per minute cpm defined as the difference between the cpm of the extracted sample and a tritium free sample were converted directly into tritium units 1 tu 1 h3 1018h jakonić et al 2014 the limit of detection was 16 tu zhang et al 2017b 2 root sampling a root auger with a diameter of 85 mm was used to obtain the root distributions of three hillslopes of the grasslands and woodlands between august 23 and 27 2017 one root core was collected close to each of the corresponding soil core taken in 2014 for the three grassland hillslope positions for each of the woodlands two cores 2 m and 3 m away from a selected trunk were taken and the average value of the two cores was taken as representative of the apricot root distribution the cores were taken at a sampling interval of 0 2 m to a depth of 13 to 25 m until no roots were discernible the roots were not sampled on the tableland to save huge labour costs because the results show that the roots distribution is determined more by the species rather than the hillslope positions fig 3 compared with the deep rooted vegetation the differences in rooting depth between the shallow rooted grass and maize can be ignored fig 3 the water contents of each soil sample were determined with roots excluded the remainder of the soil sample was then washed carefully and passed through a 0 5 mm sieve the fresh root samples were selected with tweezers and scanned on a flatbed scanner the root length under different diameters were determined by analyzing the scanned root pictures using the delta t scan image analysis software delta t devices company uk the fine root length density frld was then calculated as the total length in each soil sample divided by the volume of soil sample in addition the above ground biomass of the grassland at the three hillslope positions were measured 2 3 methods to calculate groundwater recharge rates 1 tritium peak method the tritium activity in precipitation was only 5 10 tu before 1952 however large amounts of radioactive tritium was produced after 1952 and peaked several thousand tu in 1963 eriksson 1965 as a result of intensive atomic bomb testing in the world after 1963 open air bomb testing was banned and the fall out tritium activity in precipitation gradually reduced the tritiated precipitation falls and infiltrates into soil responding to the tritium activity in precipitation zimmermann et al 1967 since then tritium as a nearly perfect tracer has been widely used to track water flow and date groundwater and the tritium tracing method was used to estimate groundwater recharge all over the world in the past several decades allison and hughes 1983 downing et al 1979 lin and wei 2006 scanlon et al 2002 si and de jong 2007 the advantage of tritium tracing method is that unlike the cmb the runoff loss of precipitation does not affect the peak tritium depth which is used to determine groundwater recharge therefore the tritium peak depth can be readily and directly applied to determine groundwater recharge rates on hillslopes assuming piston flow soil water storage above the depth of 1963 peak represents the net input from precipitation after evapotranspiration since 1963 therefore the long term annual recharge rates since 1963 is given by allison et al 1990 1 r 0 l θ z d z n where r is the estimated potential groundwater recharge rate mm yr 1 θ z is the soil volumetric water content m3 m 3 as the function of depth z m l is the depth of tritium peak m and n is the number of years between the year of sampling and 1963 2 groundwater recharge under deep rooted vegetation a prerequisite of eq 1 is that the tritium peak has passed the bottom of the root zone tyler and walker 1994 therefore it can only be used to determine the groundwater recharge rates in shallow rooted ecosystems such as grassland and annual cropland for deep rooted vegetation such as apple and apricot trees the tritium peak may still be within the root zone making the peak tritium method unsuitable for adjacent woodland and farmland a paired plot design zhang et al 2017a 2017b developed a new method to estimate the groundwater recharge rates beneath a deep rooted woodland because the horizontal variability in soil texture in wangdonggou watershed is negligible duan et al 2016 the annual average soil water deficit under the deep rooted vegetation relative to the shallow rooted vegetation δr can be calculated from the water storage difference between the woodland and farmland 2 δ r δ s t 1 t 2 d θ sr z θ dr z d z where δs is soil water deficit for the woodland relative to the farmland below the active root zone 2 m lower limit of above integral see fig 3 mm t is the age of woodland or the number of years since the farmland was converted to woodland yr θsr z and θdr z are the soil water contents for the shallow and deep rooted vegetation for depth z and d is the depth below which the water contents between the two land types are no longer different m then groundwater recharge under deep rooted vegetation rd could be calculated from the groundwater recharge under shallow rooted vegetation rs minus δr zhang et al 2017a that is 3 r d r s δ r note that the water flux obtained from eq 3 may not be groundwater recharge defined as the water flux currently entering the groundwater this is because the soil water storage within the root zone exhibits strong seasonality and can be altered by not only deep drainage but also root water uptake and evaporation assuming piston flow new water displaces old water and thus the soil water storage above the tritium peak can be considered as the total water recharge to the soil since 1963 allison et al 1990 and will form future deep drainage when all the new water is displaced the displaced water recharged before 1963 moved below the tritium peak in soil profile and formed deep drainage rate below the tritium peak depth therefore any reduction or increase in soil water storage above the tritium peak depth will eventually translate into a reduction or increase in deep drainage rate at the bottom of the root zone in the future therefore the recharge rate derived from eq 3 is the deep drainage rate in the future which in turn become future groundwater recharge despite of this subtle difference between groundwater recharge and deep drainage rate most studies including this research use the two terms interchangeably scanlon et al 2006 in addition many other studies also used the reduction in soil water storage as a reduction of groundwater recharge rates allison et al 1990 zhang et al 2017a 2 4 uncertainty and statistical analysis from eq 1 we know that the uncertainty in r results is mainly from the uncertainty in peak depth l and soil water contents θ above the peak depth based on the first order perturbation analysis of eq 1 the variance in estimated rs σ2 sr of shallow rooted vegetation can be calculated as 4 σ sr 2 r l 2 σ l 2 r θ 2 σ θ 2 θ l n 2 σ l 2 l n 2 σ θ 2 similarly the variance in estimated rδr σ2 δr can be obtained through perturbation analysis of eq 2 as 5 σ δ r 2 2 σ θ 2 t 2 the variance in estimated rd σ2 dr for deep rooted vegetation can be derived through perturbation analysis of eq 3 6 σ dr 2 σ sr 2 σ δ r 2 where n is 51 years for the terraced hillslope and 52 years for the plateau σl and σθ are the standard errors of l and θ respectively for given standard errors of two means the difference between the means can be tested using the student t test 7 t x y σ x 2 σ y 2 where x and y are the means of variable x and y respectively σx and σy are the standard errors of x and y respectively 3 results 3 1 soil water content profile soil water contents at depth below the deep rooted woodland apple and apricot trees were substantially lower than that below the shallow rooted grassland fig 2 at each landscape position the average soil water contents were 0 03 to 0 04 m3 m 3 lower in the soil profile of woodland than that of grassland or cropland table 1 therefore the apple and apricot trees consumed more deep soil water than the grassland at the same landscape positions creating a water deficit zone below the 2 m depth fig 2 moreover the difference of the average water content between the two types of land use is not discernible 0 01 m3 m 3 below 15 4 m on the tableland fig 2a thus the deficit zone ranges from 2 0 m to 15 4 m the deficit zone of the upslope is the thickest fig 2b followed by the tableland apple fig 2a the midslope and downslope had much thinner deficit zones fig 2c d with 2 0 to 11 6 m for the midslope and 2 0 to 7 6 m for the downslope respectively therefore the bottom of soil water deficit zone deepened from the tableland to the upslope and then became progressively shallower from the upslope to the middle slope and to the downslope positions fig 2 table 1 shows that the total soil water deficit between shallow rooted and deep rooted vegetation increased with increasing thickness of the deficit zone from downslope 367 mm to midslope 428 mm tableland 577 mm and upslope 732 mm the vertical distribution of deep soil water contents below 2 m was remarkably stable in time in this study soil water content profile of the grassland upslope in 2014 was almost identical to that taken at an adjacent site in 2015 due to the low spatial variability and infiltration capacity of loess fig 2b 3 2 root distribution for different vegetation in soil profiles the frld results are shown in table 2 and fig 3 for shallow rooted maize field the rooting depth defined as the depth above which 95 of roots located was 2 m which is similar to those reported by gao et al 2014 and liu 2016 the frld d 2 mm decreased exponentially with depth for each of the profiles on the grassland terraces fig 3a the maximum rooting depth was 1 4 m for the upslope and midslope and 3 0 m for the downslope reflecting increased brush encroachment downslope further the total frld was higher as the slope position is lower fig 3a which corresponded to the reduced dry biomass and lai from the downslope 486 94 g m 2 3 54 to the midslope 233 45 g m 2 2 08 and upslope 274 74 g m 2 2 17 the root distribution of the apple trees at the upslope was strikingly uniform with depth within the root zone from the soil surface to the depth of 23 m fig 3b however the rooting depths of apricots on terraces were 13 m for the midslope and 10 4 m for the downslope fig 3b the root distribution of apricot was analogous to a 4 3 2 1 type root distribution pierret et al 2017 which differed much from the exponential distribution of grassland and relatively uniform distribution of apple tree fig 3b table 2 the total frld values of both apricot orchards were larger than that of the apple orchard at the upslope table 2 further 79 of roots of the apple orchard on the upslope were below 2 0 m whereas it reduced to 8 5 and 11 6 for the apricot on the midslope and downslope respectively this may have important implications for the plants ability to uptake and intercept the infiltrating water in the root zone although the rooting depth decrease along the hillslope from upslope to downslope position there is no causal relationship between the rooting depth and hillslope positions the main difference may be due to the different species apple tree fuji as an exotic breed consumes deep soil water in dry season which further promotes deeper root 10 m development apricot trees however are native and xerophytic and rely on water storied in shallow depths to satisfy its water demand et therefore apricot tree had shallower rooting depth than apple tree in addition the downslope positions hundreds of meters in elevation below the table land may have smaller evapotranspiration rates due to the generally cooler temperature higher relative humidity and thus less water demand from the plants at lower landscapes this may also result in shallower roots for plants on downslope positions the rooting depths of deep rooted trees coincided with the depth of the bottom of water deficit zone figs 2 3b table 3 for example no difference in soil water profiles was found between the two types of land use below 11 6 m at the midslope fig 2c which coincided with the rooting depth 11 6 m of apricot at midslope table 3 on the tableland zhang et al 2017a showed that the maximum rooting depth for apple orchard planted in 1998 was 15 2 m which was identical to the depth of the bottom of the water deficit zone of apple tree at tableland in this study therefore we use 15 2 m as the tableland apple tree root depth in table 3 3 3 tritium profile and groundwater recharge for different vegetation there is a distinct bell shape tritium bulge in the profile at each slope position fig 4 to identify the depth of peak tritium concentration the peak lorentz model is fitted to the tritium distribution in each of eight tritium profiles fig 4 on the tableland the peak tritium concentration depths are located at 6 14 0 12 m and 6 5 0 10 m for the shallow rooted and deep rooted vegetation at the upslope midslope and downslope the peak depths for the shallow rooted vegetation were deeper than that of the deep rooted vegetation fig 4 table 3 the deeper tritium peak although not statistically significant and the higher aboveground biomass and lai suggest that the downslope position of the grassland transect receives more water from rainfall and probably an extra input from run on from higher positions than the upslope position hence increasing the potential of groundwater recharge data from runoff plots in changwu agro ecological experiment station on the tableland starting from 2004 show that runoff can take place during the period of focused storms in this area li et al 2017 however vegetation cover on the terraced hillslopes can further reduce or eliminate runoff by increasing overland flow resistance on the surface and rainfall infiltration rate in rare cases extreme rainfall produces limited surface runoff the effect of which on groundwater recharge can be easily offset by increased et due to better vegetation growth for the shallow rooted vegetation the long term average recharge rate can be calculated from the soil water storage above the peak depth using eq 1 because the tritium bulge was well below the root zone table 3 fig 4 the average recharge rates ranged between 33 and 38 mm yr 1 for the shallow rooted vegetation at the four landscape positions showing no significant difference between landscape positions p 0 05 table 3 the recharge was equivalent to 6 6 of the total precipitation for the deep rooted vegetation the tritium bulge was well within the root zone therefore we used eq 3 instead of the peak tritium method to estimate the groundwater recharge rate given the number of years since land use conversion the soil water storage reduction rate was 34 mm yr 1 for the tableland 32 mm yr 1 for the upslope for the apple orchard 19 mm yr 1 for the midslope and 16 mm yr 1 for the downslope for the apricot site table 3 this average reduction was equivalent to 5 7 of the long term average annual precipitation for the apple orchard and 3 1 for the apricot site over all of the slope positions the average groundwater recharge rate for the shallow rooted vegetation was 34 mm yr 1 whereas that of the deep rooted vegetation was 9 mm yr 1 the differences in peak depth soil water storage and groundwater recharge rates were statistically significant p 0 05 between the shallow rooted and deep rooted vegetation therefore there was a significant reduction of groundwater recharge after land use conversion to deep rooted orchards for the deep rooted vegetation the groundwater recharge rates were almost zero for the apple orchard and 15 22 mm yr 1 for the apricot trees showing a great reduction of groundwater recharge by woody species negative value of groundwater recharge represents no recharge in table 3 and the groundwater recharge between apple and apricot orchard differed significantly p 0 05 3 4 groundwater recharge at different slope positions for shallow rooted vegetation the peak tritium depths increased from 6 1 m at tableland to 6 9 7 4 and 7 9 m at upslope midslope and downslope positions respectively table3 fig 4 however the recharge rates varied between 33 and 38 mm yr 1 table 3 showing no statistical differences between the four slope positions p 0 05 for the deep rooted vegetation the recharge rates increased from 0 to 22 mm yr 1 as slope positions became lower p 0 05 table 3 surprisingly as the slope positions became lower the peak tritium concentrations were progressively smaller for the deep rooted vegetation but greater for the shallow rooted vegetation fig 3 the peak tritium concentrations were quite similar on the tableland and upslope between the two types of vegetation however they were three times smaller for deep rooted vegetation than for shallow rooted vegetation on the midslope and downslope suggesting that deep rooted vegetation decreased peak tritium concentration through root water uptake and subsequent replenishment from rainfall infiltration to the peak depth 3 5 relation between rooting depth and groundwater recharge the standard errors of peak tritium depth l are listed in table 3 for a measurement error of 0 01 m3 m 3 of the soil water content using the oven dry method the calculated σ sr of the shallow rooted vegetation from eq 4 are 1 3 1 5 1 5 and 1 7 mm yr 1 from the tableland lower to downslope respectively the calculated σ δ r values from eq 5 were 1 4 1 2 0 8 and 0 6 mm yr 1 for tableland upslope midslope and downslope after the land use conversion respectively and the calculated σ dr values of the deep rooted vegetation from eq 6 were 1 9 1 9 1 7 and 1 8 mm yr 1 from tableland to the downslope respectively the standard errors were all relatively small reflecting the reliability of the tritium peak method for the determination of groundwater recharge rates the calculated standard errors can be used in eq 7 to test the significance of the difference of groundwater recharge between different positions and land use types results showed that there was no statistical difference in groundwater recharge rates between the four hillslope positions for the shallow rooted vegetation p 0 05 however the groundwater recharge of deep rooted vegetation was significantly lower than that of shallow rooted one p 0 05 suggesting that the conversion to deep rooted from shallow rooted vegetation decreased groundwater recharge significantly interestingly the groundwater recharge of apple orchards at both the tableland and upslope was nearly zero however the downslope position had significantly larger groundwater recharge than the midslope position under the apricot vegetation p 0 05 furthermore the groundwater recharge under apple vegetation was significantly lower than that under apricot vegetation p 0 05 this difference may result from the difference in root distribution and rooting depth if we pool all the rooting depths and groundwater recharge rates at all landscape positions together there was a significant negative correlation between rooting depth and groundwater recharge rate p 0 05 fig 5 based on this relationship an increase of rooting depth by 1 m on average reduce groundwater recharge by 2 3 mm yr 1 when rooting depth is 15 m the groundwater water recharge rate decreases to 0 mm yr 1 suggesting that deep rooted vegetation creates a zero flux zone when the rooting depth is large than 15 m 4 discussion 4 1 landscape positions had little effect on groundwater recharge vegetation types modify precipitation intensity runoff ratio and actual evapotranspiration and thus exert substantial influence on groundwater recharge furthermore landscape position controls the partition of precipitation into runoff and infiltration normally having a major effect on groundwater recharge surprisingly the downslope did not show a larger groundwater recharge than the upslope for the grassland which may be related to the ability of terraces and vegetation to reduce runoff data from runoff plots near the study site showed that runoff can only take place during the period of focused storms li et al 2017 and the vegetation cover on the terraces can further reduce or eliminate runoff by increasing overland flow resistance on the surface and rainfall infiltration rate zhang et al 2015 in rare cases extreme rainfall may produce limited surface runoff and increase infiltration at downslope positions the effect of which on groundwater recharge can be easily offset by increased evapotranspiration due to enhanced vegetation growth 4 2 rooting depth controls groundwater recharge rates this study showed that land use covers in terms of rooting depth had a significant effect on groundwater recharge fig 5 our result is consistent with the result of zhang et al 2001 and zhang et al 2017a moreover we developed the quantitative relationship between rooting depth and groundwater recharge relative to the shallow rooted vegetation the deep rooted vegetation reduced groundwater recharge by 50 table 3 usually the depleted soil water cannot be replenished before the next growing season resulting in progressively more soil water deficit as the stand age increases like the deep rooted vegetation presented in this study this phenomenon is common on the loess plateau and is especially evident in deep rooted ecosystem wang et al 2011 2010 yan et al 2015 groundwater recharge had a negative correlation to rooting depth fig 5 because most of annual crops and perennial grasses have a shallow root system to take advantage of frequent rainfall events that infiltrate into shallow soils this allows a portion of a large rainfall event to infiltrate deeper than the shallow root zone and to recharge deeper soil and groundwater liu et al 2010 the larger the rainfall events is the deeper the soil water infiltrates and the more likely the rainfall penetrates through the root zone conversely the deeper the rooting depth is the more the deep soil water consumption and the less the groundwater recharge therefore groundwater recharge depends on the depth of rainfall infiltration and the rooting depth for example an extreme rainfall event 180 mm in five days after the harvest of winter wheat in 2003 reached 5 m depth liu et al 2010 which could lead to the continuous infiltration of soil water through the root zone of apricots thus this portion of rainfall will form potential groundwater recharge however for apple orchards this portion of infiltrated water is still within the root zone of 15 23 m depth and can be taken up by plants leaving little for groundwater recharge fan et al 2017 previous research correlated groundwater recharge to land use types such as grassland woodland and forest kim and jackson 2012 scanlon et al 2006 however the relationship is poorly constrained and thus is highly uncertain kim and jackson 2012 the uncertainty may arise from the fact that rooting depth differs substantially between different species within the same land use type for example apple tree and apricots orchards are all woodland but their root depth varies from 10 m to 23 m criteria that take rooting depth into consideration in globe synthesis gao et al 2015 seyfried et al 2005 seyfried and wilcox 2010 may help reduce the uncertainty and better understand the controls of groundwater recharge at the global scale we admit that we suggest more studies are needed to synthesize database and make the relationship more accurately 4 3 implication for modeling groundwater recharge under diverse vegetation covers global analysis of rooting depth revealed that the global average rooting depth is only 4 6 m canadell et al 1996 in this study we show that the rooting depth can be as deep as 23 m for the 23 year old apple and 10 m for apricot trees such a deep rooting depth allows plants to access deep soil water reserve elevates evapotranspiration and reduces surface runoff and thus could dramatically alter the hydrology at the surface leading to a substantially reduced groundwater recharge as compared to shallow rooted crops therefore sound modeling of hydrological processes would need accurate knowledge of rooting depth unfortunately major modeling work still assume shallow rooting depth crosbie et al 2013 keese et al 2005 small 2005 wang et al 2015 the model may be suffice for modeling large evapotranspiration rates in humid regions but may introduce unacceptable errors to groundwater recharge estimates therefore more work is needed for defining ecosystem rooting depth in order to obtain accurate groundwater recharge estimates in arid and semi arid environments this study clearly demonstrated that deep rooted vegetation for ecorestoration could substantially increase the risk of reducing groundwater recharge this problem can be especially acute in some semiarid zones where deep rooted vegetation can be dominant and ground water is the only sources of water for human consumption and economical development therefore the impact of deep rooted vegetation on groundwater recharge should be an integral consideration in sustainable ecorestoration efforts on the other hand deep rooted plants could substantially reduce or eliminate groundwater recharge this will effectively limited the water cycle to the surface soil and disconnect the precipitation with deep unsaturated zone and groundwater eliminating the potential groundwater pollution from the pollution sources from the surface and root zone this has important implication for mining waste disposal and reclamation 5 conclusions the eight tritium profiles in this study with clearly detectable peaks corresponding to the year of 1963 show that soil water movement is dominated by piston flow through a paired plot design on the tableland and three positions of the hillslope the differences in groundwater recharge between the shallow rooted and deep rooted vegetation were analyzed the main conclusions are as follow 1 there was no significant difference in root distribution and groundwater recharge between the tableland upslope midslope and downslope under shallow rooted vegetation however the root distributions and groundwater recharge rates at the four landscape positions for deep rooted vegetation were significantly different 2 land use conversion to deep rooted vegetation resulted in an obvious reduction of groundwater recharge there existed a strong negative correlation between groundwater recharge and rooting depth when the rooting depth is 15 m and deeper than which the groundwater recharge is virtually 0 mm yr 1 estimations of groundwater recharge on hillslopes are of great significance and can help improve the understanding of hydrological process of hillslope for a deep rooted ecosystem it is possible that the deep roots could diminish groundwater recharge rate creating a zero flux zone in the deep unsaturated zone that may cut off the connection between surface water and groundwater cycle which has important implication for better understanding of water cycle at the catchment scale our research also provides guidance for selection of plants in land reclamation when isolation of surface water cycles from the overburden materials is needed and provides valuable information for local water resources management and sustainable development 6 conflict of interest the authors declare that they have no conflict interest acknowledgements this work was partially supported by national natural

7061,land use changes may modify ecohydrological processes in soil altering groundwater quantity and quality in arid and semi arid regions the effects of land use change were well documented on flatlands but the effect of rooting depth on groundwater recharge is poorly understood this study is to evaluate how conversion of shallow rooted to deep rooted vegetation affects groundwater recharge at different landscape positions i e tableland upslope midslope and downslope two adjacent transects were selected for a paired plot design one was covered with shallow rooted perennial grasses and the other was planted with deep rooted apple trees or apricot trees in 1990s soil cores as deep as 13 25 m were collected at each of the four landscape positions along the two transects for the determination of soil water contents root distributions and soil tritium contents groundwater recharge rates beneath shallow rooted vegetation were determined from the tritium peak method and that beneath deep rooted vegetation were calculated by subtracting the annual soil water deficit from recharge rates beneath shallow rooted vegetation results show that there is no significant difference in groundwater recharge between the four landscape positions under shallow rooted vegetation p 0 05 however there is a substantial difference between different slope positions along the other transect p 0 05 cross comparison between the two transects show that conversion from the shallow rooted to deep rooted vegetation resulted in a significant reduction of groundwater recharge p 0 05 which reduced to virtually zero when the rooting depth is deeper than 15 m therefore we conclude that rooting depth is a major control of groundwater recharge this study is the first attempt to evaluate the effect of deep rooted vegetation in the deep unsaturated zone on groundwater recharge on hillslopes with terraces having important implications to afforestation and to understanding ecohydrological processes in natural ecosystems keywords land use change groundwater recharge tritium profile terraced hillslope 1 introduction groundwater is essential both as an economic resource for human development to meet the urban industrial and agricultural water requirements and for maintaining ecological functions in natural systems de vries and simmers 2002 tashie et al 2016 however the demand on limited water supplies in arid and semi arid regions is still increasing the international atomic energy agency iaea estimates that large amounts of groundwater being developed in arid and semi arid regions are mainly from the paleo groundwater and are not reusable scanlon et al 2006 therefore sustainable groundwater use and management are critical to human and ecosystems taylor et al 2012 groundwater recharge provides an important link between the surface water and groundwater and thus dictates the quality and quantity of groundwater therefore it is paramount to obtain accurate estimates of groundwater recharge kim and jackson 2012 scanlon et al 2006 however groundwater recharge is a complex ecohydrological process that is controlled by many factors such as climate land use cover soil type topography and landforms bennett et al 2013 jasechko et al 2014 kim and jackson 2012 petheram et al 2002 scanlon et al 2006 among those factors the land use cover has been found to be the second most important determinant for groundwater recharge following the precipitation but topography effect is often weak kim and jackson 2012 petheram et al 2002 land use change affects water quantity and quality through modifying groundwater recharge walker et al 2002 jobbágy and jackson 2004 scanlon et al 2005 for example land clearing to convert natural forest to rain fed agriculture may lead to an increase by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude in recharge and a rise in water table level in australia allison et al 1990 the elevated groundwater table may degrade groundwater quality due to flushing salts stored in the unsaturated zone into groundwater favreau et al 2009 leduc et al 2001 scanlon et al 2007 conversely land use change from farmland or annual grassland to woodland forest have caused decreased groundwater recharge bari and schofield 1992 gates et al 2011 huang and pang 2010 these changes of groundwater recharge can be attributed to different evapotranspiration between different vegetation types which in turn results from changes in the interception of solar radiation due to the different canopy cover and access to water due to differences in rooting depth zhang et al 2001 the vegetation induced groundwater recharge changes are especially pronounced in water limited environments where plants actively regulate their rooting depths to combat droughts calder 1998 mátyás and sun 2014 nepstad et al 1994 walker et al 2002 zhang et al 2001 however there is little information on the quantitative relationship between rooting depth and groundwater recharge hillslopes as a main land form on terrestrial land surface play an important role in hydrological cycle and land surface process for example overland flow is affected by rainfall intensity vegetation hillslope characteristic like hillslope length gradient and others chen and shao 2003 in general downslope having a larger contributing area receives more incoming water from upslope which may lead to higher infiltration and recharge than upslope positions after conversion to terraces the altered land surface properties may also change soil water infiltration the partition of precipitation to runoff on hillslope zhang et al 2015 and consequently may modify groundwater recharge rates the loess plateau of china lpc mostly located in semi arid and sub humid regions is in the northwest inland of china due to its relatively low annual precipitation 200 800 mm soil water is a main limiting factor for plant growth wang et al 2011 this problem has been exacerbated by the heavy erosive loss of soil and water to combat the erosion large amounts of terrace on hillslopes were constructed and the terraced area increased from 22 7 km2 to 2356 7 km2 during the period of 1956 1996 ning et al 2016 since 1999 conservation practices such as the introduction of trees shrubs and alfalfa have led to rapid land use cover changes and significantly increased vegetation cover during the past a few decades as a result surface runoff and water yield decreased by 90 over 50 of which are attributed to land use cover changes huang and zhang 2004 huang et al 2003 zhang et al 2008 concurrently the land use cover change has been found to cause deep soil desiccation weakening the soil water reservoir chen et al 2005 li 2001 yang 2001 although previous studies showed that vegetation types affect groundwater recharge quantitative relationships between vegetation and groundwater recharge remains poorly understood furthermore only a few studies investigated how land use change modifies groundwater recharge on hillslopes and hillslopes with terraces walker et al 2002 knight et al 2005 cartwright et al 2007 especially conversion from shallow rooted to deep rooted vegetation the reason may be in part due to the lack of an appropriate method to determine groundwater recharge on hillslopes and when the rooting depth is great zhang et al 2017a groundwater recharge is relatively small in arid and semi arid regions and difficult to quantify accurately allison et al 1994 gee and hillel 1988 and thus remains highly uncertain to estimate many methods have been developed to estimate groundwater recharge including the water balance method numerical simulations and environmental tracer methods the certainty is especially true with water balance and numerical simulation methods bennett et al 2013 de vries and simmers 2002 gee and hillel 1988 gong et al 2012 as a result tracer methods have been widely used allison et al 1994 scanlon et al 2006 common environmental tracers include chloride and water isotope tritium as often used in chloride mass balance cmb method and tritium peak tracing methods respectively the application of cmb is hampered by the uncertainty of chloride input fluxes and transient water flow in the unsaturated zone whereas the tritium peak method capitalizes on the nuclear bomb tritium input and has the following advantages 1 it does not require a steady state flow 2 it does not need the exact input amount and 3 it reflects recent land use cover change due to its short half life period the bomb tritium signal in soil is currently undetectable in many areas on the earth now fortunately the 1963 tritium peak is still clearly detectable in some loess areas baran et al 2007 lin and wei 2006 zhang et al 1990 2017b in this study we take advantage of the tritium signal in soil on the lpc to evaluate groundwater recharge rates at four different landscape positions tableland upslope midslope and downslope under two types of land use shallow rooted vegetation and deep rooted trees we will address two scientific questions 1 do landscape positions affect groundwater recharge on terraced hillslopes and 2 how do deep rooted and shallow rooted vegetation affect groundwater recharge 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is in the wangdonggou watershed 35 12 35 16 n 107 40 107 42 e fig 1 on the southeastern portion of the lpc the watershed with an area of 6 3 km2 is subject to warm temperate semi humid zone and continental monsoon climate the long term 1957 2015 average annual temperature is 9 4 c the average annual reference evapotranspiration is 893 69 mm and the average annual precipitation is 578 125 mm with about 55 falling between july and september the topography and landform include loess flat plateau tableland ridge and gully with the elevation varying from 946 m to 1226 m the soil is predominantly silty loam with a silt content over 50 the volumetric water contents at field capacity and at permanent wilting point are 0 28 and 0 11 m3 m 3 respectively the water table varies between 60 and 100 m depth depending on the landscape positions the deep loess profile consists of alternating glacial loess and interglacial paleosol the loess being yellowish and silt loam textured has no or few restrictions for root penetration or water infiltration however the paleosol were more reddish slightly cemented and higher in clay content although still having a silt loam texture this layer may give rise to some restriction to root penetration and water infiltration messing et al 2003 the land use almost all rainfed includes farmland wheat maize and orchards apple on the tableland and mostly grasslands with some bush encroachment or woody species apricot robinia on hillslopes 2 2 sampling and analytical methods two adjacent hillslopes the shallow rooted grassland at east hillslope and deep rooted woodland at west hillslope were selected for a paired plot design the two hillslopes were only 30 m apart separated by a steep and narrow 8 m with gully in between both hillslopes were natural grassland until 1960 when they were converted to terraces and started growing wheat or corn by local farmers in 1992 the west terraced hillslope was turned into with apple trees in upslope positions and apricot trees in midslope and downslope positions the paired sites on the tableland are about 2 km away from the upslope positions and there is only 10 m away between the sampling cores of continuous annual maize and 17 year apple orchard planted in 1998 for the grassland hillslope the lai leaf area index was measured by the li 2000 for each site aboveground biomass was chosen by random quadrat method replicated three times in the field the aboveground biomass was harvested by a pair of scissors then were oven dried for two days at 70 c and weighed for the woodland hillslope lai and biomass were not measured 1 soil sampling for each of the four landscape positions of the two hillslopes a deep soil core was obtained with a hollow stem auger with stem extension at a sampling interval of 0 20 m to a depth of 13 25 m the detailed sampling depths are shown in fig 2 the three grassland hillslopes were sampled between june 21 and june 26 2014 and the three hillslopes of woodland and two tablelands were sampled between june 10 and june 22 2015 in total there were eight cores four pairs between shallow rooted and deep rooted vegetation at the upslope of grassland a replicate soil core was taken between june 12 and15 2015 which is 2 m away from the sampling core taken in 2014 the differences in soil water content between 2014 and 2015 are negligible fig 2b the elevation of the sampling cores at tableland upslope midslope and downslope positions were 1230 1189 1163 and 1134 masl respectively the average bulk density is 1 42 g cm 3 unpublished data of deep profile each soil sample was split into two parts one was placed immediately into polyethylene plastic bottle with parafilm sealed and kept frozen for further isotopic composition analysis the other was put into an aluminous specimen box to measure the gravimetric soil water content for the two cores at grassland upslope position soil water contents were measured for both cores because of the similar soil water content profiles only the core taken in 2014 was processed for further 3h analysis to reduce the cost for the water isotope analysis soil water was extracted by cryogenic vacuum distillation and then about 8 ml of them was then mixed with 12 ml scintillation solution hisafe3 in a 25 ml standard plastic bottle after 24 hour dark adaptation the tritium count was directly recorded with a low background liquid scintillation counter quantulus 1220 perkinelmer singapore in the northwest a f university china net counts per minute cpm defined as the difference between the cpm of the extracted sample and a tritium free sample were converted directly into tritium units 1 tu 1 h3 1018h jakonić et al 2014 the limit of detection was 16 tu zhang et al 2017b 2 root sampling a root auger with a diameter of 85 mm was used to obtain the root distributions of three hillslopes of the grasslands and woodlands between august 23 and 27 2017 one root core was collected close to each of the corresponding soil core taken in 2014 for the three grassland hillslope positions for each of the woodlands two cores 2 m and 3 m away from a selected trunk were taken and the average value of the two cores was taken as representative of the apricot root distribution the cores were taken at a sampling interval of 0 2 m to a depth of 13 to 25 m until no roots were discernible the roots were not sampled on the tableland to save huge labour costs because the results show that the roots distribution is determined more by the species rather than the hillslope positions fig 3 compared with the deep rooted vegetation the differences in rooting depth between the shallow rooted grass and maize can be ignored fig 3 the water contents of each soil sample were determined with roots excluded the remainder of the soil sample was then washed carefully and passed through a 0 5 mm sieve the fresh root samples were selected with tweezers and scanned on a flatbed scanner the root length under different diameters were determined by analyzing the scanned root pictures using the delta t scan image analysis software delta t devices company uk the fine root length density frld was then calculated as the total length in each soil sample divided by the volume of soil sample in addition the above ground biomass of the grassland at the three hillslope positions were measured 2 3 methods to calculate groundwater recharge rates 1 tritium peak method the tritium activity in precipitation was only 5 10 tu before 1952 however large amounts of radioactive tritium was produced after 1952 and peaked several thousand tu in 1963 eriksson 1965 as a result of intensive atomic bomb testing in the world after 1963 open air bomb testing was banned and the fall out tritium activity in precipitation gradually reduced the tritiated precipitation falls and infiltrates into soil responding to the tritium activity in precipitation zimmermann et al 1967 since then tritium as a nearly perfect tracer has been widely used to track water flow and date groundwater and the tritium tracing method was used to estimate groundwater recharge all over the world in the past several decades allison and hughes 1983 downing et al 1979 lin and wei 2006 scanlon et al 2002 si and de jong 2007 the advantage of tritium tracing method is that unlike the cmb the runoff loss of precipitation does not affect the peak tritium depth which is used to determine groundwater recharge therefore the tritium peak depth can be readily and directly applied to determine groundwater recharge rates on hillslopes assuming piston flow soil water storage above the depth of 1963 peak represents the net input from precipitation after evapotranspiration since 1963 therefore the long term annual recharge rates since 1963 is given by allison et al 1990 1 r 0 l θ z d z n where r is the estimated potential groundwater recharge rate mm yr 1 θ z is the soil volumetric water content m3 m 3 as the function of depth z m l is the depth of tritium peak m and n is the number of years between the year of sampling and 1963 2 groundwater recharge under deep rooted vegetation a prerequisite of eq 1 is that the tritium peak has passed the bottom of the root zone tyler and walker 1994 therefore it can only be used to determine the groundwater recharge rates in shallow rooted ecosystems such as grassland and annual cropland for deep rooted vegetation such as apple and apricot trees the tritium peak may still be within the root zone making the peak tritium method unsuitable for adjacent woodland and farmland a paired plot design zhang et al 2017a 2017b developed a new method to estimate the groundwater recharge rates beneath a deep rooted woodland because the horizontal variability in soil texture in wangdonggou watershed is negligible duan et al 2016 the annual average soil water deficit under the deep rooted vegetation relative to the shallow rooted vegetation δr can be calculated from the water storage difference between the woodland and farmland 2 δ r δ s t 1 t 2 d θ sr z θ dr z d z where δs is soil water deficit for the woodland relative to the farmland below the active root zone 2 m lower limit of above integral see fig 3 mm t is the age of woodland or the number of years since the farmland was converted to woodland yr θsr z and θdr z are the soil water contents for the shallow and deep rooted vegetation for depth z and d is the depth below which the water contents between the two land types are no longer different m then groundwater recharge under deep rooted vegetation rd could be calculated from the groundwater recharge under shallow rooted vegetation rs minus δr zhang et al 2017a that is 3 r d r s δ r note that the water flux obtained from eq 3 may not be groundwater recharge defined as the water flux currently entering the groundwater this is because the soil water storage within the root zone exhibits strong seasonality and can be altered by not only deep drainage but also root water uptake and evaporation assuming piston flow new water displaces old water and thus the soil water storage above the tritium peak can be considered as the total water recharge to the soil since 1963 allison et al 1990 and will form future deep drainage when all the new water is displaced the displaced water recharged before 1963 moved below the tritium peak in soil profile and formed deep drainage rate below the tritium peak depth therefore any reduction or increase in soil water storage above the tritium peak depth will eventually translate into a reduction or increase in deep drainage rate at the bottom of the root zone in the future therefore the recharge rate derived from eq 3 is the deep drainage rate in the future which in turn become future groundwater recharge despite of this subtle difference between groundwater recharge and deep drainage rate most studies including this research use the two terms interchangeably scanlon et al 2006 in addition many other studies also used the reduction in soil water storage as a reduction of groundwater recharge rates allison et al 1990 zhang et al 2017a 2 4 uncertainty and statistical analysis from eq 1 we know that the uncertainty in r results is mainly from the uncertainty in peak depth l and soil water contents θ above the peak depth based on the first order perturbation analysis of eq 1 the variance in estimated rs σ2 sr of shallow rooted vegetation can be calculated

where x and y are the means of variable x and y respectively σx and σy are the standard errors of x and y respectively 3 results 3 1 soil water content profile soil water contents at depth below the deep rooted woodland apple and apricot trees were substantially lower than that below the shallow rooted grassland fig 2 at each landscape position the average soil water contents were 0 03 to 0 04 m3 m 3 lower in the soil profile of woodland than that of grassland or cropland table 1 therefore the apple and apricot trees consumed more deep soil water than the grassland at the same landscape positions creating a water deficit zone below the 2 m depth fig 2 moreover the difference of the average water content between the two types of land use is not discernible 0 01 m3 m 3 below 15 4 m on the tableland fig 2a thus the deficit zone ranges from 2 0 m to 15 4 m the deficit zone of the upslope is the thickest fig 2b followed by the tableland apple fig 2a the midslope and downslope had much thinner deficit zones fig 2c d with 2 0 to 11 6 m for the midslope and 2 0 to 7 6 m for the downslope respectively therefore the bottom of soil water deficit zone deepened from the tableland to the upslope and then became progressively shallower from the upslope to the middle slope and to the downslope positions fig 2 table 1 shows that the total soil water deficit between shallow rooted and deep rooted vegetation increased with increasing thickness of the deficit zone from downslope 367 mm to midslope 428 mm tableland 577 mm and upslope 732 mm the vertical distribution of deep soil water contents below 2 m was remarkably stable in time in this study soil water content profile of the grassland upslope in 2014 was almost identical to that taken at an adjacent site in 2015 due to the low spatial variability and infiltration capacity of loess fig 2b 3 2 root distribution for different vegetation in soil profiles the frld results are shown in table 2 and fig 3 for shallow rooted maize field the rooting depth defined as the depth above which 95 of roots located was 2 m which is similar to those reported by gao et al 2014 and liu 2016 the frld d 2 mm decreased exponentially with depth for each of the profiles on the grassland terraces fig 3a the maximum rooting depth was 1 4 m for the upslope and midslope and 3 0 m for the downslope reflecting increased brush encroachment downslope further the total frld was higher as the slope position is lower fig 3a which corresponded to the reduced dry biomass and lai from the downslope 486 94 g m 2 3 54 to the midslope 233 45 g m 2 2 08 and upslope 274 74 g m 2 2 17 the root distribution of the apple trees at the upslope was strikingly uniform with depth within the root zone from the soil surface to the depth of 23 m fig 3b however the rooting depths of apricots on terraces were 13 m for the midslope and 10 4 m for the downslope fig 3b the root distribution of apricot was analogous to a 4 3 2 1 type root distribution pierret et al 2017 which differed much from the exponential distribution of grassland and relatively uniform distribution of apple tree fig 3b table 2 the total frld values of both apricot orchards were larger than that of the apple orchard at the upslope table 2 further 79 of roots of the apple orchard on the upslope were below 2 0 m whereas it reduced to 8 5 and 11 6 for the apricot on the midslope and downslope respectively this may have important implications for the plants ability to uptake and intercept the infiltrating water in the root zone although the rooting depth decrease along the hillslope from upslope to downslope position there is no causal relationship between the rooting depth and hillslope positions the main difference may be due to the different species apple tree fuji as an exotic breed consumes deep soil water in dry season which further promotes deeper root 10 m development apricot trees however are native and xerophytic and rely on water storied in shallow depths to satisfy its water demand et therefore apricot tree had shallower rooting depth than apple tree in addition the downslope positions hundreds of meters in elevation below the table land may have smaller evapotranspiration rates due to the generally cooler temperature higher relative humidity and thus less water demand from the plants at lower landscapes this may also result in shallower roots for plants on downslope positions the rooting depths of deep rooted trees coincided with the depth of the bottom of water deficit zone figs 2 3b table 3 for example no difference in soil water profiles was found between the two types of land use below 11 6 m at the midslope fig 2c which coincided with the rooting depth 11 6 m of apricot at midslope table 3 on the tableland zhang et al 2017a showed that the maximum rooting depth for apple orchard planted in 1998 was 15 2 m which was identical to the depth of the bottom of the water deficit zone of apple tree at tableland in this study therefore we use 15 2 m as the tableland apple tree root depth in table 3 3 3 tritium profile and groundwater recharge for different vegetation there is a distinct bell shape tritium bulge in the profile at each slope position fig 4 to identify the depth of peak tritium concentration the peak lorentz model is fitted to the tritium distribution in each of eight tritium profiles fig 4 on the tableland the peak tritium concentration depths are located at 6 14 0 12 m and 6 5 0 10 m for the shallow rooted and deep rooted vegetation at the upslope midslope and downslope the peak depths for the shallow rooted vegetation were deeper than that of the deep rooted vegetation fig 4 table 3 the deeper tritium peak although not statistically significant and the higher aboveground biomass and lai suggest that the downslope position of the grassland transect receives more water from rainfall and probably an extra input from run on from higher positions than the upslope position hence increasing the potential of groundwater recharge data from runoff plots in changwu agro ecological experiment station on the tableland starting from 2004 show that runoff can take place during the period of focused storms in this area li et al 2017 however vegetation cover on the terraced hillslopes can further reduce or eliminate runoff by increasing overland flow resistance on the surface and rainfall infiltration rate in rare cases extreme rainfall produces limited surface runoff the effect of which on groundwater recharge can be easily offset by increased et due to better vegetation growth for the shallow rooted vegetation the long term average recharge rate can be calculated from the soil water storage above the peak depth using eq 1 because the tritium bulge was well below the root zone table 3 fig 4 the average recharge rates ranged between 33 and 38 mm yr 1 for the shallow rooted vegetation at the four landscape positions showing no significant difference between landscape positions p 0 05 table 3 the recharge was equivalent to 6 6 of the total precipitation for the deep rooted vegetation the tritium bulge was well within the root zone therefore we used eq 3 instead of the peak tritium method to estimate the groundwater recharge rate given the number of years since land use conversion the soil water storage reduction rate was 34 mm yr 1 for the tableland 32 mm yr 1 for the upslope for the apple orchard 19 mm yr 1 for the midslope and 16 mm yr 1 for the downslope for the apricot site table 3 this average reduction was equivalent to 5 7 of the long term average annual precipitation for the apple orchard and 3 1 for the apricot site over all of the slope positions the average groundwater recharge rate for the shallow rooted vegetation was 34 mm yr 1 whereas that of the deep rooted vegetation was 9 mm yr 1 the differences in peak depth soil water storage and groundwater recharge rates were statistically significant p 0 05 between the shallow rooted and deep rooted vegetation therefore there was a significant reduction of groundwater recharge after land use conversion to deep rooted orchards for the deep rooted vegetation the groundwater recharge rates were almost zero for the apple orchard and 15 22 mm yr 1 for the apricot trees showing a great reduction of groundwater recharge by woody species negative value of groundwater recharge represents no recharge in table 3 and the groundwater recharge between apple and apricot orchard differed significantly p 0 05 3 4 groundwater recharge at different slope positions for shallow rooted vegetation the peak tritium depths increased from 6 1 m at tableland to 6 9 7 4 and 7 9 m at upslope midslope and downslope positions respectively table3 fig 4 however the recharge rates varied between 33 and 38 mm yr 1 table 3 showing no statistical differences between the four slope positions p 0 05 for the deep rooted vegetation the recharge rates increased from 0 to 22 mm yr 1 as slope positions became lower p 0 05 table 3 surprisingly as the slope positions became lower the peak tritium concentrations were progressively smaller for the deep rooted vegetation but greater for the shallow rooted vegetation fig 3 the peak tritium concentrations were quite similar on the tableland and upslope between the two types of vegetation however they were three times smaller for deep rooted vegetation than for shallow rooted vegetation on the midslope and downslope suggesting that deep rooted vegetation decreased peak tritium concentration through root water uptake and subsequent replenishment from rainfall infiltration to the peak depth 3 5 relation between rooting depth and groundwater recharge the standard errors of peak tritium depth l are listed in table 3 for a measurement error of 0 01 m3 m 3 of the soil water content using the oven dry method the calculated σ sr of the shallow rooted vegetation from eq 4 are 1 3 1 5 1 5 and 1 7 mm yr 1 from the tableland lower to downslope respectively the calculated σ δ r values from eq 5 were 1 4 1 2 0 8 and 0 6 mm yr 1 for tableland upslope midslope and downslope after the land use conversion respectively and the calculated σ dr values of the deep rooted vegetation from eq 6 were 1 9 1 9 1 7 and 1 8 mm yr 1 from tableland to the downslope respectively the standard errors were all relatively small reflecting the reliability of the tritium peak method for the determination of groundwater recharge rates the calculated standard errors can be used in eq 7 to test the significance of the difference of groundwater recharge between different positions and land use types results showed that there was no statistical difference in groundwater recharge rates between the four hillslope positions for the shallow rooted vegetation p 0 05 however the groundwater recharge of deep rooted vegetation was significantly lower than that of shallow rooted one p 0 05 suggesting that the conversion to deep rooted from shallow rooted vegetation decreased groundwater recharge significantly interestingly the groundwater recharge of apple orchards at both the tableland and upslope was nearly zero however the downslope position had significantly larger groundwater recharge than the midslope position under the apricot vegetation p 0 05 furthermore the groundwater recharge under apple vegetation was significantly lower than that under apricot vegetation p 0 05 this difference may result from the difference in root distribution and rooting depth if we pool all the rooting depths and groundwater recharge rates at all landscape positions together there was a significant negative correlation between rooting depth and groundwater recharge rate p 0 05 fig 5 based on this relationship an increase of rooting depth by 1 m on average reduce groundwater recharge by 2 3 mm yr 1 when rooting depth is 15 m the groundwater water recharge rate decreases to 0 mm yr 1 suggesting that deep rooted vegetation creates a zero flux zone when the rooting depth is large than 15 m 4 discussion 4 1 landscape positions had little effect on groundwater recharge vegetation types modify precipitation intensity runoff ratio and actual evapotranspiration and thus exert substantial influence on groundwater recharge furthermore landscape position controls the partition of precipitation into runoff and infiltration normally having a major effect on groundwater recharge surprisingly the downslope did not show a larger groundwater recharge than the upslope for the grassland which may be related to the ability of terraces and vegetation to reduce runoff data from runoff plots near the study site showed that runoff can only take place during the period of focused storms li et al 2017 and the vegetation cover on the terraces can further reduce or eliminate runoff by increasing overland flow resistance on the surface and rainfall infiltration rate zhang et al 2015 in rare cases extreme rainfall may produce limited surface runoff and increase infiltration at downslope positions the effect of which on groundwater recharge can be easily offset by increased evapotranspiration due to enhanced vegetation growth 4 2 rooting depth controls groundwater recharge rates this study showed that land use covers in terms of rooting depth had a significant effect on groundwater recharge fig 5 our result is consistent with the result of zhang et al 2001 and zhang et al 2017a moreover we developed the quantitative relationship between rooting depth and groundwater recharge relative to the shallow rooted vegetation the deep rooted vegetation reduced groundwater recharge by 50 table 3 usually the depleted soil water cannot be replenished before the next growing season resulting in progressively more soil water deficit as the stand age increases like the deep rooted vegetation presented in this study this phenomenon is common on the loess plateau and is especially evident in deep rooted ecosystem wang et al 2011 2010 yan et al 2015 groundwater recharge had a negative correlation to rooting depth fig 5 because most of annual crops and perennial grasses have a shallow root system to take advantage of frequent rainfall events that infiltrate into shallow soils this allows a portion of a large rainfall event to infiltrate deeper than the shallow root zone and to recharge deeper soil and groundwater liu et al 2010 the larger the rainfall events is the deeper the soil water infiltrates and the more likely the rainfall penetrates through the root zone conversely the deeper the rooting depth is the more the deep soil water consumption and the less the groundwater recharge therefore groundwater recharge depends on the depth of rainfall infiltration and the rooting depth for example an extreme rainfall event 180 mm in five days after the harvest of winter wheat in 2003 reached 5 m depth liu et al 2010 which could lead to the continuous infiltration of soil water through the root zone of apricots thus this portion of rainfall will form potential groundwater recharge however for apple orchards this portion of infiltrated water is still within the root zone of 15 23 m depth and can be taken up by plants leaving little for groundwater recharge fan et al 2017 previous research correlated groundwater recharge to land use types such as grassland woodland and forest kim and jackson 2012 scanlon et al 2006 however the relationship is poorly constrained and thus is highly uncertain kim and jackson 2012 the uncertainty may arise from the fact that rooting depth differs substantially between different species within the same land use type for example apple tree and apricots orchards are all woodland but their root depth varies from 10 m to 23 m criteria that take rooting depth into consideration in globe synthesis gao et al 2015 seyfried et al 2005 seyfried and wilcox 2010 may help reduce the uncertainty and better understand the controls of groundwater recharge at the global scale we admit that we suggest more studies are needed to synthesize database and make the relationship more accurately 4 3 implication for modeling groundwater recharge under diverse vegetation covers global analysis of rooting depth revealed that the global average rooting depth is only 4 6 m canadell et al 1996 in this study we show that the rooting depth can be as deep as 23 m for the 23 year old apple and 10 m for apricot trees such a deep rooting depth allows plants to access deep soil water reserve elevates evapotranspiration and reduces surface runoff and thus could dramatically alter the hydrology at the surface leading to a substantially reduced groundwater recharge as compared to shallow rooted crops therefore sound modeling of hydrological processes would need accurate knowledge of rooting depth unfortunately major modeling work still assume shallow rooting depth crosbie et al 2013 keese et al 2005 small 2005 wang et al 2015 the model may be suffice for modeling large evapotranspiration rates in humid regions but may introduce unacceptable errors to groundwater recharge estimates therefore more work is needed for defining ecosystem rooting depth in order to obtain accurate groundwater recharge estimates in arid and semi arid environments this study clearly demonstrated that deep rooted vegetation for ecorestoration could substantially increase the risk of reducing groundwater recharge this problem can be especially acute in some semiarid zones where deep rooted vegetation can be dominant and ground water is the only sources of water for human consumption and economical development therefore the impact of deep rooted vegetation on groundwater recharge should be an integral consideration in sustainable ecorestoration efforts on the other hand deep rooted plants could substantially reduce or eliminate groundwater recharge this will effectively limited the water cycle to the surface soil and disconnect the precipitation with deep unsaturated zone and groundwater eliminating the potential groundwater pollution from the pollution sources from the surface and root zone this has important implication for mining waste disposal and reclamation 5 conclusions the eight tritium profiles in this study with clearly detectable peaks corresponding to the year of 1963 show that soil water movement is dominated by piston flow through a paired plot design on the tableland and three positions of the hillslope the differences in groundwater recharge between the shallow rooted and deep rooted vegetation were analyzed the main conclusions are as follow 1 there was no significant difference in root distribution and groundwater recharge between the tableland upslope midslope and downslope under shallow rooted vegetation however the root distributions and groundwater recharge rates at the four landscape positions for deep rooted vegetation were significantly different 2 land use conversion to deep rooted vegetation resulted in an obvious reduction of groundwater recharge there existed a strong negative correlation between groundwater recharge and rooting depth when the rooting depth is 15 m and deeper than which the groundwater recharge is virtually 0 mm yr 1 estimations of groundwater recharge on hillslopes are of great significance and can help improve the understanding of hydrological process of hillslope for a deep rooted ecosystem it is possible that the deep roots could diminish groundwater recharge rate creating a zero flux zone in the deep unsaturated zone that may cut off the connection between surface water and groundwater cycle which has important implication for better understanding of water cycle at the catchment scale our research also provides guidance for selection of plants in land reclamation when isolation of surface water cycles from the overburden materials is needed and provides valuable information for local water

7062,bayesian inference provides a mathematically elegant and robust approach to constrain numerical model predictions with system knowledge and observations technical challenges such as evaluating a large number of models with long runtimes have restricted the application of bayesian inference to groundwater modeling to overcome such technical challenges we use gaussian process emulators to replace a transient regional groundwater modflow model for computing objective functions during model constraining the regional model is designed to assess the potential impact of a proposed coal seam gas csg development on groundwater levels in the richmond river catchment clarence moreton basin australia the emulators were trained using 4000 snapshots derived from the modflow model and subsequently used to replace the modflow model in an approximate bayesian computation abc scheme abc was deemed the more appropriate choice as it relaxes the need to derive an explicit likelihood function that the formal bayesian analysis requires the study demonstrated the flexibility of the gaussian process emulators which can accurately reproduce the original model behavior at a fraction of the computational cost from hours to seconds the gain in computational efficiency using the proposed approach allows the global calibration and uncertainty algorithms to become more feasible for computationally demanding groundwater models based on the abc analysis the probability for the simulated csg development causing a water table change of more than 0 2 m was less than 5 in addition to a probabilistic estimate of the prediction an added value of emulator assisted abc inference is providing information on the extent to which observations can constrain parameters and predictions as well as the flexibility to include various quantitative and qualitative parameter constraining information keywords gaussian process emulators surrogate model groundwater modelling data worth clarence moreton basin coal seam gas 1 introduction doherty 2011 states that a model cannot promise the right answer however if properly constructed a model can promise that the right answer lies within the uncertainty limits which are its responsibility to construct this statement is a reflection of the need to shift the focus of groundwater modeling from seeking a single optimal prediction to a prediction distribution that encompasses the range of predictions that are consistent with observations uncertainty analysis can be considered as the process to achieve such a distribution to support evidence based decision making predictive uncertainty can be quantified through i forward propagation of input uncertainty or ii an inverse assessment of parameters where historical measurements are available to constrain the model beven 2007 refsgaard et al 2007 most practical groundwater modeling applications belong to the latter type aiming to inform decision making for water resource management the inverse assessment of uncertainty requires sampling the prior distribution of parameters to yield posterior parameter distributions conditioned on observations a multitude of methods for assessing the predictive uncertainty using various sampling strategies have been reported in the literature such as pure monte carlo mc sampling stratified sampling importance sampling projection based sampling or combinations of them beven 2008 among those the null space monte carlo nsmc herckenrath et al 2015 james et al 2009 sepúlveda and doherty 2015 is probably the most widely used method in groundwater modelling especially for computationally expensive groundwater models either due to large spatial and temporal scales or coupled multiple processes although the projection based nsmc can significantly reduce computational cost and allow a non linear uncertainty analysis for computationally intensive groundwater models the posterior distribution is always surrounding a pre calibrated parameter set using a gradient based sampling algorithm the method is sensitive to initial parameter assignment and prone to local minima when the model is not linear or not approximately linear although the bias may be minimized to some extent by multiple starting points nsmc keating et al 2010 tavakoli et al 2013 meanwhile with the continuous rise in computing power and improvement of data measurements bayesian analysis based on holistic sampling algorithms has become increasingly popular for posterior parameter inference in other fields sadegh and vrugt 2014 vrugt and sadegh 2013 however two key issues have hindered the application of bayesian inference in groundwater modelling although other factors exist pappenberger and beven 2006 such as a steep learning curve and a lack of well documented and robust tools with a user friendly interface the first factor is the heavy computational burden for most practical groundwater models despite the advances in algorithmic sampling efficiencies maier et al 2014 j a vrugt et al 2009 the number of model runs required to accurately approximate the posterior distributions are counted in tens to hundreds of thousands for highly parameterized groundwater models keating et al 2010 constraining wide and uninformative prior parameter distributions for a complex regional groundwater model through bayesian inference using a holistic search algorithm requires an often prohibitively large number of model runs model emulation has a great potential to overcome this particular issue the principle of model emulation is to use computationally efficient algorithms to replace computationally demanding models emulators are also known as surrogate models meta models reduced models proxy models lower fidelity models and response surfaces razavi et al 2012 numerous model emulation techniques have been explored in various disciplines and they can be broadly categorized into three classes data driven methods projection based methods and multi fidelity methods asher et al 2015 robinson et al 2008 the emulator is typically a black box or statistical model that is trained on a set of model inputs and their corresponding outputs a well trained emulator can yield relatively accurate and precise predictions for new inputs such as parameter values and forcing variables that were not part of the original training set emulators have gained popularity for performing tasks such as model calibration sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis where a model must be run a large number of times some popular choices in the literature have included gaussian processes gps kennedy and o hagan 2001 liu and west 2009 o hagan 2006 sacks et al 1989 neural networks kourakos and mantoglou 2009 yan and minsker 2006 random forests hooten et al 2011 leeds et al 2014 and generalized additive models gams stanfill et al 2015 storlie et al 2009 strong et al 2014 table 1 summarizes the recent applications of model emulation in applied groundwater modeling although these previous studies significantly advanced our understanding of groundwater model emulation to the authors knowledge gp emulators have not been previously applied to regional groundwater models that are used to provide environmental impact assessment of deep resource development in a sedimentary basin these models needs to include both the shallow unconsolidated aquifers where most receptors are located and the deep porous rock formations where resource development occurs raiber et al 2015 such models are complex and highly non linear cui et al 2018a sreekanth et al 2018 gaussian process emulators o hagan 2006 are mathematically very close to kriging interpolation kleijnen 2009 they are robust and well establish tools for accurate representation of complex response surfaces derived from numerical models they were chosen in this study as they 1 can provide a probabilistic estimate of the uncertainty in the emulated prediction rasmussen and williams 2006 2 are straightforward and quick to generate 3 can be easily tailored to individual predictions and 4 allow flexible parameterization bastos and o hagan 2009 razavi et al 2012 and asher et al 2015 have provided a thorough review on the application of surrogate models in water resources along with a comprehensive comparison among different types of emulators the second critical issue that limits the application of bayesian inference is the difficulty to define an explicit likelihood function for complex and non linear groundwater models although different likelihood functions can be derived based on some assumptions such as that the error residuals are normally distributed with a variance related to the observation uncertainty this observation uncertainty is however often very difficult to establish and the assumptions are often not realistic hill and tiedeman 2007 the approximate bayesian computation abc framework nott et al 2012 vrugt and sadegh 2013 relaxes the need for computing an explicit likelihood function by using summary statistics or multiple objective functions abc has its roots in the rejection sampling in which only those parameter combinations that meet specific defined acceptance criteria are accepted this is in contrast with formal bayesian analysis where parameter combinations are accepted based on a likelihood function abc is also superior in diagnostic model calibration by defining multiple summary statistics that capture different aspects of the modelled system vrugt and sadegh 2013 abc has been recently applied in hydrology by nott et al 2012 and vrugt and sadegh 2013 however and to the authors knowledge it has not been applied in groundwater modelling yet another critical challenge that the classical groundwater model calibration faces is the design of the objection function different weight factors are usually applied to different types of numerical observations to ensure that every type of observation does influence the model calibration however the determining the weights is not straightforward and is usually subjective doherty 2015 qualitative observations e g direction of flow cannot be usually included in the composite objective function on the other hand abc has not limitation on taking different types of numerical observations into account by including them in the summary statistics qualitative data can also be implemented as acceptance criteria the objective of this paper is to explore whether the emulator enabled abc framework can serve as a practical tool for a comprehensive and transparent assessment of groundwater model predictive uncertainty it also aims at tackling some of the challenges encountered by the current groundwater model calibration methods and the application of bayesian inference in groundwater modelling the framework is applied to a transient regional groundwater model developed to assess the potential impact of coal seam gas csg development in the richmond river catchment clarence moreton basin in eastern australia fig 1 the next section introduces the methods used in the study followed by a description of the study area and the numerical modflow model the results section evaluates the performance of the emulator and the resulting probabilistic estimates of model predictions while the discussion focuses on the practical implementation and transparency the findings are summarized in the conclusions section along with recommendations for further research 2 method 2 1 numerical groundwater modelling the groundwater modelling aims to probabilistically evaluate the potential changes in the relevant groundwater system due to a proposed csg development in the richmond river basin nsw australia the direct impact is represented by the difference in the groundwater head between the csg development scenario and the baseline modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 a newton formulation of modflow 2005 was chosen to execute the model in order to reduce numerical instabilities associated with cell drying and rewetting in the uppermost layer of the model the model area is characterised by high relief topography that usually results in cell drying and rewetting during modelling in the unconfined parts of a groundwater model the frequent drying and rewetting is one of the major reasons that causes difficulty to converge modflow nwt was designed to address drying and rewetting problems more efficiently thus providing a more stable solution compared to modflow 2005 by treating nonlinearities of cell drying and rewetting as a continuous function of groundwater head the gmres matrix solver was used for solving the large number of equations generated by the groundwater model 2 2 gaussian process emulator gps can be thought of as a prior distribution over functions of interest to emulate in the context of emulation the function in question is the response of a model s output y over vectors of p dimensional model inputs x the finite dimensional distributions of the model outputs can be described through a mean μ x and positive definite covariance matrix σ with the ith j th entry σ i j 2 τ 2 k x i x j the covariance terms are the product of a variance parameter τ 2 and a correlation function k that describes the decline in the correlation between two model outputs y i and y j as the distances between their respective input vectors x i and x j are increased the popularity of gps stems from two main features i the predictive distributions from the emulator have simple analytical distribution and ii as a result of analytical tractability inference for the model parameters is relatively simple gramacy and apley 2015 improved the computational efficiency of gps through the use of local approximate gaussian processes lagps to overcome the computational burden encountered for standard gps which model the data through a stationary covariance function we used lagps that is only a function of the training data within a local neighborhood of the input vector x the local neighborhood is defined to be the n input vectors nearby x that are chosen one by one in an iterative manner to maximize a reduction in prediction variance a scheme referred as active learning cohn or alc by gramacy and apley 2015 as recommended by gramacy 2016 empirical bayes has been adopted for fitting lagps in the current study a reference prior for the variance τ 2 algebraically equivalent to an inverse gamma distribution with shape and scale parameters both equal to zero and the multivariate normal likelihood of the gp makes integrating out τ 2 analytically tractable the resulting marginal likelihood for the remaining parameters has the form 1 p y n k θ γ n 2 2 π n 2 k n 1 2 ψ n 2 n 2 where θ is the length scale parameter used in the isotropic gaussian correlation function eq 5 used in this paper and ψ n y n t k n 1 y n this approach is differentiable analytically and therefore lends itself to fast newton based methods for maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters in the lagp the resulting predictive distribution from the lagp has a student t distribution with n degrees of freedom with a mean defined as 2 μ x d n k θ k n t k n 1 y n and variance defined as 3 var y x d n k θ n σ 2 x d n k n 2 where 4 σ 2 x d n k θ ψ n k θ x x k n t x k n 1 k n x n is the scale parameter k n is the n by n matrix of pairwise correlations between each of the x i with i jth entry k θ x i x j and k n t x is a vector of length n with ith element k θ x x i being the correlation function between x and x i in the above d n denotes the set of training data for the lagp which is comprised of pairs of predictor vectors and response variables this correlation function is modeled as an isotropic gaussian of the form 5 k θ x i x j exp k 1 p x i k x j k 2 θ where x i k denotes the k th component of x i in practice a nugget can be added whereby k θ η x x i k θ x x i η i x x i the standard approach taken in the lagp package is to set η 10 6 which offers enough flexibility to aid parameter estimation whilst providing a high level of fidelity to the observed model runs at each of the x i the specific algorithm for fitting the lagp as implemented in the lagp r package is outlined in gramacy 2016 but for ease of reference it is repeated below multi stage approximate local gp modeling algorithm 1 choose a sensible starting global θ x θ 0 for all x 2 calculate local designs x n x θ x based on alc independently for each x a choose a nearest neighbor design x n 0 x of size n 0 b for j n 0 n 1 set

output predictions y x d n x θ x for each x to construct a lagp emulator n runs of the target model are required in order to obtain a set of training data ideally these model runs should span a wide range of vectors across the space of model inputs and attempt to fill this space with the limited number of model runs that can be feasibly obtained with the available resources unsurprisingly the experimental designs used to build model emulators are broadly referred to as space filling designs such as latin hypercube designs lhds santner et al 2003 in this study we chose the maximin lhd which is implemented in the lhs package in r carnell 2016 the maximin latin hypercube design is generated like a standard latin hypercube design one design point at a time but with each new point selected to maximise the minimum euclidean distance between design points in the parameter space points in the design span the full range of parameter values in each dimension of the parameter space but also avoid redundancy amongst points by maximising the euclidean distance between two points since nearby points are likely to have similar model output gps tend to perform better if the output variable is close to a gaussian distribution as the groundwater model outputs of the case study were typically not normally distributed but heavily skewed the quantity to be emulated was transformed using a normal quantile transform bogner et al 2012 before training the emulator the following steps are required to carry out such a normal quantile transformation of a sample x 1 sort the sample x from smallest to largest x 1 x n 2 estimate the cumulative probabilities p i p n using a plotting position like i n 1 such that p i p x x i 3 transform each value x i of x in y i q 1 p i of the normal variate y where q 1 is the inverse of the standard normal distribution using a discrete mapping 2 3 approximate bayesian computation abc the abc framework was firstly published in the statistical literature by diggle and gratton 1984 recently the method has been seeing increasing applications in population and evolutionary genetics mainly due to the limitation of likelihood based inference and rapid generation of large amounts of data beaumont et al 2002 csilléry et al 2010 inspired by the increasing application in evolutionary genetics vrugt s team have introduced the abc approach into hydrologic modelling vrugt and sadegh 2013 and implemented it in the dream suite for bayesian inference sadegh and vrugt 2014 the abc provides a more flexible mechanism to define the nature and number of evaluation criteria various kinds of information can be formalized into the summary statistics the process of defining summary statistics can be subjective beven et al 2008 but is more transparent which makes it easier to engage with stakeholders this provides ample opportunity to integrate expert knowledge in the model evaluation and even to tailor model evaluation to specific predictions which is receiving increased attention internationally de boer euser et al 2017 gupta et al 2012 the proposition underlying abc is that a parameter set θ should lie in the posterior distribution when the distance between the observed and simulated data is less than a small positive value vrugt and sadegh 2013 the distance is defined as ρ y y θ where y is the observation vector and y θ is the simulated data corresponding to the observations for complex models such as the 3d transient regional groundwater model used in the study the chance to meet the acceptance criteria is very low which results in a very low acceptance rate during model evaluation to avoid this difficulty the distance between summary statistics s y and s y θ is usually used during inference a set of summary statistics can be can be defined to extract different types of information from the observation data csilléry et al 2010 when it is necessary another way to increase the information available for the abc sampler is to incorporate multiple context specific state variables and their relationships into a single summary statistics only parameter combinations sampled from the priors that satisfy these criteria are accepted in the posterior distributions the widely used abc algorithms can be grouped into three categories based on the different sampling techniques including the basic rejection algorithm and its variations the abc mcmc algorithm sadegh and vrugt 2014 and the algorithm using sequential monte carlo turner and van zandt 2012 the sampling procedure starts from a candidate θ from the priors and continue until the moments of the posterior distribution stabilize regardless of what sampling algorithms are chosen the process of abc inference can be described by the generic algorithm as follows generic algorithm of abc for i 1 to n do while ρ s y s y θ do sample θ from the prior θ p θ simulate data y using θ y model θ calculate ρ s y s y θ end while accept θ as θ i set θ i θ end for where ρ s y s y θ is the distance function of the two summary statistics variables the major focus of the present study is to demonstrate the applicability of abc on emulated complex groundwater models the basic rejection algorithm was chosen because it is straightforward to understand and easy to be implemented despite the availability of more sophisticated algorithms for a more detailed discussion about the abc algorithms interested readers are referred to nott et al 2012 vrugt and sadegh 2013 and sadegh and vrugt 2014 2 4 framework the workflow for the gaussian process emulator enabled abc is shown in fig 2 it consists of two major modules developing and training the emulator fig 2a and the approximate bayesian inference fig 2b 1 problem definition and process based groundwater model development the workflow starts with defining the modelling objective although the objective can be reviewed and refined throughout the modelling process it should be clearly stated at the initial stage of a modelling project anderson et al 2015 once the objective has been defined and the benefits are clearly justified a groundwater model can be developed the defined objective needs to be revisited iteratively during the model development process to justify the selection of various parameters boundary conditions observations and processes 2 define model outputs gps capture the functional behavior of a numerical model i e how a model output changes as a function of varying model parameters therefore an essential prerequisite for model emulation is that a finite set of model outputs is defined for which an emulator will be created these model outputs may correspond to historical observations or be the model predictions for which the model is being developed 3 design of experiment the primary purpose of the design of experiment doe is to efficiently sample the parameter space within the limited time and computing resources to provide training data for emulators the groundwater model should be evaluated for a wide range of parameter combinations chosen in a systematic and efficient manner the first stage of this evaluation applies a stress test involving a limited number of model runs to evaluate the stability of the model using a wide range of parameters this test helps to identify the stability of the minimum and maximum parameter ranges this test results in a more stable model while ensuring that sampling from within this range explores the full range of predictive uncertainty this exercise also helps identify the redundant parameters that do not or only slightly affect the model predictions based on the outcomes of the stress test model parameterisation is further reviewed to either remove the redundant parameters that did not affect the predictions or tie these parameters to other independent parameters once the model passes the stress test it can be used to generate snapshots for emulator training depending on the context different sampling methods can be used to generate the required parameter combinations in the current study 4000 parameter combinations were generated for the entire parameter space for the groundwater model using the maximin latin hypercube design santner et al 2003 p 138 4 emulator training the results of the model runs from the doe including the simulated equivalents to the observations and the predictions of interest were used to train the statistical emulators which will replace the modflow model in the abc analysis in the current study emulators were only trained for the objective functions summary statistics the final predictions were generated by the modflow model to avoid uncertainties from the emulators the hyperparameters of the lagps were fitted by empirical bayes 5 abc inference in the abc process random parameter combinations were generated from the parameter prior distributions these were evaluated with the emulators trained with the outputs corresponding to historical observations only those parameter combinations that met the acceptance criteria were accepted into the posterior parameter distributions in this study the key prediction was the maximum drawdown due to csg development at various locations in the model domain a set of relevant model evaluation criteria were formalized into objective functions and their acceptance thresholds the objective functions were calculated for all of the doe model results and the corresponding emulators were trained for these objective functions this set of emulators were subsequently used in a monte carlo sampling of the prior parameter distributions 6 posterior prediction the final step in the procedure is to generate the posterior ensembles of predictions in the current study prediction ensembles were generated by the modflow model with 200 samples randomly selected from the posterior parameter distribution 3 case study 3 1 study area and groundwater model the clarence moreton basin is an intracratonic sedimentary basin covering approximately 38 000 km2 on shore in south east queensland and north east new south wales rassam et al 2014 it was filled with sedimentary sequences of middle and late triassic to lower cretaceous age with a combined thickness of up to approximately 3500 to 4000 m the climate across the basin falls within the temperate and subtropical climate groupings the mean annual rainfall varies from 800 to 2716 mm rainfall is highest during the warmer months of january to march and lowest during the colder months of july to september rassam et al 2014 it contains nationally important wetlands numerous national parks and forest reserves and sites of international importance for bird conservation it includes potential habitat for 432 threatened species under queensland nsw and commonwealth legislation rassam et al 2017 although the clarence moreton basin contains several major river catchments the current study is focused on the richmond river catchment where csg development plans had been proposed raiber et al 2015 fig 1 the potential csg project is referred to as the west casino gas project in this study csg operations can induce changes in groundwater that depend on varying factors such as hydraulic properties and csg development schemes the impact in turn can potentially reduce the quantity of water that discharge to surface water bodies as base flow or may cause a decline in water level in a groundwater bore there are around 4000 groundwater bores in the model domain more than 90 of them were drilled for irrigation and domestic stock consumption mcjannet et al 2015 the groundwater model was developed to assess the potential impact of the west casino gas project on the surrounding groundwater systems and in particular on the operational groundwater bores in the study area the model is the first comprehensive model covering the entire richmond river catchment based on a newly developed 3d geological model cui et al 2018b raiber et al 2017b the remainder of this section only briefly describes the model development cui et al 2017 provides more details on the groundwater model seven layers of the ten hydrostratigraphic units identified in the geological model raiber et al 2017b were represented with six numerical layers fig 3 in the groundwater model the upper unconfined layer contains the major aquifers targeted for agricultural and domestic groundwater extraction especially the richmond river alluvium and the lamington volcanics layers 2 5 comprise sedimentary bedrock units separating the unconfined aquifers from the coal seams targeted for csg production these coal seams are represented in layer 6 the model domain was discretized into 248 rows and 184 columns resulting in 33 352 active cells in each of the six layers grid spacing varied from 200 m inside the csg development field to 800 m outside the domain the transient model spans a 120 year period from 1983 to 2102 divided in monthly stress periods where the first 30 years are used to compare simulated heads and fluxes with observations a steady state stress period was added to generate the background context for the transient groundwater model resulting in 1441 stress periods in total 3 2 boundary conditions and model parameterization general head boundaries were implemented in the northern and southern sides of the groundwater model where the simulated aquifers continue beyond the model extents a general head boundary was also applied in parts of the eastern side of the groundwater model where it intersects with the richmond river alluvium other lateral boundaries of the model were assigned as no flow boundaries the long term average recharge was estimated using chloride mass balance analysis crosbie et al 2015 raiber et al 2017a the point scale estimates were up scaled coupled with australian water resources assessment awra recharge outputs vaze et al 2013 and normalized to yield a spatially explicit time series of recharge which was implemented using the modflow recharge package and varied via multipliers during the uncertainty analyses perennial reaches of the richmond river network were explicitly simulated using the modflow river package by imposing stage height time series derived from river gauging sites estimates for the riverbed hydraulic conductivity and thickness were informed by the riverbed topography initial riverbed conductance was calculated using the two parameters along with river reach width and length the initial values were adjusted with the aid of interpolation points during the uncertainty analyses the csg extraction wells in the coal seams of layer 6 were simulated using the modflow drain package with a variable conductance that aims at matching the independently evaluated volumes of extracted water and achieves the target pressure head the proposed west casino gas project consists of two potential gas fields one to the south and one to the west of casino fig 1 there were 90 wells in the proposed development plan when the study was conducted for the gas field west of casino which were to be drilled into the walloon coal measures over a period of 20 years starting in 2018 the gas field south of casino was assumed to be a small project with five wells other existing groundwater bores that were not drilled for csg extraction were simulated using the modflow multiple node well package 3 3 model parameterization depending on data availability two different approaches were adopted to assign horizontal hydraulic conductivities kx in the groundwater model the kx for the top layer were interpolated from available kx from 130 existing pumping test records using the tguess approach bradbury and rothschild 1985 the kx for the deeper layers were computed from fitted kx depth relationships mainly using drill stem tests dst data as well as a few pumping tests due to the lack of sedimentary bedrock aquifer data in the clarence moreton basin relevant data were sourced from the linked surat basin where hydrogeological units are expected to show similar hydraulic properties to their counterparts in the clarence moreton basin porosity permeability depth relationships have been extensively studied within the petroleum industry e g magara 1980 nelson 1994 many studies have shown a linear or exponential decline in porosity down to depths of about 3 to 4 km depending on rock compositions and geological settings as hydraulic conductivity is generally correlated with porosity it is deemed that a similar trend would exist between hydraulic conductivity and depth the following log kx depth linear relationship was implemented for layers 2 3 and 4 7 log kx 0 0009 h m where h is depth and m is the value of log kx close to ground surface for layers 5 and 6 the following exponential decay relationship was implemented 8 log kx c 1 b 3 h a d where a b c and d are four coefficients that can be adjusted during modelling the adjustment of the parameters in the two log kx depth relationships are restricted by the boundary lines that is the log kx depth lines are not allowed to move outside the boundary lines in fig 4 the stress test of the groundwater model revealed that many of the 63 parameters chosen for the initial parameterization of the model hardly affect the prediction of interest and that a parameterization scheme with 38 independent parameters is sufficient to explore the water table change due to the csg development table 2 lists the 38 parameters that were independently varied in the uncertainty analysis and how they relate to the hydraulic properties stresses and boundary conditions of the groundwater model the notes column provides a short description of the parameters the min and max columns provide the range over which the parameter is sampled the chosen parameter range is based on expert knowledge local hydrogeological setting and results from a series of model stability tests the parameter ranges were sampled uniformly in the doe to ensure sufficient coverage of the parameter space for emulator training 3 4 observations and objective functions for the current study two types of observations were used to constrain the parameters including groundwater levels and independently forecast csg water production rates from the csg industry the total csg water production is a function of the integrated groundwater dynamics over tens of years in the prediction period of the model it was expected that the water production would have some constraint on the hydraulic parameters of deep layers especially the targeted coal seam formation on the other hand groundwater level observations however are mainly available in the unconfined part of the model and their dynamics are more dominated by shallow processes such as recharge and sw gw interaction two objective functions and their thresholds were defined based on the available observations 1 the total simulated csg water production is less than 1 2 gl over the simulation period that is twice of the previously estimated value by the csg industry the total csg water production was computed for all successful runs of the doe these values were used to create a csg water production emulator 2 the absolute weighted difference between observed and simulated groundwater levels is less than 2 m where observations close to the development location receive greater weight and observations close to rivers receive less weight a total of 900 head records from 43 bores were selected as the head observations fig 1 the weighting of individual head observations depends on the distance between observation and prediction and the distance between observation and river boundary calculated as follows 9 o h j 1 m r j f w d j 1 n j i 1 n j h o i h s i 2 with o h the head objective function m the number of observation bores n j the number of observations at one specific observation bore j r j the distance of observation bore j to the nearest watercourse line network h o i the head observation and h s i the simulated equivalent f w d j is a distance weighting function as 10 f w d j 1 tanh d j d where d j is the distance inkm between observation bore j and the central location of the development field coefficient d controls the distance at which the weight of observation bore j drops to zero to account for transient observations the weights are divided by n j the number of observations at the observation location the tanh function allows the weight of an observation to decrease almost linearly with distance and to gradually become zero at a distance of approximately 3 d in the current study the value of d is set equal to 7 km which means that an observation has a weight of zero if the distance between the prediction and the observation is more than 21 km the threshold t h the upper limit of the head objective function is defined as 11 t h j 1 m r j f w d j 1 n j i 1 n j 2 2 this means that any parameter combination that results in an average difference between observed and simulated groundwater level less than or equal to 2 m is deemed acceptable 4 results 4 1 emulator performance within the operational constraints time and computational resources of the study 4000 parameter sets were uniformly sampled from the parameter ranges using the above mentioned maximin latin hypercube method the two objective functions were calculated for all the models in the doe these doe objective function values and their corresponding parameter values formed the training dataset for the two objective function lagp emulators for emulators to be applicable in bayesian inference they need to be sufficiently accurate as to ensure that the added uncertainty of replacing the original model with a surrogate is acceptably small the accuracy of emulators the degree to which emulators can reproduce the relationship between parameters and predictions depends greatly on the density of sampling of the parameter space liu 2005 a cross validation was conducted by portioning the doe samples into a training set and a test set 250 samples fig 5 provides a comparison between the modelled objective functions and the emulated ones based on the 250 test samples for both objective functions the absolute values of test errors are dependent on the magnitude of the objective functions the test errors of head objective functions fig 5a are more dynamic than the water production objective function fig 5b particularly for lower values the maximum test errors are around 30 of the simulated objective functions this means that an uncertainty of 30 of the objective functions can be caused by the emulating process although it is a subjective decision the authors argue that by using an emulator with this accuracy in the abc analysis the risk of wrongly accepting or rejecting a parameter combination is acceptable for regional groundwater modelling 4 2 posterior parameter distribution a posterior parameter distribution was generated through the generic rejection sampling algorithm under the abc framework as described in the method section during this monte carlo simulation random samples of the prior parameter distribution were generated only the samples that meet both the acceptance criteria are accepted as part of the posterior distribution this process was repeated until a predefined number of samples in this case 10 000 were accepted the green histograms in fig 6 show the resulting posterior parameter distributions based on two emulators of the objective functions some of the parameters are not constrained significantly by the objective functions and the posterior distribution for these is almost identical to the prior distributions the parameters for which the posterior distribution are significantly different to the prior distribution are the recharge multipliers of recharge zones 1 rch 1 the multiplier for the drainage conductance of the csg wells drn c 1 the multiplier for conductance of drain cells in the top layer drn c 2 and the hydraulic conductivity parameters for layers 2 3 4 and 6 kx 2 kx 3 d kx 4 kx 6 c and kx 6 d parameters related to the hydraulic properties of layer 5 the aquitard between the shallow aquifers and the targeted coal seam formation are only constrained slightly however these parameters particularly the vertical horizontal hydraulic conductivity ratio are expected to have a strong impact on the drawdown prediction in the shallow aquifer for most of these parameters under well constraining expect for kx 2 and kx 4 the posterior distribution are skewed to the upper or lower ends of the parameters this is different with the most widely used assumption of normal distribution in many formal bayesian analysis a bivariate plot fig 7 was also compiled to reveal the correlation between a set of 12 selected parameter the 12 parameters were selected because they are constrained to some extent by the two objective functions the drain conductance are positively correlated with recharge multipliers particularly rch 1 alluvium higher recharge can be counterbalanced by a higher drain conductance in the top layer the drain conductance of csg well cells needs to be lower when the hydraulic conductivity in layer 6 is high to meet the water production criterion when the hydraulic parameter of layer 2 kx 2 is close to the lower end and the hydraulic parameter of layer 3 kx 3 d cannot be close to the upper end the hydraulic properties of layers 3 and 4 are positively correlated 4 3 posterior prediction although various types of prediction can be made with the developed groundwater model in the current paper we focus only on additional drawdown due to the simulated csg development by evaluating the appropriate posterior parameter distribution generated in the previous step the predictive posterior distribution was generated by running the modflow model with 200 parameter sets from the posterior parameter distribution figs 8 and 9 provide two different visualizations of predictive posterior distributions fig 8 shows the probability of drawdown exceeding 0 2 m for predictions in layer 1 while fig 9 shows the 95th percentile of these distributions the 0 2 m threshold corresponds to an impact threshold in the nsw aquifer interference policy nsw dpi 2012 for impact on high priority groundwater dependent ecosystems the results show that there are only two noticeable areas where it is possible to have csg drawdown exceeding 0 2 m although the probability is all below 5 fig 8 one area is the central part of the proposed csg development field surrounded by alluvium the other one is a north south strip along the border between kangaroo creek sandstone and the maclean sandstone aquitard the low permeability of the maclean sandstone limits the spreading of the drawdown impact resulting in an accumulated water level change along the border the highest probability of exceeding 0 2 m drawdown is recorded in the top layer is 4 8 the 95th percentiles of additional drawdown are generally higher in the central part of the development field with a maximum of around 0 15 m fig 9 the impact becomes weaker gradually with increasing distance from the proposed csg development field as the probability map also suggested another high impact zone occurs along the border between the kangaroo creek sandstone and the mclean sandstone about 5 7 km west of the development area the impact extends more to the west as the targeted coal seam unit deepens towards to east the map also shows the mitigating effect of the major rivers on additional drawdown fig 9 fig 10 shows the time series of the additional drawdown evolution due to csg over the simulated period at two representative locations node 324 and node 1291 from the center and boundary of the csg development field fig 1 the two locations represent two domestic bores in layer 1 and layer 3 respectively although the csg bores were activated following the sample scheme from 2018 to 2036 the drawdown evolution shows different characteristics among different parameter sets for some parameter sets peak impact were observed over the simulation period from 1983 to 2102 on the other hand the drawdown impact is gradually increasing until the ending of the simulation for some posterior realizations for these parameter sets a longer modelling time is required to investigate the peak drawdown impact as a summary given the current parameterization and assumptions in the groundwater model it is very likely that the maximum additional drawdown is less than the 0 2 m threshold for the two locations 5 discussion 5 1 how many samples are enough for the training dataset the performance of emulators is largely determined by the density of sampling of the parameter space and the complexity of the response surfaces of the predictions of interest for the groundwater model in this study with tens of parameters 38 adjusted parameters and hours of runtimes 2 8 h the lagps can capture the major input output relationships of the modflow model based on a doe of 4000 samples the ratio between samples and the number of parameters is around 100 the emulator performance is validated by comparing the emulated outputs with the modelled outputs for the head and the csg water production objective functions however there should be caution in assuming that this ratio can be directly applied to other groundwater models emulator performance is model specific and prediction specific for models with more parameters and more complicated input output relationships a denser sampling is required when this occurs after performance validation adaptive sampling schemes gorissen et al 2010 shields et al 2015 can be considered in which samples are incrementally added to the doe until a predefined or optimal emulator accuracy is achieved as well as dimension reduction techniques a computational drawback of building a gp emulator is that the evaluation of the predictive distribution requires the inversion of and computing the determinant of an n by n covariance matrix operations whose complexity is o n3 in other words for large values of n constructing a gp emulator may become computationally prohibitive in the context of model emulation n is relevant to the number of model runs that were performed and used to train the emulator as the number of parameter in the process based model is increased the number of model runs required to support emulator training grows dramatically although lagps has potential to overcome this as pointed out in the reviews by razavi et al 2012 and asher et al 2015 other types of emulators may be better suited for problems with very high parameter dimensions such as polynomial chaos surrogates using adaptive sparse grids and project based emulators 5 2 other beneficial usage of the doe the sampling scheme for the doe results in an ensemble of model runs to train emulators this ensemble of model runs however have great potential to gain additional insight in the model and to identify structural or conceptual model issues for instance the same dataset can be used for a formal global sensitivity analysis such as delta moment sensitivity analysis as outlined by plischke et al 2013 peeters et al 2018 show how this kind of analysis can be used to identify parameters that can be constrained by the observations as well as parameters that the predictions are sensitive to this is a critical step in a data worth analysis to identify the observations that have the most potential to reduce predictive uncertainty these model runs can also be used to show the fraction of successful runs that meet the selected acceptance criteria to help identify deficit in the model conceptualization and parameterization 5 3 applications of emulators in groundwater management in the current effort emulators were trained for helping predict the change of hydrological variables as a result of csg development the impact is calculated from a model batch that includes a baseline model and a model with csg development the two models are essentially the same except for the csg development scheme advantages of emulators can be further gained when different types of models need to be coupled in a modeling framework that requires short runtimes and or a simplified model interface gorelick and zheng 2015 for example this may be the case where the output from a groundwater model need to be coupled with an ecological model to study the impact of new water management policies on ecosystems emulators can be trained to capture the relationship between all the inputs of the two models and the final predictions of interest directly then decision makers can experiment with the simpler emulators rather than the process based groundwater and ecological models that require more skills and effort emulators can also be used in agent based water resource management platforms to explore the behavioral interactions between different entities such as stakeholders environment and government castilla rho et al 2015 5 4 comments on abc the use of gp emulators with short runtimes made the simple rejection sampling scheme computationally tractable and allowed the generation of a posterior parameter distribution of 10 000 samples within hours more sophisticated sampling methods such as population monte carlo turner and van zandt 2012 and markov chain monte carlo mcmc as implemented in dream abc sadegh and vrugt 2014 are needed however if the abc scheme is to be used without emulators or with computationally more demanding surrogate approaches such as the multi fidelity surrogates used in doherty and christensen 2011 and burrows and doherty 2015 the abc methodology has similar theoretical drawbacks as the glue methodology mantovan and todini 2006 stedinger et al 2008 vrugt et al 2009 the choice of acceptance criteria is subjective and as a result the method does not strictly adhere to the probabilistic bayesian theory a great advantage however is that this explicit formulation of evaluation criteria and thresholds increases transparency it makes it much easier to formalize what modelers experts and stakeholder considers to be a good model in turn model confidence is increased as model evaluation criteria can be unambiguously and transparently documented 6 conclusions to conduct probabilistic assessment of the potential impact of coal seam gas depressurization in the clarence moreton basin on relevant groundwater systems emulator assisted approximate bayesian computation abc was conducted major conclusions that can be drawn from this study are given the current model conceptualization and simulated development scheme the water table change due to the west casino gas project in the richmond river catchment is unlikely exceeding 0 2 m the proposed strategy of using computationally efficient emulator surrogate models to calculate objective functions during model constraining allows the application of global calibration and uncertainty analysis to computationally demanding groundwater models the running time of the modflow model varies between 2 h and 8 h depending on the parameter values with an average of about 4 h without including the post processing time the running time of the lagp emulators is less than a minute abc does not only relax the need to explicitly define a likelihood function it also provides flexibility on objective function selection and diagnostic ability to model structure deficiency the application of abc is straightforward and its application in practical groundwater modeling should be encouraged although the application of emulators and bayesian inferences in practical groundwater modeling is still at its preliminary stage they have shown great potential more research is required to 1 compare the effectiveness and efficiency of the different model emulating algorithms 2 invent new model emulating algorithms particularly for that highly parameterized models hundreds to thousands of parameters and 3 develop well documented and user friendly software packages to further lower the barrier for the application of emulator enabled bayesian inference acknowledgments this research is part of the

7062,bayesian inference provides a mathematically elegant and robust approach to constrain numerical model predictions with system knowledge and observations technical challenges such as evaluating a large number of models with long runtimes have restricted the application of bayesian inference to groundwater modeling to overcome such technical challenges we use gaussian process emulators to replace a transient regional groundwater modflow model for computing objective functions during model constraining the regional model is designed to assess the potential impact of a proposed coal seam gas csg development on groundwater levels in the richmond river catchment clarence moreton basin australia the emulators were trained using 4000 snapshots derived from the modflow model and subsequently used to replace the modflow model in an approximate bayesian computation abc scheme abc was deemed the more appropriate choice as it relaxes the need to derive an explicit likelihood function that the formal bayesian analysis requires the study demonstrated the flexibility of the gaussian process emulators which can accurately reproduce the original model behavior at a fraction of the computational cost from hours to seconds the gain in computational efficiency using the proposed approach allows the global calibration and uncertainty algorithms to become more feasible for computationally demanding groundwater models based on the abc analysis the probability for the simulated csg development causing a water table change of more than 0 2 m was less than 5 in addition to a probabilistic estimate of the prediction an added value of emulator assisted abc inference is providing information on the extent to which observations can constrain parameters and predictions as well as the flexibility to include various quantitative and qualitative parameter constraining information keywords gaussian process emulators surrogate model groundwater modelling data worth clarence moreton basin coal seam gas 1 introduction doherty 2011 states that a model cannot promise the right answer however if properly constructed a model can promise that the right answer lies within the uncertainty limits which are its responsibility to construct this statement is a reflection of the need to shift the focus of groundwater modeling from seeking a single optimal prediction to a prediction distribution that encompasses the range of predictions that are consistent with observations uncertainty analysis can be considered as the process to achieve such a distribution to support evidence based decision making predictive uncertainty can be quantified through i forward propagation of input uncertainty or ii an inverse assessment of parameters where historical measurements are available to constrain the model beven 2007 refsgaard et al 2007 most practical groundwater modeling applications belong to the latter type aiming to inform decision making for water resource management the inverse assessment of uncertainty requires sampling the prior distribution of parameters to yield posterior parameter distributions conditioned on observations a multitude of methods for assessing the predictive uncertainty using various sampling strategies have been reported in the literature such as pure monte carlo mc sampling stratified sampling importance sampling projection based sampling or combinations of them beven 2008 among those the null space monte carlo nsmc herckenrath et al 2015 james et al 2009 sepúlveda and doherty 2015 is probably the most widely used method in groundwater modelling especially for computationally expensive groundwater models either due to large spatial and temporal scales or coupled multiple processes although the projection based nsmc can significantly reduce computational cost and allow a non linear uncertainty analysis for computationally intensive groundwater models the posterior distribution is always surrounding a pre calibrated parameter set using a gradient based sampling algorithm the method is sensitive to initial parameter assignment and prone to local minima when the model is not linear or not approximately linear although the bias may be minimized to some extent by multiple starting points nsmc keating et al 2010 tavakoli et al 2013 meanwhile with the continuous rise in computing power and improvement of data measurements bayesian analysis based on holistic sampling algorithms has become increasingly popular for posterior parameter inference in other fields sadegh and vrugt 2014 vrugt and sadegh 2013 however two key issues have hindered the application of bayesian inference in groundwater modelling although other factors exist pappenberger and beven 2006 such as a steep learning curve and a lack of well documented and robust tools with a user friendly interface the first factor is the heavy computational burden for most practical groundwater models despite the advances in algorithmic sampling efficiencies maier et al 2014 j a vrugt et al 2009 the number of model runs required to accurately approximate the posterior distributions are counted in tens to hundreds of thousands for highly parameterized groundwater models keating et al 2010 constraining wide and uninformative prior parameter distributions for a complex regional groundwater model through bayesian inference using a holistic search algorithm requires an often prohibitively large number of model runs model emulation has a great potential to overcome this particular issue the principle of model emulation is to use computationally efficient algorithms to replace computationally demanding models emulators are also known as surrogate models meta models reduced models proxy models lower fidelity models and response surfaces razavi et al 2012 numerous model emulation techniques have been explored in various disciplines and they can be broadly categorized into three classes data driven methods projection based methods and multi fidelity methods asher et al 2015 robinson et al 2008 the emulator is typically a black box or statistical model that is trained on a set of model inputs and their corresponding outputs a well trained emulator can yield relatively accurate and precise predictions for new inputs such as parameter values and forcing variables that were not part of the original training set emulators have gained popularity for performing tasks such as model calibration sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis where a model must be run a large number of times some popular choices in the literature have included gaussian processes gps kennedy and o hagan 2001 liu and west 2009 o hagan 2006 sacks et al 1989 neural networks kourakos and mantoglou 2009 yan and minsker 2006 random forests hooten et al 2011 leeds et al 2014 and generalized additive models gams stanfill et al 2015 storlie et al 2009 strong et al 2014 table 1 summarizes the recent applications of model emulation in applied groundwater modeling although these previous studies significantly advanced our understanding of groundwater model emulation to the authors knowledge gp emulators have not been previously applied to regional groundwater models that are used to provide environmental impact assessment of deep resource development in a sedimentary basin these models needs to include both the shallow unconsolidated aquifers where most receptors are located and the deep porous rock formations where resource development occurs raiber et al 2015 such models are complex and highly non linear cui et al 2018a sreekanth et al 2018 gaussian process emulators o hagan 2006 are mathematically very close to kriging interpolation kleijnen 2009 they are robust and well establish tools for accurate representation of complex response surfaces derived from numerical models they were chosen in this study as they 1 can provide a probabilistic estimate of the uncertainty in the emulated prediction rasmussen and williams 2006 2 are straightforward and quick to generate 3 can be easily tailored to individual predictions and 4 allow flexible parameterization bastos and o hagan 2009 razavi et al 2012 and asher et al 2015 have provided a thorough review on the application of surrogate models in water resources along with a comprehensive comparison among different types of emulators the second critical issue that limits the application of bayesian inference is the difficulty to define an explicit likelihood function for complex and non linear groundwater models although different likelihood functions can be derived based on some assumptions such as that the error residuals are normally distributed with a variance related to the observation uncertainty this observation uncertainty is however often very difficult to establish and the assumptions are often not realistic hill and tiedeman 2007 the approximate bayesian computation abc framework nott et al 2012 vrugt and sadegh 2013 relaxes the need for computing an explicit likelihood function by using summary statistics or multiple objective functions abc has its roots in the rejection sampling in which only those parameter combinations that meet specific defined acceptance criteria are accepted this is in contrast with formal bayesian analysis where parameter combinations are accepted based on a likelihood function abc is also superior in diagnostic model calibration by defining multiple summary statistics that capture different aspects of the modelled system vrugt and sadegh 2013 abc has been recently applied in hydrology by nott et al 2012 and vrugt and sadegh 2013 however and to the authors knowledge it has not been applied in groundwater modelling yet another critical challenge that the classical groundwater model calibration faces is the design of the objection function different weight factors are usually applied to different types of numerical observations to ensure that every type of observation does influence the model calibration however the determining the weights is not straightforward and is usually subjective doherty 2015 qualitative observations e g direction of flow cannot be usually included in the composite objective function on the other hand abc has not limitation on taking different types of numerical observations into account by including them in the summary statistics qualitative data can also be implemented as acceptance criteria the objective of this paper is to explore whether the emulator enabled abc framework can serve as a practical tool for a comprehensive and transparent assessment of groundwater model predictive uncertainty it also aims at tackling some of the challenges encountered by the current groundwater model calibration methods and the application of bayesian inference in groundwater modelling the framework is applied to a transient regional groundwater model developed to assess the potential impact of coal seam gas csg development in the richmond river catchment clarence moreton basin in eastern australia fig 1 the next section introduces the methods used in the study followed by a description of the study area and the numerical modflow model the results section evaluates the performance of the emulator and the resulting probabilistic estimates of model predictions while the discussion focuses on the practical implementation and transparency the findings are summarized in the conclusions section along with recommendations for further research 2 method 2 1 numerical groundwater modelling the groundwater modelling aims to probabilistically evaluate the potential changes in the relevant groundwater system due to a proposed csg development in the richmond river basin nsw australia the direct impact is represented by the difference in the groundwater head between the csg development scenario and the baseline modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 a newton formulation of modflow 2005 was chosen to execute the model in order to reduce numerical instabilities associated with cell drying and rewetting in the uppermost layer of the model the model area is characterised by high relief topography that usually results in cell drying and rewetting during modelling in the unconfined parts of a groundwater model the frequent drying and rewetting is one of the major reasons that causes difficulty to converge modflow nwt was designed to address drying and rewetting problems more efficiently thus providing a more stable solution compared to modflow 2005 by treating nonlinearities of cell drying and rewetting as a continuous function of groundwater head the gmres matrix solver was used for solving the large number of equations generated by the groundwater model 2 2 gaussian process emulator gps can be thought of as a prior distribution over functions of interest to emulate in the context of emulation the function in question is the response of a model s output y over vectors of p dimensional model inputs x the finite dimensional distributions of the model outputs can be described through a mean μ x and positive definite covariance matrix σ with the ith j th entry σ i j 2 τ 2 k x i x j the covariance terms are the product of a variance parameter τ 2 and a correlation function k that describes the decline in the correlation between two model outputs y i and y j as the distances between their respective input vectors x i and x j are increased the popularity of gps stems from two main features i the predictive distributions from the emulator have simple analytical distribution and ii as a result of analytical tractability inference for the model parameters is relatively simple gramacy and apley 2015 improved the computational efficiency of gps through the use of local approximate gaussian processes lagps to overcome the computational burden encountered for standard gps which model the data through a stationary covariance function we used lagps that is only a function of the training data within a local neighborhood of the input vector x the local neighborhood is defined to be the n input vectors nearby x that are chosen one by one in an iterative manner to maximize a reduction in prediction variance a scheme referred as active learning cohn or alc by gramacy and apley 2015 as recommended by gramacy 2016 empirical bayes has been adopted for fitting lagps in the current study a reference prior for the variance τ 2 algebraically equivalent to an inverse gamma distribution with shape and scale parameters both equal to zero and the multivariate normal likelihood of the gp makes integrating out τ 2 analytically tractable the resulting marginal likelihood for the remaining parameters has the form 1 p y n k θ γ n 2 2 π n 2 k n 1 2 ψ n 2 n 2 where θ is the length scale parameter used in the isotropic gaussian correlation function eq 5 used in this paper and ψ n y n t k n 1 y n this approach is differentiable analytically and therefore lends itself to fast newton based methods for maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters in the lagp the resulting predictive distribution from the lagp has a student t distribution with n degrees of freedom with a mean defined as 2 μ x d n k θ k n t k n 1 y n and variance defined as 3 var y x d n k θ n σ 2 x d n k n 2 where 4 σ 2 x d n k θ ψ n k θ x x k n t x k n 1 k n x n is the scale parameter k n is the n by n matrix of pairwise correlations between each of the x i with i jth entry k θ x i x j and k n t x is a vector of length n with ith element k θ x x i being the correlation function between x and x i in the above d n denotes the set of training data for the lagp which is comprised of pairs of predictor vectors and response variables this correlation function is modeled as an isotropic gaussian of the form 5 k θ x i x j exp k 1 p x i k x j k 2 θ where x i k denotes the k th component of x i in practice a nugget can be added whereby k θ η x x i k θ x x i η i x x i the standard approach taken in the lagp package is to set η 10 6 which offers enough flexibility to aid parameter estimation whilst providing a high level of fidelity to the observed model runs at each of the x i the specific algorithm for fitting the lagp as implemented in the lagp r package is outlined in gramacy 2016 but for ease of reference it is repeated below multi stage approximate local gp modeling algorithm 1 choose a sensible starting global θ x θ 0 for all x 2 calculate local designs x n x θ x based on alc independently for each x a choose a nearest neighbor design x n 0 x of size n 0 b for j n 0 n 1 set

3 also independently calculate the maximum likelihood estimate θ n x d n x θ x thereby explicitly obtaining a globally nonstationary predictive surface set θ x θ n x 4 repeat steps 2 3 as desired 5 output predictions y x d n x θ x for each x to construct a lagp emulator n runs of the target model are required in order to obtain a set of training data ideally these model runs should span a wide range of vectors across the space of model inputs and attempt to fill this space with the limited number of model runs that can be feasibly obtained with the available resources unsurprisingly the experimental designs used to build model emulators are broadly referred to as space filling designs such as latin hypercube designs lhds santner et al 2003 in this study we chose the maximin lhd which is implemented in the lhs package in r carnell 2016 the maximin latin hypercube design is generated like a standard latin hypercube design one design point at a time but with each new point selected to maximise the minimum euclidean distance between design points in the parameter space points in the design span the full range of parameter values in each dimension of the parameter space but also avoid redundancy amongst points by maximising the euclidean distance between two points since nearby points are likely to have similar model output gps tend to perform better if the output variable is close to a gaussian distribution as the groundwater model outputs of the case study were typically not normally distributed but heavily skewed the quantity to be emulated was transformed using a normal quantile transform bogner et al 2012 before training the emulator the following steps are required to carry out such a normal quantile transformation of a sample x 1 sort the sample x from smallest to largest x 1 x n 2 estimate the cumulative probabilities p i p n using a plotting position like i n 1 such that p i p x x i 3 transform each value x i of x in y i q 1 p i of the normal variate y where q 1 is the inverse of the standard normal distribution using a discrete mapping 2 3 approximate bayesian computation abc the abc framework was firstly published in the statistical literature by diggle and gratton 1984 recently the method has been seeing increasing applications in population and evolutionary genetics mainly due to the limitation of likelihood based inference and rapid generation of large amounts of data beaumont et al 2002 csilléry et al 2010 inspired by the increasing application in evolutionary genetics vrugt s team have introduced the abc approach into hydrologic modelling vrugt and sadegh 2013 and implemented it in the dream suite for bayesian inference sadegh and vrugt 2014 the abc provides a more flexible mechanism to define the nature and number of evaluation criteria various kinds of information can be formalized into the summary statistics the process of defining summary statistics can be subjective beven et al 2008 but is more transparent which makes it easier to engage with stakeholders this provides ample opportunity to integrate expert knowledge in the model evaluation and even to tailor model evaluation to specific predictions which is receiving increased attention internationally de boer euser et al 2017 gupta et al 2012 the proposition underlying abc is that a parameter set θ should lie in the posterior distribution when the distance between the observed and simulated data is less than a small positive value vrugt and sadegh 2013 the distance is defined as ρ y y θ where y is the observation vector and y θ is the simulated data corresponding to the observations for complex models such as the 3d transient regional groundwater model used in the study the chance to meet the acceptance criteria is very low which results in a very low acceptance rate during model evaluation to avoid this difficulty the distance between summary statistics s y and s y θ is usually used during inference a set of summary statistics can be can be defined to extract different types of information from the observation data csilléry et al 2010 when it is necessary another way to increase the information available for the abc sampler is to incorporate multiple context specific state variables and their relationships into a single summary statistics only parameter combinations sampled from the priors that satisfy these criteria are accepted in the posterior distributions the widely used abc algorithms can be grouped into three categories based on the different sampling techniques including the basic rejection algorithm and its variations the abc mcmc algorithm sadegh and vrugt 2014 and the algorithm using sequential monte carlo turner and van zandt 2012 the sampling procedure starts from a candidate θ from the priors and continue until the moments of the posterior distribution stabilize regardless of what sampling algorithms are chosen the process of abc inference can be described by the generic algorithm as follows generic algorithm of abc for i 1 to n do while ρ s y s y θ do sample θ from the prior θ p θ simulate data y using θ y model θ calculate ρ s y s y θ end while accept θ as θ i set θ i θ end for where ρ s y s y θ is the distance function of the two summary statistics variables the major focus of the present study is to demonstrate the applicability of abc on emulated complex groundwater models the basic rejection algorithm was chosen because it is straightforward to understand and easy to be implemented despite the availability of more sophisticated algorithms for a more detailed discussion about the abc algorithms interested readers are referred to nott et al 2012 vrugt and sadegh 2013 and sadegh and vrugt 2014 2 4 framework the workflow for the gaussian process emulator enabled abc is shown in fig 2 it consists of two major modules developing and training the emulator fig 2a and the approximate bayesian inference fig 2b 1 problem definition and process based groundwater model development the workflow starts with defining the modelling objective although the objective can be reviewed and refined throughout the modelling process it should be clearly stated at the initial stage of a modelling project anderson et al 2015 once the objective has been defined and the benefits are clearly justified a groundwater model can be developed the defined objective needs to be revisited iteratively during the model development process to justify the selection of various parameters boundary conditions observations and processes 2 define model outputs gps capture the functional behavior of a numerical model i e how a model output changes as a function of varying model parameters therefore an essential prerequisite for model emulation is that a finite set of model outputs is defined for which an emulator will be created these model outputs may correspond to historical observations or be the model predictions for which the model is being developed 3 design of experiment the primary purpose of the design of experiment doe is to efficiently sample the parameter space within the limited time and computing resources to provide training data for emulators the groundwater model should be evaluated for a wide range of parameter combinations chosen in a systematic and efficient manner the first stage of this evaluation applies a stress test involving a limited number of model runs to evaluate the stability of the model using a wide range of parameters this test helps to identify the stability of the minimum and maximum parameter ranges this test results in a more stable model while ensuring that sampling from within this range explores the full range of predictive uncertainty this exercise also helps identify the redundant parameters that do not or only slightly affect the model predictions based on the outcomes of the stress test model parameterisation is further reviewed to either remove the redundant parameters that did not affect the predictions or tie these parameters to other independent parameters once the model passes the stress test it can be used to generate snapshots for emulator training depending on the context different sampling methods can be used to generate the required parameter combinations in the current study 4000 parameter combinations were generated for the entire parameter space for the groundwater model using the maximin latin hypercube design santner et al 2003 p 138 4 emulator training the results of the model runs from the doe including the simulated equivalents to the observations and the predictions of interest were used to train the statistical emulators which will replace the modflow model in the abc analysis in the current study emulators were only trained for the objective functions summary statistics the final predictions were generated by the modflow model to avoid uncertainties from the emulators the hyperparameters of the lagps were fitted by empirical bayes 5 abc inference in the abc process random parameter combinations were generated from the parameter prior distributions these were evaluated with the emulators trained with the outputs corresponding to historical observations only those parameter combinations that met the acceptance criteria were accepted into the posterior parameter distributions in this study the key prediction was the maximum drawdown due to csg development at various locations in the model domain a set of relevant model evaluation criteria were formalized into objective functions and their acceptance thresholds the objective functions were calculated for all of the doe model results and the corresponding emulators were trained for these objective functions this set of emulators were subsequently used in a monte carlo sampling of the prior parameter distributions 6 posterior prediction the final step in the procedure is to generate the posterior ensembles of predictions in the current study prediction ensembles were generated by the modflow model with 200 samples randomly selected from the posterior parameter distribution 3 case study 3 1 study area and groundwater model the clarence moreton basin is an intracratonic sedimentary basin covering approximately 38 000 km2 on shore in south east queensland and north east new south wales rassam et al 2014 it was filled with sedimentary sequences of middle and late triassic to lower cretaceous age with a combined thickness of up to approximately 3500 to 4000 m the climate across the basin falls within the temperate and subtropical climate groupings the mean annual rainfall varies from 800 to 2716 mm rainfall is highest during the warmer months of january to march and lowest during the colder months of july to september rassam et al 2014 it contains nationally important wetlands numerous national parks and forest reserves and sites of international importance for bird conservation it includes potential habitat for 432 threatened species under queensland nsw and commonwealth legislation rassam et al 2017 although the clarence moreton basin contains several major river catchments the current study is focused on the richmond river catchment where csg development plans had been proposed raiber et al 2015 fig 1 the potential csg project is referred to as the west casino gas project in this study csg operations can induce changes in groundwater that depend on varying factors such as hydraulic properties and csg development schemes the impact in turn can potentially reduce the quantity of water that discharge to surface water bodies as base flow or may cause a decline in water level in a groundwater bore there are around 4000 groundwater bores in the model domain more than 90 of them were drilled for irrigation and domestic stock consumption mcjannet et al 2015 the groundwater model was developed to assess the potential impact of the west casino gas project on the surrounding groundwater systems and in particular on the operational groundwater bores in the study area the model is the first comprehensive model covering the entire richmond river catchment based on a newly developed 3d geological model cui et al 2018b raiber et al 2017b the remainder of this section only briefly describes the model development cui et al 2017 provides more details on the groundwater model seven layers of the ten hydrostratigraphic units identified in the geological model raiber et al 2017b were represented with six numerical layers fig 3 in the groundwater model the upper unconfined layer contains the major aquifers targeted for agricultural and domestic groundwater extraction especially the richmond river alluvium and the lamington volcanics layers 2 5 comprise sedimentary bedrock units separating the unconfined aquifers from the coal seams targeted for csg production these coal seams are represented in layer 6 the model domain was discretized into 248 rows and 184 columns resulting in 33 352 active cells in each of the six layers grid spacing varied from 200 m inside the csg development field to 800 m outside the domain the transient model spans a 120 year period from 1983 to 2102 divided in monthly stress periods where the first 30 years are used to compare simulated heads and fluxes with observations a steady state stress period was added to generate the background context for the transient groundwater model resulting in 1441 stress periods in total 3 2 boundary conditions and model parameterization general head boundaries were implemented in the northern and southern sides of the groundwater model where the simulated aquifers continue beyond the model extents a general head boundary was also applied in parts of the eastern side of the groundwater model where it intersects with the richmond river alluvium other lateral boundaries of the model were assigned as no flow boundaries the long term average recharge was estimated using chloride mass balance analysis crosbie et al 2015 raiber et al 2017a the point scale estimates were up scaled coupled with australian water resources assessment awra recharge outputs vaze et al 2013 and normalized to yield a spatially explicit time series of recharge which was implemented using the modflow recharge package and varied via multipliers during the uncertainty analyses perennial reaches of the richmond river network were explicitly simulated using the modflow river package by imposing stage height time series derived from river gauging sites estimates for the riverbed hydraulic conductivity and thickness were informed by the riverbed topography initial riverbed conductance was calculated using the two parameters along with river reach width and length the initial values were adjusted with the aid of interpolation points during the uncertainty analyses the csg extraction wells in the coal seams of layer 6 were simulated using the modflow drain package with a variable conductance that aims at matching the independently evaluated volumes of extracted water and achieves the target pressure head the proposed west casino gas project consists of two potential gas fields one to the south and one to the west of casino fig 1 there were 90 wells in the proposed development plan when the study was conducted for the gas field west of casino which were to be drilled into the walloon coal measures over a period of 20 years starting in 2018 the gas field south of casino was assumed to be a small project with five wells other existing groundwater bores that were not drilled for csg extraction were simulated using the modflow multiple node well package 3 3 model parameterization depending on data availability two different approaches were adopted to assign horizontal hydraulic conductivities kx in the groundwater model the kx for the top layer were interpolated from available kx from 130 existing pumping test records using the tguess approach bradbury and rothschild 1985 the kx for the deeper layers were computed from fitted kx depth relationships mainly using drill stem tests dst data as well as a few pumping tests due to the lack of sedimentary bedrock aquifer data in the clarence moreton basin relevant data were sourced from the linked surat basin where hydrogeological units are expected to show similar hydraulic properties to their counterparts in the clarence moreton basin porosity permeability depth relationships have been extensively studied within the petroleum industry e g magara 1980 nelson 1994 many studies have shown a linear or exponential decline in porosity down to depths of about 3 to 4 km depending on rock compositions and geological settings as hydraulic conductivity is generally correlated with porosity it is deemed that a similar trend would exist between hydraulic conductivity and depth the following log kx depth linear relationship was implemented for layers 2 3 and 4 7 log kx 0 0009 h m where h is depth and m is the value of log kx close to ground surface for layers 5 and 6 the following exponential decay relationship was implemented 8 log kx c 1 b 3 h a d where a b c and d are four coefficients that can be adjusted during modelling the adjustment of the parameters in the two log kx depth relationships are restricted by the boundary lines that is the log kx depth lines are not allowed to move outside the boundary lines in fig 4 the stress test of the groundwater model revealed that many of the 63 parameters chosen for the initial parameterization of the model hardly affect the prediction of interest and that a parameterization scheme with 38 independent parameters is sufficient to explore the water table change due to the csg development table 2 lists the 38 parameters that were independently varied in the uncertainty analysis and how they relate to the hydraulic properties stresses and boundary conditions of the groundwater model the notes column provides a short description of the parameters the min and max columns provide the range over which the parameter is sampled the chosen parameter range is based on expert knowledge local hydrogeological setting and results from a series of model stability tests the parameter ranges were sampled uniformly in the doe to ensure sufficient coverage of the parameter space for emulator training 3 4 observations and objective functions for the current study two types of observations were used to constrain the parameters including groundwater levels and independently forecast csg water production rates from the csg industry the total csg water production is a function of the integrated groundwater dynamics over tens of years in the prediction period of the model it was expected that the water production would have some constraint on the hydraulic parameters of deep layers especially the targeted coal seam formation on the other hand groundwater level observations however are mainly available in the unconfined part of the model and their dynamics are more dominated by shallow processes such as recharge and sw gw interaction two objective functions and their thresholds were defined based on the available observations 1 the total simulated csg water production is less than 1 2 gl over the simulation period that is twice of the previously estimated value by the csg industry the total csg water production was computed for all successful runs of the doe these values were used to create a csg water production emulator 2 the absolute weighted difference between observed and simulated groundwater levels is less than 2 m where observations close to the development location receive greater weight and observations close to rivers receive less weight a total of 900 head records from 43 bores were selected as the head observations fig 1 the weighting of individual head observations depends on the distance between observation and prediction and the distance between observation and river boundary calculated as follows 9 o h j 1 m r j f w d j 1 n j i 1 n j h o i h s i 2 with o h the head objective function m the number of observation bores n j the number of observations at one specific observation bore j r j the distance of observation bore j to the nearest watercourse line network h o i the head observation and h s i the simulated equivalent f w d j is a distance weighting function as 10 f w d j 1 tanh d j d where d j is the distance inkm between observation bore j and the central location of the development field coefficient d controls the distance at which the weight of observation bore j drops to zero to account for transient observations the weights are divided by n j the number of observations at the observation location the tanh function allows the weight of an observation to decrease almost linearly with distance and to gradually become zero at a distance of approximately 3 d in the current study the value of d is set equal to 7 km which means that an observation has a weight of zero if the distance between the prediction and the observation is more than 21 km the threshold t h the upper limit of the head objective function is defined as 11 t h j 1 m r j f w d j 1 n j i 1 n j 2 2 this means that any parameter combination that results in an average difference between observed and simulated groundwater level less than or equal to 2 m is deemed acceptable 4 results 4 1 emulator performance within the operational constraints time and computational resources of the study 4000 parameter sets were uniformly sampled from the parameter ranges using the above mentioned maximin latin hypercube method the two objective functions were calculated for all the models in the doe these doe objective function values and their corresponding parameter values formed the training dataset for the two objective function lagp emulators for emulators to be applicable in bayesian inference they need to be sufficiently accurate as to ensure that the added uncertainty of replacing the original model with a surrogate is acceptably small the accuracy of emulators the degree to which emulators can reproduce the relationship between parameters and predictions depends greatly on the density of sampling of the parameter space liu 2005 a cross validation was conducted by portioning the doe samples into a training set and a test set 250 samples fig 5 provides a comparison between the modelled objective functions and the emulated ones based on the 250 test samples for both objective functions the absolute values of test errors are dependent on the magnitude of the objective functions the test errors of head objective functions fig 5a are more dynamic than the water production objective function fig 5b particularly for lower values the maximum test errors are around 30 of the simulated objective functions this means that an uncertainty of 30 of the objective functions can be caused by the emulating process although it is a subjective decision the authors argue that by using an emulator with this accuracy in the abc analysis the risk of wrongly accepting or rejecting a parameter combination is acceptable for regional groundwater modelling 4 2 posterior parameter distribution a posterior parameter distribution was generated through the generic rejection sampling algorithm under the abc framework as described in the method section during this monte carlo simulation random samples of the prior parameter distribution were generated only the samples that meet both the acceptance criteria are accepted as part of the posterior distribution this process was repeated until a predefined number of samples in this case 10 000 were accepted the green histograms in fig 6 show the resulting posterior parameter distributions based on two emulators of the objective functions some of the parameters are not constrained significantly by the objective functions and the posterior distribution for these is almost identical to the prior distributions the parameters for which the posterior distribution are significantly different to the prior distribution are the recharge multipliers of recharge zones 1 rch 1 the multiplier for the drainage conductance of the csg wells drn c 1 the multiplier for conductance of drain cells in the top layer drn c 2 and the hydraulic conductivity parameters for layers 2 3 4 and 6 kx 2 kx 3 d kx 4 kx 6 c and kx 6 d parameters related to the hydraulic properties of layer 5 the aquitard between the shallow aquifers and the targeted coal seam formation are only constrained slightly however these parameters particularly the vertical horizontal hydraulic conductivity ratio are expected to have a strong impact on the drawdown prediction in the shallow aquifer for most of these parameters under well constraining expect for kx 2 and kx 4 the posterior distribution are skewed to the upper or lower ends of the parameters this is different with the most widely used assumption of normal distribution in many formal bayesian analysis a bivariate plot fig 7 was also compiled to reveal the correlation between a set of 12 selected parameter the 12 parameters were selected because they are constrained to some extent by the two objective functions the drain conductance are positively correlated with recharge multipliers particularly rch 1 alluvium higher recharge can be counterbalanced by a higher drain conductance in the top layer the drain conductance of csg well cells needs to be lower when the hydraulic conductivity in layer 6 is high to meet the water production criterion when the hydraulic parameter of layer 2 kx 2 is close to the lower end and the hydraulic parameter of layer 3 kx 3 d cannot be close to the upper end the hydraulic properties of layers 3 and 4 are positively correlated 4 3 posterior prediction although various types of prediction can be made with the developed groundwater model in the current paper we focus only on additional drawdown due to the simulated csg development by evaluating the appropriate posterior parameter distribution generated in the previous step the predictive posterior distribution was generated by running the modflow model with 200 parameter sets from the posterior parameter distribution figs 8 and 9 provide two different visualizations of predictive posterior distributions fig 8 shows the probability of drawdown exceeding 0 2 m for predictions in layer 1 while fig 9 shows the 95th percentile of these distributions the 0 2 m threshold corresponds to an impact threshold in the nsw aquifer interference policy nsw dpi 2012 for impact on high priority groundwater dependent ecosystems the results show that there are only two noticeable areas where it is possible to have csg drawdown exceeding 0 2 m although the probability is all below 5 fig 8 one area is the central part of the proposed csg development field surrounded by alluvium the other one is a north south strip along the border between kangaroo creek sandstone and the maclean sandstone aquitard the low permeability of the maclean sandstone limits the spreading of the drawdown impact resulting in an accumulated water level change along the border the highest probability of exceeding 0 2 m drawdown is recorded in the top layer is 4 8 the 95th percentiles of additional drawdown are generally higher in the central part of the development field with a maximum of around 0 15 m fig 9 the impact becomes weaker gradually with increasing distance from the proposed csg development field as the probability map also suggested another high impact zone occurs along the border between the kangaroo creek sandstone and the mclean sandstone about 5 7 km west of the development area the impact extends more to the west as the targeted coal seam unit deepens towards to east the map also shows the mitigating effect of the major rivers on additional drawdown fig 9 fig 10 shows the time series of the additional drawdown evolution due to csg over the simulated period at two representative locations node 324 and node 1291 from the center and boundary of the csg development field fig 1 the two locations represent two domestic bores in layer 1 and layer 3 respectively although the csg bores were activated following the sample scheme from 2018 to 2036 the drawdown evolution shows different characteristics among different parameter sets for some parameter sets peak impact were observed over the simulation period from 1983 to 2102 on the other hand the drawdown impact is gradually increasing until the ending of the simulation for some posterior realizations for these parameter sets a longer modelling time is required to investigate the peak drawdown impact as a summary given the current parameterization and assumptions in the groundwater model it is very likely that the maximum additional drawdown is less than the 0 2 m threshold for the two locations 5 discussion 5 1 how many samples are enough for the training dataset the performance of emulators is largely determined by the density of sampling of the parameter space and the complexity of the response surfaces of the predictions of interest for the groundwater model in this study with tens of parameters 38 adjusted parameters and hours of runtimes 2 8 h the lagps can capture the major input output relationships of the modflow model based on a doe of 4000 samples the ratio between samples and the number of parameters is around 100 the emulator performance is validated by comparing the emulated outputs with the modelled outputs for the head and the csg water production objective functions however there should be caution in assuming that this ratio can be directly applied to other groundwater models emulator performance is model specific and prediction specific for models with more parameters and more complicated input output relationships a denser sampling is required when this occurs after performance validation adaptive sampling schemes gorissen et al 2010 shields et al 2015 can be considered in which samples are incrementally added to the doe until a predefined or optimal emulator accuracy is achieved as well as dimension reduction techniques a computational drawback of building a gp emulator is that the evaluation of the predictive distribution requires the inversion of and computing the determinant of an n by n covariance matrix operations whose complexity is o n3 in other words for large values of n constructing a gp emulator may become computationally prohibitive in the context of model emulation n is relevant to the number of model runs that were performed and used to train the emulator as the number of parameter in the process based model is increased the number of model runs required to support emulator training grows dramatically although lagps has potential to overcome this as pointed out in the reviews by razavi et al 2012 and asher et al 2015 other types of emulators may be better suited for problems with very high parameter dimensions such as polynomial chaos surrogates using adaptive sparse grids and project based emulators 5 2 other beneficial usage of the doe the sampling scheme for the doe results in an ensemble of model runs to train emulators this ensemble of model runs however have great potential to gain additional insight in the model and to identify structural or conceptual model issues for instance the same dataset can be used for a formal global sensitivity analysis such as delta moment sensitivity analysis as outlined by plischke et al 2013 peeters et al 2018 show how this kind of analysis can be used to identify parameters that can be constrained by the observations as well as parameters that the predictions are sensitive to this is a critical step in a data worth analysis to identify the observations that have the most potential to reduce predictive uncertainty these model runs can also be used to show the fraction of successful runs that meet the selected acceptance criteria to help identify deficit in the model conceptualization and parameterization 5 3 applications of emulators in groundwater management in the current effort emulators were trained for helping predict the change of hydrological variables as a result of csg development the impact is calculated from a model batch that includes a baseline model and a model with csg development the two models are essentially the same except for the csg development scheme advantages of emulators can be further gained when different types of models need to be coupled in a modeling framework that requires short runtimes and or a simplified model interface gorelick and zheng 2015 for example this may be the case where the output from a groundwater model need to be coupled with an ecological model to study the impact of new water management policies on ecosystems emulators can be trained to capture the relationship between all the inputs of the two models and the final predictions of interest directly then decision makers can experiment with the simpler emulators rather than the process based groundwater and ecological models that require more skills and effort emulators can also be used in agent based water resource management platforms to explore the behavioral interactions between different entities such as stakeholders environment and government castilla rho et al 2015 5 4 comments on abc the use of gp emulators with short runtimes made the simple rejection sampling scheme computationally tractable and allowed the generation of a posterior parameter distribution of 10 000 samples within hours more sophisticated sampling methods such as population monte carlo turner and van zandt 2012 and markov chain monte carlo mcmc as implemented in dream abc sadegh and vrugt 2014 are needed however if the abc scheme is to be used without emulators or with computationally more demanding surrogate approaches such as the multi fidelity surrogates used in doherty and christensen 2011 and burrows and doherty 2015 the abc methodology has similar theoretical drawbacks as the glue methodology mantovan and todini 2006 stedinger et al 2008 vrugt et al 2009 the choice of acceptance criteria is subjective and as a result the method does not strictly adhere to the probabilistic bayesian theory a great advantage however is that this explicit formulation of evaluation criteria and thresholds increases transparency it makes it much easier to formalize what modelers experts and stakeholder considers to be a good model in turn model confidence is increased as model evaluation criteria can be unambiguously and transparently documented 6 conclusions to conduct probabilistic assessment of the potential impact of coal seam gas depressurization in the clarence moreton basin on relevant groundwater systems emulator assisted approximate bayesian computation abc was conducted major conclusions that can be drawn from this study are given the current model conceptualization and simulated development scheme the water table change due to the west casino gas project in the richmond river catchment is unlikely exceeding 0 2 m the proposed strategy of using computationally efficient emulator surrogate models to calculate objective functions during model constraining allows the application of global calibration and uncertainty analysis to computationally demanding groundwater models the running time of the modflow model varies between 2 h and 8 h depending on the parameter values with an average of about 4 h without including the post processing time the running time of the lagp emulators is less than a minute abc does not only relax the need to explicitly define a likelihood function it also provides flexibility on objective function selection and diagnostic ability to model structure deficiency the application of abc is straightforward and its application in practical groundwater modeling should be encouraged although the application of emulators and bayesian inferences in practical groundwater modeling is still at its preliminary stage they have shown great potential more research is required to 1 compare the effectiveness and efficiency of the different model emulating algorithms 2 invent new model emulating algorithms particularly for that highly parameterized models hundreds to thousands of parameters and 3 develop well documented and user friendly software packages to further lower the barrier for the application of emulator enabled bayesian inference acknowledgments this research is part of the

and soil moisture active passive smap satellites by nasa spatio temporal interrelation between rainfall and soil moisture fields at different extents will be of great value for satellite product calibration validation and other hydrologic science investigations in this study we explored a non parametric evolutionary algorithm for prediction of soil moisture from a time series of spatially distributed rainfall across multiple weather locations under two different hydro climatic regions a new genetic algorithm based hidden markov model hmmga was developed to estimate long term soil moisture dynamics at different soil depths using precipitation data as a proxy also we tested transposability of our approach across time under different climatic conditions to test the new approach we selected two different soil moisture fields oklahoma 130 km 130 km and illinois 300 km 500 km during 1995 2009 and 1994 2010 respectively we found that the newly developed framework performed well in predicting soil moisture dynamics at different spatial extents although our approach has limitations in predicting daily values it estimates well the weekly soil moisture across the spatial and temporal domains with predictable uncertainties furthermore this approach could provide advantages for good transposability under different weather conditions compared to those of physically based hydrological models overall our suggested approach could predict weekly soil moisture estimates with precipitation and soil moisture histories and showed the potential of transposability under different weather and land surface conditions since the proposed algorithm requires only precipitation and historical soil moisture data from existing established weather stations it can serve an attractive alternative that can forecast soil moisture using climate change scenarios keywords hmmga precipitation optimal state sequences weather states rainfall occurrence probabilities soil moisture dynamics 1 introduction soil moisture is an important component of many hydro climatic processes accurate measurements of soil moisture are required for water resources management understanding rainfall and runoff processes irrigation scheduling water quality monitoring determining the partitioning of sensible and latent heat fluxes etc albergel et al 2008 barrett and petropoulos 2013 brocca et al 2011 in general in situ soil moisture measurements are assumed as fairly accurate observations but these point scale measurements may not be representative at field scales since remote sensing rs soil moisture retrievals have been developed and improved rs techniques are better suited for estimating near surface soil moisture with respect to spatial and temporal coverage across the world ines and mohanty 2008a b 2009 shin et al 2013 shin and mohanty 2013 mohanty et al 2017 the major concern regarding rs products is however the question of whether their resolution is too coarse to represent the scale at which hydrological processes occur engman 1991 entekhabi et al 1999 crow et al 2012 peng et al 2017 this indicates that rs data suffer on account of the scale discrepancy between observation rs and model resolution furthermore scaling down and up rs products requires the understanding of various complex stochastic and physical processes that can mimic a natural phenomenon such as the variability of land surface the terrestrial ecosystem atmospheric interactions etc for obtaining soil moisture dynamics various physically based hydrological models such as soil plant atmosphere water swap van dam et al 1997 community land model clm clm3 0 user s guide oleson et al 2004 variable infiltration capacity vic macroscale hydrologic model liang et al 1996 the u s department of agriculture hydrograph laboratory usdahl model holtan 1975 the sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma model peck 1976 among others were also developed besides the above mentioned deterministic models several other approaches have been developed for soil moisture estimations a sequential assimilation approach was developed mahfouf 1990 and improved bouttier et al 1993a b for soil moisture estimations from atmospheric temperature and relative humidity a genetic algorithm based assimilation scheme was developed for quantifying effective soil hydraulic properties based on inverse method im ines and mohanty 2008a b 2009 shin et al 2012 2013 shin and mohanty 2013 however these approaches could be limited by the number and complexity of required physical parameters in modeling especially various environmental conditions i e initial and bottom boundary conditions soil textures vegetation atmospheric forcings topography etc influence the performances of hydrological models this may indicate that predictive simulation outputs are dependent on model structures and user s modeling skills furthermore these hydrological models also have drawbacks in capturing model parameters that are suitable for both current calibration and projection validation conditions nazemi et al 2006 seiller et al 2012 dumedah et al 2012 common hydrological models usually assume that parameters estimated during calibration periods associated to hydro climatic conditions are applicable to validation periods under the assumption of the stationarity of rainfall runoff transformation this assumption is only valid when environmental weather conditions are not much different from calibration periods but in a climate change context contrasted weather conditions between calibration and validation periods may bring out the question of the stationarity hypothesis additionally a simple analytical approach pan et al 2003 based on a linear stochastic partial differential equation entekhabi and rodriguez iturbe 1994 has been developed for estimating surface soil moisture using precipitation data however this approach also requires land surface information for determining loss coefficient infiltration coefficient and averaging window size and provides only linear equation based surface soil moisture estimates during relatively short term periods few stochastic approaches e g hidden markov model hmm kirshner 2005 nonstationary hidden markov model nhmm robertson et al 2004 mehrotra and sharma 2005 kwon et al 2017 etc have been used to downscale satellite based products such as advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 jaxa 2013 soil moisture ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2012 soil moisture active passive smap das et al 2011 soil moisture tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm kummerow et al 1998 global precipitation measurement gpm hou et al 2014 etc to date no stochastic methods have been designed for forecasting long term soil moisture dynamics at the spatio temporal domains across the land surface using other proxies in this study we explored a non parametric evolutionary algorithm for forecasting long term weekly soil moisture dynamics at the near surface and deeper soil layers using a stochastic optimization approach on a multivariate time series of rainfall datasets obtained from a network of weather stations the objective of our study was to predict spatially and temporally distributed weekly soil moisture dynamics based on rainfall history and weather dry wet patterns using a newly developed genetic algorithm based hidden markov model hmmga and assess its transposability across time under different hydro climatic regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 conceptual multivariate framework in this study we developed a novel methodology for weekly soil moisture predictions at different study areas using multi site precipitation data the approach comprised of three steps i development of a hidden markov model using a genetic algorithm hmmga for estimating the optimal hidden state sequence representing weekly weather states using precipitation ii estimation of statistics mean and standard deviation of categorized soil moisture measurements based on the weather states and iii soil moisture predictions using the derived hidden weather states and statistics of categorized soil moisture history note that the weather states indicate the hidden states state 1 wet state 2 relatively wet state 3 relatively dry and state 4 dry conditions derived by hmmga the methodology is schematically shown in fig 1 stochastic approaches coupled with physically based hydrological models have been commonly used in hydrological predictions such as optimum interpolation based sequential assimilation technique for estimating soil moisture bouttier et al 1993a b genetic algorithm based near surface ines and mohanty 2008a b 2009 and layer specific shin et al 2012 soil moisture data assimilation among others however these coupled models are parameter intensive and are considerably influenced by the initial parameter values also these hydrological models have drawbacks in meeting the transposability for calibration and validation under contrasted weather conditions in order to address these limitations of existing schemes we developed a new algorithm by integrating a stochastic hidden markov model hmm with genetic algorithm the hypothesis of our proposed approach is that a hmm can provide better trained parameters for obtaining the hidden weather states through optimized initial parameters derived by a ga this coupling eliminates the need of using a parameter intensive physical model and minimizes not only user s skills in determining initial parameter values but also model structural i e parameterizations initial bottom boundary conditions governing equation transposability etc and measurement i e land covers soil information etc errors 2 1 1 hidden markov model hmm based on genetic algorithm in a regular markov model state transition probabilities are directly visible to the observer however as its name suggests a hidden markov model hmm has invisible or hidden state transition probabilities the notation of ot is the m multiple weather stations dimensional vector of measurements at time t and the notation of o1 t o1 ot is the sequential vectors of time length t the notation of s1 t s1 st is the corresponding sequential vectors of hidden weather states with each of the hidden states st t 1 t taking on one of the hidden states 1 to k note that k is the number of hidden states here the hidden state vector of st at time t is comprised of different weather states st s 1 k also the observed rainfall value of o t m 1 indicates rain on day t while o t m 0 means no rain on day t at the weather station m 1 m respectively a hmm can be defined as a joint distribution on a rainfall occurrence observation output and hidden state of rainfall along the time t based on two conditional independence assumptions hughes and guttorp 1999 robertson et al 2004 kirshner 2005 i in the first assumption the multivariate rainfall observations ot at time t are independent of all other variables across time t and conditional on the hidden weather state st at time t in eq 1 1 p o t s 1 t o 1 t 1 p o t s t ii in the second assumption the hidden weather state process s1 t is the first order markovian representing that markov process is homogeneous with the transition matrix of k k in time in eq 2 2 p s t s 1 t 1 p s t s t 1 in order to estimate p ot st we simplified the assumption that the rainfall observations across the weather stations m at time t are spatially independent and conditional on the hidden state robertson et al 2004 kirshner 2005 as 3 p o t o s t s m 1 m p o t m o s t s m 1 m p s o m 4 a ij p s t 1 s j s t s i 1 i j k j 1 k a ij 1 5 b j o p o t o s t s j 1 j k 0 o 1 o 0 1 b j o 1 where the rainfall occurrences at each weather station m were denoted as o p s o m means no rain for o 0 and rain for o 1 aij is the transition probability matrix on row state i and column state j and bj o is the output probability matrix note that bj o is the probability density function that o can be observed at state sj the readers are referred to rabiner 1989 macdonald and zucchini 1997 robertson et al 2004 and kirshner 2005 for a more detailed explanation of the hmm sequences of daily rainfall occurrences ot and hidden rainfall states st are shown in fig 2 a in this study a ga searches the optimized first initial hidden state parameters πi 1 k at the time t 1 on row state i and transition matrix ai 1 k j 1 k composed of parameters k πi ai j to be trained by a hmm because gas are powerful search algorithms for solving complex problems parameters through the survival of the fittest mechanism holland 1975 goldberg 1989 thus a hmm can train a set of parameters θ eq 6 for estimating the weather state conditions using the optimized initial hidden states k provided by a ga 6 θ b k a b π i where πt is the hidden state parameters at time t a is the transition probability matrix aij on row state i and column state j and bo 0 1 t is the output probability matrix bj o respectively the appropriate number of transition probabilities k 2 n are necessary to predict accurate rainfall occurrences it must be considered that a high n value will increase the number of elements in the transition matrix which is of size k k causing excessive repetitions of simulations there are no set guidelines for determining the optimum orders of k robertson et al 2004 tested the hmm with k ranging from 2 to 6 and suggested that four hidden states k 4 provide the most reasonable results furthermore increasing hidden states require more soil moisture measurements to obtain statistics of averages and standard deviations corresponding to each hidden states therefore we tested different orders of k 2 6 for selecting the optimum order k of hidden states which gives better results given the hidden states k the parameters θ of the hmm can be trained by searching for parameters that fit to the observed data for this purpose we employ the well known maximum likelihood l approach based on the baum welch algorithm i e rabiner 1989 as shown in eq 7 this approach maximizes the conditional probability of the parameters based on the observed data 7 l θ log p o θ log s 1 t p s 1 t 2 t p s t s t 1 t 1 t p o t s t the baum welch algorithm maximizes the log likelihood of l θ as a variant of an iterative expectation maximization em dempster et al 1977 robertson et al 2004 algorithm to obtain the maximum log likelihood parameter set for models with hidden state variables more details are referred to the appendix a robertson et al 2004 to compute the log likelihood of the data p o1 t s1 t the forward backward procedure rabiner 1989 was adopted as a recursive method the forward procedure means that the probabilities of hidden state st are calculated from the time from 1 to t and then the probabilities of hidden states st are calculated from the time of t to 1 as the backward procedure the maximization process is finished when the probabilities derived by forward and backward procedures are matched then the hidden state sequences can be obtained across the time t 1 t however the possible probabilities of obtained hidden states will be exponentially increased along the time step t 1 t because each hidden value s1 s2 or sk of st s1 sk at the time t has the possible probabilities up to k which will be transitioned to the next time t 1 for this reason we need to find the most likely optimal hidden state sequence representing the daily weather state for the observation at every time steps t 1 t thus our approach was integrated with the viterbi algorithm viterbi path viterbi 1967 to find the most likely hidden state sequence at every time steps in eq 9 the viterbi algorithm find the highest probability among the hidden states s1 s2 or sk at the time t and then the possible hidden state probabilities are calculated at the next time step t 1 thus the highest most likely hidden state sequence can be calculated across the time 1 to t as the forward procedure and then the viterbi algorithm calculates the highest hidden state sequence across the time t to 1 as the backward procedure when the most likely hidden state sequences obtained in the forward backward procedures are matched the most likely optimal hidden state sequence s1 st that can represent rainfall occurrences o1 ot can be determined through the joint distribution as 8 v 1 i p o 1 s 1 s i π i 9 v t j ma x 1 i k p o t s t s i a ij v t 1 i here vt is the most probable state sequence probabilities and st is the most likely optimal state sequence representing the daily weather state for the observation at time t as shown in fig 2b in the backward procedure the optimal state sequence can be retrieved by saving back pointers that remember which state st was used 10 s t ma x 1 i k v t i 11 s t s t 1 argma x 1 i k a ij v t i note that arg max meant the argument for selecting the maximum value in the given data sets i 2 k we tested the log likelihood values l 468 0 435 9 429 0 419 0 and 419 0 and correlations r 0 350 0 380 0 945 0 873 and 0 873 see section 2 3 between the observed rainfall occurrence probabilities and weather states derived by the hmmga for various orders of hidden states k 2 6 in the oklahoma domain see section 2 2 note that a log likelihood value closer to zero denotes better performance the log likelihood values considerably decreased from k 2 to k 5 but the decreasing trend from k 5 to k 6 was relatively gentle the correlation was highest at k 4 indicating that four hidden states can represent the weather states better than others as shown in the findings of robertson et al 2004 thus we selected the four hidden states k 4 for estimating weather states in this study it is assumed that four hidden states represent the weather wet state 1 relatively wet state 2 relatively dry state 3 and dry state 4 conditions respectively in this study a modified microga ines and honda 2005 ines and mohanty 2008a was used to search parameters k along the generations the parameters are composed of genes which are arranged in an array of binary values called a chromosome the modified microga is a ga variant that uses a micro population for searching parameters ines and droogers 2002 carroll et al 1996 goldberg 2002 krishnakumar 1989 it has the unique ability to restart when the searched chromosomes of the micro population are similar in structure 90 to each other before the generations are completed this improves the algorithm computationally and makes it more efficient restarting allows the modified microga to search the solutions in the global space in order to infuse new genes creep at the decimal level d l carroll fortran genetic algorithm ga driver available at www cuaerospace com carroll ga html and intermittent jump ines and mohanty 2008a mutations are implemented in the modified microga furthermore a time saving mechanism used in the ga remembers the elite fittest chromosome in the previous generation g 1 ines and honda 2005 then the elite chromosome is reproduced in the next generation g without computation note that the modified microga always reproduces the elite chromosome in the next generation the search spaces of variables and probabilities of selection crossover and mutation used in a ga for the different study domains are shown in table 1 2 1 2 categorizing soil moisture in this study hmmga predicted the weather states using only the observed rainfall occurrences however soil moisture values are usually affected by the precipitation as well as by the land surface conditions i e soil textures vegetation covers topography etc in different regions thus corresponding to the four hidden states fitted by hmmga in section 2 1 1 we classified historical soil moisture data into four categories k 4 ranging from wet to dry represented by 1 2 3 4 in order of weather states at each weather station using the k means clustering algorithm hartigan and wong 1979 based on the euclidean distance 12 d x y 1 w w 1 w x w y w 2 where d x y is the euclidean distance between two points of xw and yw on the order of w xw and yw are the soil moisture measurement on the order of w w is the running index and w is the total number of soil moisture measurements respectively initially the k means clustering algorithm assigns the soil moisture data randomly to a cluster this clustering approach repeats a two step process in the given number n 100 of runs as follows i the mean soil moisture data of individual cluster is estimated and ii the soil moisture data are reallocated to each cluster whose mean value is closest to the soil moisture data for more details on the popular k means clustering algorithm refer to jain et al 1999 in order to incorporate site specific soil moisture dynamics the clustering of soil moisture data was done for each weather station m separately then we calculated mean μ i 1 k m 1 m and standard deviation sd σ i 1 k m 1 m of the classified soil moisture measurements for each weather station the soil wetness ranges maximum and minimum for four weather state categories were determined based on clustered soil moisture measurements at individual weather station 2 1 3 prediction of soil moisture based on the derived optimal state sequences s1 st section 2 1 1 and estimated statistics μ i m and σ i m the section 2 1 2 of historical soil moisture data we generated normal distributions n μ i m σ i m 2 of soil moisture for each individual weather states along the time series casella and berger 2001 kwon et al 2017 the predicted daily soil moisture θ t m value was determined by randomly selecting a value from the generated normal distribution corresponding to the optimal state sequences selected by hmmga eq 13 note that the daily soil moisture predictions were averaged for deriving the weekly soil moisture values each optimal state value indicates the weather state st at time t note that the function of f returns the randomly generated soil moisture values for each weather station m along the time series t 13 θ t m f s t n μ i m σ i m 2 m t 2 2 study sites and data description since the proposed approach is sensitive to the domain size two domains of different extents were chosen to evaluate the applicability of this approach under two hydro climatic regions i the oklahoma domain 130 km 130 km with humid subtropical climate and ii the illinois domain 300 km 500 km with humid continental climate respectively for the oklahoma domain we selected the seven mesonet weather stations http www mesonet org index php such as site 1 elre silt loam site 2 spen sandy loam site 3 minc silt loam site 4 acme sandy loam site 5 wash loam site 6 paul silt loam and site 7 byar sandy loam in fig 3 a the weather stations have elevations in the range of 265 8 421 2 m above msl sites 1 3 and 4 in the west have higher elevations 404 3 421 2 m than those located in the east 265 6 349 5 m for the illinois domain we selected seven weather station sites from the international soil moisture network ismn http www ipf tuwien ac at insitu and illinois state water survey isws https www isws illinois edu in illinois such as site 1 bondville silt loam silty clay loam site 2 dekalb silty loam silty clay loam site 3 freeport silt loam site 4 monmouth silt loam site 5 olney silt loam site 6 orr center silt loam and site 7 peoria silt loam in fig 3b the weather stations located in the northern portion of this domain had slightly higher elevations the oklahoma and illinois areas generally have a flat topography the soils and vegetation vary across the oklahoma and illinois regions but the soil moisture observation were usually measured with native grass covers daily precipitation datasets were obtained from the oklahoma mesonet stations 1995 2009 in oklahoma and the ismn 1994 2010 in illinois during the crop growing season 90 days from march 1 to may 29 at the oklahoma sites daily soil temperature readings available from 2003 to 2009 measured by campbell scientific 229 l sensors were converted to 0 5 cm volumetric soil moisture with the empirical coefficients provided from the mesonet stations see details illston et al 2008 at the illinois locations biweekly volumetric soil moisture data at different soil depths 0 10 10 30 30 50 and 0 50 cm were measured from 1994 to 2004 using troxler neutron surface and depth probes by the illinois state water survey hollinger and isard 1994 note that soil moisture at 0 50 cm was obtained by averaging soil moisture measurements at the soil depths of 0 10 10 30 and 30 50 cm descriptive statistics mean standard deviation minimum and maximum of soil moisture measurements for the oklahoma and illinois sites were shown in table 2 and 3 precipitation data from the weather stations were available from 1995 to 2009 in oklahoma and 1994 2010 in illinois however the soil moisture data were measured for a shorter duration 2003 2009 for oklahoma and 1994 2004 for illinois the optimal hidden state sequences for both study domains were determined by the hmmga using the entire range of precipitation data available however in order to generate the normal distributions for the soil moisture we used only the estimated optimal state sequences from 2003 to 2009 for oklahoma and 1994 2004 for illinois the measurements used for the calibration were taken from 1994 to 2000 and the validation was conducted from 2001 to 2004 at the illinois sites 2 3 analysis method the challenge of this study is to model and predict the rainfall occurrence probabilities and soil moisture dynamics by using historical precipitation data and statistics of soil moisture measurements across the multiple locations sites 1 7 for the oklahoma and illinois domains in this study the spatial dependence of rainfall occurrence was analyzed during given time periods in different study domains to verify the accuracy of our suggested hmmga method we compared soil moisture predictions derived by this approach with those from a near surface soil moisture assimilation scheme based on inversion model im ines and mohanty 2008a in illinois the data assimilation scheme determined effective soil hydraulic properties α n θres θsat ksat by tuning a physical based hydrological soil water atmosphere plant swap model with a genetic algorithm see details in ines and mohanty 2008a here the soil hydraulic variables of α shape parameter equivalent to the inverse of the bubbling pressure n shape parameter that account for the pore size distribution θres residual soil moisture content θsat saturated soil moisture content and ksat saturated hydraulic conductivity indicates the mualem van genuchten parameters the soil moisture dynamics were estimated by the swap model van dam et al 1997 using the soil hydraulic parameters derived by ga then we tested the transposability of data assimilation scheme and hmmga for calibration and validation under different weather conditions from 1994 to 1996 at the bondville site in illinois in the proposed hmmga process we generated multiple realizations r using a re sampling technique efron 1982 for uncertainty analysis of weekly soil moisture dynamics also the multi populations from initial random seed numbers of 1000 950 and 750 were used for assessing uncertainties of the near surface soil moisture assimilation scheme the determination correlation r2 and root mean square error rmse cm3 cm 3 were used for evaluating uncertainties 14 r 2 1 w w 1 w x w x y w y 2 1 w w 1 w x w x 2 1 w w 1 w y w y 2 15 rmse w 1 w x w y w 2 w where r2 is the determination correlation x is the observed dataset and y is the simulated dataset 3 results and discussions fig 3 shows the observed rainfall occurrence probabilities across the multiple weather stations with the digital elevation models dems for the oklahoma 130 km 130 km and illinois 300 km 500 km domains the rainfall occurrence probabilities 0 31 0 36 in illinois were usually higher than those 0 26 0 29 in oklahoma overall the rainfall occurrences showed relatively small variations across the sites 1 7 in both domains the topographies of the two domains were relatively flat and thus the rainfall occurrences were not influenced as much by topography of the domains the observed rainfall occurrence probabilities at the weather stations in the oklahoma relatively smaller domain were correlated among the weather stations with r2 0 378 0 709 but the illinois domain had relatively lower correlations r2 0 050 0 350 between sites as shown in fig 4 it showed that spatial dependence of rainfall occurrences were significantly affected by the distance between the stations in other words the capability of hmm in simulating the multivariate time series of rainfall occurrences is influenced by dems how closely the weather stations are located across the spatial domain etc overall the statistics average and standard deviation of soil moisture measurements with sandy loam site 2 spen and site 4 acme and loam site 5 wash in the oklahoma region were relatively lower than those of other sites while the statistics of soil moisture measurements which have similar soil texture silt loam in the illinois region showed relatively less variations across the sites 1 7 the plots in fig 5 represent the performance maximum log likelihood of hmmga for the oklahoma and illinois domains the step wise improvements in searched solutions show that the log likelihood maximum fitness derived by the hmmga was instantly converged during the initial generation max 30 this result demonstrated that hmm can train the parameter set θ from eq 6 well through the optimized initial parameters by the ga 3 1 oklahoma domain the hidden weather state transition probabilities for the oklahoma domain 130 km 130 km are given in table 4 the rows i represent the present weather states state 1 wet state 2 relatively wet state 3 relatively dry and state 4 dry conditions at time t whereas the columns j represent the expected weather states at time t 1 given a wet condition at time t the probability of observing a wet condition at time t 1 is highest at 0 455 while the probability of transitioning to a dry state is 0 318 a relatively wet condition at time t also has the relatively high probabilities of observing wet 0 346 and dry conditions 0 375 at time t 1 whereas relatively dry and dry conditions at time t has the high transition probabilities with a dry condition 0 679 and 0 753 at time t 1 overall the weather state conditions at time t had the relatively higher transition probabilities with wet and dry conditions at time t 1 than those of the relatively wet and dry conditions it might indicate that moisture on the soil surface at these sites quickly run dry since the short term rainfall durations further the direct transitions between states 2 and 3 were rare which meant that states 2 and 3 play the role of intermediaries fig 6 shows the comparison of observed rainfall occurrence probabilities average over the study sites and optimal state sequences weather states derived by the hmmga during the simulation period 90 days from march 01 for each year during 1995 2009 overall the optimal state sequences had good match r2 0 894 with the observed rainfall occurrence probabilities along the time series this result showed that the derived sequences were capable of representing the weather state conditions in an identical way we tested the model performances of hmm only and hmmga using three different random number generators seeds 1000 2000 and 3000 in oklahoma as the hmmga based model outputs r2 0 611 0 894 showed the higher correlations than those r2 0 154 0 265 of hmm only note that the hmm based results were not shown in the text we confirmed that our approach could provide more reliable results fig 7 a g shows the comparison of yearly observed and simulated rainfall occurrence probabilities for the individual sites the yearly simulated probabilities matched with the observed datasets r2 0 119 0 457 and rmse 0 074 0 084 however when we compared the observed and predicted rainfall occurrence probabilities averaged for all years for the individual weather stations at the entire spatial domain fig 7h the results r2 0 615 and rmse 0 012 were highly correlated this implies that our proposed scheme could predict long term rainfall occurrences well at both the spatial and temporal scales especially better for the spatial domain similarly we predicted the time averaged 2003 2009 soil moisture 0 5 cm for the individual sites as shown in fig 8 the predicted soil moisture matched quite well with the measurements r2 0 997 and rmse 0 005 the observed and estimated soil moistures for the sites 2 4 5 and 7 were relatively lower than those of sites 1 3 and 6 when we compared the observed simulated rainfall occurrence probabilities with the soil moisture predictions the soil moisture estimates did not correspond to the rainfall patterns this supported that the soil moisture was affected by not only the weather conditions but also by the land surface conditions i e soil textures vegetation covers topography etc 3 2 illinois domain we tested the hmmga approach for the illinois domain 300 km 500 km the hidden state transition probabilities given in table 4 show slightly different behavior compared to the results of the oklahoma domain a wet condition at time t had relatively high probabilities of observing wet 0 377 and relatively dry 0 341 conditions at time t 1 a relatively wet condition at time t was evenly transitioned to other conditions 0 246 0 393 at time t 1 except of a relatively dry condition 0 067 given a relatively dry condition at time t the probabilities of observing relatively dry 0 358 and dry 0 360 conditions at time t 1 were higher than others but a dry condition at time t still had the highest self transition probability 0 649 at time t 1 overall the probabilities of observing a dry condition at time t 1 in illinois were lower than those of oklahoma indicating that the illinois sites had more rainfall events fig 9 exhibits the comparison of observed rainfall occurrence probabilities and estimated optimal state sequences the estimated optimal state sequences matched quite well r2 0 794 with the observed rainfall occurrence probabilities similar to the results of the oklahoma domain shown in fig 6 this result indicated that the hmmga performs well in predicting the optimal state sequences weather states for the illinois relatively larger domain also although more uncertainties exist in fig 10 a g the yearly predicted rainfall occurrence probabilities r2 0 006 0 215 and rmse 0 063 0 084 for the sites 1 7 derived by the hmmga were less identifiable with the observations than those r2 0 119 0 457 and rmse 0 074 0 084 of the oklahoma relatively smaller domain in fig 7a g especially for the sites 5 and 7 r2 0 010 and 0 006 rmse 0 084 and 0 077 it may indicate that the predictions were considerably influenced by the distance between the weather stations the time averaged probabilities r2 0 925 and rmse 0 006 for all years in the individual sites were fairly matched with the observations fig 10h at the spatial domain although the predicted rainfall probabilities were slightly underestimated in line with the results for the oklahoma domain it was found that the stochastic approach may be more robust in predicting rainfall occurrences across the entire spatial domain rather than predicting daily time series of rainfall occurrences at individual weather stations the statistics of rainfall predictions have some uncertainties in modeling for the illinois domain but overall the predicted results tend to be similar with the observations fig 11 shows the weekly 7 days measured and predicted soil moisture estimates cm3 cm 3 in the soil depth of 0 50 cm derived by our hmmga approach and also from the near surface soil moisture data assimilation scheme ines and mohanty 2008a at site 1 bondville in illinois for calibration 1994 and validation 1996 the model outputs for hmmga r2 0 699 and rmse 0 049 and physically based assimilation scheme r2 0 449 and rmse 0 028 matched the measurements for calibration in 1994 although the hmmga based results were slightly underestimated we tested the transposability of our hmmga approach and data assimilation scheme adapting the physically based swap model ines and mohanty 2008a across time for validation 1996 the results of physically based data assimilation scheme r2 0 023 and rmse 0 049 for validation 1996 had relatively more variations compared to those r2 0 688 and rmse 0 055 of hmmga it demonstrated that physically based hydrological models integrated with optimization schemes have limitations in reproducing soil moisture dynamics in the context of transposability with different weather conditions because the data assimilation scheme might be inclined to optimize the model input parameters under the specific weather and environmental conditions the hmmga based model outputs were also slightly underestimated compared to the measurements for both the calibration and validation periods but the results were consistent through the periods overall our approach had uncertainties limitations in predicting highest lowest state probabilities corresponding to extreme rainfall events along time these uncertainties might be common issues in stochastic approaches that need to be improved in future at least these results demonstrated that our approach can estimate the reliable weekly model outputs with predictable uncertainties and provide advantages for the good transposability under different weather conditions we predicted the time averaged 1994 2000 soil moisture at the near surface 0 10 cm and in the sub surface layers 10 30 30 50 and 0 50 cm at each of the weather stations fig 12 the predicted soil moistures r2 0 456 0 842 and rmse 0 024 0 041 at the various soil depths matched well with the measurements the near surface 0 10 cm soil moisture estimates were more variable than those of the sub surface layers mostly the predicted soil moisture values have uncertainties compared to the measurements especially for the sites 2 and 3 these uncertainties may be caused by the underestimations of predicted rainfall occurrence probabilities fig 10h fig 13 shows the calibration 1994 2000 and validation 2001 2004 results for soil moisture at the soil depth of 0 50 cm overall the predicted soil moisture estimates r2 0 240 and rmse 0 051 during the validation 2001 2004 period matched the observations with uncertainties compared to those r2 0 770 and rmse 0 040 for the calibration 1994 2000 while the soil moisture predictions of sites 2 and 3 for the validation have more bias especially for site 2 causing the relatively low correlation these findings are quite important in this study because our proposed methodology can provide an attractive alternative in forecasting long term soil moisture for the future using only climate change scenarios i e global climate models gcms regional climate models rcms etc and historical soil moisture measurements available in this regard this approach could be quite useful for developing improving efficient agricultural water resources management in the future generally the soil moisture predictions for the illinois domain had more uncertainties than those of the oklahoma relatively smaller domain transition probabilities estimated from rainfall occurrences across multiple locations might be influenced by spatial extents thus it is usual that hmmga based soil moisture predictions had more uncertainties at larger extents although the results for the illinois domain had more bias compared to the measurements the hmmga approach still predicted the soil moisture well at the temporal weekly and spatial scales with uncertainties the data assimilation scheme using the physical based hydrological swap model also has uncertainties i e due to the model structure parameter uncertainties measurement and user s modeling skill errors transposability etc when we considered these limitations mentioned above and complexity of applications our suggested approach can provide an easy application and minimize uncertainties for soil moisture predictions using only precipitation and historical soil moisture measurements existing in the real world conditions 4 conclusion in this study we developed a genetic algorithm based hidden markov model hmmga for predicting spatially and temporally distributed soil moisture using only precipitation and historical soil moisture measurements across multiple weather stations and tested the transposability of hmmga in time during calibration and validation under different weather conditions rainfall occurrence probabilities reproduced by hmmga were also analyzed hmmga was used to estimate most likely optimal hidden weather state sequences representing weather states comprised of the four hidden states wet relatively wet relatively dry and dry conditions based on precipitation history historical soil moisture data measured at different soil depths 0 5 0 10 10 30 30 50 and 0 50 cm were categorized based on the weather state conditions then statistics mean and standard deviation of categorized soil moisture data were determined using the hmmga based weather states and historical categorized soil moisture statistics soil moisture dynamics were estimated two different domains in oklahoma 1995 2009 130 km 130 km and illinois 1994 2010 300 km 500 km under different hydro climatic locations were selected for testing this approach hmmga estimated well the optimal hidden state sequences for the oklahoma r 2 0 894 and illinois r2 0 794 domains compared to the observed rainfall occurrence probabilities the yearly predicted rainfall occurrence probabilities at the individual weather stations for the oklahoma domain had a better match r2 0 119 0 457 and rmse 0 056 0 084 with observations but the illinois domain had more variations r2 0 006 0 251 and rmse 0 063 0 084 indicating that the hmmga processes are dependent on the distance between the weather stations the average rainfall occurrence predictions for all years across the individual sites matched the observations well r2 0 615 and rmse 0 012 for the oklahoma domain and r2 0 925 and rmse 0 006 for the illinois domain this result showed that hmmga provided better rainfall occurrence predictions across a spatial domain than daily rainfall occurrence predictions in time the averaged soil moisture dynamics for all seven years at the oklahoma domain matched almost perfectly r2 0 997 and rmse 0 005 with the measurements the weekly 7 days averaged model outputs r2 0 699 and rmse 0 049 for hmmga were more identifiable with the measured data in illinois although the hmmga based results were slightly underestimated compared to those r2 0 449 and rmse 0 028 of the data assimilation scheme however the data assimilation based validation r2 0 688 0 023 and rmse 0 055 0 049 for hmmga data assimilation results in 1996 had more uncertainties compared to those of calibration in 1994 although uncertainties exist these results demonstrated that the stochastic approach could provide relatively reliable model outputs at the weekly time intervals and relatively good transposability under different weather conditions also the average soil moisture dynamics at the different soil depths 0 10 10 30 30 50 and 0 50 cm performed fairly well r2 0 456 0 842 and rmse 0 024 0 041 compared to the measurements although uncertainties were evident in the predictions generally the soil moisture predictions had slightly different trends compared to the rainfall occurrence probabilities for both domains these findings showed that the predicted soil moisture estimates were influenced by not only the precipitation but also the land surface conditions e g topography soil textures vegetation covers etc thus this scheme which uses rainfall and historical soil moisture data performed relatively well in predicting soil moisture even though our stochastic based hmmga has limitations in capturing temporal dependence of soil moisture affected by the land surface conditions the results of calibration and validation supported the robustness of this approach in predicting the soil moisture dynamics at the multiple locations thus our approach can be used to predict soil moisture dynamics in the future using only climate change scenarios and soil moisture history existing currently our approach was only applied to the study areas which have the soil moisture history but hmmga can be also extended to various regions through continental global soil moisture database i e international soil moisture network ismn etc furthermore pixel scale soil moisture estimates can be obtained by combining satellite scale precipitation trmm gpm and soil moisture amsr e amsr2 smos smap etc products with our approach although uncertainties existing in rs data due to the discrepancy of spatio temporal scales short term rs precipitation and soil moisture data indicating less than 20 years scanned by satellites at the global scale etc might be included in satellite scale soil moisture estimates as the predicted results at the spatial domain matched quite well with the observations our approach can be also used for downscaling both remotely sensed precipitation robertson et al 2004 and soil moisture kwon et al 2017 products overall our findings support that our approach provides easy convenience avoiding intensive input parameters for physically based hydrological models in application to fields and minimizes not only user s skills in determining initial parameter values but also model structural i e parameterizations initial bottom boundary conditions governing equation transposability etc and measurement i e land covers soil information etc errors furthermore when we consider that the availability of rs soil moisture footprints are limited across forest regions our proposed scheme may provide an alternative in predicting soil moisture dynamics using trmm gpm with statistics of historical soil moisture at forest regions however hmmga still requires to be improved in predicting daily soil moisture this limitation might be resolved with increasing the number of hidden states under the assumption that long term daily soil moisture measurements are available in large areas thus the newly developed algorithm could be useful for

by p kitanidis editor in chief with the assistance of vahid nourani associate editor prediction of soil moisture is critical for water resources management with global precipitation measurement gpm and soil moisture active passive smap satellites by nasa spatio temporal interrelation between rainfall and soil moisture fields at different extents will be of great value for satellite product calibration validation and other hydrologic science investigations in this study we explored a non parametric evolutionary algorithm for prediction of soil moisture from a time series of spatially distributed rainfall across multiple weather locations under two different hydro climatic regions a new genetic algorithm based hidden markov model hmmga was developed to estimate long term soil moisture dynamics at different soil depths using precipitation data as a proxy also we tested transposability of our approach across time under different climatic conditions to test the new approach we selected two different soil moisture fields oklahoma 130 km 130 km and illinois 300 km 500 km during 1995 2009 and 1994 2010 respectively we found that the newly developed framework performed well in predicting soil moisture dynamics at different spatial extents although our approach has limitations in predicting daily values it estimates well the weekly soil moisture across the spatial and temporal domains with predictable uncertainties furthermore this approach could provide advantages for good transposability under different weather conditions compared to those of physically based hydrological models overall our suggested approach could predict weekly soil moisture estimates with precipitation and soil moisture histories and showed the potential of transposability under different weather and land surface conditions since the proposed algorithm requires only precipitation and historical soil moisture data from existing established weather stations it can serve an attractive alternative that can forecast soil moisture using climate change scenarios keywords hmmga precipitation optimal state sequences weather states rainfall occurrence probabilities soil moisture dynamics 1 introduction soil moisture is an important component of many hydro climatic processes accurate measurements of soil moisture are required for water resources management understanding rainfall and runoff processes irrigation scheduling water quality monitoring determining the partitioning of sensible and latent heat fluxes etc albergel et al 2008 barrett and petropoulos 2013 brocca et al 2011 in general in situ soil moisture measurements are assumed as fairly accurate observations but these point scale measurements may not be representative at field scales since remote sensing rs soil moisture retrievals have been developed and improved rs techniques are better suited for estimating near surface soil moisture with respect to spatial and temporal coverage across the world ines and mohanty 2008a b 2009 shin et al 2013 shin and mohanty 2013 mohanty et al 2017 the major concern regarding rs products is however the question of whether their resolution is too coarse to represent the scale at which hydrological processes occur engman 1991 entekhabi et al 1999 crow et al 2012 peng et al 2017 this indicates that rs data suffer on account of the scale discrepancy between observation rs and model resolution furthermore scaling down and up rs products requires the understanding of various complex stochastic and physical processes that can mimic a natural phenomenon such as the variability of land surface the terrestrial ecosystem atmospheric interactions etc for obtaining soil moisture dynamics various physically based hydrological models such as soil plant atmosphere water swap van dam et al 1997 community land model clm clm3 0 user s guide oleson et al 2004 variable infiltration capacity vic macroscale hydrologic model liang et al 1996 the u s department of agriculture hydrograph laboratory usdahl model holtan 1975 the sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma model peck 1976 among others were also developed besides the above mentioned deterministic models several other approaches have been developed for soil moisture estimations a sequential assimilation approach was developed mahfouf 1990 and improved bouttier et al 1993a b for soil moisture estimations from atmospheric temperature and relative humidity a genetic algorithm based assimilation scheme was developed for quantifying effective soil hydraulic properties based on inverse method im ines and mohanty 2008a b 2009 shin et al 2012 2013 shin and mohanty 2013 however these approaches could be limited by the number and complexity of required physical parameters in modeling especially various environmental conditions i e initial and bottom boundary conditions soil textures vegetation atmospheric forcings topography etc influence the performances of hydrological models this may indicate that predictive simulation outputs are dependent on model structures and user s modeling skills furthermore these hydrological models also have drawbacks in capturing model parameters that are suitable for both current calibration and projection validation conditions nazemi et al 2006 seiller et al 2012 dumedah et al 2012 common hydrological models usually assume that parameters estimated during calibration periods associated to hydro climatic conditions are applicable to validation periods under the assumption of the stationarity of rainfall runoff transformation this assumption is only valid when environmental weather conditions are not much different from calibration periods but in a climate change context contrasted weather conditions between calibration and validation periods may bring out the question of the stationarity hypothesis additionally a simple analytical approach pan et al 2003 based on a linear stochastic partial differential equation entekhabi and rodriguez iturbe 1994 has been developed for estimating surface soil moisture using precipitation data however this approach also requires land surface information for determining loss coefficient infiltration coefficient and averaging window size and provides only linear equation based surface soil moisture estimates during relatively short term periods few stochastic approaches e g hidden markov model hmm kirshner 2005 nonstationary hidden markov model nhmm robertson et al 2004 mehrotra and sharma 2005 kwon et al 2017 etc have been used to downscale satellite based products such as advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 jaxa 2013 soil moisture ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2012 soil moisture active passive smap das et al 2011 soil moisture tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm kummerow et al 1998 global precipitation measurement gpm hou et al 2014 etc to date no stochastic methods have been designed for forecasting long term soil moisture dynamics at the spatio temporal domains across the land surface using other proxies in this study we explored a non parametric evolutionary algorithm for forecasting long term weekly soil moisture dynamics at the near surface and deeper soil layers using a stochastic optimization approach on a multivariate time series of rainfall datasets obtained from a network of weather stations the objective of our study was to predict spatially and temporally distributed weekly soil moisture dynamics based on rainfall history and weather dry wet patterns using a newly developed genetic algorithm based hidden markov model hmmga and assess its transposability across time under different hydro climatic regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 conceptual multivariate framework in this study we developed a novel methodology for weekly soil moisture predictions at different study areas using multi site precipitation data the approach comprised of three steps i development of a hidden markov model using a genetic algorithm hmmga for estimating the optimal hidden state sequence representing weekly weather states using precipitation ii estimation of statistics mean and standard deviation of categorized soil moisture measurements based on the weather states and iii soil moisture predictions using the derived hidden weather states and statistics of categorized soil moisture history note that the weather states indicate the hidden states state 1 wet state 2 relatively wet state 3 relatively dry and state 4 dry conditions derived by hmmga the methodology is schematically shown in fig 1 stochastic approaches coupled with physically based hydrological models have been commonly used in hydrological predictions such as optimum interpolation based sequential assimilation technique for estimating soil moisture bouttier et al 1993a b genetic algorithm based near surface ines and mohanty 2008a b 2009 and layer specific shin et al 2012 soil moisture data assimilation among others however these coupled models are parameter intensive and are considerably influenced by the initial parameter values also these hydrological models have drawbacks in meeting the transposability for calibration and validation under contrasted weather conditions in order to address these limitations of existing schemes we developed a new algorithm by integrating a stochastic hidden markov model hmm with genetic algorithm the hypothesis of our proposed approach is that a hmm can provide better trained parameters for obtaining the hidden weather states through optimized initial parameters derived by a ga this coupling eliminates the need of using a parameter intensive physical model and minimizes not only user s skills in determining initial parameter values but also model structural i e parameterizations initial bottom boundary conditions governing equation transposability etc and measurement i e land covers soil information etc errors 2 1 1 hidden markov model hmm based on genetic algorithm in a regular markov model state transition probabilities are directly visible to the observer however as its name suggests a hidden markov model hmm has invisible or hidden state transition probabilities the notation of ot is the m multiple weather stations dimensional vector of measurements at time t and the notation of o1 t o1 ot is the sequential vectors of time length t the notation of s1 t s1 st is the corresponding sequential vectors of hidden weather states with each of the hidden states st t 1 t taking on one of the hidden states 1 to k note that k is the number of hidden states here the hidden state vector of st at time t is comprised of different weather states st s 1 k also the observed rainfall value of o t m 1 indicates rain on day t while o t m 0 means no rain on day t at the weather station m 1 m respectively a hmm can be defined as a joint distribution on a rainfall occurrence observation output and hidden state of rainfall along the time t based on two conditional independence assumptions hughes and guttorp 1999 robertson et al 2004 kirshner 2005 i in the first assumption the multivariate rainfall observations ot at time t are independent of all other variables across time t and conditional on the hidden weather state st at time t in eq 1 1 p o t s 1 t o 1 t 1 p o t s t ii in the second assumption the hidden weather state process s1 t is the first order markovian representing that markov process is homogeneous with the transition matrix of k k in time in eq 2 2 p s t s 1 t 1 p s t s t 1 in order to estimate p ot st we simplified the assumption that the rainfall observations across the weather stations m at time t are spatially independent and conditional on the hidden state robertson et al 2004 kirshner 2005 as 3 p o t o s t s m 1 m p o t m o s t s m 1 m p s o m 4 a ij p s t 1 s j s t s i 1 i j k j 1 k a ij 1 5 b j o p o t o s t s j 1 j k 0 o 1 o 0 1 b j o 1 where the rainfall occurrences at each weather station m were denoted as o p s o m means no rain for o 0 and rain for o 1 aij is the transition probability matrix on row state i and column state j and bj o is the output probability matrix note that bj o is the probability density function that o can be observed at state sj the readers are referred to rabiner 1989 macdonald and zucchini 1997 robertson et al 2004 and kirshner 2005 for a more detailed explanation of the hmm sequences of daily rainfall occurrences ot and hidden rainfall states st are shown in fig 2 a in this study a ga searches the optimized first initial hidden state parameters πi 1 k at the time t 1 on row state i and transition matrix ai 1 k j 1 k composed of parameters k πi ai j to be trained by a hmm because gas are powerful search algorithms for solving complex problems parameters through the survival of the fittest mechanism holland 1975 goldberg 1989 thus a hmm can train a set of parameters θ eq 6 for estimating the weather state conditions using the optimized initial hidden states k provided by a ga 6 θ b k a b π i where πt is the hidden state parameters at time t a is the transition probability matrix aij on row state i and column state j and bo 0 1 t is the output probability matrix bj o respectively the appropriate number of transition probabilities k 2 n are necessary to predict accurate rainfall occurrences it must be considered that a high n value will increase the number of elements in the transition matrix which is of size k k causing excessive repetitions of simulations there are no set guidelines for determining the optimum orders of k robertson et al 2004 tested the hmm with k ranging from 2 to 6 and suggested that four hidden states k 4 provide the most reasonable results furthermore increasing hidden states require more soil moisture measurements to obtain statistics of averages and standard deviations corresponding to each hidden states therefore we tested different orders of k 2 6 for selecting the optimum order k of hidden states which gives better results given the hidden states k the parameters θ of the hmm can be trained by searching for parameters that fit to the observed data for this purpose we employ the well known maximum likelihood l approach based on the baum welch algorithm i e rabiner 1989 as shown in eq 7 this approach maximizes the conditional probability of the parameters based on the observed data 7 l θ log p o θ log s 1 t p s 1 t 2 t p s t s t 1 t 1 t p o t s t the baum welch algorithm maximizes the log likelihood of l θ as a variant of an iterative expectation maximization em dempster et al 1977 robertson et al 2004 algorithm to obtain the maximum log likelihood parameter set for models with hidden state variables more details are referred to the appendix a robertson et al 2004 to compute the log likelihood of the data p o1 t s1 t the forward backward procedure rabiner 1989 was adopted as a recursive method the forward procedure means that the probabilities of hidden state st are calculated from the time from 1 to t and then the probabilities of hidden states st are calculated from the time of t to 1 as the backward procedure the maximization process is finished when the probabilities derived by forward and backward procedures are matched then the hidden state sequences can be obtained across the time t 1 t however the possible probabilities of obtained hidden states will be exponentially increased along the time step t 1 t because each hidden value s1 s2 or sk of st s1 sk at the time t has the possible probabilities up to k which will be transitioned to the next time t 1 for this reason we need to find the most likely optimal hidden state sequence representing the daily weather state for the observation at every time steps t 1 t thus our approach was integrated with the viterbi algorithm viterbi path viterbi 1967 to find the most likely hidden state sequence at every time steps in eq 9 the viterbi algorithm find the highest probability among the hidden states s1 s2 or sk at the time t and then the possible hidden state probabilities are calculated at the next time step t 1 thus the highest most likely hidden state sequence can be calculated across the time 1 to t as the forward procedure and then the viterbi algorithm calculates the highest hidden state sequence across the time t to 1 as the backward procedure when the most likely hidden state sequences obtained in the forward backward procedures are matched the most likely optimal hidden state sequence s1 st that can represent rainfall occurrences o1 ot can be determined through the joint distribution as 8 v 1 i p o 1 s 1 s i π i 9 v t j ma x 1 i k p o t s t s i a ij v t 1 i here vt is the most probable state sequence probabilities and st is the most likely optimal state sequence representing the daily weather state for the observation at time t as shown in fig 2b in the backward procedure the optimal state sequence can be retrieved by saving back pointers that remember which state st was used 10 s t ma x 1 i k v t i 11 s t s t 1 argma x 1 i k a ij v t i note that arg max meant the argument for selecting the maximum value in the given data sets i 2 k we tested the log likelihood values l 468 0 435 9 429 0 419 0 and 419 0 and correlations r 0 350 0 380 0 945 0 873 and 0 873 see section 2 3 between the observed rainfall occurrence probabilities and weather states derived by the hmmga for various orders of hidden states k 2 6 in the oklahoma domain see section 2 2 note that a log likelihood value closer to zero denotes better performance the log likelihood values considerably decreased from k 2 to k 5 but the decreasing trend from k 5 to k 6 was relatively gentle the correlation was highest at k 4 indicating that four hidden states can represent the weather states better than others as shown in the findings of robertson et al 2004 thus we selected the four hidden states k 4 for estimating weather states in this study it is assumed that four hidden states represent the weather wet state 1 relatively wet state 2 relatively dry state 3 and dry state 4 conditions respectively in this study a modified microga ines and honda 2005 ines and mohanty 2008a was used to search parameters k along the generations the parameters are composed of genes which are arranged in an array of binary values called a chromosome the modified microga is a ga variant that uses a micro population for searching parameters ines and droogers 2002 carroll et al 1996 goldberg 2002 krishnakumar 1989 it has the unique ability to restart when the searched chromosomes of the micro population are similar in structure 90 to each other before the generations are completed this improves the algorithm computationally and makes it more efficient restarting allows the modified microga to search the solutions in the global space in order to infuse new genes creep at the decimal level d l carroll fortran genetic algorithm ga driver available at www cuaerospace com carroll ga html and intermittent jump ines and mohanty 2008a mutations are implemented in the modified microga furthermore a time saving mechanism used in the ga remembers the elite fittest chromosome in the previous generation g 1 ines and honda 2005 then the elite chromosome is reproduced in the next generation g without computation note that the modified microga always reproduces the elite chromosome in the next generation the search spaces of variables and probabilities of selection crossover and mutation used in a ga for the different study domains are shown in table 1 2 1 2 categorizing soil moisture in this study hmmga predicted the weather states using only the observed rainfall occurrences however soil moisture values are usually affected by the precipitation as well as by the land surface conditions i e soil textures vegetation covers topography etc in different regions thus corresponding to the four hidden states fitted by hmmga in section 2 1 1 we classified historical soil moisture data into four categories k 4 ranging from wet to dry represented by 1 2 3 4 in order of weather states at each weather station using the k means clustering algorithm hartigan and wong 1979 based on the euclidean distance 12 d x y 1 w w 1 w x w y w 2 where d x y is the euclidean distance between two points of xw and yw on the order of w xw and yw are the soil moisture measurement on the order of w w is the running index and w is the total number of soil moisture measurements respectively initially the k means clustering algorithm assigns the soil moisture data randomly to a cluster this clustering approach repeats a two step process in the given number n 100 of runs as follows i the mean soil moisture data of individual cluster is estimated and ii the soil moisture data are reallocated to each cluster whose mean value is closest to the soil moisture data for more details on the popular k means clustering algorithm refer to jain et al 1999 in order to incorporate site specific soil moisture dynamics the clustering of soil moisture data was done for each weather station m separately then we calculated mean μ i 1 k m 1 m and standard deviation sd σ i 1 k m 1 m of the classified soil moisture measurements for each weather station the soil wetness ranges maximum and minimum for four weather state categories were determined based on clustered soil moisture measurements at individual weather station 2 1 3 prediction of soil moisture based on the derived optimal state sequences s1 st section 2 1 1 and estimated statistics μ i m and σ i m the section 2 1 2 of historical soil moisture data we generated normal distributions n μ i m σ i m 2 of soil moisture for each individual weather states along the time series casella and berger 2001 kwon et al 2017 the predicted daily soil moisture θ t m value was determined by randomly selecting a value from the generated normal distribution corresponding to the optimal state sequences selected by hmmga eq 13 note that the daily soil moisture predictions were averaged for deriving the weekly soil moisture values each optimal state value indicates the weather state st at time t note that the function of f returns the randomly generated soil moisture values for each weather station m along the time series t 13 θ t m f s t n μ i m σ i m 2 m t 2 2 study sites and data description since the proposed approach is sensitive to the domain size two domains of different extents were chosen to evaluate the applicability of this approach under two hydro climatic regions i the oklahoma domain 130 km 130 km with humid subtropical climate and ii the illinois domain 300 km 500 km with humid continental climate respectively for the oklahoma domain we selected the seven mesonet weather stations http www mesonet org index php such as site 1 elre silt loam site 2 spen sandy loam site 3 minc silt loam site 4 acme sandy loam site 5 wash loam site 6 paul silt loam and site 7 byar sandy loam in fig 3 a the weather stations have elevations in the range of 265 8 421 2 m above msl sites 1 3 and 4 in the west have higher elevations 404 3 421 2 m than those located in the east 265 6 349 5 m for the illinois domain we selected seven weather station sites from the international soil moisture network ismn http www ipf tuwien ac at insitu and illinois state water survey isws https www isws illinois edu in illinois such as site 1 bondville silt loam silty clay loam site 2 dekalb silty loam silty clay loam site 3 freeport silt loam site 4 monmouth silt loam site 5 olney silt loam site 6 orr center silt loam and site 7 peoria silt loam in fig 3b the weather stations located in the northern portion of this domain had slightly higher elevations the oklahoma and illinois areas generally have a flat topography the soils and vegetation vary across the oklahoma and illinois regions but the soil moisture observation were usually measured with native grass covers daily precipitation datasets were obtained from the oklahoma mesonet stations 1995 2009 in oklahoma and the ismn 1994 2010 in illinois during the crop growing season 90 days from march 1 to may 29 at the oklahoma sites daily soil temperature readings available from 2003 to 2009 measured by campbell scientific 229 l sensors were converted to 0 5 cm volumetric soil moisture with the empirical coefficients provided from the mesonet stations see details illston et al 2008 at the illinois locations biweekly volumetric soil moisture data at different soil depths 0 10 10 30 30 50 and 0 50 cm were measured from 1994 to 2004 using troxler neutron surface and depth probes by the illinois state water survey hollinger and isard 1994 note that soil moisture at 0 50 cm was obtained by averaging soil moisture measurements at the soil depths of 0 10 10 30 and 30 50 cm descriptive statistics mean standard deviation minimum and maximum of soil moisture measurements for the oklahoma and illinois sites were shown in table 2 and 3 precipitation data from the weather stations were available from 1995 to 2009 in oklahoma and 1994 2010 in illinois however the soil moisture data were measured for a shorter duration 2003 2009 for oklahoma and 1994 2004 for illinois the optimal hidden state sequences for both study domains were determined by the hmmga using the entire range of precipitation data available however in order to generate the normal distributions for the soil moisture we used only the estimated optimal state sequences from 2003 to 2009 for oklahoma and 1994 2004 for illinois the measurements used for the calibration were taken from 1994 to 2000 and the validation was conducted from 2001 to 2004 at the illinois sites 2 3 analysis method the challenge of this study is to model and predict the rainfall occurrence probabilities and soil moisture dynamics by using historical precipitation data and statistics of soil moisture measurements across the multiple locations sites 1 7 for the oklahoma and illinois domains in this study the spatial dependence of rainfall occurrence was analyzed during given time periods in different study domains to verify the accuracy of our suggested hmmga method we compared soil moisture predictions derived by this approach with those from a near surface soil moisture assimilation scheme based on inversion model im ines and mohanty 2008a in illinois the data assimilation scheme determined effective soil hydraulic properties α n θres θsat ksat by tuning a physical based hydrological soil water atmosphere plant swap model with a genetic algorithm see details in ines and mohanty 2008a here the soil hydraulic variables of α shape parameter equivalent to the inverse of the bubbling pressure n shape parameter that account for the pore size distribution θres residual soil moisture content θsat saturated soil moisture content and ksat saturated hydraulic conductivity indicates the mualem van genuchten parameters the soil moisture dynamics were estimated by the swap model van dam et al 1997 using the soil hydraulic parameters derived by ga then we tested the transposability of data assimilation scheme and hmmga for calibration and validation under different weather conditions from 1994 to 1996 at the bondville site in illinois in the proposed hmmga process we generated multiple realizations r using a re sampling technique efron 1982 for uncertainty analysis of weekly soil moisture dynamics also the multi populations from initial random seed numbers of 1000 950 and 750 were used for assessing uncertainties of the near surface soil moisture assimilation scheme the determination correlation r2 and root mean square error rmse cm3 cm 3 were used for evaluating uncertainties 14 r 2 1 w w 1 w x w x y w y 2 1 w w 1 w x w x 2 1 w w 1 w y w y 2 15 rmse w 1 w x w y w 2 w where r2 is the determination correlation x is the observed dataset and y is the simulated dataset 3 results and discussions fig 3 shows the observed rainfall occurrence probabilities across the multiple weather stations with the digital elevation models dems for the oklahoma 130 km 130 km and illinois 300 km 500 km domains the rainfall occurrence probabilities 0 31 0 36 in illinois were usually higher than those 0 26 0 29 in oklahoma overall the rainfall occurrences showed relatively small variations across the sites 1 7 in both domains the topographies of the two domains were relatively flat and thus the rainfall occurrences were not influenced as much by topography of the domains the observed rainfall occurrence probabilities at the weather stations in the oklahoma relatively smaller domain were correlated among the weather stations with r2 0 378 0 709 but the illinois domain had relatively lower correlations r2 0 050 0 350 between sites as shown in fig 4 it showed that spatial dependence of rainfall occurrences were significantly affected by the distance between the stations in other words the capability of hmm in simulating the multivariate time series of rainfall occurrences is influenced by dems how closely the weather stations are located across the spatial domain etc overall the statistics average and standard deviation of soil moisture measurements with sandy loam site 2 spen and site 4 acme and loam site 5 wash in the oklahoma region were relatively lower than those of other sites while the statistics of soil moisture measurements which have similar soil texture silt loam in the illinois region showed relatively less variations across the sites 1 7 the plots in fig 5 represent the performance maximum log likelihood of hmmga for the oklahoma and illinois domains the step wise improvements in searched solutions show that the log likelihood maximum fitness derived by the hmmga was instantly converged during the initial generation max 30 this result demonstrated that hmm can train the parameter set θ from eq 6 well through the optimized initial parameters by the ga 3 1 oklahoma domain the hidden weather state transition probabilities for the oklahoma domain 130 km 130 km are given in table 4 the rows i represent the present weather states state 1 wet state 2 relatively wet state 3 relatively dry and state 4 dry conditions at time t whereas the columns j represent the expected weather states at time t 1 given a wet condition at time t the probability of observing a wet condition at time t 1 is highest at 0 455 while the probability of transitioning to a dry state is 0 318 a relatively wet condition at time t also has the relatively high probabilities of observing wet 0 346 and dry conditions 0 375 at time t 1 whereas relatively dry and dry conditions at time t has the high transition probabilities with a dry condition 0 679 and 0 753 at time t 1 overall the weather state conditions at time t had the relatively higher transition probabilities with wet and dry conditions at time t 1 than those of the relatively wet and dry conditions it might indicate that moisture on the soil surface at these sites quickly run dry since the short term rainfall durations further the direct transitions between states 2 and 3 were rare which meant that states 2 and 3 play the role of intermediaries fig 6 shows the comparison of observed rainfall occurrence probabilities average over the study sites and optimal state sequences weather states derived by the hmmga during the simulation period 90 days from march 01 for each year during 1995 2009 overall the optimal state sequences had good match r2 0 894 with the observed rainfall occurrence probabilities along the time series this result showed that the derived sequences were capable of representing the weather state conditions in an identical way we tested the model performances of hmm only and hmmga using three different random number generators seeds 1000 2000 and 3000 in oklahoma as the hmmga based model outputs r2 0 611 0 894 showed the higher correlations than those r2 0 154 0 265 of hmm only note that the hmm based results were not shown in the text we confirmed that our approach could provide more reliable results fig 7 a g shows the comparison of yearly observed and simulated rainfall occurrence probabilities for the individual sites the yearly simulated probabilities matched with the observed datasets r2 0 119 0 457 and rmse 0 074 0 084 however when we compared the observed and predicted rainfall occurrence probabilities averaged for all years for the individual weather stations at the entire spatial domain fig 7h the results r2 0 615 and rmse 0 012 were highly correlated this implies that our proposed scheme could predict long term rainfall occurrences well at both the spatial and temporal scales especially better for the spatial domain similarly we predicted the time averaged 2003 2009 soil moisture 0 5 cm for the individual sites as shown in fig 8 the predicted soil moisture matched quite well with the measurements r2 0 997 and rmse 0 005 the observed and estimated soil moistures for the sites 2 4 5 and 7 were relatively lower than those of sites 1 3 and 6 when we compared the observed simulated rainfall occurrence probabilities with the soil moisture predictions the soil moisture estimates did not correspond to the rainfall patterns this supported that the soil moisture was affected by not only the weather conditions but also by the land surface conditions i e soil textures vegetation covers topography etc 3 2 illinois domain we tested the hmmga approach for the illinois domain 300 km 500 km the hidden state transition probabilities given in table 4 show slightly different behavior compared to the results of the oklahoma domain a wet condition at time t had relatively high probabilities of observing wet 0 377 and relatively dry 0 341 conditions at time t 1 a relatively wet condition at time t was evenly transitioned to other conditions 0 246 0 393 at time t 1 except of a relatively dry condition 0 067 given a relatively dry condition at time t the probabilities of observing relatively dry 0 358 and dry 0 360 conditions at time t 1 were higher than others but a dry condition at time t still had the highest self transition probability 0 649 at time t 1 overall the probabilities of observing a dry condition at time t 1 in illinois were lower than those of oklahoma indicating that the illinois sites had more rainfall events fig 9 exhibits the comparison of observed rainfall occurrence probabilities and estimated optimal state sequences the estimated optimal state sequences matched quite well r2 0 794 with the observed rainfall occurrence probabilities similar to the results of the oklahoma domain shown in fig 6 this result indicated that the hmmga performs well in predicting the optimal state sequences weather states for the illinois relatively larger domain also although more uncertainties exist in fig 10 a g the yearly predicted rainfall occurrence probabilities r2 0 006 0 215 and rmse 0 063 0 084 for the sites 1 7 derived by the hmmga were less identifiable with the observations than those r2 0 119 0 457 and rmse 0 074 0 084 of the oklahoma relatively smaller domain in fig 7a g especially for the sites 5 and 7 r2 0 010 and 0 006 rmse 0 084 and 0 077 it may indicate that the predictions were considerably influenced by the distance between the weather stations the time averaged probabilities r2 0 925 and rmse 0 006 for all years in the individual sites were fairly matched with the observations fig 10h at the spatial domain although the predicted rainfall probabilities were slightly underestimated in line with the results for the oklahoma domain it was found that the stochastic approach may be more robust in predicting rainfall occurrences across the entire spatial domain rather than predicting daily time series of rainfall occurrences at individual weather stations the statistics of rainfall predictions have some uncertainties in modeling for the illinois domain but overall the predicted results tend to be similar with the observations fig 11 shows the weekly 7 days measured and predicted soil moisture estimates cm3 cm 3 in the soil depth of 0 50 cm derived by our hmmga approach and also from the near surface soil moisture data assimilation scheme ines and mohanty 2008a at site 1 bondville in illinois for calibration 1994 and validation 1996 the model outputs for hmmga r2 0 699 and rmse 0 049 and physically based assimilation scheme r2 0 449 and rmse 0 028 matched the measurements for calibration in 1994 although the hmmga based results were slightly underestimated we tested the transposability of our hmmga approach and data assimilation scheme adapting the physically based swap model ines and mohanty 2008a across time for validation 1996 the results of physically based data assimilation scheme r2 0 023 and rmse 0 049 for validation 1996 had relatively more variations compared to those r2 0 688 and rmse 0 055 of hmmga it demonstrated that physically based hydrological models integrated with optimization schemes have limitations in reproducing soil moisture dynamics in the context of transposability with different weather conditions because the data assimilation scheme might be inclined to optimize the model input parameters under the specific weather and environmental conditions the hmmga based model outputs were also slightly underestimated compared to the measurements for both the calibration and validation periods but the results were consistent through the periods overall our approach had uncertainties limitations in predicting highest lowest state probabilities corresponding to extreme rainfall events along time these uncertainties might be common issues in stochastic approaches that need to be improved in future at least these results demonstrated that our approach can estimate the reliable weekly model outputs with predictable uncertainties and provide advantages for the good transposability under different weather conditions we predicted the time averaged 1994 2000 soil moisture at the near surface 0 10 cm and in the sub surface layers 10 30 30 50 and 0 50 cm at each of the weather stations fig 12 the predicted soil moistures r2 0 456 0 842 and rmse 0 024 0 041 at the various soil depths matched well with the measurements the near surface 0 10 cm soil moisture estimates were more variable than those of the sub surface layers mostly the predicted soil moisture values have uncertainties compared to the measurements especially for the sites 2 and 3 these uncertainties may be caused by the underestimations of predicted rainfall occurrence probabilities fig 10h fig 13 shows the calibration 1994 2000 and validation 2001 2004 results for soil moisture at the soil depth of 0 50 cm overall the predicted soil moisture estimates r2 0 240 and rmse 0 051 during the validation 2001 2004 period matched the observations with uncertainties compared to those r2 0 770 and rmse 0 040 for the calibration 1994 2000 while the soil moisture predictions of sites 2 and 3 for the validation have more bias especially for site 2 causing the relatively low correlation these findings are quite important in this study because our proposed methodology can provide an attractive alternative in forecasting long term soil moisture for the future using only climate change scenarios i e global climate models gcms regional climate models rcms etc and historical soil moisture measurements available in this regard this approach could be quite useful for developing improving efficient agricultural water resources management in the future generally the soil moisture predictions for the illinois domain had more uncertainties than those of the oklahoma relatively smaller domain transition probabilities estimated from rainfall occurrences across multiple locations might be influenced by spatial extents thus it is usual that hmmga based soil moisture predictions had more uncertainties at larger extents although the results for the illinois domain had more bias compared to the measurements the hmmga approach still predicted the soil moisture well at the temporal weekly and spatial scales with uncertainties the data assimilation scheme using the physical based hydrological swap model also has uncertainties i e due to the model structure parameter uncertainties measurement and user s modeling skill errors transposability etc when we considered these limitations mentioned above and complexity of applications our suggested approach can provide an easy application and minimize uncertainties for soil moisture predictions using only precipitation and historical soil moisture measurements existing in the real world conditions 4 conclusion in this study we developed a genetic algorithm based hidden markov model hmmga for predicting spatially and temporally distributed soil moisture using only precipitation and historical soil moisture measurements across multiple weather stations and tested the transposability of hmmga in time during calibration and validation under different weather conditions rainfall occurrence probabilities reproduced by hmmga were also analyzed hmmga was used to estimate most likely optimal hidden weather state sequences representing weather states comprised of the four hidden states wet relatively wet relatively dry and dry conditions based on precipitation history historical soil moisture data measured at different soil depths 0 5 0 10 10 30 30 50 and 0 50 cm were categorized based on the weather state conditions then statistics mean and standard deviation of categorized soil moisture data were determined using the hmmga based weather states and historical categorized soil moisture statistics soil moisture dynamics were estimated two different domains in oklahoma 1995 2009 130 km 130 km and illinois 1994 2010 300 km 500 km under different hydro climatic locations were selected for testing this approach hmmga estimated well the optimal hidden state sequences for the oklahoma r 2 0 894 and illinois r2 0 794 domains compared to the observed rainfall occurrence probabilities the yearly predicted rainfall occurrence probabilities at the individual weather stations for the oklahoma domain had a better match r2 0 119 0 457 and rmse 0 056 0 084 with observations but the illinois domain had more variations r2 0 006 0 251 and rmse 0 063 0 084 indicating that the hmmga processes are dependent on the distance between the weather stations the average rainfall occurrence predictions for all years across the individual sites matched the observations well r2 0 615 and rmse 0 012 for the oklahoma domain and r2 0 925 and rmse 0 006 for the illinois domain this result showed that hmmga provided better rainfall occurrence predictions across a spatial domain than daily rainfall occurrence predictions in time the averaged soil moisture dynamics for all seven years at the oklahoma domain matched almost perfectly r2 0 997 and rmse 0 005 with the measurements the weekly 7 days averaged model outputs r2 0 699 and rmse 0 049 for hmmga were more identifiable with the measured data in illinois although the hmmga based results were slightly underestimated compared to those r2 0 449 and rmse 0 028 of the data assimilation scheme however the data assimilation based validation r2 0 688 0 023 and rmse 0 055 0 049 for hmmga data assimilation results in 1996 had more uncertainties compared to those of calibration in 1994 although uncertainties exist these results demonstrated that the stochastic approach could provide relatively reliable model outputs at the weekly time intervals and relatively good transposability under different weather conditions also the average soil moisture dynamics at the different soil depths 0 10 10 30 30 50 and 0 50 cm performed fairly well r2 0 456 0 842 and rmse 0 024 0 041 compared to the measurements although uncertainties were evident in the predictions generally the soil moisture predictions had slightly different trends compared to the rainfall occurrence probabilities for both domains these findings showed that the predicted soil moisture estimates were influenced by not only the precipitation but also the land surface conditions e g topography soil textures vegetation covers etc thus this scheme which uses rainfall and historical soil moisture data performed relatively well in predicting soil moisture even though our stochastic based hmmga has limitations in capturing temporal dependence of soil moisture affected by the land surface conditions the results of calibration and validation supported the robustness of this approach in predicting the soil moisture dynamics at the multiple locations thus our approach can be used to predict soil moisture dynamics in the future using only climate change scenarios and soil moisture history existing currently our approach was only applied to the study areas which have the soil moisture history but hmmga can be also extended to various regions through continental global soil moisture database i e international soil moisture network ismn etc furthermore pixel scale soil moisture estimates can be obtained by combining satellite scale precipitation trmm gpm and soil moisture amsr e amsr2 smos smap etc products with our approach although uncertainties existing in rs data due to the discrepancy of spatio temporal scales short term rs precipitation and soil moisture data indicating less than 20 years scanned by satellites at the global scale etc might be included in satellite scale soil moisture estimates as the predicted results at the spatial domain matched quite well with the observations our approach can be also used for downscaling both remotely sensed precipitation robertson et al 2004 and soil moisture kwon et al 2017 products overall our findings support that our approach provides easy convenience avoiding intensive input parameters for physically based hydrological models in application to fields and minimizes not only user s skills in determining initial parameter values but also model structural i e parameterizations initial bottom boundary conditions governing equation transposability etc and measurement i e land covers soil information etc errors furthermore when we consider that the availability of rs soil moisture footprints are limited across forest regions our proposed scheme may provide an alternative in predicting soil moisture dynamics using trmm gpm with statistics of historical soil moisture at forest regions however hmmga still requires to be improved in predicting daily soil moisture this limitation might be resolved with increasing the number of hidden states under the assumption that long term daily soil moisture measurements are available in large areas thus the newly developed algorithm could be useful for

7064,sulphur springs cave is an extensive phreatic cavity that produces a large historic spring in the middle of metropolitan tampa florida usa the city of tampa extracts groundwater from the spring to supplement municipal water supply and to support low salinity habitat in the estuarine hillsborough river extraction at this site has occurred for many decades but has intensified since the early 2000s rapidly increasing the salinity of the spring and cave water the purpose of this study was to address the potential sources and mechanisms of saltwater intrusion at this site using historical and current hydrochemical data published in the literature and online by government agencies we also explored the cave to identify point sources of intrusion and collected water and biological samples from inside the cave to identify potential ecosystem impacts of increasing cave salinity from 1946 to present sulphur springs water shifted from being fresh specific conductance 500 µs cm 1 and of calcium sulfate type to being brackish specific conductance 5000 µs cm 1 and higher and of sodium chloride type we found numerous vents in the cave that issue saline thermal sulfidic water and host distinct microbial mat communities these vents are likely connected to bedrock fractures that provide preferential flow paths along which confined deep sourced saline water enters the freshwater portion of the aquifer probably originating from the coastal mixing zone salinity increased at the spring during dry season pumping activity and after wet season recharge events which likely increased artesian pressure in confined saline aquifer units salinization of sulphur springs may disrupt the cave microbe and stygobite communities and eventually make the spring unsuitable to maintain low salinity habitat in the hillsborough river keywords spring karst artesian coastal groundwater hydrographs urban 1 introduction 1 1 coastal aquifers saline groundwater intrusion and urban caves population density in low elevation coastal zones is more than five times that of the global average neumann et al 2015 dense coastal populations often rely on aquifers as primary sources of drinking agricultural and industrial water but current groundwater use in many coastal areas is unsustainable michael et al 2017 exploitation of coastal aquifers can lead to subterranean seawater intrusion and even small amounts of chloride contamination from intruding seawater can render groundwater nonportable 250 mg l 1 cl who 2011 chloride contamination in coastal aquifers can be difficult to remediate so researchers are working to understand monitor and prevent seawater intrusion before it occurs e g kazakis et al 2018 motevalli et al 2018 werner et al 2012 mechanisms of salinization vary greatly among aquifer systems and types i e granular vs karstic so a conceptual understanding of local system behavior is important for the development of coastal groundwater management plans an interface between seaward flowing fresh groundwater and landward intruding seawater the coastal mixing zone is present in many coastal aquifers coastal mixing zone shape and behavior are defined by complicated relationships between land surface topography aquifer hydrogeology and anthropogenic activity making some coastal mixing zones difficult to identify and monitor weyer 2018 in a regional flow system with sufficient topographic relief aquifer recharge can pressurize discharge zones hundreds of kilometers away for example coastal discharge zones throughout south florida are primarily recharged in the central florida uplands producing flow systems stretching 300 km weyer 2018 the seawater wedge intruding into confined aquifers can be pressurized by recharge to exposed topographic highs causing saline groundwater to seep upward into freshwater portions of the aquifer as in the netherlands de louw et al 2010 van rees vellinga et al 1981 or causing the salinization of coastal artesian wells as in southern france montety et al 2008 anthropogenic aquifer use can deform the mixing zone and perturb natural groundwater salinity stratification potentially contaminating aquifers where direct seawater intrusion might not otherwise occur e g giambastiani et al 2013 motevalli et al 2018 one widespread consequence of coastal groundwater extraction is mixing zone upconing garcia menendez et al 2016 werner et al 2013 groundwater extraction generates low pressure zones directly below wells causing the saltwater freshwater interface to cone upward reviewed by bower et al 1999 based on extraction rate freshwater head position and sea level the saltwater cone can reach a stable state some distance below the bottom of the well if the cone rises past a critical point it becomes unstable and the well begins to draw saline water on coasts with more diffuse mixing zones a well can upcone and draw shallow saline water long before the deeper main interface is deformed bear et al 2001 werner et al 2009 groundwater extraction can therefore expand the vertical thickness of the coastal mixing zone jakovovic et al 2016 vertical migration of deep saline groundwater is not limited to coastal zones and can result from extraction induced head reduction in aquifers overlying confined brines e g karro et al 2004 upward movement of saline groundwater can be caused by human activities other than well water extraction in northern italy extensive drainage systems have artificially lowered regional aquifer head this practice disrupted natural vertical head gradients destabilizing groundwater salinity stratification as deep sourced saline water migrated upward into fresh groundwater zones giambastiani et al 2013 preferential flow paths can enhance vertical groundwater migration and further complicate interpretations of aquifer dynamics conduits of high permeability sediment fractures faults and karstic voids offer paths of least resistance along which intruding seawater or deep sourced saline groundwater can infiltrate into freshwater aquifer units offshore of north carolina usa mulligan et al 2007 found that paleochannels infilled with coarse sediments breached a confined aquifer and could act as preferential flow paths for landward intruding seawater in the netherlands sand boils vented deep sourced coastal mixing zone water through fresh aquifer layers into overlying surface water bodies de louw et al 2010 the boils were fed by sand filled fractures that penetrated underlying confining units and a combination of the rapid discharge rate and the low head of the boils caused the underlying seawater wedge to upcone significantly anthropogenic aquifer head reduction on the atlantic coast of florida usa caused deep sourced brines to migrate upward through vertically persistent bedrock fractures and then laterally through freshwater zones contaminating a series of confined aquifers spechler 1994 in israel decades of extraction activity and head reduction in shallow aquifers led to the vertical migration of confined deep sourced brines along regional faults rosenthal 1988 on the mediterranean coast of spain calvache and pulido bosch 1997 attributed seawater intrusion in the catell de ferro aquifer entirely to the influence of preferential flow paths present in the karstified carbonate component of the aquifer which amplified the impact of anthropogenic groundwater extraction lez spring in southern france is part of an extensive karst system and discharges groundwater from multiple aquifer units bicalho et al 2017 after heavy rains lez spring discharge experienced increased contribution from mineralized groundwater which was sourced from confined evaporites the mineralized groundwater had migrated upward through faults and then leaked laterally into the main aquifer where it was later mobilized by the deep groundwater flow paths induced by intense recharge events in a limestone aquifer in south australia wood and harrington 2015 monitored a deep karst feature which intercepted the coastal mixing zone finding that the salinity of groundwater discharging from the feature showed seasonal variation dependent on mixing zone position while surrounding groundwater remained fresh caves and other karst features such as the system studied by wood and harrington 2015 provide scientists with direct access to coastal aquifers allowing researchers to identify novel mechanisms of seawater intrusion e g beddows et al 2007 vera et al 2012 and the extreme extent to which seawater intrusion can occur xu et al 2016 studies of coastal karst features have also revealed groundwater dependent ecosystems driven by unique hydrological regimes e g menning et al 2015 2018 as well as extreme isolated environments which host salinity stratified water columns e g garman and garey 2005 garman et al 2011 karst features are vulnerable to anthropogenic groundwater quality deterioration calijuri et al 2012 jiang et al 2009 especially underwater phreatic conduits which are preferential groundwater flow paths large enough to rapidly transmit natural and anthropogenic drinking water contaminants bicalho et al 2012 sulphur springs cave is an extensive phreatic conduit developed beneath metropolitan tampa florida usa the cave discharges groundwater to a surface pool from which the city of tampa extracts water in this paper we investigate hydrologically related issues that sulphur springs cave has experienced as a consequence of anthropogenic activity propose a conceptual model for seawater intrusion at this site and discuss the potential impacts of salinity increase on the cave ecosystem 1 2 sulphur springs cave sulphur springs cave is a phreatic void developed in the eogenetic limestone beneath tampa florida fig 1 eogenetic karst develops in young limestones which have maintained their initial primary porosity such that diffuse matrix flow and storage occur simultaneously with fracture karst hydrodynamics vacher and mylroie 2002 about 1 km of the cave conduit has been mapped by divers the cave consists of a main tunnel which splits into two smaller passages the orchid tunnel and the alaska tunnel the tunnels lie at a water depth of 30 m about 25 of sulphur springs cave passageway is higher than it is wide compared to the 10 exhibited by most floridan caves garman 2010 suggesting the importance of vertical bedrock fracturing in the speleogenesis of sulphur springs cave groundwater from the confined upper floridan aquifer flows through the sulphur springs tunnels toward the cave mouth producing an artesian spring the cave mouth is 1 m high and 2 m wide and is submerged in a 10 m deep pool the pool was impounded by the city of tampa in the early twentieth century to create a public swimming area the pool was used as such until the 1980s when fecal coliforms were detected and the pool was closed to swimming pumps were installed at sulphur springs pool in 1964 when the city started using spring water to replenish the hillsborough river reservoir during droughts in 2002 the pumping system was modified to allow extracted spring water to be diverted to below the reservoir dam to support the downstream lower hillsborough river southwest florida water management district swfwmd 2004 2006 diverted spring water maintains low salinity habitat and manatee thermal refuge in this estuary when spring water is not pumped it overflows from the impounded pool into the lower hillsborough river 4 km downstream of the dam when pumps are active the pool level can drop 1 m and water ceases flowing over the spillway flumes the dynamics of the spring pool have been monitored and studied since the 1940s see menke et al 1961 rosenau et al 1977 stewart and mills 1984 specific conductance of the spring water increases when the pool is lowered regardless of local aquifer head position water quality of the spring and cave can thus be maintained by controlling pool depth yet the specific conductance of the spring water has increased over time 1 3 deterioration of sulphur springs water quality north of sulphur springs cave swallets and sinkholes are present which have historically contributed to sulphur springs recharge menke et al 1961 however direct connections between important swallets i e curiosity sink blue sink and sulphur springs have been blocked since the 1980s eec 1990 schreuder 1997 2001 although these discrete connections have been thoroughly investigated the contribution of diffuse recharge to sulphur springs has largely been ignored stewart and mills 1984 found a strong correlation r2 0 90 between the discharge of sulphur springs and the water level at a nearby well romp 66 fig 2 table 1 this relationship indicates a connection between cave water and surrounding matrix stored groundwater florida limestone has maintained much of its primary matrix porosity which communicates easily with any secondary fracture cave porosity that has developed e g martin and dean 2001 thus the response of florida springs to recharge is less punctuated than that of springs primarily fed by swallet sinkhole focused recharge florea and vacher 2006 the contribution of matrix stored groundwater to spring discharge is especially important in florida where evapotranspiration prevents most of wet season precipitation from reaching the aquifer florea and vacher 2007 martin and gordon 2000 because discrete recharge is relatively unimportant to florida springs and because the deterioration of sulphur springs water quality was noticed before the 1980s rosenau et al 1977 the loss of communication with local freshwater swallets is probably not the primary cause of the increasing spring water salinity additionally municipal spring water extraction occurs only during the dry season when water is needed so the pumping induced reduction of spring pool head cannot totally explain the salinity increase hydraulic head levels of distant diffuse recharge areas probably drive the hydrological regime of sulphur springs cave examination of sulphur springs regional hydrogeology in addition to local anthropogenic activity should explain the deterioration of water quality at this site 2 material and methods 2 1 hydrogeology site description of the sulphur springs system three principal lithologic sequences underlie the tampa bay region the uppermost sequence is a collection of unconsolidated sands clays and other sediments tertiary and quaternary which confine an underlying limestone dolomite sequence in descending order this limestone sequence includes the tampa limestone upper oligocene lower miocene a member of the arcadia formation hawthorn group suwannee limestone lower oligocene ocala limestone upper eocene and the avon park formation middle eocene the tampa limestone contains layers of sand and clay and acts as an additional confining unit these limestones dip from the northeast where the suwannee and ocala limestones are exposed at land surface to the southwest where they are confined fig 3 the tampa limestone is exposed throughout the hillsborough river basin fig 3 below this limestone sequence lies a gypsiferous limestone dolomite sequence which is confined by the lower part of the avon park formation these sequences host two distinct aquifers parker et al 1955 the surficial aquifer resides in the shallow clastic sediments while the floridan aquifer lies within the limestones the floridan aquifer is separated into upper and lower zones by the avon park formation confining bed miller 1986 the upper floridan aquifer is hosted by the younger non gypsiferous limestone sequence while the lower floridan aquifer resides in the older gypsiferous limestones the upper floridan aquifer near sulphur springs is further divided into two distinct hydrological units swfwmd 1988 the shallower hydrological unit consists of the suwannee and ocala limestones and the upper and lower boundaries of the suwannee limestone are the most permeable parts of this unit fig 3 in the sulphur springs area the mid suwannee limestone is comprised of thick fine grained wackestone rich layers o sullivan and werner 1991 which could confine the underlying permeable suwannee ocala interface beneath the suwannee ocala interface is the wackestone rich ocala limestone which semiconfines the fractured dolomitic avon park formation the avon park formation hosts the second major hydrological unit of the upper floridan aquifer horizontal hydraulic conductivity in the upper floridan aquifer can range from as low as 0 16 m d 1 in the suwannee limestone robinson 1995 to as high as 6 1 103 m d 1 in the highly cavernous tampa suwannee interface beneath the city of tampa stewart and mills 1984 based on its depth and horizontally persistent morphology sulphur springs cave is likely developed along the cavernous tampa suwannee interface figs 1 and 3 precipitation entering exposures of the suwannee limestone is probably important to the recharge of the sulphur springs artesian system we therefore used the water level recorded at the monitoring well romp 87 as a measure of regional aquifer recharge figs 2 and 3 table 1 this well was bored near a large high elevation exposure of suwannee limestone based on the strong connectivity present between the surficial aquifer and the upper floridan aquifer near romp 87 i e downward vertical gradient head difference of 1 m the portion of the suwannee limestone in which romp 87 was screened was unconfined spechler

sulfate sulfide ammonium nitrite nitrate phosphate and alkalinity concentrations of discrete water samples collected in replicates of 3 at the station we collected cave water samples in glass jars with teflon lined lids these jars were acid washed and filled with sterile organic free water until the moment of collection when they were each purged 3 times with helium scuba diving through cave passages allows direct observation of aquifer dynamics and the sampling of water while it remains underground relatively unaffected by surface conditions e g beddows et al 2007 such field work allows researchers to isolate features or organisms that may have a disproportionate impact on the groundwater ecosystem e g brigmon et al 1994 rather than relying on well bore samples sampling was conducted by trained scientific cave divers under the auspices of the university of south florida scientific diving program microbial mat was sampled from the cave walls 5 m upstream from the monitoring station

discharge only lag times with the highest correlation coefficient from each analysis were reported in this study alpha values of 0 05 were used for partial correlations 3 results 3 1 specific conductance relationship to hydraulic head compared to the trend observed from 1946 to 2002 specific conductance at sulphur springs began increasing rapidly after 2002 the year that spring water diversions to the lower hillsborough river began fig 4 continuous monitoring of sulphur springs pool began in october 2009 when the usgs installed a gauge in the pool that recorded specific conductance pool level and discharge once every 15 min these data allowed for a high resolution examination of sulphur springs specific conductance trends concurrent to these data were those collected at the romp 87 monitor well which was located near the high elevation suwannee limestone exposure northeast of sulphur springs figs 2 and 3 table 1 water level in the suwannee limestone was recorded in this well once daily the continuous specific conductance profile of sulphur springs pool closely corresponded to the water level in the suwannee limestone exposure except during instances of intense spring water extraction fig 5 all specific conductance values recorded during this study period were higher than those predicted by the pre diversion specific conductance trend generated from data collected from 1946 to 2002 figs 4 and 5 rapid specific conductance spikes in the sulphur springs chemograph corresponded strikingly to intense pumping activity indicated in this analysis by pool levels lower than 1 8 m asl above sea level at levels below 1 8 m asl sulphur springs pool water was too low to flow over its spillway flumes indicating that the rate of extraction was higher than the rate of spring discharge during these periods of pumping specific conductance was strongly negatively correlated to pool level partial correlation controlling for aquifer level r 0 76 p 0 001 n 811

river seasonal groundwater extraction at this site lowered the pool level to a point at which spring water would no longer overflow its impoundment making it impossible to analyze yearly discharge trends from the spring pumps were inactive between 17 june and 30 november 2017 allowing at least for an analysis of wet season discharge during this year aquifer level and spring discharge increased throughout this period peaking with hurricane irma 10 september 2017 fig 6 cross correlation analysis showed that the level of the upper floridan aquifer hosted by the suwannee limestone exposure responded to rainfall within 1 day measured at romp 87 discharge from sulphur springs responded immediately to recharge to the suwannee limestone exposure the two hydrographs correlating with an r2 0 67 the ratio of the maximum to mean discharge observed over this period was 1 4 sulphur springs specific conductance dropped 2 days after local rainfall events this lag matched the time it took for tracer dye to reach sulphur springs when injected into nearby sinkholes stewart and mills 1984 specific conductance correlated weakly to spring discharge during this period r2 0 40 but specific conductance remained high while discharge rate dropped during the latter half of the wet season fig 6 the specific conductance chemograph lagged 25 days behind the aquifer level hydrograph specific conductance eventually dropped in the beginning of november 2017 but leveled off on about the tenth day of that month corresponding to a similar trend observed in suwannee limestone aquifer level fig 6 this increase in hydraulic head was not observed at any other well in the area e g romp 66 fig 6 and did not correspond to any rainfall events groundwater extraction resumed immediately after 30 november 2017 3 3 observations made in sulphur springs cave vents of hydrochemically distinct water contributed to the bulk water of sulphur springs cave these vents were visually apparent because of changes in microbial mat communities on the cave walls mats were normally of a dense consistency 3 5 cm long with a dark brown color fig 7 a but became white and feathery surrounding vents fig 7b fluorescence microscopy showed that brown mats were made up of a mixed microbial community fig 7a i iii while the feathery mats consisted of segmented filaments made up of uniform rod shaped cells that contained intracellular granules fig 7b i iii the white filaments measured 1 0 µm in diameter fig 7b i iii samples of feathery mat contained water that smelled strongly of reduced sulfur compounds when processed in the lab datasonde profiles recorded by divers revealed a particularly influential vent located in the alaska tunnel fig 8 salt vent on 14 october 2001 vent water salinity temperature dissolved oxygen concentration and ph were 17 7 psu 26 1 c 0 00 mg l 1 and 6 39 respectively while that of the orchid tunnel was 1 3 psu 24 9 c 0 07 mg l 1 and 6 84 respectively fig 8 the influence of salt vent water was especially apparent in the alaska tunnel but was even noticeable after it mixed with orchid tunnel water and flowed downstream through the main tunnel fig 8 3 4 well survey and major ion analysis a survey of wells in the sulphur springs area showed that only the tourist club well an artesian groundwater monitoring well screened in the suwannee limestone contained water with a specific conductance comparable to that of the sulphur springs salt vent 10 000 20 000 µs cm 1 figs 1 and 2 table 1 tourist club well was also the closest well to sulphur springs figs 1 and 2 all other wells in the area contained water less saline than the sulphur springs salt vent and tourist club well although those screened at great depths still contained water with specific conductances and chloride concentrations indicative of saltwater contamination i e 250 mg l 1 cl table 1 these wells were the deep sligh park well screened in the avon park formation and two of the hillsborough dam wells screened respectively in the ocala limestone and avon park formation recent specific conductance values measured at these wells were 5586 4442 and 7675 µs cm 1 respectively recent chloride concentrations at these wells were 1520 1170 and 2120 mg l 1 respectively the specific conductances of the tourist club and deep sligh park wells have increased over the past two decades with a similar slope though the specific conductance at deep sligh park exhibited an oscillating pattern fig 9 a specific conductance increased with depth at the hillsborough dam well but did not increase over time at any screened interval fig 9b water levels in wells containing freshwater i e romp 87 romp 66 shallow sligh park table 1 showed seasonal oscillations but had no net head reduction over the past two decades fig 10 between 1946 and 1972 sulphur springs water exhibited a calcium sulfate hydrochemical type since then its hydrochemical character has changed to sodium chloride type fig 11 supplementary table corresponding with the long term specific conductance increase observed at this site fig 4 the nearest freshwater well to sulphur springs romp 66 screened in the tampa and suwannee limestones at a depth encompassing that of sulphur springs cave fig 2 table 1 most recently contained calcium sulfate type water fig 11 supplementary table the tourist club well contained sodium chloride type water fig 11 supplementary table a well near tampa bay widely screened in the suwannee ocala and avon park formation limestones contained water of a specific conductance resembling that of seawater kinder morgan well fig 2 table 1 kinder morgan well water plotted near seawater on a piper diagram falling in the sodium chloride type but was slightly more mineralized with respect to calcium ions fig 11 supplementary table the deep wells surrounding sulphur springs contained sodium chloride type water fig 12 supplementary table the hydrochemical character of the deep sligh park well water shifted from being borderline calcium sulfate type to strongly sodium chloride type fig 12 this trend corresponded with the major specific conductance oscillation observed at this well during the late 2000s fig 9a 4 discussion 4 1 hypotheses for seawater intrusion in sulphur springs cave in general aquifer level rose and stayed high during wet seasons and declined during dry seasons fig 5 pool level tended to stay high during wet seasons and wet years while it was lower throughout dry seasons when pumping occurred specific conductance mostly mirrored aquifer level with a 25 day lag except during periods of lowered pool level when rapid immediate specific conductance spikes would occur specific conductance trends explained by pumping activity and recharge head position are summarized in table 3 it makes intuitive sense that pumping induced pool head reduction could increase the specific conductance of sulphur springs by facilitating the vertical intrusion of salt vent water specific conductance also climbed throughout wet seasons when pumps were inactive and pool level remained high figs 5 and 6 which was unexpected this trend was especially apparent during 2017 when an unusually dry winter was followed by the largest precipitation event recorded in this area during the study period hurricane irma which struck the area on 10 september 2017 figs 5 and 6 when recharge lows accompanied periods when pool level was kept high sulphur springs specific conductance dropped but the water still did not return to being as fresh as it was before the 1960s figs 4 and 5 spring water extraction and subsequent pool lowering usually occurred during dry seasons which prevented sulphur springs from recovering to a low salinity state during many years fig 5 indeed present sulphur springs specific conductance was often 6 fold and sometimes 8 fold higher than it was in 1957 menke et al 1961 and never dropped below 3000 μs cm 1 fig 5 table 2b in the following sections we propose a conceptual model explaining why sulphur springs specific conductance increased gradually over the past century rapidly over the past decades and anomalously during the recharge season fig 13 4 1 1 seawater intrusion conceptual model initial state vertical fractures flexures and subsidence features are common in the limestone underlying west central florida based on seismic reflection surveys conducted on the lower hillsborough river wolansky and thompson 1987 and rivers of neighboring watersheds lewelling et al 1998 trommer et al 2009 the morphology of sulphur springs cave garman 2010 indicates the presence of vertical fractures in the immediate area which have contributed to the speleogenesis of the cave vertical bedrock fractures act as preferential groundwater flow paths and can be conduits for saline water intrusion into freshwater layers if they breach one or multiple confining units e g spechler 1994 their fig 37 the salt vents found in sulphur springs cave are probably termini of fractures which must either intercept the coastal mixing zone similar to the chasm cave in south australia wood and harrington 2015 or draw up mixing zone water by providing an avenue of reduced head similar to how saline groundwater upcones toward depressed potentiometric surfaces produced by extraction wells e g bower et al 1999 vertical intrusion of saline groundwater into overlying freshwater has also been observed in the absence of wells this natural phenomenon has been attributed to the reduced potentiometric head generated by discharging springs tellam et al 1986 and to rapid upward groundwater movement through aquitard breaching fractures in artesian systems de louw et al 2010 in the pre extraction state of the sulphur springs system fig 13a variations in spring pool head controlled the influence of vertically migrating saline water menke et al 1961 p 42 this indicates that the sulphur springs salt vents were active before pumping began in the 1950s menke et al 1961 p 41 found no evidence of saline water in the suwannee limestone around sulphur springs and suggested that saline water must be moving up through fractures from below the ocala limestone confining unit i e the avon park formation the wet season salinity increases observed during the present study period were not mentioned in previous studies of sulphur springs menke et al 1961 rosenau et al 1977 stewart and mills 1984 4 1 2 seawater intrusion conceptual model dry season pumping upper floridan aquifer levels surrounding tampa bay can seasonally drop to lower than 6 m below sea level especially in areas of major groundwater extraction activity hickey 1981 hutchinson 1983 trommer 1993 this would allow for landward groundwater movement and for seawater to recharge the coastal aquifer in tampa the extent of the coastal groundwater mixing zone is at least 16 km inland from tampa bay hickey 1981 trommer 1993 in highly permeable zones such as the avon park formation this boundary can extend even farther sulphur springs cave lies well within this transition zone being situated only 10 km north of the bay fig 1 pumps were installed in sulphur springs pool in 1964 and were modified in 2002 to allow for spring water to be diverted to below the hillsborough river reservoir dam the intense pumping activity observed since 2011 lowered sulphur springs pool level to near and occasionally equal to or below sea level fig 5 table 2b such activity could have led to rapid local seawater intrusion as head pressure above each one of the fractures intersecting sulphur springs cave dropped whenever municipal pumps drew down the spring pool seasonal rainfall patterns and groundwater extraction in the tampa bay region and at sulphur springs caused the potentiometric head of the upper floridan aquifer to oscillate dramatically although there was no net annual loss in freshwater head around sulphur springs cave fig 10 natural oscillation of the freshwater saltwater interface would be enhanced by extraction activity potentially causing the mixing zone to expand over time based on the rinsing principle developed by wentworth 1948 and invoked more recently by researchers explaining controls on mixing zone thickness fratesi 2013 rotzoll et al 2010 unstable saltwater upconing can additionally expand an already wide mixing zone and cause a well or spring to draw increasingly saline groundwater bear et al 2001 werner et al 2009 these mechanisms probably contributed to the salinity increase of sulphur springs water occurring slowly since 1964 fig 13b and rapidly since 2002 fig 13c over time the fractures intersecting sulphur springs cave would have drawn water from deeper and deeper into the coastal mixing zone while the mixing zone itself was expanding and introducing increasingly saline water to shallower depths 4 1 3 seawater intrusion conceptual model wet season recharge long term pool head reduction due to pumping would have increased the frequency and time that deep sourced saline groundwater resided in the fractures intersecting sulphur springs cave because matrix porosity communicates freely with fractures and voids in eogenetic karst this vertically infiltrating saline water likely leaked from fractures and migrated laterally into the shallow suwannee limestone underlying sulphur springs cave fig 13b and c this mechanism is similar to that proposed by spechler 1994 to explain salinization of the fractured floridan aquifer in northeastern florida stewart and mills 1984 reported that the specific conductance and chloride concentrations of the tourist club well screened in the suwannee limestone near sulphur springs had steadily increased during the 1970s and 1980s in 1963 specific conductance and chloride concentrations in this well were as low as 1000 µs cm 1 and 200 mg l 1 respectively stewart and mills 1984 from 1991 to 2017 specific conductance at this well never dropped below 9900 µs cm 1 and reached values higher than 19 000 µs cm 1 fig 9a with chloride concentrations as high as 5750 mg l 1 supplementary table in summary the specific conductance of suwannee limestone groundwater nearby sulphur springs increased concurrently with that of sulphur springs water this saline groundwater was present no deeper than 97 m below land surface the maximum screened interval of the tourist club well table 1 corresponding to the depth of wackestone rich suwannee limestone layers this phenomenon was only observed in the immediate sulphur springs area as data from other local wells screened at similar intervals did not indicate specific conductance increases table 1 the low maximum to mean discharge ratio of sulphur springs 1 4 during the 2017 wet season supports the idea that diffuse recharge to exposures of the cave s parent limestone drove spring discharge more than did recharge to discrete locations i e sinkholes florea and vacher 2006 when recharge events occurred the immediate response of sulphur springs discharge was primarily due to the propagation of a pressure wave through the system with direct stormwater input from nearby sinkholes being less important discrete recharge still seemed to impact sulphur springs cave however by introducing rainwater directly to the system and producing short lived decreases in specific conductance fig 6 input from discrete recharge points probably introduced surface derived nutrients and oxygen to the cave as well despite the short lived influence that discrete recharge had on sulphur springs specific conductance at this site increased throughout wet seasons figs 5 and 6 during the 2017 wet season spring discharge responded immediately to suwannee limestone recharge with both factors peaking after hurricane irma 10 september 2017 fig 6 the turbulent movement of groundwater through the cave and could have entrained salt vent water and mixed it with bulk cave water but because specific conductance at the spring continued to increase long after seasonal discharge peaked fig 6 this is an unlikely mechanism of sulphur springs salinization diffuse suwannee limestone recharge best correlated to specific conductance when recharge was lagged 25 days fig 6 this 25 day delay might have corresponded to the travel time that saline groundwater from fracture leakage in the shallow suwannee limestone took to migrate to the spring head after it was pressurized by recharge fig 13d a similar mechanism was recently proposed by bicalho et al 2017 to explain mineralization trends at lez spring in southern france groundwater discharging from the karstic lez spring became increasingly mineralized for short periods after the occurrence of recharge events large enough to raise regional aquifer head to near saturation levels bicalho et al 2012 2017 the source of mineralized water in this artesian system was a confined layer of evaporites from which saline groundwater migrated vertically through confinement breaching faults then leaked from the faults and moved laterally into the main aquifer creating shallow reservoir of slightly saline water bicalho et al 2017 invoked the concept of piston flow groundwater movement to explain the contribution of mineralized water to lez spring discharge after large rainfall events under piston flow conditions intense recharge increases aquifer hydraulic gradients which deepens groundwater flow paths and mobilizes deeper long residence time waters this concept is commonly used in the karst aquifer literature to explain sporadic recharge induced discharge of mineralized spring water desmarais and rojstaczer 2002 lopez chicano et al 2001 at sulphur springs the increasingly saline matrix stored groundwater screened by the tourist club well beneath sulphur springs cave probably resided below the wackestone rich layers of suwannee limestone identified in a nearby florida geological survey lithology fig 2 o sullivan and werner 1991 the wackestone confined saline groundwater would have received more artesian pressure for any given recharge event than would freshwater in overlying aquifer units fig 13d the presence of multiple leaky confining units in the sulphur springs hydrogeological system makes this a multi story artesian system described by klimchouk 2017 with hydrochemically distinct water residing in each story this explains the increase in sulphur springs specific conductance observed throughout wet seasons better than does the piston flow concept recharge induced mineralization at lez spring occurred sporadically and lasted on the order of a few days before specific conductance levels returned to normal even while aquifer head remained high bicalho et al 2012 their fig 6 bicalho et al 2017 their fig 4 specific conductance at sulphur springs increased almost continuously throughout the 2017 wet season and continued to stay high for about a month beyond peak aquifer level fig 6 this pattern was mostly observed throughout the rest of the study period and was supported by our partial correlation analyses fig 5 table 2 for the sulphur springs system the aquifer level specific conductance partial correlation coefficient we calculated when the pool level remained 1 8 m asl was higher than that for the pool level specific conductance partial correlation coefficient under the same conditions though statistically significant the coefficient was low r 0 33 table 2a indicating that there must be another variable that our simple conceptual model did not consider other variables affecting sulphur springs specific conductance trends could include subtidal sea level variations water levels in local sinkholes or artesian pressure in the avon park formation where the intruding seawater wedge likely resides 4 2 well survey and hydrochemical evidence the tourist club well was screened at an interval encompassing the suwannee limestone above and below a wackestone layer and has experienced an increase in specific conductance since at least 1971 stewart and mills 1984 fig 9a no other suwannee limestone screened wells in the area showed evidence of seawater intrusion table 1 a deeper well located southwest of sulphur springs i e deep sligh park screened in the avon park formation showed an increasing specific conductance trend similar to that of the tourist club well fig 9a table 1 suggesting an upward migration or expansion of the coastal mixing zone in this area another well screened at a similar depth as the deep sligh park well located southeast of sulphur springs i e hillsborough dam avon park contained more saline water but did not experience an increase in specific conductance fig 9b potentiometric head above the hillsborough dam well was less likely to oscillate since it is located near a large reservoir perhaps explaining why specific conductance did not increase here most recently the saline water found in sulphur springs and tourist club well was hydrochemically similar to modern seawater fig 11 based on the relatively high sulfate concentrations they measured at sulphur springs menke et al 1961 hypothesized that the source of the vertically infiltrating saline water was not seawater but instead gypsum influenced water from below the ocala limestone confinement indeed based on our analysis of historical data sulphur springs water in the 1950s and 1960s fell into the calcium sulfate type fig 11 the same analysis of more recent measurements suggested that the increasing specific conductance of sulphur springs was due to the influence of sodium chloride type water fig 11 the sulfate enriched water influencing sulphur springs hydrochemistry must have been sourced from freshwater portions of the tampa and suwannee limestones since this type of water is found in well romp 66 fig 11 future stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope analysis of sulphur springs salt vent water will clarify if this water is indeed intruding modern seawater and not residual pleistocene seawater leftover from a past high sea level stand hydrochemical analysis reported by trommer 1993 p 13 suggested that the aquifer in our study area has been flushed of residual seawater and therefore that groundwater mineralization in the area is a result of freshwater mixing with intruding modern seawater our analysis of major ion data provided by swfwmd at least made it clear that the vertically infiltrating water was not sourced from the lower floridan aquifer which contains calcium sulfate type water e g moore et al 2009 spechler 1994 4 3 ecosystem impacts of saltwater intrusion and conservation of sulphur springs cave throughout 2017 nutrient concentrations were measured from bulk water from the sampling station in the cave data not shown the cave was oligotrophic and the only nutrient concentration to correlate with specific conductance was that of sulfide which varied between 0 5 5 µg l 1 partial correlation controlling for date r 0 98 p 0 022 n 7 the long residing anoxic saline groundwater migrating vertically into sulphur springs cave was therefore probably rich in sulfide this was corroborated by the observation that sulphur springs cave salt vent water had a strong sulfidic odor while bulk cave water did not sulfide is usually present in anoxic groundwaters where sulfate or sulfur concentrations are also high and is produced by sulfur reducing bacteria while sulfide seems to be another tracer of salt vent influence its presence might also have an impact on the cave ecosystem based on their morphology and ecological niche the feathery white microbial mats growing near sulphur springs cave salt vents are likely sulfide oxidizing gammaproteobacteria similar to those found in frasassi cave italy macalady et al 2006 any sulfide oxidizing bacteria living in sulphur springs cave could produce sulfuric acid as a metabolic byproduct enhancing limestone dissolution engel et al 2004 enhanced speleogenesis would primarily enlarge salt vents around which the acid producing bacteria live leading to an increased rate of vertical infiltration as fracture diameter grows additionally sulfide is toxic to aquatic macro organisms see tobler et al 2011 so increased sulfide concentrations in the sulphur springs system would be detrimental to the cave spring and downstream ecosystems over the past century the hydrochemistry of water in sulphur springs cave has increasingly resembled that of its salt vents figs 4 5 and 8 the brown microbial mats observed on the cave walls contained varying amounts of white filaments and microscope images of brown mat samples showed that the segmented filaments characteristic of the feathery mats are sometimes present fig 7a i iii as municipal groundwater extraction alters the sulphur springs cave ecosystem conditions will probably favor the growth of sulfur oxidizing bacteria at the cost of brown iron cycling sulfur reducing bacteria metabolic capability of brown sulphur springs cave mats was determined by garman 2010 p 82 a community overhaul by sulfur oxidizers would possibly lead to enhanced dissolution of the cave which underlies a busy highway in metropolitan tampa additionally while garman 2010 usually recorded the presence of dissolved oxygen in sulphur springs cave on dives conducted in the early 2000s fig 8 the main tunnel was anoxic for all of 2017 except for during a few days in november data not shown some tunnels of sulphur springs cave are home to stygobitic crustaceans garman 2010 if dissolved oxygen levels throughout the entire cave currently drop to zero for many months at a time sulphur springs cave may no longer be able to support these rare cave adapted animals the specific conductance of sulphur springs has increased rapidly since diversions to the lower hillsborough river began in 2002 fig 4 as specific conductance continues to increase it is likely that associated factors such as sulfide concentrations anoxia temperature and acidity will increase as well to effectively conserve the ecosystem of this urban cave alternative methods of supporting the minimum flows of the lower hillsborough river are needed this is especially apparent in the observation that eventually sulphur springs water will no longer be able to support low salinity habitat in the river below the dam 5 conclusions sulphur springs specific conductance has increased 10 fold from 500 µs cm 1 to 5000 µs cm 1 or higher and has changed from being of calcium sulfate type to sodium chloride type since 1946 long before groundwater extraction at this site began vents issuing saline water in sulphur springs cave were likely connected to bedrock fractures which breached confining units and either intercepted or upconed coastal mixing zone water the dynamic annual timescale specific conductance trends observed at sulphur springs were primarily caused by interactions between aquifer head and anthropogenic manipulation of spring pool level dry season specific conductance spikes in sulphur springs cave were explained by municipal pumping activity and subsequent pool level lowering while wet season specific conductance highs were probably due to regional aquifer recharge disproportionately pressurizing confined saline groundwater units the decadal timescale specific conductance increase at this site was probably related to anthropogenic changes in coastal mixing zone position and shape if current trends continue sulphur springs water may eventually become unsuitable for the maintenance of low salinity habitat in the lower hillsborough river our model focuses on the water levels of the sulphur springs pool and the regional upper floridan aquifer the two most likely forces which drive specific conductance trends at sulphur springs it does not include the possible effect of subtidal sea level variations water levels in hydraulically connected sinkholes or artesian pressure variation in deeper confined aquifer units that could host the seawater wedge our study does demonstrate the effect of direct groundwater extraction from coastal karst and the importance of considering regional hydrogeology when interpreting the dynamics of local scale features although coastal karst features are easy targets for groundwater extraction the complexity of these systems makes them vulnerable to mismanagement the increasing urbanization of coasts will surely impact these unique ecosystems throughout the world but their deterioration can be prevented by

7064,sulphur springs cave is an extensive phreatic cavity that produces a large historic spring in the middle of metropolitan tampa florida usa the city of tampa extracts groundwater from the spring to supplement municipal water supply and to support low salinity habitat in the estuarine hillsborough river extraction at this site has occurred for many decades but has intensified since the early 2000s rapidly increasing the salinity of the spring and cave water the purpose of this study was to address the potential sources and mechanisms of saltwater intrusion at this site using historical and current hydrochemical data published in the literature and online by government agencies we also explored the cave to identify point sources of intrusion and collected water and biological samples from inside the cave to identify potential ecosystem impacts of increasing cave salinity from 1946 to present sulphur springs water shifted from being fresh specific conductance 500 µs cm 1 and of calcium sulfate type to being brackish specific conductance 5000 µs cm 1 and higher and of sodium chloride type we found numerous vents in the cave that issue saline thermal sulfidic water and host distinct microbial mat communities these vents are likely connected to bedrock fractures that provide preferential flow paths along which confined deep sourced saline water enters the freshwater portion of the aquifer probably originating from the coastal mixing zone salinity increased at the spring during dry season pumping activity and after wet season recharge events which likely increased artesian pressure in confined saline aquifer units salinization of sulphur springs may disrupt the cave microbe and stygobite communities and eventually make the spring unsuitable to maintain low salinity habitat in the hillsborough river keywords spring karst artesian coastal groundwater hydrographs urban 1 introduction 1 1 coastal aquifers saline groundwater intrusion and urban caves population density in low elevation coastal zones is more than five times that of the global average neumann et al 2015 dense coastal populations often rely on aquifers as primary sources of drinking agricultural and industrial water but current groundwater use in many coastal areas is unsustainable michael et al 2017 exploitation of coastal aquifers can lead to subterranean seawater intrusion and even small amounts of chloride contamination from intruding seawater can render groundwater nonportable 250 mg l 1 cl who 2011 chloride contamination in coastal aquifers can be difficult to remediate so researchers are working to understand monitor and prevent seawater intrusion before it occurs e g kazakis et al 2018 motevalli et al 2018 werner et al 2012 mechanisms of salinization vary greatly among aquifer systems and types i e granular vs karstic so a conceptual understanding of local system behavior is important for the development of coastal groundwater management plans an interface between seaward flowing fresh groundwater and landward intruding seawater the coastal mixing zone is present in many coastal aquifers coastal mixing zone shape and behavior are defined by complicated relationships between land surface topography aquifer hydrogeology and anthropogenic activity making some coastal mixing zones difficult to identify and monitor weyer 2018 in a regional flow system with sufficient topographic relief aquifer recharge can pressurize discharge zones hundreds of kilometers away for example coastal discharge zones throughout south florida are primarily recharged in the central florida uplands producing flow systems stretching 300 km weyer 2018 the seawater wedge intruding into confined aquifers can be pressurized by recharge to exposed topographic highs causing saline groundwater to seep upward into freshwater portions of the aquifer as in the netherlands de louw et al 2010 van rees vellinga et al 1981 or causing the salinization of coastal artesian wells as in southern france montety et al 2008 anthropogenic aquifer use can deform the mixing zone and perturb natural groundwater salinity stratification potentially contaminating aquifers where direct seawater intrusion might not otherwise occur e g giambastiani et al 2013 motevalli et al 2018 one widespread consequence of coastal groundwater extraction is mixing zone upconing garcia menendez et al 2016 werner et al 2013 groundwater extraction generates low pressure zones directly below wells causing the saltwater freshwater interface to cone upward reviewed by bower et al 1999 based on extraction rate freshwater head position and sea level the saltwater cone can reach a stable state some distance below the bottom of the well if the cone rises past a critical point it becomes unstable and the well begins to draw saline water on coasts with more diffuse mixing zones a well can upcone and draw shallow saline water long before the deeper main interface is deformed bear et al 2001 werner et al 2009 groundwater extraction can therefore expand the vertical thickness of the coastal mixing zone jakovovic et al 2016 vertical migration of deep saline groundwater is not limited to coastal zones and can result from extraction induced head reduction in aquifers overlying confined brines e g karro et al 2004 upward movement of saline groundwater can be caused by human activities other than well water extraction in northern italy extensive drainage systems have artificially lowered regional aquifer head this practice disrupted natural vertical head gradients destabilizing groundwater salinity stratification as deep sourced saline water migrated upward into fresh groundwater zones giambastiani et al 2013 preferential flow paths can enhance vertical groundwater migration and further complicate interpretations of aquifer dynamics conduits of high permeability sediment fractures faults and karstic voids offer paths of least resistance along which intruding seawater or deep sourced saline groundwater can infiltrate into freshwater aquifer units offshore of north carolina usa mulligan et al 2007 found that paleochannels infilled with coarse sediments breached a confined aquifer and could act as preferential flow paths for landward intruding seawater in the netherlands sand boils vented deep sourced coastal mixing zone water through fresh aquifer layers into overlying surface water bodies de louw et al 2010 the boils were fed by sand filled fractures that penetrated underlying confining units and a combination of the rapid discharge rate and the low head of the boils caused the underlying seawater wedge to upcone significantly anthropogenic aquifer head reduction on the atlantic coast of florida usa caused deep sourced brines to migrate upward through vertically persistent bedrock fractures and then laterally through freshwater zones contaminating a series of confined aquifers spechler 1994 in israel decades of extraction activity and head reduction in shallow aquifers led to the vertical migration of confined deep sourced brines along regional faults rosenthal 1988 on the mediterranean coast of spain calvache and pulido bosch 1997 attributed seawater intrusion in the catell de ferro aquifer entirely to the influence of preferential flow paths present in the karstified carbonate component of the aquifer which amplified the impact of anthropogenic groundwater extraction lez spring in southern france is part of an extensive karst system and discharges groundwater from multiple aquifer units bicalho et al 2017 after heavy rains lez spring discharge experienced increased contribution from mineralized groundwater which was sourced from confined evaporites the mineralized groundwater had migrated upward through faults and then leaked laterally into the main aquifer where it was later mobilized by the deep groundwater flow paths induced by intense recharge events in a limestone aquifer in south australia wood and harrington 2015 monitored a deep karst feature which intercepted the coastal mixing zone finding that the salinity of groundwater discharging from the feature showed seasonal variation dependent on mixing zone position while surrounding groundwater remained fresh caves and other karst features such as the system studied by wood and harrington 2015 provide scientists with direct access to coastal aquifers allowing researchers to identify novel mechanisms of seawater intrusion e g beddows et al 2007 vera et al 2012 and the extreme extent to which seawater intrusion can occur xu et al 2016 studies of coastal karst features have also revealed groundwater dependent ecosystems driven by unique hydrological regimes e g menning et al 2015 2018 as well as extreme isolated environments which host salinity stratified water columns e g garman and garey 2005 garman et al 2011 karst features are vulnerable to anthropogenic groundwater quality deterioration calijuri et al 2012 jiang et al 2009 especially underwater phreatic conduits which are preferential groundwater flow paths large enough to rapidly transmit natural and anthropogenic drinking water contaminants bicalho et al 2012 sulphur springs cave is an extensive phreatic conduit developed beneath metropolitan tampa florida usa the cave discharges groundwater to a surface pool from which the city of tampa extracts water in this paper we investigate hydrologically related issues that sulphur springs cave has experienced as a consequence of anthropogenic activity propose a conceptual model for seawater intrusion at this site and discuss the potential impacts of salinity increase on the cave ecosystem 1 2 sulphur springs cave sulphur springs cave is a phreatic void developed in the eogenetic limestone beneath tampa florida fig 1 eogenetic karst develops in young limestones which have maintained their initial primary porosity such that diffuse matrix flow and storage occur simultaneously with fracture karst hydrodynamics vacher and mylroie 2002 about 1 km of the cave conduit has been mapped by divers the cave consists of a main tunnel which splits into two smaller passages the orchid tunnel and the alaska tunnel the tunnels lie at a water depth of 30 m about 25 of sulphur springs cave passageway is higher than it is wide compared to the 10 exhibited by most floridan caves garman 2010 suggesting the importance of vertical bedrock fracturing in the speleogenesis of sulphur springs cave groundwater from the confined upper floridan aquifer flows through the sulphur springs tunnels toward the cave mouth producing an artesian spring the cave mouth is 1 m high and 2 m wide and is submerged in a 10 m deep pool the pool was impounded by the city of tampa in the early twentieth century to create a public swimming area the pool was used as such until the 1980s when fecal coliforms were detected and the pool was closed to swimming pumps were installed at sulphur springs pool in 1964 when the city started using spring water to replenish the hillsborough river reservoir during droughts in 2002 the pumping system was modified to allow extracted spring water to be diverted to below the reservoir dam to support the downstream lower hillsborough river southwest florida water management district swfwmd 2004 2006 diverted spring water maintains low salinity habitat and manatee thermal refuge in this estuary when spring water is not pumped it overflows from the impounded pool into the lower hillsborough river 4 km downstream of the dam when pumps are active the pool level can drop 1 m and water ceases flowing over the spillway flumes the dynamics of the spring pool have been monitored and studied since the 1940s see menke et al 1961 rosenau et al 1977 stewart and mills 1984 specific conductance of the spring water increases when the pool is lowered regardless of local aquifer head position water quality of the spring and cave can thus be maintained by controlling pool depth yet the specific conductance of the spring water has increased over time 1 3 deterioration of sulphur springs water quality north of sulphur springs cave swallets and sinkholes are present which have historically contributed to sulphur springs recharge menke et al 1961 however direct connections between important swallets i e curiosity sink blue sink and sulphur springs have been blocked since the 1980s eec 1990 schreuder 1997 2001 although these discrete connections have been thoroughly investigated the contribution of diffuse recharge to sulphur springs has largely been ignored stewart and mills 1984 found a strong correlation r2 0 90 between the discharge of sulphur springs and the water level at a nearby well romp 66 fig 2 table 1 this relationship indicates a connection between cave water and surrounding matrix stored groundwater florida limestone has maintained much of its primary matrix porosity which communicates easily with any secondary fracture cave porosity that has developed e g martin and dean 2001 thus the response of florida springs to recharge is less punctuated than that of springs primarily fed by swallet sinkhole focused recharge florea and vacher 2006 the contribution of matrix stored groundwater to spring discharge is especially important in florida where evapotranspiration prevents most of wet season precipitation from reaching the aquifer florea and vacher 2007 martin and gordon 2000 because discrete recharge is relatively unimportant to florida springs and because the deterioration of sulphur springs water quality was noticed before the 1980s rosenau et al 1977 the loss of communication with local freshwater swallets is probably not the primary cause of the increasing spring water salinity additionally municipal spring water extraction occurs only during the dry season when water is needed so the pumping induced reduction of spring pool head cannot totally explain the salinity increase hydraulic head levels of distant diffuse recharge areas probably drive the hydrological regime of sulphur springs cave examination of sulphur springs regional hydrogeology in addition to local anthropogenic activity should explain the deterioration of water quality at this site 2 material and methods 2 1 hydrogeology site description of the sulphur springs system three principal lithologic sequences underlie the tampa bay region the uppermost sequence is a collection of unconsolidated sands clays and other sediments tertiary and quaternary which confine an underlying limestone dolomite sequence in descending order this limestone sequence includes the tampa limestone upper oligocene lower miocene a member of the arcadia formation hawthorn group suwannee limestone lower oligocene ocala limestone upper eocene and the avon park formation middle eocene the tampa limestone contains layers of sand and clay and acts as an additional confining unit these limestones dip from the northeast where the suwannee and ocala limestones are exposed at land surface to the southwest where they are confined fig 3 the tampa limestone is exposed throughout the hillsborough river basin fig 3 below this limestone sequence lies a gypsiferous limestone dolomite sequence which is confined by the lower part of the avon park formation these sequences host two distinct aquifers parker et al 1955 the surficial aquifer resides in the shallow clastic sediments while the floridan aquifer lies within the limestones the floridan aquifer is separated into upper and lower zones by the avon park formation confining bed miller 1986 the upper floridan aquifer is hosted by the younger non gypsiferous limestone sequence while the lower floridan aquifer resides in the older gypsiferous limestones the upper floridan aquifer near sulphur springs is further divided into two distinct hydrological units swfwmd 1988 the shallower hydrological unit consists of the suwannee and ocala limestones and the upper and lower boundaries of the suwannee limestone are the most permeable parts of this unit fig 3 in the sulphur springs area the mid suwannee limestone is comprised of thick fine grained wackestone rich layers o sullivan and werner 1991 which could confine the underlying permeable suwannee ocala interface beneath the suwannee ocala interface is the wackestone rich ocala limestone which semiconfines the fractured dolomitic avon park formation the avon park formation hosts the second major hydrological unit of the upper floridan aquifer horizontal hydraulic conductivity in the upper floridan aquifer can range from as low as 0 16 m d 1 in the suwannee limestone robinson 1995 to as high as 6 1 103 m d 1 in the highly cavernous tampa suwannee interface beneath the city of tampa stewart and mills 1984 based on its depth and horizontally persistent morphology sulphur springs cave is likely developed along the cavernous tampa suwannee interface figs 1 and 3 precipitation entering exposures of the suwannee limestone is probably important to the recharge of the sulphur springs artesian system we therefore used the water level recorded at the monitoring well romp 87 as a measure of regional aquifer recharge figs 2 and 3 table 1 this well was bored near a large high elevation exposure of suwannee limestone based on the strong connectivity present between the surficial aquifer and the upper floridan aquifer near romp 87 i e downward vertical gradient head difference of 1 m the portion of the suwannee limestone in which romp 87 was screened was unconfined spechler and kroening 2007 2 2 data collection and analysis major ion na k ca2 mg2 so4 2 cl alkalinity specific conductance water level and discharge measurements from sulphur springs pool and nearby wells were collected and published by the southwest florida water management district swfwmd and by usgs precipitation in the recharge area was measured at the green swamp tower swfwmd station 19053 and local precipitation was measured on the lower hillsborough river near sulphur springs swfwmd station 19436 precipitation data were recorded daily and published online by swfwmd we used gw chart v 1 29 winston 2000 to generate piper diagrams of major ion concentrations from sulphur springs and associated wells although a usgs monitoring station was set up in sulphur springs pool there were no stations deployed within the underlying cave we deployed a long term monitoring station and collected samples for laboratory analysis 100 m linearly into the cave fig 1 we deployed multiprobes hydrolab datasonde hach usa at this station to record depth temperature ph dissolved oxygen and specific conductance hourly we used a spectrophotometer dr 3900 hach usa to measure total organic carbon sulfate sulfide ammonium nitrite nitrate phosphate and alkalinity concentrations of discrete water samples collected in replicates of 3 at the station we collected cave water samples in glass jars with teflon lined lids these jars were acid washed and filled with sterile organic free water until the moment of collection when they were each purged 3 times with helium scuba diving through cave passages allows direct observation of aquifer dynamics and the sampling of water while it remains underground relatively unaffected by surface conditions e g beddows et al 2007 such field work allows researchers to isolate features or organisms that may have a disproportionate impact on the groundwater ecosystem e g brigmon et al 1994 rather than relying on well bore samples sampling was conducted by trained scientific cave divers under the auspices of the university of south florida scientific diving program microbial mat was sampled from the cave walls 5 m upstream from the monitoring station and from a vent located 30 m downstream using 10 ml syringes that were filled with sterile organic free water until collection mat samples were gently homogenized and four 100 µl subsamples individually mixed with 1 phosphate buffered saline solution ten µl of each subsample was mixed with 2 µl of 2 µg ml 1 final concentration dapi stain and 2 µl of 1 µg ml 1 final concentration fm4 64 membrane dye samples 5 µl were placed on glass bottom culture dishes mattek corp usa and covered using 1 agarose pads made with distilled water and multiple fields imaged using fluorescence microscopy deltavision elite ge usa the pcor test function of program r v 3 4 3 was used to run partial correlation analyses ppcor package kim 2015 and the ccf function was used for cross correlations from stats package r development core team 2008 we ran partial correlation analyses to calculate correlation coefficients between two variables while controlling for a third variable cross correlation analyses calculated correlation coefficients between two time series datasets as one of the datasets was incrementally shifted providing lag time information between the datasets e g aquifer level and spring discharge only lag times with the highest correlation coefficient from each analysis were reported in this study alpha values of 0 05 were used for partial correlations 3 results 3 1 specific conductance relationship to hydraulic head compared to the trend observed from 1946 to 2002 specific conductance at sulphur springs began increasing rapidly after 2002 the year that spring water diversions to the lower hillsborough river began fig 4 continuous monitoring of sulphur springs pool began in october 2009 when the usgs installed a gauge in the pool that recorded specific conductance pool level and discharge once every 15 min these data allowed for a high resolution examination of sulphur springs specific conductance trends concurrent to these data were those collected at the romp 87 monitor well which was located near the high elevation suwannee limestone exposure northeast of sulphur springs figs 2 and 3 table 1 water level in the suwannee limestone was recorded in this well once daily the continuous specific conductance profile of sulphur springs pool closely corresponded to the water level in the suwannee limestone exposure except during instances of intense spring water extraction fig 5 all specific conductance values recorded during this study period were higher than those predicted by the pre diversion specific conductance trend generated from data collected from 1946 to 2002 figs 4 and 5 rapid specific conductance spikes in the sulphur springs chemograph corresponded strikingly to intense pumping activity indicated in this analysis by pool levels lower than 1 8 m asl above sea level at levels below 1 8 m asl sulphur springs pool water was too low to flow over its spillway flumes indicating that the rate of extraction was higher than the rate of spring discharge during these periods of pumping specific conductance was strongly negatively correlated to pool level partial correlation controlling for aquifer level r 0 76 p 0 001 n 811 table 2 fig 5 when pool level remained above 1 8 m asl specific conductance spikes still occasionally occurred but correlated more strongly to aquifer level in the suwannee limestone than to pool level partial correlation controlling for pool level r 0 33 p 0 001 n 2129 table 2 fig 5 throughout the entire study period the specific conductance of sulphur springs pool best correlated to pool level while aquifer level had a lesser affect partial correlation analysis controlling for aquifer level r 0 74 p 0 001 n 2940 partial correlation controlling for pool level r 0 60 p 0 001 n 2940

0 001 n 2129 table 2 fig 5 3 2 wet season 2017 hydrograph analysis discharge from sulphur springs was measured by a usgs gauge as pool water flowed over spillway flumes into the lower hillsborough river seasonal groundwater extraction at this site lowered the pool level to a point at which spring water would no longer overflow its impoundment making it impossible to analyze yearly discharge trends from the spring pumps were inactive between 17 june and 30 november 2017 allowing at least for an analysis of wet season discharge during this year aquifer level and spring discharge increased throughout this period peaking with hurricane irma 10 september 2017 fig 6 cross correlation analysis showed that the level of the upper floridan aquifer hosted by the suwannee limestone exposure responded to rainfall within 1 day measured at romp 87 discharge from sulphur springs responded immediately to recharge to the suwannee limestone exposure the two hydrographs correlating with an r2 0 67 the ratio of the maximum to mean discharge observed over this period was 1 4 sulphur springs specific conductance dropped 2 days after local rainfall events this lag matched the time it took for tracer dye to reach sulphur springs when injected into nearby sinkholes stewart and mills 1984 specific conductance correlated weakly to spring discharge during this period r2 0 40 but specific conductance remained high while discharge rate dropped during the latter half of the wet season fig 6 the specific conductance chemograph lagged 25 days behind the aquifer level hydrograph specific conductance eventually dropped in the beginning of november 2017 but leveled off on about the tenth day of that month corresponding to a similar trend observed in suwannee limestone aquifer level fig 6 this increase in hydraulic head was not observed at any other well in the area e g romp 66 fig 6 and did not correspond to any rainfall events groundwater extraction resumed immediately after 30 november 2017 3 3 observations made in sulphur springs cave vents of hydrochemically distinct water contributed to the bulk water of sulphur springs cave these vents were visually apparent because of changes in microbial mat communities on the cave walls mats were normally of a dense consistency 3 5 cm long with a dark brown color fig 7 a but became white and feathery surrounding vents fig 7b fluorescence microscopy showed that brown mats were made up of a mixed microbial community fig 7a i iii while the feathery mats consisted of segmented filaments made up of uniform rod shaped cells that contained intracellular granules fig 7b i iii the white filaments measured 1 0 µm in diameter fig 7b i iii samples of feathery mat contained water that smelled strongly of reduced sulfur compounds when processed in the lab datasonde profiles recorded by divers revealed a particularly influential vent located in the alaska tunnel fig 8 salt vent on 14 october 2001 vent water salinity temperature dissolved oxygen concentration and ph were 17 7 psu 26 1 c 0 00 mg l 1 and 6 39 respectively while that of the orchid tunnel was 1 3 psu 24 9 c 0 07 mg l 1 and 6 84 respectively fig 8 the influence of salt vent water was especially apparent in the alaska tunnel but was even noticeable after it mixed with orchid tunnel water and flowed downstream through the main tunnel fig 8 3 4 well survey and major ion analysis a survey of wells in the sulphur springs area showed that only the tourist club well an artesian groundwater monitoring well screened in the suwannee limestone contained water with a specific conductance comparable to that of the sulphur springs salt vent 10 000 20 000 µs cm 1 figs 1 and 2 table 1 tourist club well was also the closest well to sulphur springs figs 1 and 2 all other wells in the area contained water less saline than the sulphur springs salt vent and tourist club well although those screened at great depths still contained water with specific conductances and chloride concentrations indicative of saltwater contamination i e 250 mg l 1 cl table 1 these wells were the deep sligh park well screened in the avon park formation and two of the hillsborough dam wells screened respectively in the ocala limestone and avon park formation recent specific conductance values measured at these wells were 5586 4442 and 7675 µs cm 1 respectively recent chloride concentrations at these wells were 1520 1170 and 2120 mg l 1 respectively the specific conductances of the tourist club and deep sligh park wells have increased over the past two decades with a similar slope though the specific conductance at deep sligh park exhibited an oscillating pattern fig 9 a specific conductance increased with depth at the hillsborough dam well but did not increase over time at any screened interval fig 9b water levels in wells containing freshwater i e romp 87 romp 66 shallow sligh park table 1 showed seasonal oscillations but had no net head reduction over the past two decades fig 10 between 1946 and 1972 sulphur springs water exhibited a calcium sulfate hydrochemical type since then its hydrochemical character has changed to sodium chloride type fig 11 supplementary table corresponding with the long term specific conductance increase observed at this site fig 4 the nearest freshwater well to sulphur springs romp 66 screened in the tampa and suwannee limestones at a depth encompassing that of sulphur springs cave fig 2 table 1 most recently contained calcium sulfate type water fig 11 supplementary table the tourist club well contained sodium chloride type water fig 11 supplementary table a well near tampa bay widely screened in the suwannee ocala and avon park formation limestones contained water of a specific conductance resembling that of seawater kinder morgan well fig 2 table 1 kinder morgan well water plotted near seawater on a piper diagram falling in the sodium chloride type but was slightly more mineralized with respect to calcium ions fig 11 supplementary table the deep wells surrounding sulphur springs contained sodium chloride type water fig 12 supplementary table the hydrochemical character of the deep sligh park well water shifted from being borderline calcium sulfate type to strongly sodium chloride type fig 12 this trend corresponded with the major specific conductance oscillation observed at this well during the late 2000s fig 9a 4 discussion 4 1 hypotheses for seawater intrusion in sulphur springs cave in general aquifer level rose and stayed high during wet seasons and declined during dry seasons fig 5 pool level tended to stay high during wet seasons and wet years while it was lower throughout dry seasons when pumping occurred specific conductance mostly mirrored aquifer level with a 25 day lag except during periods of lowered pool level when rapid immediate specific conductance spikes would occur specific conductance trends explained by pumping activity and recharge head position are summarized in table 3 it makes intuitive sense that pumping induced pool head reduction could increase the specific conductance of sulphur springs by facilitating the vertical intrusion of salt vent water specific conductance also climbed throughout wet seasons when pumps were inactive and pool level remained high figs 5 and 6 which was unexpected this trend was especially apparent during 2017 when an unusually dry winter was followed by the largest precipitation event recorded in this area during the study period hurricane irma which struck the area on 10 september 2017 figs 5 and 6 when recharge lows accompanied periods when pool level was kept high sulphur springs specific conductance dropped but the water still did not return to being as fresh as it was before the 1960s figs 4 and 5 spring water extraction and subsequent pool lowering usually occurred during dry seasons which prevented sulphur springs from recovering to a low salinity state during many years fig 5 indeed present sulphur springs specific conductance was often 6 fold and sometimes 8 fold higher than it was in 1957 menke et al 1961 and never dropped below 3000 μs cm 1 fig 5 table 2b in the following sections we propose a conceptual model explaining why sulphur springs specific conductance increased gradually over the past century rapidly over the past decades and anomalously during the recharge season fig 13 4 1 1 seawater intrusion conceptual model initial state vertical fractures flexures and subsidence features are common in the limestone underlying west central florida based on seismic reflection surveys conducted on the lower hillsborough river wolansky and thompson 1987 and rivers of neighboring watersheds lewelling et al 1998 trommer et al 2009 the morphology of sulphur springs cave garman 2010 indicates the presence of vertical fractures in the immediate area which have contributed to the speleogenesis of the cave vertical bedrock fractures act as preferential groundwater flow paths and can be conduits for saline water intrusion into freshwater layers if they breach one or multiple confining units e g spechler 1994 their fig 37 the salt vents found in sulphur springs cave are probably termini of fractures which must either intercept the coastal mixing zone similar to the chasm cave in south australia wood and harrington 2015 or draw up mixing zone water by providing an avenue of reduced head similar to how saline groundwater upcones toward depressed potentiometric surfaces produced by extraction wells e g bower et al 1999 vertical intrusion of saline groundwater into overlying freshwater has also been observed in the absence of wells this natural phenomenon has been attributed to the reduced potentiometric head generated by discharging springs tellam et al 1986 and to rapid upward groundwater movement through aquitard breaching fractures in artesian systems de louw et al 2010 in the pre extraction state of the sulphur springs system fig 13a variations in spring pool head controlled the influence of vertically migrating saline water menke et al 1961 p 42 this indicates that the sulphur springs salt vents were active before pumping began in the 1950s menke et al 1961 p 41 found no evidence of saline water in the suwannee limestone around sulphur springs and suggested that saline water must be moving up through fractures from below the ocala limestone confining unit i e the avon park formation the wet season salinity increases observed during the present study period were not mentioned in previous studies of sulphur springs menke et al 1961 rosenau et al 1977 stewart and mills 1984 4 1 2 seawater intrusion conceptual model dry season pumping upper floridan aquifer levels surrounding tampa bay can seasonally drop to lower than 6 m below sea level especially in areas of major groundwater extraction activity hickey 1981 hutchinson 1983 trommer 1993 this would allow for landward groundwater movement and for seawater to recharge the coastal aquifer in tampa the extent of the coastal groundwater mixing zone is at least 16 km inland from tampa bay hickey 1981 trommer 1993 in highly permeable zones such as the avon park formation this boundary can extend even farther sulphur springs cave lies well within this transition zone being situated only 10 km north of the bay fig 1 pumps were installed in sulphur springs pool in 1964 and were modified in 2002 to allow for spring water to be diverted to below the hillsborough river reservoir dam the intense pumping activity observed since 2011 lowered sulphur springs pool level to near and occasionally equal to or below sea level fig 5 table 2b such activity could have led to rapid local seawater intrusion as head pressure above each one of the fractures intersecting sulphur springs cave dropped whenever municipal pumps drew down the spring pool seasonal rainfall patterns and groundwater extraction in the tampa bay region and at sulphur springs caused the potentiometric head of the upper floridan aquifer to oscillate dramatically although there was no net annual loss in freshwater head around sulphur springs cave fig 10 natural oscillation of the freshwater saltwater interface would be enhanced by extraction activity potentially causing the mixing zone to expand over time based on the rinsing principle developed by wentworth 1948 and invoked more recently by researchers explaining controls on mixing zone thickness fratesi 2013 rotzoll et al 2010 unstable saltwater upconing can additionally expand an already wide mixing zone and cause a well or spring to draw increasingly saline groundwater bear et al 2001 werner et al 2009 these mechanisms probably contributed to the salinity increase of sulphur springs water occurring slowly since 1964 fig 13b and rapidly since 2002 fig 13c over time the fractures intersecting sulphur springs cave would have drawn water from deeper and deeper into the coastal mixing zone while the mixing zone itself was expanding and introducing increasingly saline water to shallower depths 4 1 3 seawater intrusion conceptual model wet season recharge long term pool head reduction due to pumping would have increased the frequency and time that deep sourced saline groundwater resided in the fractures intersecting sulphur springs cave because matrix porosity communicates freely with fractures and voids in eogenetic karst this vertically infiltrating saline water likely leaked from fractures and migrated laterally into the shallow suwannee limestone underlying sulphur springs cave fig 13b and c this mechanism is similar to that proposed by spechler 1994 to explain salinization of the fractured floridan aquifer in northeastern florida stewart and mills 1984 reported that the specific conductance and chloride concentrations of the tourist club well screened in the suwannee limestone near sulphur springs had steadily increased during the 1970s and 1980s in 1963 specific conductance and chloride concentrations in this well were as low as 1000 µs cm 1 and 200 mg l 1 respectively stewart and mills 1984 from 1991 to 2017 specific conductance at this well never dropped below 9900 µs cm 1 and reached values higher than 19 000 µs cm 1 fig 9a with chloride concentrations as high as 5750 mg l 1 supplementary table in summary the specific conductance of suwannee limestone groundwater nearby sulphur springs increased concurrently with that of sulphur springs water this saline groundwater was present no deeper than 97 m below land surface the maximum screened interval of the tourist club well table 1 corresponding to the depth of wackestone rich suwannee limestone layers this phenomenon was only observed in the immediate sulphur springs area as data from other local wells screened at similar intervals did not indicate specific conductance increases table 1 the low maximum to mean discharge ratio of sulphur springs 1 4 during the 2017 wet season supports the idea that diffuse recharge to exposures of the cave s parent limestone drove spring discharge more than did recharge to discrete locations i e sinkholes florea and vacher 2006 when recharge events occurred the immediate response of sulphur springs discharge was primarily due to the propagation of a pressure wave through the system with direct stormwater input from nearby sinkholes being less important discrete recharge still seemed to impact sulphur springs cave however by introducing rainwater directly to the system and producing short lived decreases in specific conductance fig 6 input from discrete recharge points probably introduced surface derived nutrients and oxygen to the cave as well despite the short lived influence that discrete recharge had on sulphur springs specific conductance at this site increased throughout wet seasons figs 5 and 6 during the 2017 wet season spring discharge responded immediately to suwannee limestone recharge with both factors peaking after hurricane irma 10 september 2017 fig 6 the turbulent movement of groundwater through the cave and could have entrained salt vent water and mixed it with bulk cave water but because specific conductance at the spring continued to increase long after seasonal discharge peaked fig 6 this is an unlikely mechanism of sulphur springs salinization diffuse suwannee limestone recharge best correlated to specific conductance when recharge was lagged 25 days fig 6 this 25 day delay might have corresponded to the travel time that saline groundwater from fracture leakage in the shallow suwannee limestone took to migrate to the spring head after it was pressurized by recharge fig 13d a similar mechanism was recently proposed by bicalho et al 2017 to explain mineralization trends at lez spring in southern france groundwater discharging from the karstic lez spring became increasingly mineralized for short periods after the occurrence of recharge events large enough to raise regional aquifer head to near saturation levels bicalho et al 2012 2017 the source of mineralized water in this artesian system was a confined layer of evaporites from which saline groundwater migrated vertically through confinement breaching faults then leaked from the faults and moved laterally into the main aquifer creating shallow reservoir of slightly saline water bicalho et al 2017 invoked the concept of piston flow groundwater movement to explain the contribution of mineralized water to lez spring discharge after large rainfall events under piston flow conditions intense recharge increases aquifer hydraulic gradients which deepens groundwater flow paths and mobilizes deeper long residence time waters this concept is commonly used in the karst aquifer literature to explain sporadic recharge induced discharge of mineralized spring water desmarais and rojstaczer 2002 lopez chicano et al 2001 at sulphur springs the increasingly saline matrix stored groundwater screened by the tourist club well beneath sulphur springs cave probably resided below the wackestone rich layers of suwannee limestone identified in a nearby florida geological survey lithology fig 2 o sullivan and werner 1991 the wackestone confined saline groundwater would have received more artesian pressure for any given recharge event than would freshwater in overlying aquifer units fig 13d the presence of multiple leaky confining units in the sulphur springs hydrogeological system makes this a multi story artesian system described by klimchouk 2017 with hydrochemically distinct water residing in each story this explains the increase in sulphur springs specific conductance observed throughout wet seasons better than does the piston flow concept recharge induced mineralization at lez spring occurred sporadically and lasted on the order of a few days before specific conductance levels returned to normal even while aquifer head remained high bicalho et al 2012 their fig 6 bicalho et al 2017 their fig 4 specific conductance at sulphur springs increased almost continuously throughout the 2017 wet season and continued to stay high for about a month beyond peak aquifer level fig 6 this pattern was mostly observed throughout the rest of the study period and was supported by our partial correlation analyses fig 5 table 2 for the sulphur springs system the aquifer level specific conductance partial correlation coefficient we calculated when the pool level remained 1 8 m asl was higher than that for the pool level specific conductance partial correlation coefficient under the same conditions though statistically significant the coefficient was low r 0 33 table 2a indicating that there must be another variable that our simple conceptual model did not consider other variables affecting sulphur springs specific conductance trends could include subtidal sea level variations water levels in local sinkholes or artesian pressure in the avon park formation where the intruding seawater wedge likely resides 4 2 well survey and hydrochemical evidence the tourist club well was screened at an interval encompassing the suwannee limestone above and below a wackestone layer and has experienced an increase in specific conductance since at least 1971 stewart and mills 1984 fig 9a no other suwannee limestone screened wells in the area showed evidence of seawater intrusion table 1 a deeper well located southwest of sulphur springs i e deep sligh park screened in the avon park formation showed an increasing specific conductance trend similar to that of the tourist club well fig 9a table 1 suggesting an upward migration or expansion of the coastal mixing zone in this area another well screened at a similar depth as the deep sligh park well located southeast of sulphur springs i e hillsborough dam avon park contained more saline water but did not experience an increase in specific conductance fig 9b potentiometric head above the hillsborough dam well was less likely to oscillate since it is located near a large reservoir perhaps explaining why specific conductance did not increase here most recently the saline water found in sulphur springs and tourist club well was hydrochemically similar to modern seawater fig 11 based on the relatively high sulfate concentrations they measured at sulphur springs menke et al 1961 hypothesized that the source of the vertically infiltrating saline water was not seawater but instead gypsum influenced water from below the ocala limestone confinement indeed based on our analysis of historical data sulphur springs water in the 1950s and 1960s fell into the calcium sulfate type fig 11 the same analysis of more recent measurements suggested that the increasing specific conductance of sulphur springs was due to the influence of sodium chloride type water fig 11 the sulfate enriched water influencing sulphur springs hydrochemistry must have been sourced from freshwater portions of the tampa and suwannee limestones since this type of water is found in well romp 66 fig 11 future stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope analysis of sulphur springs salt vent water will clarify if this water is indeed intruding modern seawater and not residual pleistocene seawater leftover from a past high sea level stand hydrochemical analysis reported by trommer 1993 p 13 suggested that the aquifer in our study area has been flushed of residual seawater and therefore that groundwater mineralization in the area is a result of freshwater mixing with intruding modern seawater our analysis of major ion data provided by swfwmd at least made it clear that the vertically infiltrating water was not sourced from the lower floridan aquifer which contains calcium sulfate type water e g moore et al 2009 spechler 1994 4 3 ecosystem impacts of saltwater intrusion and conservation of sulphur springs cave throughout 2017 nutrient concentrations were measured from bulk water from the sampling station in the cave data not shown the cave was oligotrophic and the only nutrient concentration to correlate with specific conductance was that of sulfide which varied between 0 5 5 µg l 1 partial correlation controlling for date r 0 98 p 0 022 n 7 the long residing anoxic saline groundwater migrating vertically into sulphur springs cave was therefore probably rich in sulfide this was corroborated by the observation that sulphur springs cave salt vent water had a strong sulfidic odor while bulk cave water did not sulfide is usually present in anoxic groundwaters where sulfate or sulfur concentrations are also high and is produced by sulfur reducing bacteria while sulfide seems to be another tracer of salt vent influence its presence might also have an impact on the cave ecosystem based on their morphology and ecological niche the feathery white microbial mats growing near sulphur springs cave salt vents are likely sulfide oxidizing gammaproteobacteria similar to those found in frasassi cave italy macalady et al 2006 any sulfide oxidizing bacteria living in sulphur springs cave could produce sulfuric acid as a metabolic byproduct enhancing limestone dissolution engel et al 2004 enhanced speleogenesis would primarily enlarge salt vents around which the acid producing bacteria live leading to an increased rate of vertical infiltration as fracture diameter grows additionally sulfide is toxic to aquatic macro organisms see tobler et al 2011 so increased sulfide concentrations in the sulphur springs system would be detrimental to the cave spring and downstream ecosystems over the past century the hydrochemistry of water in sulphur springs cave has increasingly resembled that of its salt vents figs 4 5 and 8 the brown microbial mats observed on the cave walls contained varying amounts of white filaments and microscope images of brown mat samples showed that the segmented filaments characteristic of the feathery mats are sometimes present fig 7a i iii as municipal groundwater extraction alters the sulphur springs cave ecosystem conditions will probably favor the growth of sulfur oxidizing bacteria at the cost of brown iron cycling sulfur reducing bacteria metabolic capability of brown sulphur springs cave mats was determined by garman 2010 p 82 a community overhaul by sulfur oxidizers would possibly lead to enhanced dissolution of the cave which underlies a busy highway in metropolitan tampa additionally while garman 2010 usually recorded the presence of dissolved oxygen in sulphur springs cave on dives conducted in the early 2000s fig 8 the main tunnel was anoxic for all of 2017 except for during a few days in november data not shown some tunnels of sulphur springs cave are home to stygobitic crustaceans garman 2010 if dissolved oxygen levels throughout the entire cave currently drop to zero for many months at a time sulphur springs cave may no longer be able to support these rare cave adapted animals the specific conductance of sulphur springs has increased rapidly since diversions to the lower hillsborough river began in 2002 fig 4 as specific conductance continues to increase it is likely that associated factors such as sulfide concentrations anoxia temperature and acidity will increase as well to effectively conserve the ecosystem of this urban cave alternative methods of supporting the minimum flows of the lower hillsborough river are needed this is especially apparent in the observation that eventually sulphur springs water will no longer be able to support low salinity habitat in the river below the dam 5 conclusions sulphur springs specific conductance has increased 10 fold from 500 µs cm 1 to 5000 µs cm 1 or higher and has changed from being of calcium sulfate type to sodium chloride type since 1946 long before groundwater extraction at this site began vents issuing saline water in sulphur springs cave were likely connected to bedrock fractures which breached confining units and either intercepted or upconed coastal mixing zone water the dynamic annual timescale specific conductance trends observed at sulphur springs were primarily caused by interactions between aquifer head and anthropogenic manipulation of spring pool level dry season specific conductance spikes in sulphur springs cave were explained by municipal pumping activity and subsequent pool level lowering while wet season specific conductance highs were probably due to regional aquifer recharge disproportionately pressurizing confined saline groundwater units the decadal timescale specific conductance increase at this site was probably related to anthropogenic changes in coastal mixing zone position and shape if current trends continue sulphur springs water may eventually become unsuitable for the maintenance of low salinity habitat in the lower hillsborough river our model focuses on the water levels of the sulphur springs pool and the regional upper floridan aquifer the two most likely forces which drive specific conductance trends at sulphur springs it does not include the possible effect of subtidal sea level variations water levels in hydraulically connected sinkholes or artesian pressure variation in deeper confined aquifer units that could host the seawater wedge our study does demonstrate the effect of direct groundwater extraction from coastal karst and the importance of considering regional hydrogeology when interpreting the dynamics of local scale features although coastal karst features are easy targets for groundwater extraction the complexity of these systems makes them vulnerable to mismanagement the increasing urbanization of coasts will surely impact these unique ecosystems throughout the world but their deterioration can be prevented by the development of science based karst aquifer management plans acknowledgments this work was supported by the cave research foundation philip m smith graduate research award and a research grant from
