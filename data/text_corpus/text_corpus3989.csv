19945,nitrous oxides n2o emissions contribute to climate change and stratospheric ozone depletion wastewater treatment is an important yet likely underestimated source of n2o emissions as recent long term monitoring campaigns have demonstrated however the available data are insufficient to representatively estimate countrywide emission due to the brevity of most monitoring campaigns this study showed that the emission estimates can be significantly improved using an advanced approach based on multiple continuous long term monitoring campaigns in monitoring studies on 14 full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps we found a strong variability in the yearly emission factors efs 0 1 to 8 of the incoming nitrogen load which exhibited a good correlation with effluent nitrite but countrywide data on nitrite effluent concentrations is very limited and unavailable for emission estimation in many countries hence we propose a countrywide emission factor calculated from the weighted efs of three wwtp categories carbon removal ef 0 1 8 nitrification only 1 8 and full nitrogen removal 0 9 however ef of carbon removal wwtps are still highly uncertain given the expected variability in performance the newly developed approach allows representative country specific estimations of the n2o emissions from wwtp applied to switzerland the estimations result in an average ef of 0 9 to 3 6 and total emissions of 410 to 1690 tn2o n year which corresponds to 0 3 1 4 of the total greenhouse gas emissions in switzerland our results demonstrate that better data availability and an improved understanding of long term monitoring campaigns is crucial to improve current emission estimations finally our results confirm several measures to mitigate n2o emissions from wastewater treatment year round denitrification limiting nitrite accumulation and stringent control of sludge age in carbon removal plants graphical abstract image graphical abstract introduction nitrous oxide n2o emissions contribute substantially to climate change ipcc 2014 and stratospheric ozone depletion ravishankara et al 2009 the atmospheric n2o concentration is expected to rise until the middle of the 21st century tian et al 2020 wastewater treatment plants wwtps and their n2o production are currently often underestimated emission processes in national greenhouse gas ghg inventories estimations of countrywide n2o emissions are based on assumed emission factors efs efs in the standard reporting guidelines are much lower 0 03 to 0 14 daelman et al 2015 ipcc 2006 than reported long term full scale measurements with the refinement of the ipcc methodology in 2019 increased efs of 0 01 to 2 9 appeared in the reporting guidelines ipcc 2019 in wastewater treatment n2o formation is primarily caused by biological nitrogen removal through nitrification and denitrification kampschreur et al 2009 the main production processes are the biological stage in the water lines of wwtps kosonen et al 2016 and the side stream treatment for reject water from the sludge lines joss et al 2009 kampschreur et al 2008b emissions of n2o produced on wwtps can occur either on site or in receiving waters if dissolved n2o is discharged mikola et al 2014 marescaux et al 2018 however roughly 80 of the n2o emissions from wwtps are released in the aerated zone of biological treatment baeten et al 2020 chen et al 2019 quantifying representative efs at the biological stage of wwtps requires continuous long term monitoring campaigns due to the substantial daily variation and seasonality of emissions daelman et al 2013 a strong seasonal emission pattern with high emission in spring and low emissions in autumn was previously shown in several long term monitoring campaigns gujer 2020 however only six continuous monitoring campaigns of at least one year s duration have been reported to our knowledge chen et al 2019 daelman et al 2015 gruber et al 2020 kosonen et al 2016 five of these studies were conducted in temperate climates with a monthly mean temperature of over 10 c during 4 7 months belda et al 2014 the ef assessed 0 8 2 9 of the total nitrogen loads were shown to be substantially higher than those found by many short term campaigns chen et al 2019 daelman et al 2015 gruber et al 2020 kosonen et al 2016 vasilaki et al 2019 the causes of the wide range of efs assessed are still unknown vasilaki et al 2019 hence we conclude that additional online long term monitoring campaigns are much needed to better characterize the variability from n2o emissions in full scale wwtps ultimately a broad data basis is crucial for countrywide assessment of the n2o efs from wastewater treatment various approaches have been suggested for the extrapolation of n2o emissions from wwtps at countrywide level ramirez melgarejo et al 2020 the standard approach is described by the ipcc guidelines ipcc 2006 which are designed to be calculated with generally accessible variables consequently the approach leads to high uncertainties of the total emission estimates for two reasons firstly in a top down approach the nitrogen load to wwtps is estimated from a country s protein consumption resulting in substantial differences compared to a bottom up approach using measured nitrogen influent loads to wwtps ramirez melgarejo et al 2020 secondly the ipcc guidelines suggest a uniform ef independent of the type of wwtp ipcc 2006 the assumption of a uniform ef leads to high uncertainties due to the wide range of efs reported for different types of wwtps cadwallader and van briesen 2017 and poorly described key factors characterizing n2o efs vasilaki et al 2019 several methods have been suggested to overcome these shortcomings arising from short term monitoring campaigns ahn et al 2010 valkova et al 2020 however the integration of continuous long term monitoring campaigns on different process types is needed to obtain the most accurate estimates for countrywide n2o efs here we propose a refined approach to estimating n2o emissions from wwtps based on the efs of a dozen long term monitoring campaigns on full scale wwtps in switzerland to acquire a broad data basis we conducted seven monitoring campaigns of at least one year s duration on full scale wwtps using an adaptation of the flux chamber method gruber et al 2020 additionally we extracted the same results from seven long term monitoring campaigns reported in literature daelman et al 2015 kosonen et al 2016 gruber et al 2020 we used spearman s correlation analysis to characterize key variables of a wwtp to predict n2o efs we use our results to link the variables to patterns detected in our monitoring campaigns to provide experimental evidence for the correlations found and we conducted full scale tests on one wwtp to prove concepts from the correlation analysis finally we propose a method for calculating n2o emissions for switzerland and compare it with the methods described in the ipcc guidelines ipcc 2006 2019 regarding total emissions and corresponding uncertainties material methods monitoring approach n2o emissions were assessed using an adapted version of the flux chamber method as described in gruber et al 2020 fig 1 in total five different setups based on the same general concept were applied to monitor the emission on seven wwtps see diagrams in the supporting information si in short all discontinuously fed reactors were equipped with a flux chamber on wwtps with continuously fed lanes one or more lanes were monitored each with three or more flux chambers per lane placed on the aerated compartments in contrast to the standard method chandran et al 2016 a chamber surface 1 m2 with an open outlet was used and therefore sample gas was not recirculated to the flux chamber after measurement a sample of the gas flowing through the chamber was diverted at the outlet through a tube with a length of up to a few hundred meters to the central monitoring station where the off gas was measured in a non dispersive infrared analyser x stream emerson st louis mo usa prior to the measurement the off gas was dehumidified by cooling to 4 c jcp sl jct wiener neustadt aut or tc standard pke 521 bühler ratingen ger to monitor the entire biological treatment at multiple sampling points and on various lanes up to 14 floating hoods can be connected to our system over three way valves parker lucifer type 7131kbg2jv00 cleveland usa while one of the valves is open to the measurement line the other channels are purged with a pump me 2 nt vaccubrand wertheim ger to ensure a constant flow through all the tubes the constant flow is considered important for two reasons i to reduce system response time and thus allow fast switching between valves 1 min per measurement and ii to avoid freezing of sampling tubes due to humidity in tubing and cold temperatures the system is controlled with a programmable logical controller plc type wago 750 881 which provides two key functions i switching between the valves and ii analogue digital signal conversion and data storage key control variables of the system are a flowmeter mems flow sensor d6f 10a6 000 omron kyoto jp in the sample gas duct a paramagnetic oxygen sensor in the gas analyser x stream emerson st louis mo usa and a humidity sensor kw1 jct wiener neustadt aut after the pre treatment the flowmeter allows detection of malfunctioning across the whole system or in specific channels when the measured flow drops below a set threshold the oxygen sensor signals substantial leaks in the channel when oxygen concentration is close to atmospheric concentrations and does not show variation finally the humidity sensor is used as a binary sensor in case of humidity after the pre treatment the measurement is switched off to prevent the analyser malfunctioning as a second barrier against water entering the analyser a protection filter is installed directly after the pre treatment a field computer is used to parametrize the plc additionally the field computer establishes data transmission to a data server via the secure file transfer protocol sftp and a 3 g modem imon u300 insys icom regensburg ger on the data server the monitoring data is processed and synchronized with the operational data of the wwtps and visualized on demand the operators of the wwtps assessed lab data on concentrations of total nitrogen nitrogen species and cod sampled from influent effluent primary clarifier effluent biological treatment and effluent wwtp at various intervals operational data on influent flow air supply wastewater temperature dissolved oxygen concentrations was acquired over the wwtp s supervisory control and data acquisition scada system a detailed description of the monitoring setup can be found in the si wwtp selection and monitoring campaigns the seven wwtps monitored were selected to represent the range of nutrient removal goals set and common types of processes installed in wwtps in switzerland table 1 common removal goals are i carbon removal ii nitrification and iii denitrification common processes include various types of activated sludge as systems such as plug flow conventional activated sludge cas anoxic aerobic ao anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2o alternatingly fed intermittently aerated a i and sequencing batch reactors sbr and biofilm systems hybrid fixed bed and activated sludge ifas fixed bed fb we sought to represent various types of wwtp size classes table 1 monitoring campaigns were conducted over at least 1 year flux chambers were placed on lanes in accordance with the monitoring strategy proposed in gruber et al 2020 see section 2 1 and si the monitoring campaigns reported in gruber et al 2020 were included in the selection additionally data from three long term monitoring campaigns of previous studies was included for the statistical analysis of the data chen et al 2019 daelman et al 2015 kosonen et al 2016 these studies include data on one ao process and two carrousel carr activated sludge processes detailed information on the wwtps monitored and the results of the newly conducted monitoring campaigns can be found in the si n2o emission and ef calculation the net n2o flux for a specific lane was computed with the approach presented by aboobakar et al 2013 from the airflow supplied to each reactor section equipped with a flux chamber and the respective n2o concentration when gaps between two consecutive data points did not exceed 30 min n2o concentrations were linearly interpolated data gaps longer than 30 min were excluded see table s1 in the si the air flow supplied to the reactor was estimated with three different methods depending on the wwtp i from the blower speed and the blower specification provided by the plant operators ii by measurement of the total air flow provided to a treatment lane or iii by measurement of the air flow provided to a compartment of the treatment lane the airflow was recorded at intervals of 1 min and emissions were calculated in 1 min intervals only for the aerated phases emissions from the whole treatment plant were extrapolated according to suggestions made in gruber et al 2020 when wastewater loadings were expected to differ or operation strategies to change all lanes were monitored but lanes with comparable process performance and operation were assumed to emit comparable quantities of n2o n2o efs were calculated with eq 1 for the whole duration of the monitoring campaigns gruber et al 2020 aboobakar et al 2013 for the monitoring campaigns that were substantially longer than 1 year 3 months we evaluated the efs for all possible data sets of 1 year and calculated their average and standard deviation in the newly conducted monitoring campaigns of more than 15 months the yearly average efs did not exhibit substantial variation efs always refer to the yearly average influent nitrogen load of the wwtps calculated based on 24 hour composite samples the samples were taken and analysed by the operators of the wwtps every 5 to 14 days where nitrogen influent measurements were not available we estimated the influent nitrogen load by evaluating a nitrogen mass balance over the primary clarifier based on typical values for mass flow coefficients from standard textbooks gujer 2007 tchobanoglous et al 2014 because at least effluent loads of the primary clarifier were available in every case figure s3 si all monitoring data and the values for the nitrogen loads can be found in the si 1 e f n 2 o d 1 365 m 1 1440 c n 2 o m d q a i

meta data and correlation analysis the correlation analysis included key figures and performance indicators that were collected for each wwtp spearman rank correlation was used to study the

si if possible we collected and calculated values for the total nitrogen and cod loads at the influent and the effluent of the biological treatment and of the wwtps additionally we collected values on nitrite no2 concentration in the effluent of the biological treatment the input variables for the correlation analysis are summarized in table s2 si all statistical calculations were performed using python programming language version 3 8 3 van rossum and drake 2009 and the pandas mckinney 2010 numpy harris et al 2020 and scipy packages virtanen et al 2020 full scale tests at the hofen wwtp we conducted full scale experiments to compare the effects on n2o emissions of a pre denitrification zone with those of a fully oxic process at the hofen wwtp see si for further details the plant has an ao activated sludge process consisting of six lanes where two lanes use the same clarifier and sludge recycle si every lane consists of three zones with an equal size of which the first zone is typically anoxic four of the six lanes were monitored lane 1 1 lane 2 1 lane 2 2 and lane 3 2 whereas lane 2 1 and lane 2 2 share the same secondary clarifier lane 1 1 and lane 3 2 are independent of each other between february and april 2020 the first of three zones on two lanes lanes 2 1 and 3 2 were fully aerated the exact dates and durations for each experiment are given in table 2 extrapolation to the whole of switzerland and uncertainty estimation countrywide n2o emissions were estimated by multiplying the total nitrogen load to the wwtp and different estimates of the efs from

the swiss implementation of the 2006 ipcc guidelines the ef applied was 0 032 as suggested by the guidelines a standard deviation could not be calculated for the resulting countrywide emission because

2011 strähl et al 2013 we assumed the same fractions of wwtp types and extrapolated the nitrogen loads found in the dataset to the wwtps treating the remaining 30 of the wastewater in switzerland an overview of the data set is provided in section s6 si countrywide emissions in approaches c and d were calculated according to eq 4 approach d was calculated for two scenarios d1 incorporates a high

monitoring campaigns the monitoring campaigns studied showed a yearly n2o ef ranging from 0 1 to 8 of the total influent nitrogen load fig 2 the range of ef is significantly wider than has been reported from previous long term monitoring campaigns 1 1 to 2 9 mainly due to the high ef of the giubiasco wwtp whose treatment goal is carbon removal the average value of 1 6 for all studies is comparable to the value proposed in the updated ipcc guidelines ipcc 2019 however the high standard deviation of the average ef 2 equivalent to 125 of the mean value shows clearly that using average efs for countrywide extrapolations leads to very high uncertainties which is in line with previous research valkova et al 2020 characterizing the n2o ef of a wwtp depending from key indicators is therefore essential for the robust calculation of countrywide efs none of the explanatory factors displayed in fig 2 exhibits a strong relation with the n2o ef while nitrogen removal efficiency displays a weak and insignificant correlation r 0 51 p 0 06 fig 3 treatment size does not correlate at all with n2o ef r 0 002 p 0 99 fig 3 the low relevance of the reactor configuration and the treatment process can be only discussed qualitatively due to the low number of monitoring campaigns for different processes firstly flow through activated sludge systems exhibited a wide range of efs 0 08 8 n 6 the systems monitored with our setup with an anoxic zone during the whole year processes ao and a2o n 3 did not exceed an ef of 0 3 the very low efs are not in line with the value 1 9 for the viikinmäki wwtp which uses with an ao process this dissimilarity may be explained by the difference between its influent conditions viikinmäki is served by a separated sewer system and the climate in finland differs from that of central europe kosonen et al 2016 moreover the nitrogen removal efficiency of the biological treatment is 60 quite low compared to the other ao and a2o systems fig 2 secondly the efs of two activated sludge plants with sbr configuration differed substantially 0 3 vs 2 3 as their nutrient removal goal differed nitrification vs denitrification previously sbr systems were reported to cause generally higher n2o emissions vasilaki et al 2019 but our results indicate that low efs can be reached in sbr systems too thirdly the two a i activated sludge systems varied substantially 0 2 vs 0 8 even though they shared the same removal goal denitrification finally both biofilm systems monitored had a high ef 1 4 which is closely in line with previously reported values bollon et al 2016 the systems monitored by daelman et al 2015 at kralingseveer wwtp and chen et al 2019 at avedøre wwtp have carrousel reactors for the biological treatment and exhibited high efs 1 1 and 2 9 respectively the efs assessed by other research groups are higher on average this might be linked to the monitoring approach in contrast to our flux chamber based monitoring approach the other monitoring campaigns were conducted using i measurement of dissolved n2o in the biological treatment combined with a stripping model and ii the measurement of the collected off gas of covered wwtp the study by chen et al 2019 used approach i and resulted in an ef similar to that found in this study the studies by daelman et al 2015 and kosonen et al 2016 used approach ii and reported very high efs despite high nitrogen removal in the biological treatment unlike the flux chamber approach emissions from unaerated zones in the biological treatment and secondary clarification can be assessed using approaches i and ii however the relative contribution of these emissions has been found to be of minor importance chen et al 2019 mikola et al 2014 three main sources of uncertainty arise when using the flux chamber method for monitoring n2o emissions from the aerated zone in the biological treatment firstly inhomogeneous air supply within the biological treatment due to preferential flows of air and aging of the membrane aerators can locally affect airflow rates and calculated emissions substantially to reduce those uncertainties we used a multi flux chamber approach with at least three flux chambers per lane to cover the full range of off gas concentrations within a treatment lane secondly inhomogeneity in nutrient and sewage loading of parallel lanes in a wwtp may contribute to variation in the emissions between lanes which remains unobserved if not all lanes are monitored gruber et al 2020 thirdly the quality of air flow and blower data differs highly between plants ranging from blower frequency data of single blowers supplying several lanes to air flow meters installed in each zone of a treatment lane to quantify the relevance of the uncertainties and compare the off gas monitoring approaches a study comparing all monitoring approaches applied on one wwtp is needed variables relevant for yearly n2o ef fig 3 shows that the ef displays the highest and only statistically significant correlation with the effluent no2 load expressed as a fraction of the incoming nitrogen load similarly concentration peaks coincided with n2o emissions peaks at wwtp with high ef where no2 effluent concentrations were measured giubiasco lucerne kralingseveer no2 accumulation has previously been linked to high n2o emissions in nitritation denitrification systems kampschreur et al 2008a peng et al 2015 a negative correlation with nitrogen removal efficiency was expected because denitrifying communities have a high capacity to scavenge n2o produced during both anoxic and aerobic conditions which has been demonstrated in lab and full scale wwtp studies conthe et al 2018 rodriguez caballero et al 2015 however a few wwtps lucerne avedøre and most strikingly kralingseveer had a high ef factor 1 despite high nitrogen removal efficiency most likely due to nitrite accumulation excluding the kralingseveer wwtp data from the correlation analysis results in a strong and substantial relation between the ef and nitrogen removal efficiencies r 0 73 p 0 005 other variables that could potentially be linked to n2o did not show significant correlation nitrogen loading specific reactor volume c to n ratio at inflow aerobic srt and wwtp utilization average design load however yearly average values are only partly useful for such correlation analysis because seasonal peak phases are not well represented vasilaki et al 2018 nevertheless we conclude from the relations found that countrywide estimations can be improved by considering three factors governing the n2o ef of a wwtp i seasonal emission pattern and no2 accumulation ii all year denitrification and iii unstable nitrification these factors are discussed in the following sections seasonal emission pattern and no2 accumulation a strong and reproducible emission pattern has been found in our own n2o emission monitoring campaign and in all previous studies except for the viikinmäki study fig 4 emissions typically peaked in march april or may and dropped over several months to a minimum in september or october hence we analysed the seasonal emission pattern of the long term monitoring campaigns for all biological nutrient removal bnr activated sludge processes in temperate climates since this category represents the majority n 10 of the wwtps monitored the analysis of seasonality is considered representative because for some wwtps more than 1 year of data were available uster lucerne altenrhein and the observations represent independent measurements of comparable processes during different years the seasonal emission pattern with a high emission peak in march or april was only apparent in five of the monitoring campaigns fig 4 group g1 panel a two wwtps exhibited a shifted pattern with extended peaks between april and july group g2 panel b and three wwtps featured a rather uniform pattern with only occasional peaks group g3 panel c the average ef was significantly higher for the wwtps exhibiting the seasonal ef than those without mann whitney wilcoxon u 3095 p 6 10 4 fig 4 panel d only one of the wwtps with an emission peak in march or april had an ef clearly below 1 moossee wwtp wwtps with a seasonal emission pattern emitted mostly between february and may the high contribution of the emission peak phase to the total emissions highlights the strong need to better understand the causes of the seasonal emission pattern chen et al 2019 additionally it signifies that emission reduction strategies should be based and tested on long term monitoring campaigns covering at least 1 year duan et al 2020 the reproducibility of the emission pattern on wwtps with high ef panel a b and between different lanes in a wwtp suggests that monitoring n2o emissions over 1 year is sufficient on several wwtps lucerne uster kralingseveer the pattern could be partly linked to no2 accumulation in biological treatment during the spring season we hypothesize that reduced no2 oxidizing bacteria nob performance could be the cause of seasonal no2 accumulation gruber et al 2021 vieira et al 2018 and lead to n2o peak emissions induced by enhanced nitrifier denitrification or incomplete heterotrophic denitrification the emission pattern and the emission peaks in spring help to prioritize efforts to mitigate n2o emissions but the high impact on the yearly ef is problematic for a countrywide extrapolation based on only a few monitoring campaigns since the frequency of wwtps with seasonal peaks is unknown additionally no2 effluent concentrations do not fully represent the no2 concentrations in the reactors because no2 can accumulate locally in a wwtp or even within sludge flocs chen et al 2018 as a consequence monitoring of n2o emission patterns at wwtps with plug flow characteristics or multiple biological treatment steps such as the kralingseveer wwtp may be less accurate if effluent concentrations are used or if concentrations are sampled only at one location for such cases extensive monitoring of nitrogen species at a range of locations may be advantageous in order to avoid no2 accumulation all year denitrification appears to be an efficient strategy wwtps without seasonal emission patterns birs zurich and hofen or with low efs moossee had a very low proportion of no2 in the effluent of the biological treatment 0 2 0 5 relative to the yearly nitrogen influent load all of these wwtps practise all year denitrification year round denitrification and n2o reduction to test the seasonally varying influence of an anoxic zone and denitrification on n2o emissions full scale tests were performed at the hofen wwtp some wwtps in switzerland are operated for nitrogen removal year round whereas other treatment plants are fully aerated in winter and thus only perform denitrification in summer the responses of n2o emissions to switching aeration on or off in the first compartment of the biological treatment train are shown in fig 5 the n2o emissions were substantially increased on the fully aerated lanes lanes 2 1 and 3 2 amongst the monitored lanes sharing the same secondary clarifier the one with an anoxic zone 2 2 had lower emissions than the fully aerated one 2 1 but still had higher emissions than the lane with anoxic zones on both lanes sharing the same secondary clarifier lane 3 2 when the conditions were swapped and lane 3 2 was fully aerated the emission pattern reacted immediately and switched completely the anoxic zone however does not always have such a substantial impact on the emissions during the first phase of the first experiment beginning of february to mid march emissions on lanes 2 1 and 2 2 only slightly increased additionally the emissions rose to a lower level in june and only marginally in september the importance of denitrification to reaching low emissions highlights the need to consider nitrogen removal rates in countrywide estimations of n2o emissions the varying impact of an anoxic zone underpin our conclusion that the emission peaks in spring are caused by imbalanced nitrification and no2 accumulation an anoxic zone prevents no2 and n2o accumulation probably via the return sludge since both intermediates can be reduced by denitrification as long as sufficient organic substrate is available pan et al 2013 the seasonal dependence of denitrification on the emissions might be linked to the yearly variation of the microbial community and nitrifiers in a wwtp and relates to the previous discussion about yearly nob variation griffin and wells 2017 gruber et al 2021 ju et al 2014 experimental support for the relevance of seasonal nitrifier variation can be found in the monitoring campaign at the giubiasco wwtp which represents an extreme case of unstable nitrification and highlights its impact on n2o emissions unstable nitrification and n2o emission pattern to characterize the risk of high n2o emissions in a process with unstable nitrification we analysed the giubiasco wwtp in more detail the giubiasco wwtp is a cas system with carbon removal as a treatment goal the n2o emission pattern exhibited a strong seasonal variation fig 6 a as a consequence of higher temperatures nitrifiers can actually proliferate during the summer months and a seasonal occurrence of nitrification is the result at giubiasco wwtp fig 6b the yearly emission pattern exhibits two emission peak phases january march june july these coincide with a dramatic change in nitrification performance nitrification did not occur during winter at low temperatures therefore the ammonium effluent concertation of the wwtp exhibits a pattern that is opposite of the wastewater temperature curve during the transition from a nitrifying to a non nitrifying process the no2 concentrations in the wwtp effluent increased and massive amounts of n2o were emitted the high ef 8 for a non bnr system contrasts strongly with previous studies and the ipcc guidelines which suggests that a high ef is linked to uncontrolled and incomplete nitrification in most previous studies non bnr systems were found to have low emissions vasilaki et al 2019 our study demonstrates that long term monitoring is required to assess efs from non bnr systems unless nitrification can be excluded all year most of the previously reported monitoring campaigns were conducted over short periods but a few discontinuous long term monitoring campaigns have been conducted for non bnr system a study on a brazil wwtp over 1 year resulted in a very low ef of 0 12 brotto et al 2015 the nitrogen removal efficiency and nitrification exhibited a strong seasonal variation but no2 was comparatively low 0 0 8 mg no2 n l in all effluent samples a possible explanation for the differences from the giubiasco wwtp is the tropical climate which led to very high wastewater temperature 24 c at minimum high emissions for wwtps with variable nitrogen removal efficiencies were reported from three monitoring campaigns using a discontinuous monitoring approach over a year yan et al 2014 in that study a wwtp with similarly low nitrogen removal efficiencies as the giubiasco wwtp had a very high average ef of 3 6 the yearly temperature patterns were very similar to the wwtps monitored in our study further continuous long term monitoring campaigns on carbon removal wwtps are essential to provide better estimates of ef variability we expect negligible efs from carbon removal systems that completely avoid bnr partly explaining the low ef of previous studies for emission mitigation limiting the srt to prevent nitrifier growth could be a feasible strategy for carbon removing plants however the strategy leads to impaired removal of organic compounds in the biological treatment falas et al 2016 and thus to a trade off decision between effluent quality and the carbon footprint of a wwtp countrywide extrapolation of n2o emissions and uncertainties the dependencies of the n2o ef discussed above and the corresponding understanding of the mechanistic processes derived from the 14 long term monitoring campaigns on eight types of wwtp processes led us to propose a refined approach to estimating on site n2o emissions of wwtps in switzerland we suggest calculating an ef for the three nutrient removal categories of carbon removal nitrification only and year round nitrogen removal with the overall assumption that a lower nitrogen removal results in higher emissions and a higher probability of no2 accumulation unless nitrification can be excluded completely we calculated an average ef for switzerland by multiplying the average ef for each category fig 7 a with the share of nitrogen load treated by each category fig 7b table 4 the total emissions were calculated for two scenarios with our approach d1 and d2 because data availability for carbon removal plant was not sufficient and emissions were expected to differ substantially between such wwtps we did not propose a linear regression model for ef extrapolation since data on effluent no2 the best predictor for efs fig 3 was limited on a countrywide level in switzerland and is in most other countries the results of the new methods approaches d1 and d2 are compared with the current ipcc approaches approaches a and b and an average ef of all 14 efs approach c discussed in this study table 4 the estimated total nitrogen load to wwtp based on our bottom up approach c d is lower than that calculated with the ipcc approaches a b nevertheless the emission estimates calculated with the 2006 guidelines are drastically lower than the other estimates due to the very low ef applied table 4 n2o emissions calculated with our approaches c d1 d2 vary substantially and depend primarily on the estimated ef for carbon removal plants fig 7c the 2019 refinements are in the range of the total emissions estimated with our approaches and data in summary all the estimates show that direct n2o emissions from wwtps are important and sum up to 0 3 1 4 of total swiss ghg emissions 50 mtco2 eq year in 2011 foen 2020 notably these estimations do not include n2o emissions originating from the effluent of the wwtp after discharge to the environment and the total ghg emission in switzerland in 2011 were around 10 higher than in 2018 accordingly we expect an increasing importance of n2o emissions from wwtps to the total swiss ghg emissions especially assuming the projected continued decline of total ghg emissions the discrepancies between the activity data from the ipcc approaches and our data confirm that a country specific bottom up approach should be prioritized for estimation if sufficient data is available ramirez melgarejo et al 2020 the low emission estimates yielded from the 2006 guidelines highlight that an update of the estimation methods was clearly required for more accurate representation of wastewater treatment in ghg inventories however our results show that the 2019 refinement is not optimal for calculating country specific efs for two reasons i the selection of monitoring campaigns in the guidelines used to calculate the average ef is arbitrary and not necessarily representative for a country ii the efs applied section s5 si originate mostly from short term grab sampling which does not provide representative efs daelman et al 2013 methods building on a country specific representation of wastewater treatment such as ours not only yield more accurate estimations but are better suited to resolve changes in wastewater treatment efficiencies over time figure s4 an increase of the nitrogen removal efficiencies in wastewater treatment plants over the last decades as reported in most developed countries due to increased effluent requirements could be implemented with our approach to obtain representative emission time series van drecht et al 2009 the expected change in emissions over time could thus be quantified as required by the kyoto and paris protocols united nations climate change 1997 2015 the reporting of ghg emissions to the unfccc united nations climate change 1992 always refers back to 1990 and representative emission time series are therefore considered important we conclude that identifying robust predictors for efs from wwtps is of high importance to making reliable predictions for the total n2o emission from wastewater treatment previously linear regression modeling was proposed by valkova et al 2020 as a versatile and precise predictor for countrywide n2o emissions from wwtps their study was based on short term monitoring campaigns over a few weeks which does not provide representative ef estimation and reported substantially lower efs 0 1 5 than the values reported in our study and other long term monitoring campaigns chen et al 2019 moreover a linear relation between nitrogen removal efficiency and ef cannot be assumed fig 3 and potentially low efs for carbon removal wwtps our approach is based on long term monitoring data and on grouping of efs according to meaningful characteristics of wwtps which additionally reduces the uncertainties of efs table 4 however a clear need to better characterize emissions from carbon removal wwtps has been identified estimates of the proportion and efs of carbon removal wwtps have to be made by expert judgements until more monitoring data is available a fourth nutrient removal category could then be implemented in our method to differentiate between the two types of carbon removal wwtps and combine scenarios d1 and d2 ultimately we believe that our approach can be used for n2o emission estimations in other countries with temperate climates and significantly improve the representativity of emission estimation over the ipcc approach for the extrapolation to countries in other climate zones continuous long term monitoring campaigns in those climate zones are absolutely necessary conclusions n2o efs from wwtps exhibit a strong relation with the effluent no2 compared to the influent nitrogen load and nitrogen removal efficiency since data availability for no2 effluent loads on a countrywide level is usually limited we suggest calculating a countrywide ef from the weighted average efs of three nutrient removal categories carbon removal ef 0 1 8 nitrification only 1 8 and full nitrogen removal 0 9 the overall assumption of the approach is that categories with higher nitrogen removal result in lower emissions unless nitrification is not active at all the approach allows representative country specific estimations of the n2o emissions from wwtps applied to switzerland the estimations result in an average ef of 0 9 3 6 and total emissions of 410 1690 tn2o n year which corresponds to 0 3 1 4 of total swiss ghg emissions uncontrolled nitrification in wwtps with carbon removal as a treatment goal can cause very high emissions coupled with no2 accumulation during wash out and re growth of nitrifiers partial nitrification should be avoided by stringent srt control because increased n2o emissions can be excluded as long as nitrification is not present in a wwtp consequently uncertainties linked to the high variability of carbon removal wwtps estimated efs 0 1 8 have to be considered in countrywide emission estimations further continuous long term monitoring campaigns on carbon removal wwtps are required to reduce the uncertainties of ef estimates yearlong continuous monitoring campaigns are essential to assess representative efs given the high temporal variability encountered in 14 long term monitoring campaigns yearly n2o emissions patterns for activated sludge based wwtps with high efs 0 5 are very dynamic and comparable among different wwtps and lanes of the same wwtp with separated sludges hence assuming yearly reproducibility of efs is justified for a particular wwtp the emission peak phase often coincides with no2 accumulation in the biological treatment we expect that limiting no2 accumulation is the key factor reducing n2o emissions in wwtps wwtps with year round denitrification often exhibit low efs and rather uniform emission pattern introducing anoxic conditions at the beginning of the biological treatment immediately reduces n2o emissions over the whole biological treatment including the aerobic zones however fully aerobic conditions do not always result in high n2o emissions author contributions w g l v k l b d b e m and a j designed the study all authors provided helpful feedback and suggestions throughout

19945,nitrous oxides n2o emissions contribute to climate change and stratospheric ozone depletion wastewater treatment is an important yet likely underestimated source of n2o emissions as recent long term monitoring campaigns have demonstrated however the available data are insufficient to representatively estimate countrywide emission due to the brevity of most monitoring campaigns this study showed that the emission estimates can be significantly improved using an advanced approach based on multiple continuous long term monitoring campaigns in monitoring studies on 14 full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps we found a strong variability in the yearly emission factors efs 0 1 to 8 of the incoming nitrogen load which exhibited a good correlation with effluent nitrite but countrywide data on nitrite effluent concentrations is very limited and unavailable for emission estimation in many countries hence we propose a countrywide emission factor calculated from the weighted efs of three wwtp categories carbon removal ef 0 1 8 nitrification only 1 8 and full nitrogen removal 0 9 however ef of carbon removal wwtps are still highly uncertain given the expected variability in performance the newly developed approach allows representative country specific estimations of the n2o emissions from wwtp applied to switzerland the estimations result in an average ef of 0 9 to 3 6 and total emissions of 410 to 1690 tn2o n year which corresponds to 0 3 1 4 of the total greenhouse gas emissions in switzerland our results demonstrate that better data availability and an improved understanding of long term monitoring campaigns is crucial to improve current emission estimations finally our results confirm several measures to mitigate n2o emissions from wastewater treatment year round denitrification limiting nitrite accumulation and stringent control of sludge age in carbon removal plants graphical abstract image graphical abstract introduction nitrous oxide n2o emissions contribute substantially to climate change ipcc 2014 and stratospheric ozone depletion ravishankara et al 2009 the atmospheric n2o concentration is expected to rise until the middle of the 21st century tian et al 2020 wastewater treatment plants wwtps and their n2o production are currently often underestimated emission processes in national greenhouse gas ghg inventories estimations of countrywide n2o emissions are based on assumed emission factors efs efs in the standard reporting guidelines are much lower 0 03 to 0 14 daelman et al 2015 ipcc 2006 than reported long term full scale measurements with the refinement of the ipcc methodology in 2019 increased efs of 0 01 to 2 9 appeared in the reporting guidelines ipcc 2019 in wastewater treatment n2o formation is primarily caused by biological nitrogen removal through nitrification and denitrification kampschreur et al 2009 the main production processes are the biological stage in the water lines of wwtps kosonen et al 2016 and the side stream treatment for reject water from the sludge lines joss et al 2009 kampschreur et al 2008b emissions of n2o produced on wwtps can occur either on site or in receiving waters if dissolved n2o is discharged mikola et al 2014 marescaux et al 2018 however roughly 80 of the n2o emissions from wwtps are released in the aerated zone of biological treatment baeten et al 2020 chen et al 2019 quantifying representative efs at the biological stage of wwtps requires continuous long term monitoring campaigns due to the substantial daily variation and seasonality of emissions daelman et al 2013 a strong seasonal emission pattern with high emission in spring and low emissions in autumn was previously shown in several long term monitoring campaigns gujer 2020 however only six continuous monitoring campaigns of at least one year s duration have been reported to our knowledge chen et al 2019 daelman et al 2015 gruber et al 2020 kosonen et al 2016 five of these studies were conducted in temperate climates with a monthly mean temperature of over 10 c during 4 7 months belda et al 2014 the ef assessed 0 8 2 9 of the total nitrogen loads were shown to be substantially higher than those found by many short term campaigns chen et al 2019 daelman et al 2015 gruber et al 2020 kosonen et al 2016 vasilaki et al 2019 the causes of the wide range of efs assessed are still unknown vasilaki et al 2019 hence we conclude that additional online long term monitoring campaigns are much needed to better characterize the variability from n2o emissions in full scale wwtps ultimately a broad data basis is crucial for countrywide assessment of the n2o efs from wastewater treatment various approaches have been suggested for the extrapolation of n2o emissions from wwtps at countrywide level ramirez melgarejo et al 2020 the standard approach is described by the ipcc guidelines ipcc 2006 which are designed to be calculated with generally accessible variables consequently the approach leads to high uncertainties of the total emission estimates for two reasons firstly in a top down approach the nitrogen load to wwtps is estimated from a country s protein consumption resulting in substantial differences compared to a bottom up approach using measured nitrogen influent loads to wwtps ramirez melgarejo et al 2020 secondly the ipcc guidelines suggest a uniform ef independent of the type of wwtp ipcc 2006 the assumption of a uniform ef leads to high uncertainties due to the wide range of efs reported for different types of wwtps cadwallader and van briesen 2017 and poorly described key factors characterizing n2o efs vasilaki et al 2019 several methods have been suggested to overcome these shortcomings arising from short term monitoring campaigns ahn et al 2010 valkova et al 2020 however the integration of continuous long term monitoring campaigns on different process types is needed to obtain the most accurate estimates for countrywide n2o efs here we propose a refined approach to estimating n2o emissions from wwtps based on the efs of a dozen long term monitoring campaigns on full scale wwtps in switzerland to acquire a broad data basis we conducted seven monitoring campaigns of at least one year s duration on full scale wwtps using an adaptation of the flux chamber method gruber et al 2020 additionally we extracted the same results from seven long term monitoring campaigns reported in literature daelman et al 2015 kosonen et al 2016 gruber et al 2020 we used spearman s correlation analysis to characterize key variables of a wwtp to predict n2o efs we use our results to link the variables to patterns detected in our monitoring campaigns to provide experimental evidence for the correlations found and we conducted full scale tests on one wwtp to prove concepts from the correlation analysis finally we propose a method for calculating n2o emissions for switzerland and compare it with the methods described in the ipcc guidelines ipcc 2006 2019 regarding total emissions and corresponding uncertainties material methods monitoring approach n2o emissions were assessed using an adapted version of the flux chamber method as described in gruber et al 2020 fig 1 in total five different setups based on the same general concept were applied to monitor the emission on seven wwtps see diagrams in the supporting information si in short all discontinuously fed reactors were equipped with a flux chamber on wwtps with continuously fed lanes one or more lanes were monitored each with three or more flux chambers per lane placed on the aerated compartments in contrast to the standard method chandran et al 2016 a chamber surface 1 m2 with an open outlet was used and therefore sample gas was not recirculated to the flux chamber after measurement a sample of the gas flowing through the chamber was diverted at the outlet through a tube with a length of up to a few hundred meters to the central monitoring station where the off gas was measured in a non dispersive infrared analyser x stream emerson st louis mo usa prior to the measurement the off gas was dehumidified by cooling to 4 c jcp sl jct wiener neustadt aut or tc standard pke 521 bühler ratingen ger to monitor the entire biological treatment at multiple sampling points and on various lanes up to 14 floating hoods can be connected to our system over three way valves parker lucifer type 7131kbg2jv00 cleveland usa while one of the valves is open to the measurement line the other channels are purged with a pump me 2 nt vaccubrand wertheim ger to ensure a constant flow through all the tubes the constant flow is considered important for two reasons i to reduce system response time and thus allow fast switching between valves 1 min per measurement and ii to avoid freezing of sampling tubes due to humidity in tubing and cold temperatures the system is controlled with a programmable logical controller plc type wago 750 881 which provides two key functions i switching between the valves and ii analogue digital signal conversion and data storage key control variables of the system are a flowmeter mems flow sensor d6f 10a6 000 omron kyoto jp in the sample gas duct a paramagnetic oxygen sensor in the gas analyser x stream emerson st louis mo usa and a humidity sensor kw1 jct wiener neustadt aut after the pre treatment the flowmeter allows detection of malfunctioning across the whole system or in specific channels when the measured flow drops below a set threshold the oxygen sensor signals substantial leaks in the channel when oxygen concentration is close to atmospheric concentrations and does not show variation finally the humidity sensor is used as a binary sensor in case of humidity after the pre treatment the measurement is switched off to prevent the analyser malfunctioning as a second barrier against water entering the analyser a protection filter is installed directly after the pre treatment a field computer is used to parametrize the plc additionally the field computer establishes data transmission to a data server via the secure file transfer protocol sftp and a 3 g modem imon u300 insys icom regensburg ger on the data server the monitoring data is processed and synchronized with the operational data of the wwtps and visualized on demand the operators of the wwtps assessed lab data on concentrations of total nitrogen nitrogen species and cod sampled from influent effluent primary clarifier effluent biological treatment and effluent wwtp at various intervals operational data on influent flow air supply wastewater temperature dissolved oxygen concentrations was acquired over the wwtp s supervisory control and data acquisition scada system a detailed description of the monitoring setup can be found in the si wwtp selection and monitoring campaigns the seven wwtps monitored were selected to represent the range of nutrient removal goals set and common types of processes installed in wwtps in switzerland table 1 common removal goals are i carbon removal ii nitrification and iii denitrification common processes include various types of activated sludge as systems such as plug flow conventional activated sludge cas anoxic aerobic ao anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2o alternatingly fed intermittently aerated a i and sequencing batch reactors sbr and biofilm systems hybrid fixed bed and activated sludge ifas fixed bed fb we sought to represent various types of wwtp size classes table 1 monitoring campaigns were conducted over at least 1 year flux chambers were placed on lanes in accordance with the monitoring strategy proposed in gruber et al 2020 see section 2 1 and si the monitoring campaigns reported in gruber et al 2020 were included in the selection additionally data from three long term monitoring campaigns of previous studies was included for the statistical analysis of the data chen et al 2019 daelman et al 2015 kosonen et al 2016 these studies include data on one ao process and two carrousel carr activated sludge processes detailed information on the wwtps monitored and the results of the newly conducted monitoring campaigns can be found in the si n2o emission and ef calculation the net n2o flux for a specific lane was computed with the approach presented by aboobakar et al 2013 from the airflow supplied to each reactor section equipped with a flux chamber and the respective n2o concentration when gaps between two consecutive data points did not exceed 30 min n2o concentrations were linearly interpolated data gaps longer than 30 min were excluded see table s1 in the si the air flow supplied to the reactor was estimated with three different methods depending on the wwtp i from the blower speed and the blower specification provided by the plant operators ii by measurement of the total air flow provided to a treatment lane or iii by measurement of the air flow provided to a compartment of the treatment lane the airflow was recorded at intervals of 1 min and emissions were calculated in 1 min intervals only for the aerated phases emissions from the whole treatment plant were extrapolated according to suggestions made in gruber et al 2020 when wastewater loadings were expected to differ or operation strategies to change all lanes were monitored but lanes with comparable process performance and operation were assumed to emit comparable quantities of n2o n2o efs were calculated with eq 1 for the whole duration of the monitoring campaigns gruber et al 2020 aboobakar et al 2013 for the monitoring campaigns that were substantially longer than 1 year 3 months we evaluated the efs for all possible data sets of 1 year and calculated their average and standard deviation in the newly conducted monitoring campaigns of more than 15 months the yearly average efs did not exhibit substantial variation efs always refer to the yearly average influent nitrogen load of the wwtps calculated based on 24 hour composite samples the samples were taken and analysed by the operators of the wwtps every 5 to 14 days where nitrogen influent measurements were not available we estimated the influent nitrogen load by evaluating a nitrogen mass balance over the primary clarifier based on typical values for mass flow coefficients from standard textbooks gujer 2007 tchobanoglous et al 2014 because at least effluent loads of the primary clarifier were available in every case figure s3 si all monitoring data and the values for the nitrogen loads can be found in the si 1 e f n 2 o d 1 365 m 1 1440 c n 2 o m d q a i

meta data and correlation analysis the correlation analysis included key figures and performance indicators that were collected for each wwtp spearman rank correlation was used to study the

si if possible we collected and calculated values for the total nitrogen and cod loads at the influent and the effluent of the biological treatment and of the wwtps additionally we collected values on nitrite no2 concentration in the effluent of the biological treatment the input variables for the correlation analysis are summarized in table s2 si all statistical calculations were performed using python programming language version 3 8 3 van rossum and drake 2009 and the pandas mckinney 2010 numpy harris et al 2020 and scipy packages virtanen et al 2020 full scale tests at the hofen wwtp we conducted full scale experiments to compare the effects on n2o emissions of a pre denitrification zone with those of a fully oxic process at the hofen wwtp see si for further details the plant has an ao activated sludge process consisting of six lanes where two lanes use the same clarifier and sludge recycle si every lane consists of three zones with an equal size of which the first zone is typically anoxic four of the six lanes were monitored lane 1 1 lane 2 1 lane 2 2 and lane 3 2 whereas lane 2 1 and lane 2 2 share the same secondary clarifier lane 1 1 and lane 3 2 are independent of each other between february and april 2020 the first of three zones on two lanes lanes 2 1 and 3 2 were fully aerated the exact dates and durations for each experiment are given in table 2 extrapolation to the whole of switzerland and uncertainty estimation countrywide n2o emissions were estimated by multiplying the total nitrogen load to the wwtp and different estimates of the efs from

the swiss implementation of the 2006 ipcc guidelines the ef applied was 0 032 as suggested by the guidelines a standard deviation could not be calculated for the resulting countrywide emission because

2011 strähl et al 2013 we assumed the same fractions of wwtp types and extrapolated the nitrogen loads found in the dataset to the wwtps treating the remaining 30 of the wastewater in switzerland an

monitoring campaigns the monitoring campaigns studied showed a yearly n2o ef ranging from 0 1 to 8 of the total influent nitrogen load fig 2 the range of ef is significantly wider than has been reported from previous long term monitoring campaigns 1 1 to 2 9 mainly due to the high ef of the giubiasco wwtp whose treatment goal is carbon removal the average value of 1 6 for all studies is comparable to the value proposed in the updated ipcc guidelines ipcc 2019 however the high standard deviation of the average ef 2 equivalent to 125 of the mean value shows clearly that using average efs for countrywide extrapolations leads to very high uncertainties which is in line with previous research valkova et al 2020 characterizing the n2o ef of a wwtp depending from key indicators is therefore essential for the robust calculation of countrywide efs none of the explanatory factors displayed in fig 2 exhibits a strong relation with the n2o ef while nitrogen removal efficiency displays a weak and insignificant correlation r 0 51 p 0 06 fig 3 treatment size does not correlate at all with n2o ef r 0 002 p 0 99 fig 3 the low relevance of the reactor configuration and the treatment process can be only discussed qualitatively due to the low number of monitoring campaigns for different processes firstly flow through activated sludge systems exhibited a wide range of efs 0 08 8 n 6 the systems monitored with our setup with an anoxic zone during the whole year processes ao and a2o n 3 did not exceed an ef of 0 3 the very low efs are not in line with the value 1 9 for the viikinmäki wwtp which uses with an ao process this dissimilarity may be explained by the difference between its influent conditions viikinmäki is served by a separated sewer system and the climate in finland differs from that of central europe kosonen et al 2016 moreover the nitrogen removal efficiency of the biological treatment is 60 quite low compared to the other ao and a2o systems fig 2 secondly the efs of two activated sludge plants with sbr configuration differed substantially 0 3 vs 2 3 as their nutrient removal goal differed nitrification vs denitrification previously sbr systems were reported to cause generally higher n2o emissions vasilaki et al 2019 but our results indicate that low efs can be reached in sbr systems too thirdly the two a i activated sludge systems varied substantially 0 2 vs 0 8 even though they shared the same removal goal denitrification finally both biofilm systems monitored had a high ef 1 4 which is closely in line with previously reported values bollon et al 2016 the systems monitored by daelman et al 2015 at kralingseveer wwtp and chen et al 2019 at avedøre wwtp have carrousel reactors for the biological treatment and exhibited high efs 1 1 and 2 9 respectively the efs assessed by other research groups are higher on average this might be linked to the monitoring approach in contrast to our flux chamber based monitoring approach the other monitoring campaigns were conducted using i measurement of dissolved n2o in the biological treatment combined with a stripping model and ii the measurement of the collected off gas of covered wwtp the study by chen et al 2019 used approach i and resulted in an ef similar to that found in this study the studies by daelman et al 2015 and kosonen et al 2016 used approach ii and reported very high efs despite high nitrogen removal in the biological treatment unlike the flux chamber approach emissions from unaerated zones in the biological treatment and secondary clarification can be assessed using approaches i and ii however the relative contribution of these emissions has been found to be of minor importance chen et al 2019 mikola et al 2014 three main sources of uncertainty arise when using the flux chamber method for monitoring n2o emissions from the aerated zone in the biological treatment firstly inhomogeneous air supply within the biological treatment due to preferential flows of air and aging of the membrane aerators can locally affect airflow rates and calculated emissions substantially to reduce those uncertainties we used a multi flux chamber approach with at least three flux chambers per lane to cover the full range of off gas concentrations within a treatment lane secondly inhomogeneity in nutrient and sewage loading of parallel lanes in a wwtp may contribute to variation in the emissions between lanes which remains unobserved if not all lanes are monitored gruber et al 2020 thirdly the quality of air flow and blower data differs highly between plants ranging from blower frequency data of single blowers supplying several lanes to air flow meters installed in each zone of a treatment lane to quantify the relevance of the uncertainties and compare the off gas monitoring approaches a study comparing all monitoring approaches applied on one wwtp is needed variables relevant for yearly n2o ef fig 3 shows that the ef displays the highest and only statistically significant correlation with the effluent no2 load expressed as a fraction of the incoming nitrogen load similarly concentration peaks coincided with n2o emissions peaks at wwtp with high ef where no2 effluent concentrations were measured giubiasco lucerne kralingseveer no2 accumulation has previously been linked to high n2o emissions in nitritation denitrification systems kampschreur et al 2008a peng et al 2015 a negative correlation with nitrogen removal efficiency was expected because denitrifying communities have a high capacity to scavenge n2o produced during both anoxic and aerobic conditions which has been demonstrated in lab and full scale wwtp studies conthe et al 2018 rodriguez caballero et al 2015 however a few wwtps lucerne avedøre and most strikingly kralingseveer had a high ef factor 1 despite high nitrogen removal efficiency most likely due to nitrite accumulation excluding the kralingseveer wwtp data from the correlation analysis results in a strong and substantial relation between the ef and nitrogen removal efficiencies r 0 73 p 0 005 other variables that could potentially be linked to n2o did not show significant correlation nitrogen loading specific reactor volume c to n ratio at inflow aerobic srt and wwtp utilization average design load however yearly average values are only partly useful for such correlation analysis because seasonal peak phases are not well represented vasilaki et al 2018 nevertheless we conclude from the relations found that countrywide estimations can be improved by considering three factors governing the n2o ef of a wwtp i seasonal emission pattern and no2 accumulation ii all year denitrification and iii unstable nitrification these factors are discussed in the following sections seasonal emission pattern and no2 accumulation a strong and reproducible emission pattern has been found in our own n2o emission monitoring campaign and in all previous studies except for the viikinmäki study fig 4 emissions typically peaked in march april or may and dropped over several months to a minimum in september or october hence we analysed the seasonal emission pattern of the long term monitoring campaigns for all biological nutrient removal bnr activated sludge processes in temperate climates since this category represents the majority n 10 of the wwtps monitored the analysis of seasonality is considered representative because for some wwtps more than 1 year of data were available uster lucerne altenrhein and the observations represent independent measurements of comparable processes during different years the seasonal emission pattern with a high emission peak in march or april was only apparent in five of the monitoring campaigns fig 4 group g1 panel a two wwtps exhibited a shifted pattern with extended peaks between april and july group g2 panel b and three wwtps featured a rather uniform pattern with only occasional peaks group g3 panel c the average ef was significantly higher for the wwtps exhibiting the seasonal ef than those without mann whitney wilcoxon u 3095 p 6 10 4 fig 4 panel d only one of the wwtps with an emission peak in march or april had an ef clearly below 1 moossee wwtp wwtps with a seasonal emission pattern emitted mostly between february and may the high contribution of the emission peak phase to the total emissions highlights the strong need to better understand the causes of the seasonal emission pattern chen et al 2019 additionally it signifies that emission reduction strategies should be based and tested on long term monitoring campaigns covering at least 1 year duan et al 2020 the reproducibility of the emission pattern on wwtps with high ef panel a b and between different lanes in a wwtp suggests that monitoring n2o emissions over 1 year is sufficient on several wwtps lucerne uster kralingseveer the pattern could be partly linked to no2 accumulation in biological treatment during the spring season we hypothesize that reduced no2 oxidizing bacteria nob performance could be the cause of seasonal no2 accumulation gruber et al 2021 vieira et al 2018 and lead to n2o peak emissions induced by enhanced nitrifier denitrification or incomplete heterotrophic denitrification the emission pattern and the emission peaks in spring help to prioritize efforts to mitigate n2o emissions but the high impact on the yearly ef is problematic for a countrywide extrapolation based on only a few monitoring campaigns since the frequency of wwtps with seasonal peaks is unknown additionally no2 effluent concentrations do not fully represent the no2 concentrations in the reactors because no2 can accumulate locally in a wwtp or even within sludge flocs chen et al 2018 as a consequence monitoring of n2o emission patterns at wwtps with plug flow characteristics or multiple biological treatment steps such as the kralingseveer wwtp may be less accurate if effluent concentrations are used or if concentrations are sampled only at one location for such cases extensive monitoring of nitrogen species at a range of locations may be advantageous in order to avoid no2 accumulation all year denitrification appears to be an efficient strategy wwtps without seasonal emission patterns birs zurich and hofen or with low efs moossee had a very low proportion of no2 in the effluent of the biological treatment 0 2 0 5 relative to the yearly nitrogen influent load all of these wwtps practise all year denitrification year round denitrification and n2o reduction to test the seasonally varying influence of an anoxic zone and denitrification on n2o emissions full scale tests were performed at the hofen wwtp some wwtps in switzerland are operated for nitrogen removal year round whereas other treatment plants are fully aerated in winter and thus only perform denitrification in summer the responses of n2o emissions to switching aeration on or off in the first compartment of the biological treatment train are shown in fig 5 the n2o emissions were substantially increased on the fully aerated lanes lanes 2 1 and 3 2 amongst the monitored lanes sharing the same secondary clarifier the one with an anoxic zone 2 2 had lower emissions than the fully aerated one 2 1 but still had higher emissions than the lane with anoxic zones on both lanes sharing the same secondary clarifier lane 3 2 when the conditions were swapped and lane 3 2 was fully aerated the emission pattern reacted immediately and switched completely the anoxic zone however does not always have such a substantial impact on the emissions during the first phase of the first experiment beginning of february to mid march emissions on lanes 2 1 and 2 2 only slightly increased additionally the emissions rose to a lower level in june and only marginally in september the importance of denitrification to reaching low emissions highlights the need to consider nitrogen removal rates in countrywide estimations of n2o emissions the varying impact of an anoxic zone underpin our conclusion that the emission peaks in spring are caused by imbalanced nitrification and no2 accumulation an anoxic zone prevents no2 and n2o accumulation probably via the return sludge since both intermediates can be reduced by denitrification as long as sufficient organic substrate is available pan et al 2013 the seasonal dependence of denitrification on the emissions might be linked to the yearly variation of the microbial community and nitrifiers in a wwtp and relates to the previous discussion about yearly nob variation griffin and wells 2017 gruber et al 2021 ju et al 2014 experimental support for the relevance of seasonal nitrifier variation can be found in the monitoring campaign at the giubiasco wwtp which represents an extreme case of unstable nitrification and highlights its impact on n2o emissions unstable nitrification and n2o emission pattern to characterize the risk of high n2o emissions in a process with unstable nitrification we analysed the giubiasco wwtp in more detail the giubiasco wwtp is a cas system with carbon removal as a treatment goal the n2o emission pattern exhibited a strong seasonal variation fig 6 a as a consequence of higher temperatures nitrifiers can actually proliferate during the summer months and a seasonal occurrence of nitrification is the result at giubiasco wwtp fig 6b the yearly emission pattern exhibits two emission peak phases january march june july these coincide with a dramatic change in nitrification performance nitrification did not occur during winter at low temperatures therefore the ammonium effluent concertation of the wwtp exhibits a pattern that is opposite of the wastewater temperature curve during the transition from a nitrifying to a non nitrifying process the no2 concentrations in the wwtp effluent increased and massive amounts of n2o were emitted the high ef 8 for a non bnr system contrasts strongly with previous studies and the ipcc guidelines which suggests that a high ef is linked to uncontrolled and incomplete nitrification in most previous studies non bnr systems were found to have low emissions vasilaki et al 2019 our study demonstrates that long term monitoring is required to assess efs from non bnr systems unless nitrification can be excluded all year most of the previously reported monitoring campaigns were conducted over short periods but a few discontinuous long term monitoring campaigns have been conducted for non bnr system a study on a brazil wwtp over 1 year resulted in a very low ef of 0 12 brotto et al 2015 the nitrogen removal efficiency and nitrification exhibited a strong seasonal variation but no2 was comparatively low 0 0 8 mg no2 n l in all effluent samples a possible explanation for the differences from the giubiasco wwtp is the tropical climate which led to very high wastewater temperature 24 c at minimum high emissions for wwtps with variable nitrogen removal efficiencies were reported from three monitoring campaigns using a discontinuous monitoring approach over a year yan et al 2014 in that study a wwtp with similarly low nitrogen removal efficiencies as the giubiasco wwtp had a very high average ef of 3 6 the yearly temperature patterns were very similar to the wwtps monitored in our study further continuous long term monitoring campaigns on carbon removal wwtps are essential to provide better estimates of ef variability we expect negligible efs from carbon removal systems that completely avoid bnr partly explaining the low ef of previous studies for emission mitigation limiting the srt to prevent nitrifier growth could be a feasible strategy for carbon removing plants however the strategy leads to impaired removal of organic compounds in the biological treatment falas et al 2016 and thus to a trade off decision between effluent quality and the carbon footprint of a wwtp countrywide extrapolation of n2o emissions and uncertainties the dependencies of the n2o ef discussed above and the corresponding understanding of the mechanistic processes derived from the 14 long term monitoring campaigns on eight types of wwtp processes led us to propose a refined approach to estimating on site n2o emissions of wwtps in switzerland we suggest calculating an ef for the three nutrient removal categories of carbon removal nitrification only and year round nitrogen removal with the overall assumption that a lower nitrogen removal results in higher emissions and a higher probability of no2 accumulation unless nitrification can be excluded completely we calculated an average ef for switzerland by multiplying the average ef for each category fig 7 a with the share of nitrogen load treated by each category fig 7b table 4 the total emissions were calculated for two scenarios with our approach d1 and d2 because data availability for carbon removal plant was not sufficient and emissions were expected to differ substantially between such wwtps we did not propose a linear regression model for ef extrapolation since data on effluent no2 the best predictor for efs fig 3 was limited on a countrywide level in switzerland and is in most other countries the results of the new methods approaches d1 and d2 are compared with the current ipcc approaches approaches a and b and an average ef of all 14 efs approach c discussed in this study table 4 the estimated total nitrogen load to wwtp based on our bottom up approach c d is lower than that calculated with the ipcc approaches a b nevertheless the emission estimates calculated with the 2006 guidelines are drastically lower than the other estimates due to the very low ef applied table 4 n2o emissions calculated with our approaches c d1 d2 vary substantially and depend primarily on the estimated ef for carbon removal plants fig 7c the 2019 refinements are in the range of the total emissions estimated with our approaches and data in summary all the estimates show that direct n2o emissions from wwtps are important and sum up to 0 3 1 4 of total swiss ghg emissions 50 mtco2 eq year in 2011 foen 2020 notably these estimations do not include n2o emissions originating from the effluent of the wwtp after discharge to the environment and the total ghg emission in switzerland in 2011 were around 10 higher than in 2018 accordingly we expect an increasing importance of n2o emissions from wwtps to the total swiss ghg emissions especially assuming the projected continued decline of total ghg emissions the discrepancies between the activity data from the ipcc approaches and our data confirm that a country specific bottom up approach should be prioritized for estimation if sufficient data is available ramirez melgarejo et al 2020 the low emission estimates yielded from the 2006 guidelines highlight that an update of the estimation methods was clearly required for more accurate representation of wastewater treatment in ghg inventories however our results show that the 2019 refinement is not optimal for calculating country specific efs for two reasons i the selection of monitoring campaigns in the guidelines used to calculate the average ef is arbitrary and not necessarily representative for a country ii the efs applied section s5 si originate mostly from short term grab sampling which does not provide representative efs daelman et al 2013 methods building on a country specific representation of wastewater treatment such as ours not only yield more accurate estimations but are better suited to resolve changes in wastewater treatment efficiencies over time figure s4 an increase of the nitrogen removal efficiencies in wastewater treatment plants over the last decades as reported in most developed countries due to increased effluent requirements could be implemented with our approach to obtain representative emission time series van drecht et al 2009 the expected change in emissions over time could thus be quantified as required by the kyoto and paris protocols united nations climate change 1997 2015 the reporting of ghg emissions to the unfccc united nations climate change 1992 always refers back to 1990 and representative emission time series are therefore considered important we conclude that identifying robust predictors for efs from wwtps is of high importance to making reliable predictions for the total n2o emission from wastewater treatment previously linear regression modeling was proposed by valkova et al 2020 as a versatile and precise predictor for countrywide n2o emissions from wwtps their study was based on short term monitoring campaigns over a few weeks which does not provide representative ef estimation and reported substantially lower efs 0 1 5 than the values reported in our study and other long term monitoring campaigns chen et al 2019 moreover a linear relation between nitrogen removal efficiency and ef cannot be assumed fig 3 and potentially low efs for carbon removal wwtps our approach is based on long term monitoring data and on grouping of efs according to meaningful characteristics of wwtps which additionally reduces the uncertainties of efs table 4 however a clear need to better characterize emissions from carbon removal wwtps has been identified estimates of the proportion and efs of carbon removal wwtps have to be made by expert judgements until more monitoring data is available a fourth nutrient removal category could then be implemented in our method to differentiate between the two types of carbon removal wwtps and combine scenarios d1 and d2 ultimately we believe that our approach can be used for n2o emission estimations in other countries with temperate climates and significantly improve the representativity of emission estimation over the ipcc approach for the extrapolation to countries in other climate zones continuous long term monitoring campaigns in those climate zones are absolutely necessary conclusions n2o efs from wwtps exhibit a strong relation with the effluent no2 compared to the influent nitrogen load and nitrogen removal efficiency since data availability for no2 effluent loads on a countrywide level is usually limited we suggest calculating a countrywide ef from the weighted average efs of three nutrient removal categories carbon removal ef 0 1 8 nitrification only 1 8 and full nitrogen removal 0 9 the overall assumption of the approach is that categories with higher nitrogen removal result in lower emissions unless nitrification is not active at all the approach allows representative country specific estimations of the n2o emissions from wwtps applied to switzerland the estimations result in an average ef of 0 9 3 6 and total emissions of 410 1690 tn2o n year which corresponds to 0 3 1 4 of total swiss ghg emissions uncontrolled nitrification in wwtps with carbon removal as a treatment goal can cause very high emissions coupled with no2 accumulation during wash out and re growth of nitrifiers partial nitrification should be avoided by stringent srt control because increased n2o emissions can be excluded as long as nitrification is not present in a wwtp consequently uncertainties linked to the high variability of carbon removal wwtps estimated efs 0 1 8 have to be considered in countrywide emission estimations further continuous long term monitoring campaigns on carbon removal wwtps are required to reduce the uncertainties of ef estimates yearlong continuous monitoring campaigns are essential to assess representative efs given the high temporal variability encountered in 14 long term monitoring campaigns yearly n2o emissions patterns for activated sludge based wwtps with high efs 0 5 are very dynamic and comparable among different wwtps and lanes of the same wwtp with separated sludges hence assuming yearly reproducibility of efs is justified for a particular wwtp the emission peak phase often coincides with no2 accumulation in the biological treatment we expect that limiting no2 accumulation is the key factor reducing n2o emissions in wwtps wwtps with year round denitrification often exhibit low efs and rather uniform emission pattern introducing anoxic conditions at the beginning of the biological treatment immediately reduces n2o emissions over the whole biological treatment including the aerobic zones however fully

19946,recharge of urban stormwater has often been limited by the high cost of land and concerns about contamination of groundwater to provide a possible solution we developed an electrochemical advanced oxidation system uv h2o2 that is compatible with high capacity stormwater recharge systems e g drywells the system employed an air diffusion cathode to generate a h2o2 stock solution i e typically around 600 mm prior to the storm event the h2o2 stock solution was then metered into stormwater and converted into hydroxyl radical oh by an ultraviolet lamp the energy consumption for h2o2 generation was optimized by adjusting the applied current density and adding an inert salt e g na2so4 to stormwater h2o2 in the stock solution was unstable by mixing the basic h2o2 containing catholyte and the acidic anolyte the stability increased enabling generation of the h2o2 stock solution up to three days prior the storm event with loss of less than 20 of the h2o2 lab scale experiments and a kinetic model were used to assess the feasibility of the full scale advanced oxidation system system performance decreased at elevated concentrations of dissolved organic carbon in stormwater due to enhanced light reflection and backscattering at the water air interface in the uv reactor competition for uv light absorption with h2o2 and the tendency of organic matter to act as a oh scavenger the proposed system can be incorporated into drywells to remove greater than 90 of trace organic contaminants under typical operating conditions the electrical energy per order of the system is estimated to range from 0 5 to 2 kwh m3 depending on the dissolved organic carbon concentration graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords green infrastructure aquifer recharge electrochemical generation hydrogen peroxide trace organic contaminant introduction climate change and rapid population growth are exacerbating water scarcity in cities around the world flörke et al 2018 the capture and use of urban stormwater are attractive to water stressed cities because this underutilized water source is available in large quantities and does not require large investments in environmentally damaging long distance conveyance systems due to limited opportunities for water storage within cities captured urban runoff might best be used for aquifer recharge in cities that rely upon groundwater luthy et al 2019 however stormwater contains contaminants including pesticides compounds released by vehicles and waterborne pathogens all of which can pose risks to drinking water supplies grebel et al 2013 rippy et al 2017 spahr et al 2020 rather than relying upon natural attenuation or treatment after extraction to remove trace organic contaminants some form of treatment may be appropriate prior to recharge zhang et al 2020 researchers have studied the use of engineered geomedia such as manganese oxide coated sands charbonnet et al 2020 grebel et al 2016 woodchips ashoori et al 2019 functionalized clays ray et al 2019 and biochar ashoori et al 2019 boehm et al 2020 ulrich et al 2015 as a passive means of stormwater treatment however such treatment systems are often limited by the low hydraulic conductivities of geomedia or underlying soils and sediments barnes et al 2014 minnesota stormwater steering committee 2005 ray et al 2019 infiltration rates are also limited by the need to achieve adequate contact times between the engineered geomedia and the contaminants grebel et al 2016 shimabuku et al 2016 in addition geomedia eventually will clog or be exhausted which necessitates replacement or regeneration to assure continued operation charbonnet et al 2018 2021 as a result infiltration based techniques that employ geomedia are often unable to treat large volumes of stormwater in urban areas in locations where surface infiltration is impractical drywells offer an attractive alternative due to their high infiltration rates and small footprints edwards et al 2016 for reference to achieve a recharge rate of 400 l min a value typical of drywells an area of 1 5 m2 and 1200 m2 would be required for drywells and rain gardens maximum infiltration rate 2 cm h 1 respectively hunt et al 2010 prince george s county maryland 1999 torrent resources 2021 however it has been difficult to incorporate treatment systems capable of removing trace organic compounds and viruses into drywells because high flow rates during storms often preclude the use of geomedia as a result the use of drywells for urban stormwater infiltration without any form of treatment has contaminated groundwater with volatile organic compounds benzene and petroleum hydrocarbons city of portland bureau of environmental services 2008 jurgens et al 2008 lindemann 1999 advanced oxidation processes aops such as uv h2o2 have been used for over 40 years to oxidize organic contaminants in hazardous waste drinking water and contaminated groundwater by taking advantage of the high reactivity and low selectivity of hydroxyl radical oh koubek 1977 furthermore the process also controls waterborne pathogens because the fluence of ultraviolet uv light used in the process is typically about ten times higher than values used to disinfect drinking water sun et al 2016 despite its potential applicability only a few attempts bettman 2020 zheng et al 2021 have been made to employ aops in stormwater treatment systems due to the cost and challenges associated with system maintenance and reagent replenishment especially when infiltration structures are distributed around a city electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops are promising options for decentralized system because of their modular design high efficiency and ease of automation feng et al 2018 kanakaraju et al 2018 miklos et al 2018 moreira et al 2017 nidheesh et al 2018 yang 2020 yang and hoffmann 2016 to overcome the difficulties associated with using aops for distributed water

o 2 2 e 2 h h 2 o 2 e h 0 70 v the h2o2 is then converted to oh by exposure to uv light eq 2 in a low cost reactor that was originally developed for drinking water disinfection in resource limited communities gadgil 2008 2 h 2 o 2 uv 2 oh to employ this approach in a drywell or another type of stormwater infiltration system a sufficient quantity of h2o2 must be generated using inexpensive equipment that can fit into a small area to accomplish this objective we developeddeveloped h2o2 generation and storage strategies to produce a h2o2 stock solution prior to the storm event potentially with stormwater captured previously and then metered the h2o2 stock solution into stormwater prior to exposing it to uv light using a kinetic model of h2o2 activation and contaminant transformation we assessed the feasibility of employing uv h2o2 to treat urban stormwater under conditions typically encountered in drywells finally by systematic optimization of each process we demonstrated eaop is

panizza and cerisola 2008 pérez et al 2017 after h2o2 was generated in the electrochemical cell the h2o2 containing catholyte was mixed with the anolyte to form a h2o2 stock solution the h2o2 stock

of catholyte and anolyte generated by batch mode electrolysis of a 0 2 m na2so4 electrolyte solution although cbz has not been detected frequently in stormwater it was chosen as a surrogate for trace organic contaminants in stormwater because it is mainly transformed by reactions with oh radicals it exhibits a low rate of direct photolysis and does not react with other photo produced transients produced by uv light barazesh et al 2015 most stormwater contaminants e g pesticides exhibit similar rate constants to cbz for reactions with oh radical some compounds also may be transformed by direct photolysis and or transient species produced when natural organic matter is exposed to uv light table s2 for some compounds that react with oh radicals slower than cbz e g atrazine the overall removal rates were observed to be higher than that of cbz during the uv h2o2 process because the other compounds undergo direct photolysis rozas et al 2016 therefore cbz can be used as a surrogate for

light fluence are included in the supplementary information section analytical methods h2o2 was measured with a titanium iv sulfate method modified from eisenberg 1943 with a shimadzu uv 2600 spectrophotometer at 420 nm h2o2 was measured within 5 min of sampling to minimize artifacts caused by h2o2 decomposition total organic carbon toc was measured using a shimadzu toc v analyzer cbz containing samples were filtered through 0 22 μm glass fiber filters prior to adding isotopically labeled internal standard and 100 μl of methanol to quench any possible oh reactions that could consume cbz cbz was quantified in multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode with an agilent 1200 series hplc system coupled to a 6460 triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer hplc ms ms within 24 h after sampling jasper et al 2014 metal ions were quantified in triplicate on an agilent 7700 series inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms kinetic model for the uv h2o2 treatment a kinetic model was employed based on reaction schemes developed in previously published studies crittenden et al 1999 glaze et al 1995 song et al 2008 using kintecus version 6 80 ianni 2003 details of the model construction are described in the supplementary information section results and discussion h2o2 generation as a function of current density the applied current density could affect the h2o2 generation performance for stormwater treatment an ideal electrode should be able to generate a high concentration of h2o2 stock solution with high faraday efficiency comparing to in situ generation of h2o2 in a flow through reactor barazesh et al 2015 generating a high concentration of h2o2 before a storm event and storing it could reduce the energy consumption and system footprint by reducing the applied current density and electrode area it could also minimize the amount of salt added to the treated stormwater when h2o2 is produced in a salt amended electrolyte solution as described below however at very high concentrations especially under basic ph conditions encountered in the catholyte ph around 11 5 figure s4 the h2o2 is unstable due to self decomposition and reactions with transition metals and organics galbács and csányi 1983 petigara et al 2002 under applied current h2o2 can also undergo electrochemical reduction to h2o jiang et al 2018 therefore development of a better understanding of the effect of current density on h2o2 production rate faraday efficiency and factors affecting the maximum h2o2 concentration that can be generated provides a basis for selecting an optimum operational mode hydrogen peroxide formation in the catholyte fig 1 exhibited similar behavior in na2so4 electrolyte and in na2so4 amended stormwater at current densities ranging from 200 to 1200 a m2 the h2o2 concentrations increased in approximately a linear fashion with the applied charge density up to about 120 kc l at which point a concentration of around 430 mm had been produced for electrolysis conducted with 200 a m2 of current density the h2o2 concentration remained at around 430 mm as the charge density further increased for electrolysis conducted with higher current densities after the charge density reaching 120 kc l the h2o2 generation efficiency decreased until the h2o2 concentration in catholyte plateaued at around 600 mm because of the similar performance with respect to applied current density the system design and operation adjustment can be significantly simplified leading to considerable flexibility in the operation of the treatment system to assess the performance of this air diffusion cathode for h2o2 generation at high h2o2 concentrations these data were compared with results from previous studies on electrochemical synthesis of h2o2 in terms of surface normalized production rate faraday efficiency and maximum h2o2 concentration table s7 the device tested in this study was better suited for producing a concentrated stock solution for use in water treatment than the other 12 systems reported in the literature that also can generate a relatively high concentration of h2o2 solution with relative high faraday efficiency this may be due to the fact that most previous efforts either focused on achieving the maximum possible h2o2 concentration h2o2 max ranged from 320 to 5500 mm faraday efficiency ranged from 12 to 60 iwasaki et al 2018 luo et al 2015 oloman and watkinson 1979 yamanaka et al 2008 yamanaka and murayama 2008 yamanaka et al 2006 or high faraday efficiency faraday efficiency ranged from 79 to 99 h2o2 max ranged from 24 to 250 mm chen et al 2017 li et al 2013 sa et al 2019 wang et al 2020 li et al 2020 achieved 980 mm of h2o2 max with a faraday efficiency of 79 but their fuel cell reactor inhibits the application of their device in distributed locations because of lack of supply of pure h2 and o2 under the actual field condition in addition most of those devices were designed to be operated in strongly acidic or alkaline conditions with deteriorating performances observed at lower acid base concentrations foller et al 1991 yamanaka et al 2008 among the other approaches the method of xia et al 2019 shows considerable promise due to its high faraday efficiency 90 to 95 and ability to produce a high concentration of h2o2 5900 mm however the system requires pumping humidified air as a source of o2 rather than relying on the passive diffusion of air the system also requires passage of water through a solid electrolyte these requirements would likely increase the system cost and increase the risk of system failures two outcomes that could be problematic in remote operations energy consumption during h2o2 generation the energy consumption was dictated by the cell voltage which was mainly affected by the ohmic loss and the overpotential the ohmic loss of an electrochemical system depends upon the conductivity of the solution the overpotential is the driving force of the electrochemical process and was mainly determined by the electrode material and the applied current density for low conductivity solutions e g stormwater the energy consumption was mainly affected by the low conductivity of the electrolyte therefore it is possible to reduce the energy consumed for h2o2 production by adding an inert electrolyte e g na2so4 to the stormwater na2so4 was chosen as the electrolyte amendment because of its relatively low cost about 100 ton and the absence of undesirable products e g clo3 from nacl oxidation produced when it passes through the anode chamber a na2so4 concentration of 0 2 m was chosen to strike a balance between energy consumption and the amount of salt added to the stock solution energy consumption in stormwater amended with 0 02 m to 0 2 m of na2so4 was estimated as described in the text s4 and figure s6 at lower salt concentrations na2so4 0 1 m the energy consumption increased dramatically as the salt concentration decreased at na2so4 0 1 m the addition of salts barely decreased the energy consumption because the overpotential dominated the cell voltage given the relatively low cost of the na2so4 comparing to the cost of electricity the estimated overall cost of the system was decreased by adding na2so4 into stormwater used for production of the h2o2 stock solution text s5 and figure s8 for realistic operating conditions the amount of salts can be determined by balancing the energy cost and the cost for delivering and dosing the salts into the solution adding an electrolyte to a stock solution prior to h2o2 generation and then mixing a small volume of concentrated h2o2 solution into the stormwater would increase the total dissolved solids tds of the treated stormwater to avoid adverse impacts on water quality it is important to assure that the tds and sulfate concentration of the treated water would not exceed the usepa secondary maximum contaminant levels smcls for tds of 500 mg l as well as the sulfate concentration limit of 250 mg l usepa 2017 if the target h2o2 concentration in the stock solution was 200 mm and a 0 2 m solution of na2so4 was used in the stock solution then addition of h2o2 to produce an initial h2o2 concentration of 1 mm in the stormwater will increase the tds by about 140 mg l and sulfate by around 100 mg l which would be acceptable for drinking water purposes provided that the initial stormwater tds and sulfate concentrations were below 360 mg l and 150 mg l respectively if this were not the case a lower concentration of na2so4 would be necessary the energy consumption increased approximately in a linear fashion with respect to the applied current density fig 2 and figure s9 the increasing in energy consumption with increased current density was due to the increased ohmic loss and overpotential the solution matrix i e the presence or absence of synthetic stormwater constituents had little effect on the energy consumption because of the similar solution conductivity and h2o2 generation performance between na2so4 amended simulated stormwater and na2so4 electrolyte for electrolysis performed with current density of 800 a m2 and 1200 a m2 the energy consumption increased slightly after the h2o2 concentration reaching 450 mm due to decreased h2o2 generation efficiency although high current density may reduce the lifetime of the electrode carlesi jara and fino 2010 it enables h2o2 generation with a smaller electrode which could lower the system capital cost use of high current densities could also generate h2o2 more quickly meaning that less time would be needed to generate a sufficient quantity of h2o2 to prepare for a storm operating at a low current density could lower the energy consumption by over 50 but h2o2 loss during storage might become more significant under such conditions see following section the current density employed in the system can be adjusted based on uncertainty in the weather forecast the predicted duration and intensity of the storm and the amount of time that has elapsed since the previous storm which often affects stormwater quality grebel et al 2013 due to the voltage limitation of the power supply used in this research the energy consumption was evaluated with na2so4 concentrations above 0 02 m given the ionic strength of the simulated stormwater is typically around 0 005 m use of the air diffusion cathode to produce a stock solution of h2o2 without addition of salts would require a lower applied current density further research on electrode performance on h2o2 generation under low current density conditions is needed to evaluate the tradeoffs of operating this system without added salts h2o2 stability during storage after production h2o2 may need to be stored for periods of several days the stability of h2o2 maybe affected by solution ph galbács and csányi 1983 watts et al 1999 transition metals haber and weiss 1934 mckee 1969 organic matter petigara et al 2002 romero et al 2009 soil particles petigara et al 2002 and enzymes netto et al 1996 at the high concentration of h2o2 employed in this system microbial activity should be relatively low collén and pedersén 1996 therefore the loss caused by peroxidase enzymes should be insignificant in this system previous research has indicated that h2o2 is unstable under alkaline ph conditions galbács and csányi 1983 nicoll and smith 1955 špalek et al 1982 therefore the stability of h2o2 solution was assessed in the basic catholyte initial ph around 12 and after the catholyte was mixed with acidic anolyte which had an initial ph 0 61 0 04 and 0 78 0 15 for na2so4 electrolyte and simulated stormwater respectively generated during the electrolysis process referred to as na2so4 electrolyte and na2so4 amended stormwater in figure s10 figure s11 and fig 3 the concentration of h2o2 decreased by 33 in na2so4 amended stormwater catholyte and 27 in na2so4 catholyte within a day when it was mixed with the anolyte only 7 and 2 of the h2o2 was lost within a day in the mixed na2so4 amended stormwater and the mixed na2so4 electrolyte respectively figure s10 the enhanced stability was attributed to the reduction in the solution ph figure s11 abel 1952 and duke and haas 1961 reported the homogeneous uncatalyzed decomposition rate and reaction mechanism of h2o2 in alkaline aqueous solution as described in eq 5 6 5 h 2 o 2 ho 2 h k 10 11 7 6 h 2 o 2 ho 2 oh o 2 h 2 o k 1 61 m 1 h 1 during the h2o2 generation the high concentration of h2o2 ho2 in the catholyte buffered the solution ph around the pka value of h2o2 eq 5 without further adjusting the ph the disproportionation reaction eq 6 could be an important loss mechanism although neutralization of the catholyte slowed the rate of h2o2 decomposition rates of h2o2 decomposition in the catholyte anolyte mixture increased substantially after about one day the most likely explanation for the loss of h2o2 was transition metal catalyzed processes particularly from fe and cu in the suwannee river natural organic matter table s8 the reaction mechanisms for h2o2 decomposition in simulated stormwater matrix is complicated because of the interactions of h2o2 with transition metals haber and weiss 1934 mckee 1969 organic matter petigara et al 2002 romero et al 2009 walling and goosen 1973 and phosphate kakarla and watts 1997 and is therefore beyond the scope of this study the measured concentrations of fe and cu in na2so4 amended simulated stormwater were similar to the concentrations observed in stormwater samples collected when suspended particle concentrations were low as would be expected after stormwater pretreatment ahead of drywell infiltration kabir et al 2014 li et al 2012 most of the fe and cu in stormwater is likely to be associated with natural organic matters or complexed by phosphate aiken et al 2011 benjamin 2014 rose and waite 2003 therefore the h2o2 stability observed in the na2so4 amended simulated stormwater should represent its stability under actual field conditions addition of 50 mg l of san joaquin soil which is a typical concentration of suspended solids concentrations in stormwater mean tss 58 mg l grebel et al 2013 did not affect h2o2 stability to minimize h2o2 loss during storage the h2o2 generation process ideally should be completed immediately before the storm event starts assuming the h2o2 is generated in a continuous flow through electrochemical module that has a hydraulic residence time of less than 1 hour most of the loss of h2o2 will occur in the storage tank the loss will be driven by the h2o2 generated at the beginning of the generating process which will be stored for longer time the cumulative h2o2 loss under different operating conditions fig 3 was calculated based on the results of decomposition experiments figure s10 and the storage time t day 7 cumulative h 2 o 2 loss 0 t 1 c c 0 dt t 100 to limit the overall loss of h2o2 to less than 20 several approaches are possible first h2o2 generated by passage of water through the cathode can be used immediately if h2o2 generation starts less than one day prior to the storm event alternatively stormwater from the cathode chamber can be neutralized by mixing with stormwater that has passed through the anode in which case the h2o2 generation can be started up to three days prior to the storm event finally water with fewer impurities e g tap water can be used for h2o2 generation in which case generation of h2o2 can take place up to 10 days prior to the storm event an effective h2o2 generation strategy can be formulated based on the performance of the air diffusion cathode and the stability of h2o2 the required total current was estimated from the stability of h2o2 which determines the time available for h2o2 generation to scale up the system for conditions expected in a dry well the electrode area can be increased by stacking the required number of modular reactors finally a balance between the applied current density which determines electricity consumption and the electrode capital cost can be established for each specific application for example to treat a typical 8 hour storm event in which water flows at the full infiltration capacity of the drywell q 400 l min with an initial h2o2 concentration of 1 mm in the stormwater detailed discussion about h2o2 initial on the treatment performance is described in the following section the required amount of h2o2 stock solution h2o2 stock 200 mm v 1 m3 can be generated with five 40 cm 40 cm air diffusion cathodes operating at a current density of 800 a m2 for one day prior to the storm event the 1 m3 h2o2 stock solution reservoir and the electrochemical modules can be deployed within the available service area next to the drywell trace organic contaminant removal by advanced oxidation to assess the performance of the uv h2o2 aop the rate of transformation of a trace organic contaminant that is lost mainly through reactions with oh i e cbz was evaluated in simulated stormwater upon exposure to uv light and h2o2 most trace organic contaminants in stormwater react with oh radical at near diffusion controlled rates 109 1010 m 1 s 1 wols and hofman caris 2012 some trace organic contaminants may also be transformed by photolysis for cbz the contribution of photolysis to its removal is expected to be negligible relative to its reactions with oh text s6 measured concentrations of h2o2 and cbz were consistent with model predictions fig 4 the modest overprediction of transformation rates at low humic acid concentrations i e 0 and 0 13 mg c l was likely caused by impurities in the deionized water i e dissolved organic carbon concentrations in deionized water can be as high as 0 5 mg c l given that ion exchange resins do not remove the organics from the tap water which had a doc concentration ranging from 1 5 to 3 0 mg c l east bay municipal utility district 2019 the small underprediction in cbz removal rate at the highest humic acid concentration 5 0 mg c l was likely caused by the uncertainty of the rate constant for the reaction between oh and humic acid typically 50 appiani et al 2014 under conditions representative of stormwater treatment i e h2o2 initial and cbz initial of 1 mm and 10 μg l respectively the rate of transformation of the trace organic contaminants decreased as the concentration of humic acid increased at the highest dissolved organic carbon condition tested 5 0 mg c l humic acid the half life for cbz removal was around 1 6 min the uv h2o2 process should also result in inactivation of pathogens the photon fluence rates measured by chemical actinometry indicated that the uv dose delivered to water within 10 min of treatment were 2430 mj cm2 2300 mj cm2 1700 mj cm2 1480 mj cm2 and 1360 mj cm2 for humic acid concentration ranging from 0 mg c l to 5 0 mg c l for reference 4 log inactivation of cryptosporidium giardia and viruses requires 22 mj cm2 22 mj cm2 and 186 mj cm2 respectively usepa 2003 to avoid deposition of solutes and minerals on the surface of the uv lamps the uv reactor was designed with an air gap between the uv lamp and the water surface figure s12 although this design minimizes complications associated with submerged lamps it decreases light utilization efficiency because a substantial fraction of the uv light is reflected and backscattered at the air water interface and converted into heat although the aluminum reflector above the lamp redirects some of the light emitted from the lamp and light reflected from the air water interface back to the water it only returns about 70 of uv light per reflection li 2000 the percentage of uv light lost as heat was calculated as follows 8 uv light lost as heat 1 w 254 n a h ν a p η where w254 photon fluence rate at 254 nm ei cm 2 s 1 na 6 02 1023 mol 1 h ν energy per photon j a air water interface area cm2 p power of uv lamp w η electrical to uv conversion efficiency 35 usepa 2003 the percentage of uv light lost as heat increased from 17 to 55 as the concentration of humic acid increased from 0 to 5 0 mg c l because the humic acid enhanced reflection and backscattering of uv light at the air water interface fig 5 a the increased light reflection and backscattering with dissolved species agreed with observations from previous research clarke et al 1970 grüniger et al 1983 kozarac et al 2005 schwarzenbach et al 2016 for the light absorbed in the water column the fraction of light absorbed by each chromophore was calculated based on the concentration and the molar attenuation coefficient the percentage of uv light absorbed by h2o2 decreased from 99 to 4 as the concentration of humic acid increased from 0 to 5 0 mg c l as a result the oh production rate decreased and the rate of h2o2 loss also decreased in addition to slowing the rate of oh production by competing with h2o2 for uv light humic acid also slowed the cbz removal by serving as a oh scavenger fig 5b and text s7 the concentrations of oh were obtained from the kintecus kinetic model over experimental time scales the steady state concentrations of oh which were estimated by the average value of the oh concentrations decreased by about 90 as the humic acid concentration increased from 0 to 5 0 mg c l as the concentration of humic acid increased its relative importance as a oh scavenger also increased at 5 0 mg c l of humic acid close to half of the oh produced was scavenged by humic acid because the model did not account for the transition metal catalyzed dismutation of o2 the steady state concentration of this species was probably overestimated o2 therefore the actual scavenging effect of o2 included under radicals in fig 5b is probably less important especially at low humic acid concentrations despite the fact that oh react quickly with humic acid cbz was removed from stormwater in the presence of 5 0 mg c l of humic acid because the humic acid only reduced the steady state oh concentration by 90 however the overall performance of the system is expected to decrease dramatically as the humic acid concentration further increases due to the inefficient uv reactor design and the scavenging effect therefore under conditions likely to be useful in the field the maximum humic acid concentration in stormwater treated by this system is around 5 mg c l full scale treatment system design and considerations the kinetic model can provide guidance for the design of full scale treatment systems and their operation under different conditions considering a baseline case with a maximum flow rate of 400 l min i e 0 067 m3 s which is the typical value for drywells torrent resources 2021 along with other design conditions e g system size limited by space available to install a treatment system within a drywell the uv reactor will need to achieve at least 90 removal of a trace organic contaminant at diffusion controlled rates if it is transformed mainly by reactions with oh the initial h2o2 concentration in stormwater prior to exposure of uv light hereinafter referred to as initial h2o2 concentration in this section would need to be at least 0 1 mm and between 5 and 25 500 watt low pressure uv lamps would be needed to achieve the treatment goal if the humic acid concentrations ranged from 0 13 mg c l to 5 0 mg c l fig 6 considering these constraints the analysis indicated a trade off between the initial concentration of h2o2 and the number of lamps being operated at a humic acid concentration of 2 5 mg c l 90 of the organic contaminants can be removed with an initial h2o2 concentration of 0 6 mm and 15 lamps for a humic acid concentration of 5 mg c l an initial h2o2 concentration of 1 mm and 25 lamps is needed to assure 90 removal of a trace organic contaminant the initial h2o2 concentration in stormwater and the number of lamps being used affect the energy consumption by the full scale uv h2o2 system we used the electrical energy per order eeo of the system to compare the system performance under different operating conditions bolton et al 2001 overall eeo increased with the doc concentrations because of the light reflection and backscattering at air water interface competition for light absorption and oh scavenging by humic acid fig 7 we estimated eeo values of approximate were between 0 5 and 2 kwh m3 for condition that are likely to be employed in full scale treatment system for reference modern seawater desalination requires about 3 to 5 kwh m3 kim et al 2019 and electrochemical oxidation with boron doped diamond electrodes requires about 40 kwh m3 lanzarini lopes et al 2017 vahid and khataee 2013 the specific uv absorbance suva at 254 nm of humic substances measured in previous study 0 006 0 053 l mg 1 cm 1 weishaar et al 2003 were lower than the value measured in this study 0 083 0 001 l mg 1 cm 1 if stormwater with a lower suva value at 254 nm than the value used in our model is tested higher removal of contaminants and lower energy consumption may be observed another factor affecting the energy consumption is the applied current density used when preparing the h2o2 stock solution assuming the power consumption associated with h2o2 generation was 1 9 10 5 kwh mg h2o2 i 600 a m2 the h2o2 generation process consumed a similar amount of energy as the uv lamp for example at 5 0 mg c l of humic acid if the system is operated with an initial h2o2 concentration of 0 9 mm and 25 uv lamps 500 w generating enough h2o2 for one hour of continuous dosing into stormwater would consume about 14 kwh of electricity and operating the lamps for one hour would consume about 13 kwh electricity generating the same amount of h2o2 at current density ranging from 200 a m2 to 1200 a m2 would consume between 7 kwh and 20 kwh of electricity under the conditions employed in the aop less than 30 of the h2o2 will be converted into oh by uv light thus residual h2o2 i e up to around 1 mm remaining after the treatment would be recharged to groundwater residual h2o2 should decompose in the first several centimeters of subsurface mainly through reactions catalyzed by transition metal oxides and microbial biomass wang et al 2016 if necessary iron containing minerals or manganese containing minerals can be added to the drywell to enhance the rate of decomposition of h2o2 pham et al 2012 because o2 is produced when h2o2 decomposes through transition metal catalyzed reactions this process increases dissolved oxygen concentrations in the subsurface this is potentially beneficial because aerobic biodegradation of residual organic contaminants e g transformation products formed by the uv h2o2 process tends to be more effective than biotransformation that takes place under anoxic or anaerobic conditions lhotský et al 2017 mikkonen et al 2018 regnery et al 2017 ying et al 2008 another consideration for successful operation is maintenance the suspended uv lamp avoids any potential fouling on the lamp sleeve therefore the longevity of the uv reactor is only limited by the lifetime of uv lamps typically 5000 h the longevity of the electrochemical reactor is limited by aging of the air diffusion cathode or the cation exchange membrane although additional experiments are needed to further assess the longevity of the air diffusion cathode cation exchange membranes have been fabricated to enhance their oxidative stability they typically operate for 1000 h park et al 2018 because the proposed treatment only operates during the rainy season a total of several hundred hours of operation per year it appears likely that the proposed system can be operated with only annual maintenance which is consistent with practices employed by communities that use drywells whatcom county 2021 conclusions electrochemical generation of h2o2 followed by activation of h2o2 with uv light efficiently removed trace organic contaminants from stormwater h2o2 was efficiently generated in stock solutions under different water matrix and applied current densities the maximum h2o2 concentrations achieved in the stock solution were between 400 and 600 mm although stormwater composition impacted the h2o2 stock solution stability neutralization of basic ph conditions by mixing the catholyte and anolyte resulted in sufficient stability to enable h2o2 generation for up to three days before arrival of a storm and to provide enough h2o2 to treat a typical storm lasting as long as eight hours these lab scale tests and model predictions while indicating the potential for removing trace organic contaminants did not account for several factors that could be encountered in field scale applications for example during h2o2 generation tests decreased performance of the electrode was observed after extended use possibly as a result of flooding i e decreased hydrophobicity of the water facing side of the electrode further research should be conducted to investigate the factors that affect the electrode lifetime e g current density electrolyte conductivity due to the variation in stormwater compositions h2o2 decomposition rates in the stock solutions also may merit further assessment for locations with high concentrations of natural organic matter in stormwater submerged uv lamps capable of delivering uv light to stormwater more efficiently by avoiding the light reflection and scattering at water air interface may be needed however the tradeoff between lamp fouling and lamp efficiency requires further analysis uv led lamps offer promising alternatives because of the minimal heat generation at lamp surface which reduces the potential for precipitative fouling linden et al 2019 new engineering solutions for fitting the reactors into the drywell may also be advantageous low cost sensors and controllers also may be coupled with operation of this system to maximize water quality benefits and

19946,recharge of urban stormwater has often been limited by the high cost of land and concerns about contamination of groundwater to provide a possible solution we developed an electrochemical advanced oxidation system uv h2o2 that is compatible with high capacity stormwater recharge systems e g drywells the system employed an air diffusion cathode to generate a h2o2 stock solution i e typically around 600 mm prior to the storm event the h2o2 stock solution was then metered into stormwater and converted into hydroxyl radical oh by an ultraviolet lamp the energy consumption for h2o2 generation was optimized by adjusting the applied current density and adding an inert salt e g na2so4 to stormwater h2o2 in the stock solution was unstable by mixing the basic h2o2 containing catholyte and the acidic anolyte the stability increased enabling generation of the h2o2 stock solution up to three days prior the storm event with loss of less than 20 of the h2o2 lab scale experiments and a kinetic model were used to assess the feasibility of the full scale advanced oxidation system system performance decreased at elevated concentrations of dissolved organic carbon in stormwater due to enhanced light reflection and backscattering at the water air interface in the uv reactor competition for uv light absorption with h2o2 and the tendency of organic matter to act as a oh scavenger the proposed system can be incorporated into drywells to remove greater than 90 of trace organic contaminants under typical operating conditions the electrical energy per order of the system is estimated to range from 0 5 to 2 kwh m3 depending on the dissolved organic carbon concentration graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords green infrastructure aquifer recharge electrochemical generation hydrogen peroxide trace organic contaminant introduction climate change and rapid population growth are exacerbating water scarcity in cities around the world flörke et al 2018 the capture and use of urban stormwater are attractive to water stressed cities because this underutilized water source is available in large quantities and does not require large investments in environmentally damaging long distance conveyance systems due to limited opportunities for water storage within cities captured urban runoff might best be used for aquifer recharge in cities that rely upon groundwater luthy et al 2019 however stormwater contains contaminants including pesticides compounds released by vehicles and waterborne pathogens all of which can pose risks to drinking water supplies grebel et al 2013 rippy et al 2017 spahr et al 2020 rather than relying upon natural attenuation or treatment after extraction to remove trace organic contaminants some form of treatment may be appropriate prior to recharge zhang et al 2020 researchers have studied the use of engineered geomedia such as manganese oxide coated sands charbonnet et al 2020 grebel et al 2016 woodchips ashoori et al 2019 functionalized clays ray et al 2019 and biochar ashoori et al 2019 boehm et al 2020 ulrich et al 2015 as a passive means of stormwater treatment however such treatment systems are often limited by the low hydraulic conductivities of geomedia or underlying soils and sediments barnes et al 2014 minnesota stormwater steering committee 2005 ray et al 2019 infiltration rates are also limited by the need to achieve adequate contact times between the engineered geomedia and the contaminants grebel et al 2016 shimabuku et al 2016 in addition geomedia eventually will clog or be exhausted which necessitates replacement or regeneration to assure continued operation charbonnet et al 2018 2021 as a result infiltration based techniques that employ geomedia are often unable to treat large volumes of stormwater in urban areas in locations where surface infiltration is impractical drywells offer an attractive alternative due to their high infiltration rates and small footprints edwards et al 2016 for reference to achieve a recharge rate of 400 l min a value typical of drywells an area of 1 5 m2 and 1200 m2 would be required for drywells and rain gardens maximum

trace organic compounds and viruses into drywells because high flow rates during storms often preclude the use of geomedia as a result the use of drywells for urban stormwater infiltration without any

1999 advanced oxidation processes aops such as uv h2o2 have been used for over 40 years to oxidize organic contaminants in hazardous waste drinking water and contaminated groundwater by taking advantage of the high reactivity and low selectivity of hydroxyl radical oh koubek 1977 furthermore the process also controls waterborne pathogens because the fluence of ultraviolet uv light used in the process is typically about ten times higher than values used to disinfect drinking water sun et al 2016 despite its potential applicability only a few attempts bettman 2020 zheng et al 2021 have been made to employ aops in stormwater treatment systems due to the cost and challenges associated with system maintenance and reagent replenishment especially when infiltration structures are distributed around a city electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops are promising options for decentralized system because of their modular design high efficiency and ease of automation feng et al 2018 kanakaraju et al 2018 miklos et al 2018 moreira et al 2017 nidheesh et al 2018 yang 2020 yang and hoffmann 2016 to overcome the difficulties associated with using aops for distributed water treatment we employed an inexpensive compact system that generates h2o2 by electrochemical reduction of o2 eq 1 with an air diffusion cathode that uses only electricity and passive diffusion of air 1

communities gadgil 2008 2 h 2 o 2 uv 2 oh to employ this approach in a drywell or another type of stormwater infiltration system a sufficient quantity of h2o2 must be generated using inexpensive equipment that can fit into a small area to accomplish this objective we developeddeveloped h2o2 generation and storage strategies to produce a h2o2 stock solution prior to the storm event potentially with stormwater captured previously and then metered the h2o2 stock solution into stormwater prior to exposing it to uv light using a kinetic model of h2o2 activation and contaminant transformation we assessed the feasibility of employing uv h2o2 to treat urban stormwater under conditions typically encountered in drywells finally by systematic optimization of each process we demonstrated eaop is

anodic chamber were separated by a cation exchange membrane ultrex cmi 7000 membranes international inc ringwood nj the thickness of each chamber was 1 7 cm the divided electrochemical cell was chosen to avoid anodic oxidation of h2o2 which could limit the generation of high concentration h2o2 solutions and lower the faraday efficiency of the generation process abdullah and xing 2017 ma et al 2019 panizza and cerisola 2008 pérez et al 2017 after h2o2 was generated in the electrochemical cell the h2o2 containing catholyte was mixed with the anolyte to form a h2o2 stock solution the h2o2 stock solution was then diluted into simulated stormwater and passed through a uv reactor the uv reactor used in this study was described by gadgil and garud 1998 briefly the reactor had a volume of 5 5 l and included a 60 watt low pressure uv lamp philips andover ma mounted under an aluminum reflector the uv lamp was situated approximately 6 cm above the surface of the flowing water h2o2 generation

reactors in series without the complexity of operating the large system under laboratory conditions the h2o2 stock solution was diluted from a 0 18 0 03 m n 15 stock solution by mixing equal volumes of catholyte and anolyte generated by batch mode electrolysis of a 0 2 m na2so4 electrolyte solution although cbz has not been detected frequently in stormwater it was chosen as a surrogate for trace organic contaminants in stormwater because it is mainly transformed by reactions with oh radicals it exhibits a low rate of direct photolysis and does not react with other photo produced transients produced by uv light barazesh et al 2015 most stormwater contaminants e g pesticides exhibit similar rate constants to cbz for reactions with oh radical some compounds also may be transformed by direct photolysis and or transient species produced when natural organic matter is exposed to uv light table s2 for some compounds that react with oh radicals slower than cbz e g atrazine the overall removal rates were observed to be higher than that of cbz during the uv h2o2 process because the other compounds undergo direct photolysis rozas et al 2016 therefore cbz can be used as a surrogate for most of the trace organic contaminants commonly detected in stormwater the light field in the uv reactor was characterized by chemical actinometry using atrazine under the same experimental conditions

after sampling jasper et al 2014 metal ions were quantified in triplicate on an agilent 7700 series inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms kinetic model for the uv h2o2 treatment a kinetic model was employed based on reaction schemes developed in previously published studies crittenden et al 1999 glaze et al 1995 song et al 2008 using kintecus version 6 80 ianni 2003 details of the model construction are described in the supplementary information section results and discussion h2o2 generation as a function of current density the applied current density could affect the h2o2 generation performance for stormwater treatment an ideal electrode should be able to generate a high concentration of h2o2 stock solution with high faraday efficiency comparing to in situ generation of h2o2 in a flow through reactor barazesh et al 2015 generating a high concentration of h2o2 before a storm event and storing it could reduce the energy consumption and system footprint by reducing the applied current density and electrode area it could also minimize the amount of salt added to the treated stormwater when h2o2 is produced in a salt amended electrolyte solution as described below however at very high concentrations especially under basic ph conditions encountered in the catholyte ph around 11 5 figure s4 the h2o2 is unstable due to self decomposition and reactions with transition metals and organics galbács and csányi 1983 petigara et al 2002 under applied current h2o2 can also undergo electrochemical reduction to h2o jiang et al 2018 therefore development of a better understanding of the effect of current density on h2o2 production rate faraday efficiency and factors affecting the maximum h2o2 concentration that can be generated provides a basis for selecting an optimum operational mode hydrogen peroxide formation in the catholyte fig 1 exhibited similar behavior in na2so4 electrolyte and in na2so4 amended stormwater at current densities ranging from 200 to 1200 a m2 the h2o2 concentrations increased in approximately a linear fashion with the applied charge density up to about 120 kc l at which point a concentration of around 430 mm had been produced for electrolysis conducted with 200 a m2 of current density the h2o2 concentration remained at around 430 mm as the charge density further increased for electrolysis conducted with higher current densities after the charge density reaching 120 kc l the h2o2 generation efficiency decreased until the h2o2 concentration in catholyte plateaued at around 600 mm because of the similar performance with respect to applied current density the system design and operation adjustment can be significantly simplified leading to considerable flexibility in the operation of the treatment system to assess the performance of this air diffusion cathode for h2o2 generation at high h2o2 concentrations these data were compared with results from previous studies on electrochemical synthesis of h2o2 in terms of surface normalized production rate faraday efficiency and maximum h2o2 concentration table s7 the device tested in this study was better suited for producing a concentrated stock solution for use in water treatment than the other 12 systems reported in the literature that also can generate a relatively high concentration of h2o2 solution with relative high faraday efficiency this may be due to the fact that most previous efforts either focused on achieving the maximum possible h2o2 concentration h2o2 max ranged from 320 to 5500 mm faraday efficiency ranged from 12 to 60 iwasaki et al 2018 luo et al 2015 oloman and watkinson 1979 yamanaka et al 2008 yamanaka and murayama 2008 yamanaka et al 2006 or high faraday efficiency faraday efficiency ranged from 79 to 99 h2o2 max ranged from 24 to 250 mm chen et al 2017 li et al 2013 sa et al 2019 wang et al 2020 li et al 2020 achieved 980 mm of h2o2 max with a faraday efficiency of 79 but their fuel cell reactor inhibits the application of their device in distributed locations because of lack of supply of pure h2 and o2 under the actual field condition in addition most of those devices were designed to be operated in strongly acidic or alkaline conditions with deteriorating performances observed at lower acid base concentrations foller et al 1991 yamanaka et al 2008 among the other approaches the method of xia et al 2019 shows considerable promise due to its high faraday efficiency 90 to 95 and ability to produce a high concentration of h2o2 5900 mm however the system requires pumping humidified air as a source of o2 rather than relying on the passive diffusion of air the system also requires passage of water through a solid electrolyte these requirements would likely increase the system cost and increase the risk of system failures two outcomes that could be problematic in remote operations energy consumption during h2o2 generation the energy consumption was dictated by the cell voltage which was mainly affected by the ohmic loss and the overpotential the ohmic loss of an electrochemical system depends upon the conductivity of the solution the overpotential is the driving force of the electrochemical process and was mainly determined by the electrode material and the applied current density for low conductivity solutions e g stormwater the energy consumption was mainly affected by the low conductivity of the electrolyte therefore it is possible to reduce the energy consumed for h2o2 production by adding an inert electrolyte e g na2so4 to the stormwater na2so4 was chosen as the electrolyte amendment because of its relatively low cost about 100 ton and the absence of undesirable products e g clo3 from nacl oxidation produced when it passes through the anode chamber a na2so4 concentration of 0 2 m was chosen to strike a balance between energy consumption and the amount of salt added to the stock solution energy consumption in stormwater amended with 0 02 m to 0 2 m of na2so4 was estimated as described in the text s4 and figure s6 at lower salt concentrations na2so4 0 1 m the energy consumption increased dramatically as the salt concentration decreased at na2so4 0 1 m the addition of salts barely decreased the energy consumption because the overpotential dominated the cell voltage given the relatively low cost of the na2so4 comparing to the cost of electricity the estimated overall cost of the system was decreased by adding na2so4 into stormwater used for production of the h2o2 stock solution text s5 and figure s8 for realistic operating conditions the amount of salts can be determined by balancing the energy cost and the cost for delivering and dosing the salts into the solution adding an electrolyte to a stock solution prior to h2o2 generation and then mixing a small volume of concentrated h2o2 solution into the stormwater would increase the total dissolved solids tds of the treated stormwater to avoid adverse impacts on water quality it is important to assure that the tds and sulfate concentration of the treated water would not exceed the usepa secondary maximum contaminant levels smcls for tds of 500 mg l as well as the sulfate concentration limit of 250 mg l usepa 2017 if the target h2o2 concentration in the stock solution was 200 mm and a 0 2 m solution of na2so4 was used in the stock solution then addition of h2o2 to produce an initial h2o2 concentration of 1 mm in the stormwater will increase the tds by about 140 mg l and sulfate by around 100 mg l which would be acceptable for drinking water purposes provided that the initial stormwater tds and sulfate concentrations were below 360 mg l and 150 mg l respectively if this were not the case a lower concentration of na2so4 would be necessary the energy consumption increased approximately in a linear fashion with respect to the applied current density fig 2 and figure s9 the increasing in energy consumption with increased current density was due to the increased ohmic loss and overpotential the solution matrix i e the presence or absence of synthetic stormwater constituents had little effect on the energy consumption because of the similar solution conductivity and h2o2 generation performance between na2so4 amended simulated stormwater and na2so4 electrolyte for electrolysis performed with current density of 800 a m2 and 1200 a m2 the energy consumption increased slightly after the h2o2 concentration reaching 450 mm due to decreased h2o2 generation efficiency although high current density may reduce the lifetime of the electrode carlesi jara and fino 2010 it enables h2o2 generation with a smaller electrode which could lower the system capital cost use of high current densities could also generate h2o2 more quickly meaning that less time would be needed to generate a sufficient quantity of h2o2 to prepare for a storm operating at a low current density could lower the energy consumption by over 50 but h2o2 loss during storage might become more significant under such conditions see following section the current density employed in the system can be adjusted based on uncertainty in the weather forecast the predicted duration and intensity of the storm and the amount of time that has elapsed since the previous storm which often affects stormwater quality grebel et al 2013 due to the voltage limitation of the power supply used in this research the energy consumption was evaluated with na2so4 concentrations above 0 02 m given the ionic strength of the simulated stormwater is typically around 0 005 m use of the air diffusion cathode to produce a stock solution of h2o2 without addition of salts would require a lower applied current density further research on electrode performance on h2o2 generation under low current density conditions is needed to evaluate the tradeoffs of operating this system without added salts h2o2 stability during storage after production h2o2 may need to be stored for periods of several days the stability of h2o2 maybe affected by solution ph galbács and csányi 1983 watts et al 1999 transition metals haber and weiss 1934 mckee 1969 organic matter petigara et al 2002 romero et al 2009 soil particles petigara et al 2002 and enzymes netto et al 1996 at the high concentration of h2o2 employed in this system microbial activity should be relatively low collén and pedersén 1996 therefore the loss caused by peroxidase enzymes should be insignificant in this system previous research has indicated that h2o2 is unstable under alkaline ph conditions galbács and csányi 1983 nicoll and smith 1955 špalek et al 1982 therefore the stability of h2o2 solution was assessed in the basic catholyte initial ph around 12 and after the catholyte was mixed with acidic anolyte which had an initial ph 0 61 0 04 and 0 78 0 15 for na2so4 electrolyte and simulated stormwater respectively generated during the electrolysis process referred to as na2so4 electrolyte and na2so4 amended stormwater in figure s10 figure s11 and fig 3 the concentration of h2o2 decreased by 33 in na2so4 amended stormwater catholyte and 27 in na2so4 catholyte within a day when it was mixed with the anolyte only 7 and 2 of the h2o2 was lost within a day in the mixed na2so4 amended stormwater and the mixed na2so4 electrolyte respectively figure s10 the enhanced stability was attributed to the reduction in the solution ph figure s11 abel 1952 and duke and haas 1961 reported the homogeneous uncatalyzed decomposition rate and reaction mechanism of h2o2 in alkaline aqueous solution as described in eq 5 6 5 h 2 o 2 ho 2 h k 10 11 7 6 h 2 o 2 ho 2 oh o 2 h 2 o k 1 61 m 1 h 1 during the h2o2 generation the high concentration of h2o2 ho2 in the catholyte buffered the solution ph around the pka value of h2o2 eq 5 without further adjusting the ph the disproportionation reaction eq 6 could be an important loss mechanism although neutralization of the catholyte slowed the rate of h2o2 decomposition rates of h2o2 decomposition in the catholyte anolyte mixture increased substantially after about one day the most likely explanation for the loss of h2o2 was transition metal catalyzed processes particularly from fe and cu in the suwannee river natural organic matter table s8 the reaction mechanisms for h2o2 decomposition in simulated stormwater matrix is complicated because of the interactions of h2o2 with transition metals haber and weiss 1934 mckee 1969 organic matter petigara et al 2002 romero et al 2009 walling and goosen 1973 and phosphate kakarla and watts 1997 and is therefore beyond the scope of this study the measured concentrations of fe and cu in na2so4 amended simulated stormwater were similar to the concentrations observed in stormwater samples collected when suspended particle concentrations were low as would be expected after stormwater pretreatment ahead of drywell infiltration kabir et al 2014 li et al 2012 most of the fe and cu in stormwater is likely to be associated with natural organic matters or complexed by phosphate aiken et al 2011 benjamin 2014 rose and waite 2003 therefore the h2o2 stability observed in the na2so4 amended simulated stormwater should represent its stability under actual field conditions addition of 50 mg l of san joaquin soil which is a typical concentration of suspended solids concentrations in stormwater mean tss 58 mg l grebel et al 2013 did not affect h2o2 stability to minimize h2o2 loss during storage the h2o2 generation process ideally should be completed immediately before the storm event starts assuming the h2o2 is generated in a continuous flow through electrochemical module that has a hydraulic residence time of less than 1 hour most of the loss of h2o2 will occur in the storage tank the loss will be driven by the h2o2 generated at the beginning of the generating process which will be stored for longer time the cumulative h2o2 loss under different operating conditions fig 3 was calculated based on the results of decomposition experiments figure s10 and the storage time t day 7 cumulative h 2 o 2 loss 0 t 1 c c 0 dt t 100 to limit the overall loss of h2o2 to less than 20 several approaches are possible first h2o2 generated by passage of water through the cathode can be used immediately if h2o2 generation starts less than one day prior to the storm event alternatively stormwater from the cathode chamber can be neutralized by mixing with stormwater that has passed through the anode in which case the h2o2 generation can be started up to three days prior to the storm event finally water with fewer impurities e g tap water can be used for h2o2 generation in which case generation of h2o2 can take place up to 10 days prior to the storm event an effective h2o2 generation strategy can be formulated based on the performance of the air diffusion cathode and the stability of h2o2 the required total current was estimated from the stability of h2o2 which determines the time available for h2o2 generation to scale up the system for conditions expected in a dry well the electrode area can be increased by stacking the required number of modular reactors finally a balance between the applied current density which determines electricity consumption and the electrode capital cost can be established for each specific application for example to treat a typical 8 hour storm event in which water flows at the full infiltration capacity of the drywell q 400 l min with an initial h2o2 concentration of 1 mm in the stormwater detailed discussion about h2o2 initial on the treatment performance is described in the following section the required amount of h2o2 stock solution h2o2 stock 200 mm v 1 m3 can be generated with five 40 cm 40 cm air diffusion cathodes operating at a current density of 800 a m2 for one day prior to the storm event the 1 m3 h2o2 stock solution reservoir and the electrochemical modules can be deployed within the available service area next to the drywell trace organic contaminant removal by advanced oxidation to assess the performance of the uv h2o2 aop the rate of transformation of a trace organic contaminant that is lost mainly through reactions with oh i e cbz was evaluated in simulated stormwater upon exposure to uv light and h2o2 most trace organic contaminants in stormwater react with oh radical at near diffusion controlled rates 109 1010 m 1 s 1 wols and hofman caris 2012 some trace organic contaminants may also be transformed by photolysis for cbz the contribution of photolysis to its removal is expected to be negligible relative to its reactions with oh text s6 measured concentrations of h2o2 and cbz were consistent with model predictions fig 4 the modest overprediction of transformation rates at low humic acid concentrations i e 0 and 0 13 mg c l was likely caused by impurities in the deionized water i e dissolved organic carbon concentrations in deionized water can be as high as 0 5 mg c l given that ion exchange resins do not remove the organics from the tap water which had a doc concentration ranging from 1 5 to 3 0 mg c l east bay municipal utility district 2019 the small underprediction in cbz removal rate at the highest humic acid concentration 5 0 mg c l was likely caused by the uncertainty of the rate constant for the reaction between oh and humic acid typically 50 appiani et al 2014 under conditions representative of stormwater treatment i e h2o2 initial and cbz initial of 1 mm and 10 μg l respectively the rate of transformation of the trace organic contaminants decreased as the concentration of humic acid increased at the highest dissolved organic carbon condition tested 5 0 mg c l humic acid the half life for cbz removal was around 1 6 min the uv h2o2 process should also result in inactivation of pathogens the photon fluence rates measured by chemical actinometry indicated that the uv dose delivered to water within 10 min of treatment were 2430 mj cm2 2300 mj cm2 1700 mj cm2 1480 mj cm2 and 1360 mj cm2 for humic acid concentration ranging from 0 mg c l to 5 0 mg c l for reference 4 log inactivation of cryptosporidium giardia and viruses requires 22 mj cm2 22 mj cm2 and 186 mj cm2 respectively usepa 2003 to avoid deposition of solutes and minerals on the surface of the uv lamps the uv reactor was designed with an air gap between the uv lamp and the water surface figure s12 although this design minimizes complications associated with submerged lamps it decreases light utilization efficiency because a substantial fraction of the uv light is reflected and backscattered at the air water interface and converted into heat although the aluminum reflector above the lamp redirects some of the light emitted from the lamp and light reflected from the air water interface back to the water it only returns about 70 of uv light per reflection li 2000 the percentage of uv light lost as heat was calculated as follows 8 uv light lost as heat 1 w 254 n a h ν a p η where w254 photon fluence rate at 254 nm ei cm 2 s 1 na 6 02 1023 mol 1 h ν energy per photon j a air water interface area cm2 p power of uv lamp w η electrical to uv conversion efficiency 35 usepa 2003 the percentage of uv light lost as heat increased from 17 to 55 as the concentration of humic acid increased from 0 to 5 0 mg c l because the humic acid enhanced reflection and backscattering of uv light at the air water interface fig 5 a the increased light reflection and backscattering with dissolved species agreed with observations from previous research clarke et al 1970 grüniger et al 1983 kozarac et al 2005 schwarzenbach et al 2016 for the light absorbed in the water column the fraction of light absorbed by each chromophore was calculated based on the concentration and the molar attenuation coefficient the percentage of uv light absorbed by h2o2 decreased from 99 to 4 as the concentration of humic acid increased from 0 to 5 0 mg c l as a result the oh production rate decreased and the rate of h2o2 loss also decreased in addition to slowing the rate of oh production by competing with h2o2 for uv light humic acid also slowed the cbz removal by serving as a oh scavenger fig 5b and text s7 the concentrations of oh were obtained from the kintecus kinetic model over experimental time scales the steady state concentrations of oh which were estimated by the average value of the oh concentrations decreased by about 90 as the humic acid concentration increased from 0 to 5 0 mg c l as the concentration of humic acid increased its relative importance as a oh scavenger also increased at 5 0 mg c l of humic acid close to half of the oh produced was scavenged by humic acid because the model did not account for the transition metal catalyzed dismutation of o2 the steady state concentration of this species was probably overestimated o2 therefore the actual scavenging effect of o2 included under radicals in fig 5b is probably less important especially at low humic acid concentrations despite the fact that oh react quickly with humic acid cbz was removed from stormwater in the presence of 5 0 mg c l of humic acid because the humic acid only reduced the steady state oh concentration by 90 however the overall performance of the system is expected to decrease dramatically as the humic acid concentration further increases due to the inefficient uv reactor design and the scavenging effect therefore under conditions likely to be useful in the field the maximum humic acid concentration in stormwater treated by this system is around 5 mg c l full scale treatment system design and considerations the kinetic model can provide guidance for the design of full scale treatment systems and their operation under different conditions considering a baseline case with a maximum flow rate of 400 l min i e 0 067 m3 s which is the typical value for drywells torrent resources 2021 along with other design conditions e g system size limited by space available to install a treatment system within a drywell the uv reactor will need to achieve at least 90 removal of a trace organic contaminant at diffusion controlled rates if it is transformed mainly by reactions with oh the initial h2o2 concentration in stormwater prior to exposure of uv light hereinafter referred to as initial h2o2 concentration in this section would need to be at least 0 1 mm and between 5 and 25 500 watt low pressure uv lamps would be needed to achieve the treatment goal if the humic acid concentrations ranged from 0 13 mg c l to 5 0 mg c l fig 6 considering these constraints the analysis indicated a trade off between the initial concentration of h2o2 and the number of lamps being operated at a humic acid concentration of 2 5 mg c l 90 of the organic contaminants can be removed with an initial h2o2 concentration of 0 6 mm and 15 lamps for a humic acid concentration of 5 mg c l an initial h2o2 concentration of 1 mm and 25 lamps is needed to assure 90 removal of a trace organic contaminant the initial h2o2 concentration in stormwater and the number of lamps being used affect the energy consumption by the full scale uv h2o2 system we used the electrical energy per order eeo of the system to compare the system performance under different operating conditions bolton et al 2001 overall eeo increased with the doc concentrations because of the light reflection and backscattering at air water interface competition for light absorption and oh scavenging by humic acid fig 7 we estimated eeo values of approximate were between 0 5 and 2 kwh m3 for condition that are likely to be employed in full scale treatment system for reference modern seawater desalination requires about 3 to 5 kwh m3 kim et al 2019 and electrochemical oxidation with boron doped diamond electrodes requires about 40 kwh m3 lanzarini lopes et al 2017 vahid and khataee 2013 the specific uv absorbance suva at 254 nm of humic substances measured in previous study 0 006 0 053 l mg 1 cm 1 weishaar et al 2003 were lower than the value measured in this study 0 083 0 001 l mg 1 cm 1 if stormwater with a lower suva value at 254 nm than the value used in our model is tested higher removal of contaminants and lower energy consumption may be observed another factor affecting the energy consumption is the applied current density used when preparing the h2o2 stock solution assuming the power consumption associated with h2o2 generation was 1 9 10 5 kwh mg h2o2 i 600 a m2 the h2o2 generation process consumed a similar amount of energy as the uv lamp for example at 5 0 mg c l of humic acid if the system is operated with an initial h2o2 concentration of 0 9 mm and 25 uv lamps 500 w generating enough h2o2 for one hour of continuous dosing into stormwater would consume about 14 kwh of electricity and operating the lamps for one hour would consume about 13 kwh electricity generating the same amount of h2o2 at current density ranging from 200 a m2 to 1200 a m2 would consume between 7 kwh and 20 kwh of electricity under the conditions employed in the aop less than 30 of the h2o2 will be converted into oh by uv light thus residual h2o2 i e up to around 1 mm remaining after the treatment would be recharged to groundwater residual h2o2 should decompose in the first several centimeters of subsurface mainly through reactions catalyzed by transition metal oxides and microbial biomass wang et al 2016 if necessary iron containing minerals or manganese containing minerals can be added to the drywell to enhance the rate of decomposition of h2o2 pham et al 2012 because o2 is produced when h2o2 decomposes through transition metal catalyzed reactions this process increases dissolved oxygen concentrations in the subsurface this is potentially beneficial because aerobic biodegradation of residual organic contaminants e g transformation products formed by the uv h2o2 process tends to be more effective than biotransformation that takes place under anoxic or anaerobic conditions lhotský et al 2017 mikkonen et al 2018 regnery et al 2017 ying et al 2008 another consideration for successful operation is maintenance the suspended uv lamp avoids any potential fouling on the lamp sleeve therefore the longevity of the uv reactor is only limited by the lifetime of uv lamps typically 5000 h the longevity of the electrochemical reactor is limited by aging of the air diffusion cathode or the cation exchange membrane although additional experiments are needed to further assess the longevity of the air diffusion cathode cation exchange membranes have been fabricated to enhance their oxidative stability they typically operate for 1000 h park et al 2018 because the proposed treatment only operates during the rainy season a total of several hundred hours of operation per year it appears likely that the proposed system can be operated with only annual maintenance which is consistent with practices employed by communities that use drywells whatcom county 2021 conclusions electrochemical generation of h2o2 followed by activation of h2o2 with uv light efficiently removed trace organic contaminants from stormwater h2o2 was efficiently generated in stock solutions under different water matrix and applied current densities the maximum h2o2 concentrations achieved in the stock solution were between 400 and 600 mm although stormwater composition impacted the h2o2 stock solution stability neutralization of basic ph conditions by mixing the catholyte and anolyte resulted in sufficient stability to enable h2o2 generation for up to three days before arrival of a storm and to provide enough h2o2 to treat a typical storm lasting as long as eight hours these lab scale tests and model predictions while indicating the potential for removing trace organic contaminants did not account for several factors that could be encountered in field scale applications for example during h2o2 generation tests decreased performance of the electrode was observed after extended use possibly as a result of flooding i e decreased hydrophobicity of the water facing side of the electrode further research should be conducted to investigate the factors that affect the electrode lifetime e g current density electrolyte conductivity due to the variation in stormwater compositions h2o2 decomposition rates in the stock solutions also may merit further assessment for locations with high concentrations of natural organic matter in stormwater submerged uv lamps capable of delivering uv light to stormwater more efficiently by avoiding the light reflection and scattering at water air interface may be needed however the tradeoff between lamp fouling and lamp efficiency requires further analysis uv led lamps offer promising alternatives because of the minimal heat generation at lamp surface which reduces the potential for precipitative fouling linden et al 2019 new engineering solutions for fitting the reactors into the drywell may also be advantageous low cost sensors and controllers also may be coupled with operation of this system to maximize water quality benefits and

19947,because paint particles consist of a resin polymer combined with one or more additives they bear compositional similarities with microplastics despite these shared characteristics however paint particles are often undetected deliberately overlooked or evade classification in the pool of micro debris all synthetic debris of 5 mm in size and in particular in the marine setting where an extensive body of microplastic literature exists accordingly the present paper provides a critical insight into the physico chemical properties sources distributions behaviour and toxicity of paint particles in the marine environment paint particles contain a greater proportion of additives than plastics and consequently are more brittle angular opaque dense heterogeneous and layered than microplastics of equivalent dimensions land based sources of paint particles including deteriorating or disturbed coatings on roads and building are transported to the ocean with other microplastics via urban runoff water treatment facilities and the atmosphere however inputs of paint particles are enhanced significantly and more directly by the disturbance erosion and weathering of coatings on coastal structures boats and ships estimates of paint particle emissions to the marine environment vary widely with calculated contributions to the total synthetic micro debris input as high as 35 upper estimates are consistent with available albeit limited quantitative information on the relative abundance of paint particles amongst synthetic material captured by sea surface trawls and ingested by marine animals of greatest environmental concern is the high chemical toxicity of paint particles compared with similarly sized microplastics and other synthetic debris this results from the contemporary and historical use of high concentrations of hazardous inorganic additives in marine antifouling and land based paints and the relatively ready mobilisation of harmful ions like cu cu2 tbt pb2 and cro4 2 from the matrix recommendations arising from this review include greater use of particulate capturing devices waste collection systems and recycling facilities during paint disturbance raising awareness of the potential impacts of discarded paint amongst users and alerting the microplastic community to the significance of paint particles and developing means by which they are isolated from environmental samples keywords paint particles microplastics marine environment composition impacts toxicity 1 introduction the recent scientific policy and management literature contains a plethora of studies on microplastics in the environment and in particular in the marine environment abbasi et al 2018 dauvergne 2018 liubartseva et al 2018 kane and clare 2019 henderson and green 2020 kor and mehdinia 2020 microplastics have been operationally defined as synthetic or semisynthetic materials constructed of polymers and additives that are 5 mm in diameter arthur et al 2009 with nanoplastics defined with a 1000 nm upper size limit gigault et al 2018 microplastics may be further divided into primary particles like pre production pellets clothing fibres and exfoliating beads used in cosmetic products that are 5 mm before entering the environment and secondary particles that are broken down from larger debris in situ to fragments films foams and fibres of 5 mm in size microplastics may also be classified according to additional physical or chemical attributes like polymer type colour roughness transparency and shape gauci et al 2019 bikker et al 2020 paint is a pigmented and usually opaque surface coating that has decorative protective or other specific technical properties oecd 2009 paint consists of polymers and additives and dried paint particles of 5 mm in size derived from the deterioration or removal of surface applications paint particles should strictly be classified as microplastics according to the definition above however there is relatively little systematic study of paint particles in the current marine scientific literature galafassi et al 2019 gaylarde et al 2021 this may in part be attributed to the omission of paint in marine litter guidelines and the consequent inconsistencies regarding its classification in the microplastic literature ospar commission 2010 thus some investigations include paint particles amongst the microplastic cohort lima et al 2014 cardoza et al 2018 haave et al 2019 while others operationally incidentally or deliberately exclude them or treat them differently when reporting or characterising samples free et al 2014 baini et al 2018 ferreira et al 2019 lacerda et al 2019 in this paper the similarities in and differences between microplastics and equivalently sized paint particles are critically evaluated based on their uses physico chemical characteristics sources behaviours and relative abundances in the environment the focus is on the marine setting in which both types of solid clearly exist but where the connection is often distinctly lacking or overlooked 2 plastics versus paints there are fundamental similarities in and differences between plastics and paints which are conceptualised in fig 1 thus plastics are constructed of one or more synthetic polymer whose properties may be customised by functional additives and fillers while paints consist of fine natural or synthetic polymeric particles the binder or resin and additives and fillers that are held together on a surface as a plastic like film when cured frequently used synthetic polymers in consumer and industrial plastics include acrylonitrile butadiene styrene polyethylene polypropylene polyethylene terephthalate pet polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride pvc while most paints are based on acrylic alkyd polyurethane epoxy or chlorinated rubber binders some additives are common to both plastics and paints like inorganic fillers and colourants while others are specific to or more commonly employed in either plastics or paints because of differences in the manufacture processing and function of the materials for example dryers emulsifiers and adhesion promoters are critical to the storage and application of many kinds of paint whereas blowing agents lubricants and impact modifiers are more important for the performance and durability of certain plastics in general the mass content of additives including pigments and fillers is significantly greater in dried paint films than in plastics and consequently the polymeric content is usually much greater in the latter there is also a smaller range of additives available for plastics because the higher processing temperatures required constrain the selection of chemicals and in particular colour pigments based on thermal stability these differences generally mean that paint particles are denser more brittle more angular less transparent and chemically more heterogeneous than microplastics moreover the nature of paint application results in a layered structure of identical or different formulations that may be contaminated by residue from the underlying substrate these characteristics may account for why paints are deliberately through appearance under a microscope imhof et al 2016 horton et al 2017 or operationally via density separation or chemical treatment coppock et al 2017 rodrigues et al 2020 excluded from the overall micro debris pool in environmental samples micro debris is defined as all synthetic debris of 5 mm in size including fibres tire wear particles and other vehicle derived solids pellets beads and paints 3 sources of paint particles to the marine environment the broad sources of paint particles to the marine environment are shown in fig 2 where paints are defined according to their principal users or applications a selection of various more specific sources is also illustrated in fig 3 in theory and as with microplastics sources can be divided into primary and secondary with the former representing fine 5 mm particles transported into the environment via runoff or the atmosphere and the latter encompassing particles that are formed in situ from for example the weathering of larger fragments or the deterioration or damage to coastal structures and boats ultimately however most paint particles are formed by the same mechanisms acting on the paint film and such a classification does not bear any relationship with physical or chemical properties or environmental behaviour mechanisms of deterioration are uv degradation of the binding polymer and intentional or unintentional mechanical disturbance of the coating damage wear and tear maintenance or removal the poor management of municipal waste containing unused paint or painted structures including building waste and packaging may act as a direct source of paint particles to the coastal environment through littering and failing coastal landfills pope et al 2011 more generally however the urban environment represents a rich and varied indirect source of paint particles that are generated when decorative anticorrosive or safety paints on private and public buildings road surfaces and municipal structures and street furniture undergo natural deterioration or are deliberately disturbed during maintenance repair or removal jartun et al 2009 turner and solman 2016 horton et al 2017 lee et al 2018 more directly large coastal structures like bridges and decommissioned naval establishments may act as locally significant sources of paint particles to the marine environment finkelstein et al 2003 shu et al 2015 however perhaps of broader concern in this respect is the uncontrolled release of paint particles from boats that are abandoned being recycled or undergoing repair reddy et al 2003 singh and turner 2009 rees et al 2014 soon et al 2021 regarding the latter maintenance of hulls in the leisure boat sector is generally unregulated and yet produces significant quantities of toxic antifouling paints particles of a range of sizes from the scraping sanding stripping sand blasting and hydro blasting of spent coatings furthermore older formulations that are disturbed often contain metals and biocides that are now restricted or prohibited eklund et al 2014 soroldoni et al 2018 paint particles from these sources are transported to the aquatic environment as airborne particulates that are subject to fallout with road runoff or treated waste water or via washdown from boat maintenance facilities or coastal structures undergoing repair the significance of the local transport of airborne paint particles has been established from the levels and signatures of contamination of soils and roof top dusts of residential and municipal buildings in the vicinity of roads dry docks boatyards and harbours decelis and vella 2007 jartun et al 2009 turner 2013 eklund et al 2014 sakata et al 2017 meza figueroa et al 2018 given the particle size range generated by sanding in the range of 50 nm to a few μm in diameter koponen et al 2009 however the potential range of airborne transport of paint particles is considerable for example microplastics of dimensions orders of magnitude greater albeit less dense and usually fibrous appear to have the propensity to be transported thousands of km with regional air masses bergmann et al 2019 brahney et al 2020 while geosolids towards the upper size limit generated by sanding may be transported globally mahowald et al 2014 paint particles are also generated while ships are at sea for example groundings and collisions are known to generate large quantities of antifouling paint around the location of impaction negri et al 2002 jones 2007 van der schyff et al 2020 while vessels navigating through ice or fishing activities generating friction between painted surfaces and rope may also act as more diffuse sources negri and marshall 2009 song et al 2014 it is also likely that paint particles are generated more passively with the general wear and tear erosion of hull waterline topside and deck coatings dibke et al 2021 4 inputs of paint particles to the marine environment estimating the quantities of paint particles entering the marine environment or their contribution to the total marine microplastic pool is fraught with difficulties and uncertainties one of the fundamental considerations in this respect is whether the mass of dried paint should be converted to the mass of polymer by subtracting the weights of additives and fillers present before direct quantitative comparisons are made with microplastics while this approach is often favoured for flux calculations and inventories additives and fillers are integral components of both paints and microplastics that from physical environmental and toxicological perspectives should not be ignored input estimates are generally based on the quantities of paints manufactured for or sold in different sectors and quantitative assumptions about longevity removal disposal and retention by waste facilities and are usually compared with estimates for other types of microplastic based on equivalent assumptions sundt et al 2014 lassen et al 2015 verschoor et al 2016 in a recent example hann et al 2018 estimated emissions of different types of microplastics to the european aquatic environment using data information and assumptions on paints published in earlier oecd reports oecd 2005 oecd 2009 and supplied by the european council of the paint printing ink and artist s colours industry cepe neglecting inputs from poor waste management or the degradation of larger plastic waste lower middle and upper estimates for each microplastic category considered were derived table 1 for building marine and road marking paints estimates were based on figures for consumption coupled with assumptions on rates of removal during maintenance wear and tear and polymer degradation and rates of retention entrapment or loss by water treatment facilities road side sedimentation devices road cleaning adjacent soils and asphalt surfaces not factored into the estimates for paint were emissions to water when uncured disturbance of layers of paint below the top coat for example primers and base coats weathering of marine paints while in service or at the end of life and the direct input of airborne dusts within these assumptions and constraints estimates for paint particle emissions to surface waters range from about 12 000 to 30 000 tonnes or between about 10 and 17 of total microplastic inputs presumably inputs to the marine environment are related to these estimates but with modification of building and road paint inputs by settlement and entrapment in rivers given the many sources of marine paint particles neglected in the calculations above it is likely that the emission figures for each paint category in table 1 have been underestimated in their calculations for example mcadams and angelskår 2020 considered all paint applied to industrial and marine steel assets not just marine paints and about 42 billion litres per annum and assumed a 20 year coating lifetime or a 5 loss per year and 50 efficiency of waste retrieval a resulting 2 3 million tonnes of paint particles was predicted to enter the oceans annually representing a highly significant fraction of the estimated 8 million tonnes of total plastic entering the marine environment each year jambeck et al 2015 the calculated relative contribution of paint to the latter estimate is still subject to many uncertainties but is more consistent with measurements of the relative abundance of micro debris constituents that include paint obtained by surface trawls in the ocean and as reported below 5 presence and abundance of paint particles in the marine environment the presence of protective and antifouling paint particles in sediment deposits in the vicinity of boatyards marinas harbours and abandoned boats has been well documented from visual or microscopic inspection of sieved samples thomas et al 2003 turner 2010 takahashi et al 2012 eklund et al 2014 rees et al 2014 costa et al 2016 lagerström et al 2016 soroldoni et al 2018 abreu et al 2020 based on sediment contamination by cu singh and turner 2009 estimated antifouling paint particle abundance of up to 1 on a mass basis in a tidal inlet of southwest england while direct counting of antifouling paint particles in sediments from a brazilian lagoon by soroldoni et al 2018 revealed mass contamination of up to 4 4 in contrast very little quantitative information exists on paint particles in intertidal and benthic marine sediments more remote from significant point sources thus in the coastal environment díez minguito et al 2020 refer to paint sheets in sediments from the ría de vigo northwest spain at water depths of up to 40 m while haave et al 2019 report paint particles in a norwegian fjord at depths of up to 330 m along the strandline of a sandy beach in eastern england latuta 2019 report that almost one half of microplastics retrieved by density separation were paint based in the open ocean fischer et al 2015 mention paint chips being present in sediments from the northwest pacific kuril kamchatka trench and its adjacent abyssal plain at depths of around 5 km unfortunately however none of these studies provide clear quantitative information on the paint particles observed nor characteristics that could determine their origin a greater body of more quantitative data exist for paint particles captured by plankton trawls at or near the sea surface in some cases visible or chemical characterisation of particles has revealed that the protective or antifouling paints of the research vessel or trawl frame was a significant and sometimes dominant source created by shedding from the hull or collisions between the vessel and sampling equipment rummel et al 2016 bagaev et al 2017 eriksen et al 2018 lacerda et al 2019 suaria et al 2020 however in other cases trawls deployed from unpainted vessels or paint sample characteristics sufficiently different to those of formulations applied to the research vessel or trawl frame have allowed external sources to be inferred lima et al 2014 found that paint particles contributed nearly 30 of all microplastics and up to about 0 1 particle m 3 in 300 μm nets trawled in the goiana estuary brazil the greatest concentrations were encountered in the bottom waters and during the rainy season coincident with the period of most intensive fishing activities kang et al 2015a found alkyd based paint particles contributed 20 to 50 of suspended microplastics in the mouth of nakdong river korea with abundances of up to about 1 m 3 captured by a 330 μm manta trawl but up to 230 m 3 captured by a finer 50 μm hand net dibke et al 2012 recently estimated that up to 80 of the microplastics sampled from surface waters of the german bight north sea using an on board deck wash system were ship paints based on epoxy acryl and chlorinated rubber binders the remaining material was dominated by polyethylene polypropylene and pet derived from packaging and mismanaged waste paint particles have also been reported amongst microplastic debris retrieved from plankton trawls in the north atlantic morét ferguson et al 2010 black sea öztekin and bat 2017 tropical and equatorial western atlantic ocean ivar do sul et al 2014 garcia et al 2020 adriatic sea suaria et al 2016 and gulf of oman aliabad et al 2019 and over the great barrier reef hall et al 2015 jensen et al 2019 in the coastal zone of korea song et al 2014 observed paint particles in the sea surface microlayer or the boundary layer between the atmosphere and ocean sampled to a depth of 400 μm using a metal sieve the mean particle abundance was found to be about 200 l 1 or 150 m 2 compared with an abundance of other microplastics of 16 l 1 or 13 m 2 significantly there was a distinct increase in paint particle number with decreasing size 1000 μm to 50 μm which was attributed to the gradual breakdown of the floating stock of paint particles into smaller pieces quantitatively and qualitatively the observations and measurements above are subject to various limitations and uncertainties specifically in sediment where harsh chemical treatment e g peroxidation or acidification and flotation are employed to isolate microplastics the abundance of paint particles is predicted to be under reported because of their greater density and lower chemical stability see below in seawater paint particle concentrations are likely underestimated because of the inherent size limits of the capturing devices or detection methods and the propensity for paint particles to fragment to sizes below these limits during sample processing nevertheless it is clear that paint particles are a significant if not the dominant form of microplastic at or near the water column surface and within intertidal and benthic sediments in many marine settings accordingly it would appear that the sources processes and assumptions involved in estimates of paint inputs into the aquatic environment and as exemplified in table 1 require re evaluation 6 environmental behaviour transport and exposure of paint particles one of the key physical factors that determines the transport behaviour and fate of plastics in natural waters or engineered systems for example water treatment facilities is density de la fuente et al 2021 this property also forms the basis by which microplastics are extracted through flotation from environmental samples like soils and sediments miller et al 2017 density ranges for common plastics and paints are compared in fig 4 for plastics the lowest values represent the pure polymer while maximum values denote formulations loaded with the highest concentrations of mineral or glass fibre filler plasticiser or flame retardant according to the omnexus material selection platform specialchem 2021 for dried paints the overall density range and noted formulations are based on information in the scientific and commercial literature also annotated on fig 4 are the density range of seawater and the density range of solutions of zncl2 that are commonly used to extract microplastics from environmental samples rodrigues et al 2020 low density plastics like polyethylene are predicted to float in seawater while high density plastics like pet and pvc are predicted to sink plastics of intermediate density or with a relatively low density but broad range like polypropylene and polystyrene are expected to exhibit negative or positive buoyancy depending on the content and nature of additives and fillers the precise density of ambient seawater and any biofouling present for paints however all formulations are ultimately predicted to sink in the marine environment based on density considerations because of the greater abundance of inorganic additives and fillers in the dried formulations this means that in theory paint particles of equivalent dimensions and shapes to microplastics are more readily deposited and less mobile in aquatic systems regarding extraction by flotation in zncl2 solution the majority of microplastics should be isolated when a relatively high concentration of the salt is employed but many types of paint particles including those with clear marine origins would evade capture by this approach haave et al 2019 that is conventional extraction methods are predicted to underestimate the stock of micro sized synthetic polymeric particulates empirical studies on the settling characteristics of antifouling paints in artificial estuarine water salinity 15 have shown that above a diameter of 1 mm settling is related to density and size but below 180 μm most particles remain at the surface without agitation and settle only after the surface tension had been broken with stirring soroldini et al 2018 accordingly the authors suggested that the size range of paint particles generated in local harbours and boatyards could be transported several tens of km from their point of origin in a lagoonal estuary within 24 h depending on local hydrodynamic and meteorological conditions more generally surface tension augmented in natural seawater by biogenic material song et al 2014 and broken only by energy equivalent to wind speeds 6 6 m s 1 wurl et al 2011 coupled with long range airborne transport may account for the ready detection of paint particles at or near the sea surface in locations remote from any immediate point sources and as discussed earlier with paint particles encountered at the sea surface and in the pelagic and benthic zones it is not surprising that they have been detected amongst other micro debris in the digestive tracts and sometimes gills of various marine animals including birds fish crustaceans cetaceans turtles and invertebrates and as summarised in table 2 in many cases paint particles are noted without detailed or systematic quantification or characterisation and critical information on abundance sources selectivity impacts and fate is lacking where paint particles have been counted and classified in fish guts however the contribution of this material to the mp cohort on a number basis may be as high as 35 cardoza et al 2018 with blue often noted as the dominant colour herrera et al 2019 paint particles may be ingested passively while suspended in the water or attached to dietary material like algae russell et al 2011 or mistaken for items of food like zooplankton because of similarities in colour size and texture kang et al 2015b in controlled laboratory experiments involving a range of suspension and deposit feeding invertebrates ground antifouling paint particle composites appear to be ingested without any avoidance mechanisms evident turner et al 2008 turner et al 2009 muller karanssos et al 2019 likewise studies in the avian literature suggest that paint particles may be incidentally or even deliberately ingested by seabirds and waterfowl while foraging for food molnar 1983 sileo and fefer 1987 turner 2010 7 paint particle toxicity and impacts on biota from a general ecological and health perspective exposure to paint particles is likely to exert similar impacts on marine organisms as exposure to microplastics of equivalent dimensions yin et al 2018 bringer et al 2020 maes et al 2020 a greater concern regarding contemporary and historical paint particles however is the presence and availability of additives that are hazardous while asbestos cadmium compounds and certain phthalate esters and brominated flame retardants have been employed in speciality paints of more general concern are lead based compounds that were common in historical paints with wide ranging applications including road markings buildings and shipping and biocidal additives that are fundamental to marine antifouling formulations a variety of lead compounds were used as drying catalysts lead acetate octoate and naphthenate pigments for colour opacity and protection e g lead carbonates sulphates oxides chromates and on metal corrosion inhibitors e g lead tetroxide calcium plumbate restrictions have eliminated the intentional use of lead in paints in many sectors but legacy coatings remain an important source of the metal to the environment mielke et al 2008 turner and lewis 2018 copper i based compounds have played a critical role in antifouling paints for many decades with other metal based biocides based on compounds of tributyl tin lead arsenic and mercury phased out but still encountered on the hulls of older boats and abandoned vessels eklund and eklund 2014 rees et al 2014 various organic and organo metallic booster compounds with herbicidal properties have often been added at smaller concentrations to antifouling paints with many undergoing restrictions but encountered in historical boat coatings parks et al 2010 while lead compounds and certain biocides have also been added to plastics both their concentrations and mobilities are significantly greater in paint particles for example the maximum lead content of beached microplastics mainly polyolefins retrieved from south west england was about 5000 mg kg 1 massos and turner 2017 with pvc fragments having concentrations in the range 10 000 to 20 000 mg kg 1 turner and solman 2016 in contrast the lead content of paint fragments derived from the hulls of abandoned boats can regularly exceed 20 by weight rees et al 2014 or an order of magnitude higher than the maximum concentration reported for pvc regarding biocides the typical content in protected plastics is 1 000 mg kg 1 dylingowski and 2004 this contrasts with cu i concentrations in the dry films of contemporary and historical antifouling formulations of up to 50 by weight muller karanassos et al 2019 a specific chemical comparison between a fragment of polyethylene pigmented with pbcro4 that had been retrieved from the strandline of a beach and a copper based antifouling paint fragment taken from an abandoned boat is shown in fig 5 here x ray fluorescent spectra acquired under the same operating conditions are illustrated over the energy range 0 to 14 kev with selected principal secondary x ray peaks identified annotated in the boxes and where quantification was possible by fundamental parameters are concentrations of elements detected in each sample in mg kg 1 clearly the number and magnitude of peaks and overall elemental concentrations are greater in the antifouling fragment but the percentage balance also annotated consisting of light elements not detected by the instrument z 11 and indicative of the polymer concentration is considerably lower more generally these observations are also consistent with the greater abundance of additives and lower polymer content of paints relative to plastics discussed earlier the greater mobility of hazardous chemicals in paint particles relative to plastics is evident from differences in the quantities of toxic metal ions e g cu cu2 tbt pb2 cro4 2 released from each particle type into physiological solutions that simulate the mammalian or avian stomach turner and radford 2010 smith and turner 2020 and from the more stringent guidelines and regulations that deal with toxic metals in paint gooch 1993 factors that account for a greater mobility of metals in paint than in plastic include a higher additive to polymer binder ratio in the dried formulation the brittleness of weathered paint and its propensity to readily fragment into smaller particles of high surface area and the more ready aging and degradation of the paint binder than the plastic polymer more specifically in hard ablative and self polishing antifouling paints biocides are designed to leach out or the entire formulations dissolve at controlled rates into the surrounding medium the greater solubility of hazardous additives in paint than in plastic also results in a higher toxicity thus in the aquatic environment while chemicals leaching from microplastics including pb have been shown to be toxic to bacteria invertebrates and fish silva et al 2016 boyle et al 2020 sarkur et al 2020 the quantities of plastic relative to water volume used to generate leachates are well in excess of levels encountered in the environment by contrast poisoning of birds through the ingestion of leaded paint particles has been documented in situ molnar 1983 finkelstein et al 2003 and concentrations of antifouling paint representative of those encountered in contaminated harbour sediments have been shown to elicit toxic responses in epibenthic copepods crustaceans and macroinvertebrates in controlled laboratory exposures for example muller karanassos et al 2021 report 5 day lethal and effects concentrations lc50 and ec50 respectively for size fractionated particles 100 μm to 1 mm derived from a modern cu based antifouling paint of 19 9 and 14 6 g per l of estuarine sediment respectively for the ragworm hediste diversicolor and 2 3 g l 1 and 1 4 g l 1 respectively for the common cockle cerrastoderma edule soroldoni et al 2017 report a significant decrease in fecundity for epibenthic copepods exposed to 0 01 of modern cu based antifouling paint particles 63 μm in estuarine sediment and an lc50 arising from the elutriate of a preparation equivalent to 0 14 of paint soroldoni et al 2020 subsequently demonstrated 10 day lc50 values for benthic microcrustaceans exposed to estuarine sediment spiked with fractionated antifouling paint particles of 0 16 to 0 45 by mass of sediment the biocidal properties of antifouling formulations also impact on colonisation by marine bacteria thus while microplastics are rapidly colonised by microbial communities that do not differ greatly from communities on other inert surfaces like glass rock or wood wright et al 2020 antifouling surfaces provide a habitat to select particular but sometimes diverse bacterial populations that are resistant to the active biocides chen et al 2013 flach et al 2017 tagg et al 2019 analysed and compared biofilm communities on microplastics and paint particles retrieved from sediment grabs in the coastal baltic alkyd and epoxy based paints that likely included antifouling fragments although this was not explicitly stated were found to support communities that were distinct from and more consistent than biofilms on polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride microplastics and on natural particles significantly an abundance of taxa from the desulfobacteraceae family on some paint particles suggests that their presence in sediment may have impacts on the sulphur metabolism cycle 8 concluding remarks the sources pathways behaviour and receptors of marine paint particles described above are summarised in fig 6 also shown are the ions of greatest ecotoxicological concern that are by design or otherwise mobilised from paint additives into seawater given that both the abundance and mobility of harmful additives are greater in most paint particles compared with microplastics of equivalent dimensions it is concerning that the former are often overlooked or deliberately excluded from the micro debris pool in environmental samples baini et al 2018 ferreira et al 2019 this omission means that quantitative comparisons of plastic to paint abundance in seawater sediments and digestive tracts are often lacking it is also likely that the significance of the paint pool is understated from surface or near surface water sampling because the most mobile paint particles evade capture by the mesh size of common trawling nets 100 to a few hundred μm while larger particles have a greater propensity to sink in sediment paint particle abundance is also underestimated because the densities of conventional solutions used to isolate micro debris are lower than the densities of many common paint formulations and treatments typically used to isolate microplastics may be physically or chemically destructive to paints clearly a greater awareness of the potential environmental and health impacts of paints particles and development of methods for their recovery and isolation are required amongst the microplastic community and general measures to reduce the inputs of paints to the aquatic environment by manufacturers and users are called for regarding the latter potential solutions include reducing the volume of materials that require painting improving the wear resistance and enhancing end of life degradation of formulations increasing the use and efficacy of dust extraction systems during maintenance and repair improving waste collection systems in boatyards and incentivising the safe and sustainable disposal or recycling of boats turner 2010 rees et al 2014 verschoor et al 2016 declaration of competing interest the

19947,because paint particles consist of a resin polymer combined with one or more additives they bear compositional similarities with microplastics despite these shared characteristics however paint particles are often undetected deliberately overlooked or evade classification in the pool of micro debris all synthetic debris of 5 mm in size and in particular in the marine setting where an extensive body of microplastic literature exists accordingly the present paper provides a critical insight into the physico chemical properties sources distributions behaviour and toxicity of paint particles in the marine environment paint particles contain a greater proportion of additives than plastics and consequently are more brittle angular opaque dense heterogeneous and layered than microplastics of equivalent dimensions land based sources of paint particles including deteriorating or disturbed coatings on roads and building are transported to the ocean with other microplastics via urban runoff water treatment facilities and the atmosphere however inputs of paint particles are enhanced significantly and more directly by the disturbance erosion and weathering of coatings on coastal structures boats and ships estimates of paint particle emissions to the marine environment vary widely with calculated contributions to the total synthetic micro debris input as high as 35 upper estimates are consistent with available albeit limited quantitative information on the relative abundance of paint particles amongst synthetic material captured by sea surface trawls and ingested by marine animals of greatest environmental concern is the high chemical toxicity of paint particles compared with similarly sized microplastics and other synthetic debris this results from the contemporary and historical use of high concentrations of hazardous inorganic additives in marine antifouling and land based paints and the relatively ready mobilisation of harmful ions like cu cu2 tbt pb2 and cro4 2 from the matrix recommendations arising from this review include greater use of particulate capturing devices waste collection systems and recycling facilities during paint disturbance raising awareness of the potential impacts of discarded paint amongst users and alerting the microplastic community to the significance of paint particles and developing means by which they are isolated from environmental samples keywords paint particles microplastics marine environment composition impacts toxicity 1 introduction the recent scientific policy and management literature contains a plethora of studies on microplastics in the environment and in particular in the marine environment abbasi et al 2018 dauvergne 2018 liubartseva et al 2018 kane and clare 2019 henderson and green 2020 kor and mehdinia 2020 microplastics have been operationally defined as synthetic or semisynthetic materials constructed of polymers and additives that are 5 mm in diameter arthur et al 2009 with nanoplastics defined with a 1000 nm upper size limit gigault et al 2018 microplastics may be further divided into primary particles like pre production pellets clothing fibres and exfoliating beads used in cosmetic products that are 5 mm before entering the environment and secondary particles that are broken down from larger debris in situ to fragments films foams and fibres of 5 mm in size microplastics may also be classified according to additional physical or chemical attributes like polymer type colour roughness transparency and shape gauci et al 2019 bikker et al 2020 paint is a pigmented and usually opaque surface coating that has decorative protective or other specific technical properties oecd 2009 paint consists of polymers and additives and dried paint particles of 5 mm in size derived from the deterioration or removal of surface applications paint particles should strictly be classified as microplastics according to the definition above however there is relatively little systematic study of paint particles in the current marine scientific literature galafassi et al 2019 gaylarde et al 2021 this may in part be attributed to the omission of paint in marine litter guidelines and the consequent inconsistencies regarding its classification in the microplastic literature ospar commission 2010 thus some investigations include paint particles amongst the microplastic cohort lima et al 2014 cardoza et al 2018 haave et al 2019 while others operationally incidentally or deliberately exclude them or treat them differently when reporting or characterising samples free et al 2014 baini et al 2018 ferreira et al 2019 lacerda et al 2019 in this paper the similarities in and differences between microplastics and equivalently sized paint particles are critically evaluated based on their uses physico chemical characteristics sources behaviours and relative abundances in the environment the focus is on the marine setting in which both types of solid clearly exist but where the connection is often distinctly lacking or overlooked 2 plastics versus paints there are fundamental similarities in and differences between plastics and paints which are conceptualised in fig 1 thus plastics are constructed of one or more synthetic polymer whose properties may be customised by functional additives and fillers while paints consist of fine natural or synthetic polymeric particles the binder or resin and additives and fillers that are held together on a surface as a plastic like film when cured frequently used synthetic polymers in consumer and industrial plastics include acrylonitrile butadiene styrene polyethylene polypropylene polyethylene terephthalate pet polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride pvc while most paints are based on acrylic alkyd polyurethane epoxy or chlorinated rubber binders some additives are common to both plastics and paints like inorganic fillers and colourants while others are specific to or more commonly employed in either plastics or paints because of differences in the manufacture processing and function of the materials for example dryers emulsifiers and adhesion promoters are critical to the storage and application of many kinds of paint whereas blowing agents lubricants and impact modifiers are more important for the performance and durability of certain plastics in general the mass content of additives including pigments and fillers is significantly greater in dried paint films than in plastics and consequently the polymeric content is usually much greater in the latter there is also a smaller range of additives available for plastics because the higher processing temperatures required constrain the selection of chemicals and in particular colour pigments based on thermal stability these differences generally mean that paint particles are denser more brittle more angular less transparent and chemically more heterogeneous than microplastics moreover the nature of paint application results in a layered structure of identical or different formulations that may be contaminated by residue from the underlying substrate these characteristics may account for why paints are deliberately through appearance under a microscope imhof et al 2016 horton et al 2017 or operationally via density separation or chemical treatment coppock et al 2017 rodrigues et al 2020 excluded from the overall micro debris pool in environmental samples micro debris is defined as all synthetic debris of 5 mm in size including fibres tire wear particles and other vehicle derived solids pellets beads and paints 3 sources of paint particles to the marine environment the broad sources of paint particles to the marine environment are shown in fig 2 where paints are defined according to their principal users or applications a selection of various more specific sources is also illustrated in fig 3 in theory and as with microplastics sources can be divided into primary and secondary with the former representing fine 5 mm particles transported into the environment via runoff or the atmosphere and the latter encompassing particles that are formed in situ from for example the weathering of larger fragments or the deterioration or damage to coastal structures and boats ultimately however most paint particles are formed by the same mechanisms acting on the paint film and such a classification does not bear any relationship with physical or chemical properties or environmental behaviour mechanisms of deterioration are uv degradation of the binding polymer and intentional or unintentional mechanical disturbance of the coating damage wear and tear maintenance or removal the poor management of municipal waste containing unused paint or painted structures including building waste and packaging may act as a direct source of paint particles to the coastal environment through littering and failing coastal landfills pope et al 2011 more generally however the urban environment represents a rich and varied indirect source of paint particles that are generated when decorative anticorrosive or safety paints on private and public buildings road surfaces and municipal structures and street furniture undergo natural deterioration or are deliberately disturbed during maintenance repair or removal jartun et al 2009 turner and solman 2016 horton et al 2017 lee et al 2018 more directly large coastal structures like bridges and decommissioned naval establishments may act as locally significant sources of paint particles to the marine environment finkelstein et al 2003 shu et al 2015 however perhaps of broader concern in this respect is the uncontrolled release of paint particles from boats that are abandoned being recycled or undergoing repair reddy et al 2003 singh and turner 2009 rees et al 2014 soon et al 2021 regarding the latter maintenance of hulls in the leisure boat sector is generally unregulated and yet produces significant quantities of toxic antifouling paints particles of a range of sizes from the scraping sanding stripping sand blasting and hydro blasting of spent coatings furthermore older formulations that are disturbed often contain metals and biocides that are now restricted or prohibited eklund et al 2014 soroldoni et al 2018 paint particles from these sources are transported to the aquatic environment as airborne particulates that are subject to fallout with road runoff or treated waste water or via washdown from boat maintenance facilities or coastal structures undergoing repair the significance of the local transport of airborne paint particles has been established from the levels and signatures of contamination of soils and roof top dusts of residential and municipal buildings in the vicinity of roads dry docks boatyards and harbours decelis and vella 2007 jartun et al 2009 turner 2013 eklund et al 2014 sakata et al 2017 meza figueroa et al 2018 given the particle size range generated by sanding in the range of 50 nm to a few μm in diameter koponen et al 2009 however the potential range of airborne transport of paint particles is considerable for example microplastics of dimensions orders of magnitude greater albeit less dense and usually fibrous appear to have the propensity to be transported thousands of km with regional air masses bergmann et al 2019 brahney et al 2020 while geosolids towards the upper size limit generated by sanding may be transported globally mahowald et al 2014 paint particles are also generated while ships are at sea for example groundings and collisions are known to generate large quantities of antifouling paint around the location of impaction negri et al 2002 jones 2007 van der schyff et al 2020 while vessels navigating through ice or fishing activities generating friction between painted surfaces and rope may also act as more diffuse sources negri and marshall 2009 song et al 2014 it is also likely that paint particles are generated more passively with the general wear and tear erosion of hull waterline topside and deck coatings dibke et al 2021 4 inputs of paint particles to the marine environment estimating the quantities of paint particles entering the marine environment or their contribution to the total marine microplastic pool is fraught with difficulties and uncertainties one of the fundamental considerations in this respect is whether the mass of dried paint should be converted to the mass of polymer by subtracting the weights of additives and fillers present before direct quantitative comparisons are made with microplastics while this approach is often favoured for flux calculations and inventories additives and fillers are integral components of both paints and microplastics that from physical environmental and toxicological perspectives should not be ignored input estimates are generally based on the quantities of paints manufactured for or sold in different sectors and quantitative assumptions about longevity removal disposal and retention by waste facilities and are usually compared with estimates for other types of microplastic based on equivalent assumptions sundt et al 2014 lassen et al 2015 verschoor et al 2016 in a recent example hann et al 2018 estimated emissions of different types of microplastics to the european aquatic environment using data information and assumptions on paints published in earlier oecd reports oecd 2005 oecd 2009 and supplied by the european council of the paint printing ink and artist s colours industry cepe neglecting inputs from poor waste management or the degradation of larger plastic waste lower middle and upper estimates for each microplastic category considered were derived table 1 for building marine and road marking paints estimates were based on figures for consumption coupled with assumptions on rates of removal during maintenance wear and tear and polymer degradation and rates of retention entrapment or loss by water treatment facilities road side sedimentation devices road cleaning adjacent soils and asphalt surfaces not factored into the estimates for paint were emissions to water when uncured disturbance of layers of paint below the top coat for example primers and base coats weathering of marine paints while in service or at the end of life and the direct input of airborne dusts within these assumptions and constraints estimates for paint particle emissions to surface waters range from about 12 000 to 30 000 tonnes or between about 10 and 17 of total microplastic inputs presumably inputs to the marine environment are related to these estimates but with modification of building and road paint inputs by settlement and entrapment in rivers given the many sources of marine paint particles neglected in the calculations above it is likely that the emission figures for each paint category in table 1 have been underestimated in their calculations for example mcadams and angelskår 2020 considered all paint applied to industrial and marine steel assets not just marine paints and about 42 billion litres per annum and assumed a 20 year coating lifetime or a 5 loss per year and 50 efficiency of waste retrieval a resulting 2 3 million tonnes of paint particles was predicted to enter the oceans annually representing a highly significant fraction of the estimated 8 million tonnes of total plastic entering the marine environment each year jambeck et al 2015 the calculated relative contribution of paint to the latter estimate is still subject to many uncertainties but is more consistent with measurements of the relative abundance of micro debris constituents that include paint obtained by surface trawls in the ocean and as reported below 5 presence and abundance of paint particles in the marine environment the presence of protective and antifouling paint particles in sediment deposits in the vicinity of boatyards marinas harbours and abandoned boats has been well documented from visual or microscopic inspection of sieved samples thomas et al 2003 turner 2010 takahashi et al 2012 eklund et al 2014 rees et al 2014 costa et al 2016 lagerström et al 2016 soroldoni et al 2018 abreu et al 2020 based on sediment contamination by cu singh and turner 2009 estimated antifouling paint particle abundance of up to 1 on a mass basis in a tidal inlet of southwest england while direct counting of antifouling paint particles in sediments from a brazilian lagoon by soroldoni et al 2018 revealed mass contamination of up to 4 4 in contrast very little quantitative information exists on paint particles in intertidal and benthic marine sediments more remote from significant point sources thus in the coastal environment díez minguito et al 2020 refer to paint sheets in sediments from the ría de vigo northwest spain at water depths of up to 40 m while haave et al 2019 report paint particles in a norwegian fjord at depths of up to 330 m along the strandline of a sandy beach in eastern england latuta 2019 report that almost one half of microplastics retrieved by density separation were paint based in the open ocean fischer et al 2015 mention paint chips being present in sediments from the northwest pacific kuril kamchatka trench and its adjacent abyssal plain at depths of around 5 km unfortunately however none of these studies provide clear quantitative information on the paint particles observed nor characteristics that could determine their origin a greater body of more quantitative data exist for paint particles captured by plankton trawls at or near the sea surface in some cases visible or chemical characterisation of particles has revealed that the protective or antifouling paints of the research vessel or trawl frame was a significant and sometimes dominant source created by shedding from the hull or collisions between the vessel and sampling equipment rummel et al 2016 bagaev et al 2017 eriksen et al 2018 lacerda et al 2019 suaria et al 2020 however in other cases trawls deployed from unpainted vessels or paint sample characteristics sufficiently different to those of formulations applied to the research vessel or trawl frame have allowed external sources to be inferred lima et al 2014 found that paint particles contributed nearly 30 of all microplastics and up to about 0 1 particle m 3 in 300 μm nets trawled in the goiana estuary brazil the greatest concentrations were encountered in the bottom waters and during the rainy season coincident with the period of most intensive fishing activities kang et al 2015a found alkyd based paint particles contributed 20 to 50 of suspended microplastics in the mouth of nakdong river korea with abundances of up to about 1 m 3 captured by a 330 μm manta trawl but up to 230 m 3 captured by a finer 50 μm hand net dibke et al 2012 recently estimated that up to 80 of the microplastics sampled from surface waters of the german bight north sea using an on board deck wash system were ship paints based on epoxy acryl and chlorinated rubber binders the remaining material was dominated by polyethylene polypropylene and pet derived from packaging and mismanaged waste paint particles have also been reported amongst microplastic debris retrieved from plankton trawls in the north atlantic morét ferguson et al 2010 black sea öztekin and bat 2017 tropical and equatorial western atlantic ocean ivar do sul et al 2014 garcia et al 2020 adriatic sea suaria et al 2016 and gulf of oman aliabad et al 2019 and over the great barrier reef hall et al 2015 jensen et al 2019 in the coastal zone of korea song et al 2014 observed paint particles in the sea surface microlayer or the boundary layer between the atmosphere and ocean sampled to a depth of 400 μm using a metal sieve the mean particle abundance was found to be about 200 l 1 or 150 m 2 compared with an abundance of other microplastics of 16 l 1 or 13 m 2 significantly there was a distinct increase in paint particle number with decreasing size 1000 μm to 50 μm which was attributed to the gradual breakdown of the floating stock of paint particles into smaller pieces quantitatively and qualitatively the observations and measurements above are subject to various limitations and uncertainties specifically in sediment where harsh chemical treatment e g peroxidation or acidification and flotation are employed to isolate microplastics the abundance of paint particles is predicted to be under reported because of their greater density and lower chemical stability see below in seawater paint particle concentrations are likely underestimated because of the inherent size limits of the capturing devices or detection methods and the propensity for paint particles to fragment to sizes below these limits during sample processing nevertheless it is clear that paint particles are a significant if not the dominant form of microplastic at or near the water column surface and within intertidal and benthic sediments in many marine settings accordingly it would appear that the sources processes and assumptions involved in estimates of paint inputs into the aquatic environment and as exemplified in table 1 require re evaluation 6 environmental behaviour transport and exposure of paint particles one of the key physical factors that determines the transport behaviour and fate of plastics in natural waters or engineered systems for example water treatment facilities is density de la fuente et al 2021 this property also forms the basis by which microplastics are extracted through flotation from environmental samples like soils and sediments miller et al 2017 density ranges for common plastics and paints are compared in fig 4 for plastics the lowest values represent the pure polymer while maximum values denote formulations loaded with the highest concentrations of mineral or glass fibre filler plasticiser or flame retardant according to the omnexus material selection platform specialchem 2021 for dried paints the overall density range and noted formulations are based on information in the scientific and commercial literature also annotated on fig 4 are the density range of seawater and the density range of solutions of zncl2 that are commonly used to extract microplastics from environmental samples rodrigues et al 2020 low density plastics like polyethylene are predicted to float in seawater while high density plastics like pet and pvc are predicted to sink plastics of intermediate density or with a relatively low density but broad range like polypropylene and polystyrene are expected to exhibit negative or positive buoyancy depending on the content and nature of additives and fillers the precise density of ambient seawater and any biofouling present for paints however all formulations are ultimately predicted to sink in the marine environment based on density considerations because of the greater abundance of inorganic additives and fillers in the dried formulations this means that in theory paint particles of equivalent dimensions and shapes to microplastics are more readily deposited and less mobile in aquatic systems regarding extraction by flotation in zncl2 solution the majority of microplastics should be isolated when a relatively high concentration of the salt is employed but many types of paint particles including those with clear marine origins would evade capture by this approach haave et al 2019 that is conventional extraction methods are predicted to underestimate the stock of micro sized synthetic polymeric particulates empirical studies on the settling characteristics of antifouling paints in artificial estuarine water salinity 15 have shown that above a diameter of 1 mm settling is related to density and size but below 180 μm most particles remain at the surface without agitation and settle only after the surface tension had been broken with stirring soroldini et al 2018 accordingly the authors suggested that the size range of paint particles generated in local harbours and boatyards could be transported several tens of km from their point of origin in a lagoonal estuary within 24 h depending on local hydrodynamic and meteorological conditions more generally surface tension augmented in natural seawater by biogenic material song et al 2014 and broken only by energy equivalent to wind speeds 6 6 m s 1 wurl et al 2011 coupled with long range airborne transport may account for the ready detection of paint particles at or near the sea surface in locations remote from any immediate point sources and as discussed earlier with paint particles encountered at the sea surface and in the pelagic and benthic zones it is not surprising that they have been detected amongst other micro debris in the digestive tracts and sometimes gills of various marine animals including birds fish crustaceans cetaceans turtles and invertebrates and as summarised in table 2 in many cases paint particles are noted without detailed or systematic quantification or characterisation and critical information on abundance sources selectivity impacts and fate is lacking where paint particles have been counted and classified in fish guts however the contribution of this material to the mp cohort on a number basis may be as high as 35 cardoza et al 2018 with blue often noted as the dominant colour herrera et al 2019 paint particles may be ingested passively while suspended in the water or attached to dietary material like algae russell et al 2011 or mistaken for items of food like zooplankton because of similarities in colour size and texture kang et al 2015b in controlled laboratory experiments involving a range of suspension and deposit feeding invertebrates ground antifouling paint particle composites appear to be ingested without any avoidance mechanisms evident turner et al 2008 turner et al 2009 muller karanssos et al 2019 likewise studies in the avian literature suggest that paint particles may be incidentally or even deliberately ingested by seabirds and waterfowl while foraging for food molnar 1983 sileo and fefer 1987 turner 2010 7 paint particle toxicity and impacts on biota from a general ecological and health perspective exposure to paint particles is likely to exert similar impacts on marine organisms as exposure to microplastics of equivalent dimensions yin et al 2018 bringer et al 2020 maes et al 2020 a greater concern regarding contemporary and historical paint particles however is the presence and availability of additives that are hazardous while asbestos cadmium compounds and certain phthalate esters and brominated flame retardants have been employed in speciality paints of more general concern are lead based compounds that were common in historical paints with wide ranging applications including road markings buildings and shipping and biocidal additives that are fundamental to marine antifouling formulations a variety of lead compounds were used as drying catalysts lead acetate octoate and naphthenate pigments for colour opacity and protection e g lead carbonates sulphates oxides chromates and on metal corrosion inhibitors e g lead tetroxide calcium plumbate restrictions have eliminated the intentional use of lead in paints in many sectors but legacy coatings remain an important source of the metal to the environment mielke et al 2008 turner and lewis 2018 copper i based compounds have played a critical role in antifouling paints for many decades with other metal based biocides based on compounds of tributyl tin lead arsenic and mercury phased out but still encountered on the hulls of older boats and abandoned vessels eklund and eklund 2014 rees et al 2014 various organic and organo metallic booster compounds with herbicidal properties have often been added at smaller concentrations to antifouling paints with many undergoing restrictions but encountered in historical boat coatings parks et al 2010 while lead compounds and certain biocides have also been added to plastics both their concentrations and mobilities are significantly greater in paint particles for example the maximum lead content of beached microplastics mainly polyolefins retrieved from south west england was about 5000 mg kg 1 massos and turner 2017 with pvc fragments having concentrations in the range 10 000 to 20 000 mg kg 1 turner and solman 2016 in contrast the lead content of paint fragments derived from the hulls of abandoned boats can regularly exceed 20 by weight rees et al 2014 or an order of magnitude higher than the maximum concentration reported for pvc regarding biocides the typical content in protected plastics is 1 000 mg kg 1 dylingowski and 2004 this contrasts with cu i concentrations in the dry films of contemporary and historical antifouling formulations of up to 50 by weight muller karanassos et al 2019 a specific chemical comparison between a fragment of polyethylene pigmented with pbcro4 that had been retrieved from the strandline of a beach and a copper based antifouling paint fragment taken from an abandoned boat is shown in fig 5 here x ray fluorescent spectra acquired under the same operating conditions are illustrated over the energy range 0 to 14 kev with selected principal secondary x ray peaks identified annotated in the boxes and where quantification was possible by fundamental parameters are concentrations of elements detected in each sample in mg kg 1 clearly the number and magnitude of peaks and overall elemental concentrations are greater in the antifouling fragment but the percentage balance also annotated consisting of light elements not detected by the instrument z 11 and indicative of the polymer concentration is considerably lower more generally these observations are also consistent with the greater abundance of additives and lower polymer content of paints relative to plastics discussed earlier the greater mobility of hazardous chemicals in paint particles relative to plastics is evident from differences in the quantities of toxic metal ions e g cu cu2 tbt pb2 cro4 2 released from each particle type into physiological solutions that simulate the mammalian or avian stomach turner and radford 2010 smith and turner 2020 and from the more stringent guidelines and regulations that deal with toxic metals in paint gooch 1993 factors that account for a greater mobility of metals in paint than in plastic include a higher additive to polymer binder ratio in the dried formulation the brittleness of weathered paint and its propensity to readily fragment into smaller particles of high surface area and the more ready aging and degradation of the paint binder than the plastic polymer more specifically in hard ablative and self polishing antifouling paints biocides are designed to leach out or the entire formulations dissolve at controlled rates into the surrounding medium the greater solubility of hazardous additives in paint than in plastic also results in a higher toxicity thus in the aquatic environment while chemicals leaching from microplastics including pb have been shown to be toxic to bacteria invertebrates and fish silva et al 2016 boyle et al 2020 sarkur et al 2020 the quantities of plastic relative to water volume used to generate leachates are well in excess of levels encountered in the environment by contrast poisoning of birds through the ingestion of leaded paint particles has been documented in situ molnar 1983 finkelstein et al 2003 and concentrations of antifouling paint representative of those encountered in contaminated harbour sediments have been shown to elicit toxic responses in epibenthic copepods crustaceans and macroinvertebrates in controlled laboratory exposures for example muller karanassos et al 2021 report 5 day lethal and effects concentrations lc50 and ec50 respectively for size fractionated particles 100 μm to 1 mm derived from a modern cu based antifouling paint of 19 9 and 14 6 g per l of estuarine sediment respectively for the ragworm hediste diversicolor and 2 3 g l 1 and 1 4 g l 1 respectively for the common cockle cerrastoderma edule soroldoni et al 2017 report a significant decrease in fecundity for epibenthic copepods exposed to 0 01 of modern cu based antifouling paint particles 63 μm in estuarine sediment and an lc50 arising from the elutriate of a preparation equivalent to 0 14 of paint soroldoni et al 2020 subsequently demonstrated 10 day lc50 values for benthic microcrustaceans exposed to estuarine sediment spiked with fractionated antifouling paint particles of 0 16 to 0 45 by mass of sediment the biocidal properties of antifouling formulations also impact on colonisation by marine bacteria thus while microplastics are rapidly colonised by microbial communities that do not differ greatly from communities on other inert surfaces like glass rock or wood wright et al 2020 antifouling surfaces provide a habitat to select particular but sometimes diverse bacterial populations that are resistant to the active biocides chen et al 2013 flach et al 2017 tagg et al 2019 analysed and compared biofilm communities on microplastics and paint particles retrieved from sediment grabs in the coastal baltic alkyd and epoxy based paints that likely included antifouling fragments although this was not explicitly stated were found to support communities that were distinct from and more consistent than biofilms on polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride microplastics and on natural particles significantly an abundance of taxa from the desulfobacteraceae family on some paint particles suggests that their presence in sediment may have impacts on the sulphur metabolism cycle 8 concluding remarks the sources pathways behaviour and receptors of marine paint particles described above are summarised in fig 6 also shown are the ions of greatest ecotoxicological concern that are by design or otherwise mobilised from paint additives into seawater given that both the abundance and mobility of harmful additives are greater in most paint particles compared with microplastics of equivalent dimensions it is concerning that the former are often overlooked or deliberately excluded from the micro debris pool in environmental samples baini et al 2018 ferreira et al 2019 this omission means that quantitative comparisons of plastic to paint abundance in seawater sediments and digestive tracts are often lacking it is also likely that the significance of the paint pool is understated from surface or near surface water sampling because the most mobile paint particles evade capture by the mesh size of common trawling nets 100 to a few hundred μm while larger particles have a greater propensity to sink in sediment paint particle abundance is also underestimated because the densities of conventional solutions used to isolate micro debris are lower than the densities of many common paint formulations and treatments typically used to isolate microplastics may be physically or chemically destructive to paints clearly a greater awareness of the potential environmental and health impacts of paints particles and development of methods for their recovery and isolation are required amongst the microplastic community and general measures to reduce the inputs of paints to the aquatic environment by manufacturers and users are called for regarding the latter potential solutions include reducing the volume of materials that require painting improving the wear resistance and enhancing end of life degradation of formulations increasing the use and efficacy of dust extraction systems during maintenance and repair improving waste collection systems in boatyards and incentivising the safe and sustainable disposal or recycling of boats turner 2010 rees et al 2014 verschoor et al 2016 declaration of competing interest the

19948,the knowledge about the members of active archaea communities in dwds is limited the current understanding is based on high throughput 16s ribosomal rna gene dna based amplicon sequencing that reveals the diversity of active dormant and dead members of the prokaryote bacteria archaea communities the sequencing primers optimized for bacteria community analysis may underestimate the share of the archaea community this study characterized archaea communities at five full scale drinking water distribution systems dwds representing a variety of drinking water production units a e a b use artificially recharged non disinfected groundwater arg the other dwds s supplied water disinfected by using ultraviolet uv light and chlorine compounds c d were surface waterworks and e was a ground

an rna based approach in addition to the previously used 16s rrna gene target rdna a dna based approach to reveal the active fraction of the archaea present in dwds the archaea community structure in varying environmental conditions in the water and biofilm of the five dwdss were investigated by taking into consideration the system properties cold or hot water system and water age distance from

where the dna based and rna based analysis created separate clusters in a weighted beta diversity analysis the season and location in dwds a further affected the diversity of these archaea communities

dwdss a b when utilizing rna based template the metabolically active archaea community of dwdss thus seemed to be effectively controlled by disinfection of water and in the hot water systems by the temperature all biofilms regardless of dwds showed lower species richness values mainly nitrososphaeria class than non disinfected water from dwdss a b where several archaea classes occurred e g woesearchaeia nitrososphaeria micrarchaeia methanomicrobia iairchaeia bathyarchaeia indicating only part of the archaea members were able to survive in biofilms thus archaea has been shown as a significant part of normal dwds biota and their role especially in non disinfected dwds may be more important than previously considered keywords archaea diversity drinking water distribution system chlorination high throughput sequencing 16s rrna gene 16s rrna gene transcript 1 introduction drinking water distribution systems dwds have diverse biotic communities from wide taxonomic ranges such as archaea bacteria eukaryotes and viruses wielen et al 2009 prest et al 2016 inkinen et al 2016 2019 although archaea are an important domain of microbes most of these communities have uncultured nature and thus they are not fully understood in the discussion of dwds microbiomes prest et al 2016 steen et al 2019 therefore research reports related to archaea in dwds are rare wielen et al 2009 roeselers et al 2015 bautista de los santos et al 2016 bradley et al 2020 in drinking water treatment plants ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa have shown high abundance and are responsible for the nitrification activities in the water treatment filtration processes wielen et al 2009 kasuga et al 2010 ammonium can be present in dwds of ground waterworks and at surface waterworks too when chloramination is used for disinfection and thus in these systems the proportion of aoa communities could be high wielen et al 2009 waak et al 2019 bradley et al 2020 until recently it was thought that only a few types of bacteria in the genera nitrosomonas nitrosospira and nitrosococcus have a key role in ammonia oxidation however koenneke et al 2005 discovered the important role of archaea in ammonia oxidation since their discovery aoa has often been found to outnumber the ammonia oxidizing bacteria in many habitats the occurrence of archaea and their metabolic functions in the earth s natural habitats e g aquatic environments soils and man made systems e g wastewater treatment plants have been reported wielen et al 2009 auguet et al 2010 gonzalez martinez et al 2018 archaea can survive in nutrient poor oligotrophic settings such as subsurface environments in a viable state with an extremely low metabolic rate hoehler and jørgensen 2013 archaea have even been suggested to be crucial in the development of microbial co occurrences and to play a vital role in maintaining microbial ecosystems in the soil environment shi et al 2019 the microbial growth in dwds occurs within the biofilms at the inner surfaces of the pipelines and may change the physical chemical and biological characteristics of drinking water lie et al 2016 therefore two approaches disinfection such as chlorination uv and intensive removal of nutrients biologically available organic carbon and phosphorus are commonly practiced for keeping dwdss biologically stable ikonen et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 bautista de los santos et al 2019 dai et al 2020 further the availability of micro nutrients such as iron manganese and zinc in dwds increases the autotrophic communities liu et al 2016 the grow die cycle of biofilm communities in the dwds might increase the availability of nutrients for further biological growth fish et al 2015 lie et al 2016 in ecological microbiome studies including the drinking water environment the major focus has been to study the bacteria domain for bacteria widely utilized universal primer pairs detect also archaea but their archaea coverage might be poor

members inkinen et al 2016 2019 by using high throughput techniques an rna based template has recently been used to study archaea communities in the bovine rumen kang et al 2013 and anaerobic digestion vrieze et al 2018 in one earlier study an rna based template was also used as a target for archaea in a fluorescent oligonucleotide probe manz et al 1993 this study comprehensively investigated archaea communities existing in full scale dwdss by using an archaea specific primer pair for high throughput sequencing utilizing dna and rna based templates the study was extended to assess the impact of dwds properties with a strong focus on evaluating both the overall and active dormant archaea communities to capture the archaea diversity varying environmental conditions were

described earlier inkinen et al 2019 and included ca 1 10 ng of nucleic acids illumina libraries were constructed using a ca 100 ng purified amplicon pool and gel electrophoresis was used for pooling and size selection at lgc genomics gmbh berlin germany 2 3 next generation sequencing and bioinformatics sequencing was performed on an illumina miseq platform that produced 300 base pair bp paired end reads illumina inc san diego ca us the data were denoised by using the dada2 protocol software version 1 8 to produce amplicon sequence variants asvs callahan et al 2016 since the overlap was just 25 reads with the archaea primers used a340f 915r the initial pre processing of reads for low quality removal reduced the whole overlap region in the upstream analysis however the information from both the r1 and r2 reads together is more informative for taxonomy identification with higher accuracy the r1 and r2 reads were stitched with ambiguous n as done in an earlier study jeraldo et al 2014 before stitching all reads were checked for missing overlap regions the code for stitching read 1 file1 r1 preprocessed cleaned fastq and read 2 file1 r2 preprocessed cleaned fastq was as follows paste file r1 preprocessed cleaned fastq d file r2 preprocessed cleaned fastq sed s nnnnnnnnnn g stitched reads file1 r1 r2 fastq during the insertion of ambiguous n the r1 and r2 processed reads were joined as a single read r1 n r2 by mapping and aligning to the full length 16s region before proceeding further in the analysis pipeline the sequence table was constructed and chimeras were removed using a per sample method callahan et al 2016 the final asv table was constructed and the taxonomy was assigned using the silva database version 128 release quast et al 2013 ylimaz et al 2014 then the downstream processing of the asv table was performed using the qiime software package version 1 9 1 caporaso et al 2010 and visualized in the microbiomeanalyst software package dhariwal et al 2017 chong et al 2020 2 4 data analyses and statistics the initial alpha rarefaction limit 402 total sequences for the entire data including all three domains archaea bacteria eukaryota was determined based on sample versus negative controls present in the same beta diversity plots produced in the qiime software and visualized in the emperor software vázquez baeza et al 2013 according to the total read counts a new asv table containing only archaea rarefraction 375 was filtered from the entire table archaea bacteria eukaryota for further analysis in microbiomeanalyst samples that produced less than 375 archaea reads were excluded from the analysis afterward based on beta diversities alpha diversity values and taxa profile comparisons during analysing each subsample type in microbiomeanalyst the data was rarefied into the lowest number of reads of the particular subsample type for avoiding the biased of the high variation of read numbers dhariwal et al 2017 chong et al 2020 the rarefraction limit for each subsample type is described in each table and figure only sample sets e g dwds sample type location dna rna that produced on average enough archaea reads archaea reads 30 relative abundance for analysis were chosen to produce representative archaea community characterization results for the given environment alpha diversity values were calculated from the asv table

whitney tests in ibm spss version 27 beta diversity values weighted bray curtis and unweighted binary jaccard distance matrices were calculated from the asv table and differences between the samples were displayed using an analysis of similarity anosim for non metric multidimensional scaling nmds plots unweighted beta diversity jaccard was reported if the visual analysis showed different main

clustering analysis as well as the alpha and beta diversities of the entire archaea data were calculated and visualized using the microbiomeanalyst software the majority of the statistical analyses were performed on the water data from dwdss a b as these contained enough reads to capture the characteristics of the archaea community only the rna of the hot water samples failed to yield enough

the studied dwdss cluster iv fig 1 a the alpha diversities species richness according to the chao1 index and species richness and evenness according to shannon diversity estimate indicated higher archaea diversity in the water from dwdss a b compared to the water from dwds d and the water meter biofilms fig 1b c a heatmap clustering analysis revealed that non disinfected water from dwdss a b contained the highest abundance of archaea reads from the classes micrarchaeia methanomicrobia and nanohaloarchaeia in the rna based library cluster i and classes woesearchaeia and group 11c in the dna based library cluster ii fig 2 a relative abundance table per sample further revealed that most of the archaeal classes in this study were present in the dwdss a b water samples clusters i ii in contrast to the dwds d water samples cluster iii and biofilms cluster iv that consisted of only two or three archaeal classes supplementary file 2 table s2 at the genera level only canditatus nitrosoarchaeum candidatus methanoperedens and candidatus nitrosotalea were abundant in both water sample rna based libraries average 10 14 cluster 1 and dna based libraries average 2 8 cluster ii

disinfected water 3 3 1 the effect of the season the beta diversity of cold water from dwdss a b n 84 indicated separate rna based and dna based clusters r 0 54 p 0 001 anosim followed by a minor effect of the season r 0 18 p 0 001 anosim fig 3 a the species richness chao1 of the total archaea community n 47 dna based was significantly affected by the season p 0 01 kruskal wallis fig 3b the same phenomenon was seen in the active community n 37 rna based but was not statistically significant fig 3c in both the total and active communities the number of estimated species reached the lowest values in winter and grouped apart from samples from other seasons fig 3a c moreover the average relative abundance of the archaeal class woesearchaeia seemed higher in winter compared to other seasons while the occurrence of a few other classes methanomicrobia nitrosphaeria bathyarchaeia seemed less abundant in winter in both the dna based and rna based samples fig 3d e moreover the relative abundance of the taxa profiles suggested the nitrososphaeria class was particularly active in the autumn spring and summer seasons and methanomicrobia to be active in all seasons based on their higher abundance of rna based compared to dna based fig 3d e 3 3 2 the effect of the location the effect of the distance from the waterworks i e the sampling location reflecting the water age was notable in dwds a for both the active n 17 fig 4 supplementary file 3 fig s1 and total n 23 supplementary file 3 fig s2 s4 archaea communities differences in the rna based sequence libraries according to the sampling location for dwds a are visible in the weighted beta diversity plot r 0 64 p 0 001 anosim fig 4a the location also affected the alpha diversities and the lowest alpha diversity values were noted in location 3 according to the chao1 richness index fig 4b and shannon evenness index supplementary file 3 fig s1 although these were not statistically significant p 0 06 0

additionally the alpha diversity values were significantly different between the locations p 0 05 kruskal wallis supplementary file 3 fig s2 s3 however the taxa abundance profiles of the dna based sequences appeared similar via visual inspection between the locations supplementary file 3 fig s4 instead the rna based sequence libraries seemed to display some minor changes in the relative abundances of a few archaeal classes between the locations fig 4c the relative abundance of methanomicrobia and nitrososphaeria increased whereas the relative abundance of bathyarchaeia and micrarchaea decreased in location three compared to the first location the same effect was not evident in dwds b as beta diversity rna based n 20 dna based n 24 and alpha diversities were not different between the locations p 0 05 supplementary file 4 fig s5 s6 3 3 3 archaea communities between cold and hot water systems the groups of cold and hot water samples from the sampling location 2 in dwdss a b dna based n 29 created distinct clusters in a weighted beta diversity bray curtis analysis r 0 37 p 0 001 anosim in which also the winter samples three cold water and one hot water created separate clusters regardless of the water system supplementary file 5 fig s7 the archaea community characteristics in the cold and hot water systems within comparable time points spring summer and autumn seasons are presented in table 3 the alpha diversities measured as chao1 and shannon indexes were similar for the groups p 0 05 table 3 the archaeal class abundance profiles were similar for the cold and hot water samples except for a few classes that seemed slightly more abundant in hot water bathyarchaea or cold water methanomicrobia table 3 4 discussion 4 1 active or dormant rna based archaea communities exist in dwdss and display different characteristics to the total dna based archaea community to our knowledge our work is the first to combine both approaches using cdna derived from ribosomal rna to describe the active or dormant fraction of an archaea community and using the rrna gene dna to describe the total community in order to obtain the most realistic picture of the archaea community inhabiting full scale dwdss despite the successful recovery in the archaea with the dna based method with 85 100 reads of the total reads in the dwdss a b samples on average the same recovery rate was not achieved by using the rna based method in this study the maximum bacteria recovery sequence reads identified as bacteria with rna based method in dwdss a b was 57 of cold water and biofilm samples due to successful archaea recovery table 2 this deviated from bacteria recovery in all samples from dwdss c e as well as in the hot water samples from dwdss a b which was on average 95 interestingly in those samples containing enough rna based sequence reads for comparison the dna based and rna based archaea communities were crucially different as shown by the separate clusters in the beta diversity analysis as earlier reported in the aerobic digestion process vrieze et al 2018 the lower archaea recovery with the rna based method could be due to the lower abundance of active or dormant archaea compared to the corresponding bacteria due to an average higher growth rate of bacteria than archaea vrieze et al 2018 the phenomenon may be dependent on the environmental conditions for example higher optimum temperature and lower ph in the soil for nitrification potential is usually preferred for ammonia oxidizing archaea than for ammonia oxidizing bacteria gubry rangin et al 2010 zeng et al 2011 mukhtar et al 2019 regardless of the methodology archaea are considered to be less abundant than bacteria in drinking water distribution systems and related habitats such as bottled groundwater with archaea being detected at very low levels manz et al 1993 frança et al 2015 bautista de los santos et al 2016 in one earlier dwds study specific probes were used to target rrna but archaea were not detected above the estimated detection limit of 103 to 104 ribosomes per cell manz et al 1993 the low abundance of rna of some species might play a greater role in metabolism than previously thought and has been reported for novel methanogen species in the rumen kang et al 2013 4 2 archaea communities show more diversity in non disinfected water compared to biofilms or disinfected water of the potential ecological disturbances active or dormant archaea seemed especially sensitive to disinfection based on the lack of archaea reads for analysis recovered from any of the samples collected from the disinfected systems dwdss c e to support this in an extensive meta study utilizing dna archaea sequences were detected in less than 20 in chlorinated systems and almost 90 in disinfectant residual free systems bautista de los santos et al 2016 in the present study water samples taken from non disinfected dwdss a b were more diverse with higher species richness than the biofilms or disinfected dwds d water and were grouped apart from them according to their beta diversity lower diversity in biofilms to water suggests that only part of the archaea members present in water were able to attach in biofilms and survive there a finding similar to our earlier observations when dwds bacteria were studied inkinen et al 2016 earlier observations by others report a generally lower abundance of microbial communities in disinfected water systems and sensitivity of some important archaea to chlorination such as ammonia oxidizing archaea in water treatment processes and dwdss kasuga et al 2010 bautista de los santos et al 2016 dai et al 2020 archaea similarly to other microorganisms may be protectively sheltered in biofilms against chlorination schwering et al 2013 fish and boxall 2018 biofilms showed different characteristics to water with a lower asv richness and a high abundance of only a few taxa mainly nitrosophaeria previous research has similarly reported archaea as part of the biofilm community in dwdss with low archaea diversity which may involve different interactions with the environment than more diverse bacteria fish et al 2015 overall archaeal phyla euryarchaeota nanoarchaeaeota diapherotrites thaumarchaeota and crenarchaeota have been found in both dna based and rna based templates and these have been also detected earlier in dwdss or drinking water related environments frança et al 2015 roeselers et al 2015 bautista de los santos et al 2016 dai et al 2020 similar to the abovementioned studies we could not reach beyond the phylum or class level only 3 of the asvs were identified at the genus level supplementary file 1 which suggests that typical archaea in dwdss are not fully covered in the current silva reference database 4 3 water temperature season and location in dwds affect archaea communities archaea were not recovered from the rna based library of the hot water samples suggesting the high water temperature on average 53 8 57 7 c in the dwdss a b water samples inkinen et al 2019 effectively controlled the active and dormant fraction of the archaea communities the selective pressure of hot water has been shown in earlier studies to affect also bacterial and eukaryotic communities dai et al 2018 inkinen et al 2019 slightly lower species richness was observed in hot water compared to the archaea in cold water however this difference was not found to be statistically significant our earlier work from the same system found a reduced number of eukaryotic diversity in hot water as compared to the cold water systems inkinen et al 2019 in dna based libraries of the present work the same archaeal classes occurred in cold and hot water with an increased relative abundance of bathyarchaiea suggesting this class may have at some point had a competitive advantage due to the ecological disturbance of the high temperature the season had an impact on the archaea communities with the lowest species richness in the winter season in dwdss a b in both dna based and rna based sequencing read libraries this may be in part due to changes in the water temperature and also absorbance varies between the seasons in the studied dwdss ikonen et al 2017 previous studies have highlighted this phenomenon for total cell counts and bacterial communities in dwdss where the seasonal variation is typical and correlates especially with temperature pinto et al 2014 prest et al 2016 schleich et al 2019 some archaea members e g methanomicrobia were less abundant in the winter than other seasons this class has earlier been reported to flourish in the summer season in littoral sediment in the sea yan et al 2018 moreover changes in raw water quality could also explain the changes in the dwdss because structures of archaea communities in freshwater are known to change along with the seasons of the year li et al 2015 the location within the dwdss might affect the archaea communities too in this study the sampling locations in dwds a created separate clusters in terms of their beta diversity and differences in the asv richness values were observed in an earlier study of the same five dwdss targeting eukaryote communities the effect of location on the species richness was even more pronounced covering all dwdss inkinen et al 2019 in the same system also heterotrophic bacteria plate counts varied between locations in dwdss a and b ikonen et al 2017 moreover earlier studies have reported changes in bacterial community structures between different locations in full scale dwdss and even within a single building pinto et al 2014 inkinen et al 2016 schleich et al 2019 possible reasons for spatial differences could include changes in environmental factors or archaea species regrowth interactions with biofilms or the differences in survival the relative abundance of the class nitrososphaeria the most abundant class in the biofilm samples was increased in rna based sequencing read libraries at dwds a location 3 suggesting the detachment of biofilms in the water wingender and flemming 2004 moreover the archaea that were found solely in the disinfected dwds d water at location 3 the farthest sampling location may have originated from biofilms as the water samples were clustered close to the biofilm in a beta diversity plot and contained mainly the archaeal genus candidatus nitrosoarcheaum nitrososphaeria class which is a genus found especially rich in the biofilms of disinfected systems dwdss d e our study has indicated not only bacteria but also a wide set of archaea can grow in dwds especially in unchlorinated systems the domain archaea and its functions are not well understood yet and more work is required to develop the taxonomic database to enable the assignment of the sequencing reads to the genus level without such information the exact implications of the findings to the water systems management are difficult to make of the identified archaea in our study dwds d distributing water disinfected by using chloramination implicated that the farthest location from the waterworks 19 km s distance was inhabited with aoa this might tentatively affect the efficiency of the post chlorination and or cause disinfection byproducts waak et al 2019 in the future more phenomena could be explained by using a holistic approach studying all members of the microbiome for example in addition to 16s and 18s rrna gene studies also metagenomics and virus communities could be investigated eventually one future aspect could be even to engineer the dwds microbiome in a way that the microbes causing adverse health effects could be suspended neu and hammes 2020 this would require further understanding of the relationships between different domains of lives occurring in the dwds 5 conclusions archaea communities including active or dormant archaea were revealed in the drinking water system at detectable levels in certain environmental conditions especially dwds supplying for non disinfected waters cold non disinfected water from the two separate waterworks from the same city and both using artificial groundwater sources contained an especially diverse archaea community in non disinfected water up to ten archaeal classes were present as opposed to less diverse biofilms and in disinfected water that accounted only for a few highly abundant taxa disinfection seemed to control both total and active archaea occurrence in dwds water and hot water temperature seemed to control the active archaea occurrence in dwds water the season and distance from the waterworks both affected the archaea communities the functional role of archaea in dwds may be more important than

19948,the knowledge about the members of active archaea communities in dwds is limited the current understanding is based on high throughput 16s ribosomal rna gene dna based amplicon sequencing that reveals the diversity of active dormant and dead members of the prokaryote bacteria archaea communities the sequencing primers optimized for bacteria community analysis may underestimate the share of the archaea community this study characterized archaea communities at five full scale drinking water distribution systems dwds representing a variety of drinking water production units a e a b use artificially recharged non disinfected groundwater arg the other dwds s supplied water disinfected by using ultraviolet uv light and chlorine compounds c d were surface waterworks and e was a ground waterworks for the first time for archaea community analyses this study employed the archaea specific high throughput sequencing primers for 16s ribosomal rna rrna as a target reverse transcribed cdna an rna based approach in addition to the previously used 16s rrna gene target rdna a dna based approach to reveal the active fraction of the archaea present in dwds the archaea community structure in varying environmental conditions in the water and biofilm of the five dwdss were investigated by taking into consideration the system properties cold or hot water system and water age distance from the treatment plants in samples from each season of one year the rna based archaea amplicon reads were obtained mostly from cold water samples from dwdss a b distributing water without disinfection where the dna based and rna based analysis created separate clusters in a weighted beta diversity analysis the season and location in dwds a further affected the diversity of these archaea communities as was seen by different clusters in beta diversity plots the recovery of archaea reads was not adequate for analysis in any of the disinfected samples in dwdss c e or non disinfected hot water in dwdss a b when utilizing rna based template the metabolically active archaea community of dwdss thus seemed to be effectively controlled by disinfection of water and in the hot water systems by the temperature all biofilms regardless of dwds showed lower species richness values mainly nitrososphaeria class than non disinfected water from dwdss a b where several archaea classes occurred e g woesearchaeia nitrososphaeria micrarchaeia methanomicrobia iairchaeia bathyarchaeia indicating only part of the archaea members were able to survive in biofilms thus archaea has been shown as a significant part of normal dwds biota and their role especially in non disinfected dwds may be more important than previously considered keywords archaea diversity drinking water distribution system chlorination high throughput sequencing 16s rrna gene 16s rrna gene transcript 1 introduction drinking water distribution systems dwds have diverse biotic communities from wide taxonomic ranges such as archaea bacteria eukaryotes and viruses wielen et al 2009 prest et al 2016 inkinen et al 2016 2019 although archaea are an important domain of microbes most of these communities have uncultured nature and thus they are not fully understood in the discussion of dwds microbiomes prest et al 2016 steen et al 2019 therefore research reports related to archaea in dwds are rare wielen et al 2009 roeselers et al 2015 bautista de los santos et al 2016 bradley et al 2020 in drinking water treatment plants ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa have shown high abundance and are responsible for the nitrification activities in the water treatment filtration processes wielen et al 2009 kasuga et al 2010 ammonium can be present in dwds of ground waterworks and at surface waterworks too when chloramination is used for disinfection and thus in these systems the proportion of aoa communities could be high wielen et al 2009 waak et al 2019 bradley et al 2020 until recently it was thought that only a few types of bacteria in the genera nitrosomonas nitrosospira and nitrosococcus have a key role in ammonia oxidation however koenneke et al 2005 discovered the important role of archaea in ammonia oxidation since their discovery aoa has often been found to outnumber the ammonia oxidizing bacteria in many habitats the occurrence of archaea and their metabolic functions in the earth s natural habitats e g aquatic environments soils and man made systems e g wastewater treatment plants have been reported wielen et al 2009 auguet et al 2010 gonzalez martinez et al 2018 archaea can survive in nutrient poor oligotrophic settings such as subsurface environments in a viable state with an extremely low metabolic rate hoehler and jørgensen 2013 archaea have even been suggested to be crucial in the development of microbial co occurrences and to play a vital role in maintaining microbial ecosystems in the soil environment shi et al 2019 the microbial growth in dwds occurs within the biofilms at the inner surfaces of the pipelines and may change the physical chemical and biological characteristics of drinking water lie et al 2016 therefore two approaches disinfection such as chlorination uv and intensive removal of nutrients biologically available organic carbon and phosphorus are commonly practiced for keeping dwdss biologically stable ikonen et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 bautista de los santos et al 2019 dai et al 2020 further the availability of micro nutrients such as iron manganese and zinc in dwds increases the autotrophic communities liu et al 2016 the grow die cycle of biofilm communities in the dwds might increase the availability of nutrients for further biological growth fish et al 2015 lie et al 2016 in ecological microbiome studies including the drinking water environment the major focus has been to study the bacteria domain for bacteria widely utilized universal primer pairs detect also archaea but their archaea coverage might be poor klindworth et al 2013 roeselers et al 2015 thijs et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 new archaea primers have been designed and utilized for better coverage and specificity stahl and amann 1991 gantner et al 2011 in recent years varying archaea specific primers have been successfully utilized to better describe archaea diversity in varying habitats including dwds biofilms fish et al 2015 wastewater and soil shi et al 2019 the aforementioned microbial community studies have targeted the 16s ribosomal rna genes dna based method and thus detect active dormant and dead community members in previous studies of bacteria and eukaryotes in dwdss ribosomal rna rna based method has been utilized for reverse transcribed rna prior to sequencing as complementary dna cdna to capture active community members inkinen et al 2016 2019 by using high throughput techniques an rna based template has recently been used to study archaea communities in the bovine rumen kang et al 2013 and anaerobic digestion vrieze et al 2018 in one earlier study an rna based template was also used as a target for archaea in a fluorescent oligonucleotide probe manz et al 1993 this study comprehensively investigated archaea communities existing in full scale dwdss by using an archaea specific primer pair for high throughput sequencing utilizing dna and rna based templates the study was extended to assess the impact of dwds properties with a strong focus on evaluating both the overall and active dormant archaea communities to capture the archaea diversity varying environmental conditions were included non disinfected systems and systems with post treatment disinfection uv chlorination or chloramination surface water artificial recharge groundwater or groundwater as source waters for

25 l mean 14 l negative controls n 35 were taken at different sample processing steps as earlier described inkinen et al 2019 positive controls for archaea were not available membranes were kept frozen at 75 c before extraction of nucleic acids 2 2 dna and rna extraction and pcr amplification dna and rna were extracted from the membranes as described earlier inkinen et al 2019 in brief total nucleic acids were extracted to a final elution volume of 100 µl using a chemagic dna plant kit perkin elmer waltham ma usa following the manufacturer s instructions without removing the rna the rna

described earlier inkinen et al 2019 and included ca 1 10 ng of nucleic acids illumina libraries were constructed using a ca 100 ng purified amplicon pool and gel electrophoresis was used for pooling and size selection at lgc genomics gmbh berlin germany 2 3 next generation sequencing and bioinformatics sequencing was performed on an illumina miseq platform that produced 300 base pair bp paired end reads illumina inc san diego ca us the data were denoised by using the dada2 protocol software version 1 8 to produce amplicon sequence variants asvs callahan et al 2016 since the overlap was just 25 reads with the archaea primers used a340f 915r the initial pre processing of reads for low quality removal reduced the whole overlap region in the upstream analysis however the information from both the r1 and r2 reads together is more informative for taxonomy identification with higher accuracy the r1 and r2 reads were stitched with ambiguous n as done in an earlier study jeraldo et al 2014 before stitching all reads were checked for missing overlap regions the code for stitching read 1 file1 r1 preprocessed cleaned fastq and read 2 file1 r2 preprocessed cleaned fastq was as follows paste file r1 preprocessed cleaned fastq d file r2 preprocessed cleaned fastq sed s nnnnnnnnnn g stitched reads file1 r1 r2 fastq during the insertion of ambiguous n the r1 and r2 processed reads were joined as a single read r1 n r2 by mapping and aligning to the full length 16s region before proceeding further in the analysis pipeline the sequence table was constructed and chimeras were removed using a per sample method callahan et al 2016 the final asv table was constructed and the taxonomy was assigned using the silva database version 128 release quast et al 2013 ylimaz et al 2014 then the downstream processing of the asv table was performed using the qiime software package version 1 9 1 caporaso et al 2010 and visualized in the microbiomeanalyst software package dhariwal et al 2017 chong et al 2020 2 4 data analyses and statistics the initial alpha rarefaction limit 402 total sequences for the entire data including all three domains archaea bacteria eukaryota was determined based on sample versus negative controls present in the same beta diversity plots produced in the qiime software and visualized in the emperor software vázquez baeza et al 2013 according to the total read counts a new asv table containing only archaea rarefraction 375 was filtered from the entire table archaea bacteria eukaryota for further analysis in microbiomeanalyst samples that produced less than 375 archaea reads were excluded from the analysis afterward based on beta diversities alpha diversity values and taxa profile comparisons during analysing each subsample type in microbiomeanalyst the data was rarefied into the lowest number of reads of the particular subsample type for avoiding the biased of the high variation of read numbers dhariwal et al 2017 chong et al 2020 the rarefraction limit for each subsample type is described in each table and figure only sample sets e g dwds sample type location dna rna that produced on average enough archaea reads archaea reads 30 relative abundance for analysis were chosen to produce representative archaea community characterization results for the given environment alpha diversity values were calculated from the asv table using standard metrics such as observed asvs chao1 ace simpson and shannon alpha diversity indices were compared between different sample water types with non parametric kruskal wallis and mann whitney tests in ibm spss version 27 beta diversity values weighted bray curtis and unweighted binary jaccard distance matrices were calculated from the asv table and differences between the samples were displayed using an analysis of similarity anosim for non metric multidimensional scaling nmds plots unweighted beta diversity jaccard was reported if the visual analysis showed different main observations compared to the weighted beta diversity bray curtis taxa summaries by relative abundance were calculated for representative taxa class and genus level the absolute abundance of asvs for the entire dataset was visualized as a heatmap hierarchically clustered on a taxon scale archaeal class based on the default euclidean distance and average clustering method the taxa summaries heatmap clustering analysis as well as the alpha and beta diversities of the entire archaea data were calculated and visualized using the microbiomeanalyst software the majority of the statistical analyses were performed on the water data from dwdss a b as these contained enough reads to capture the characteristics of the archaea community only the rna of the hot water samples failed to yield enough archaea reads in dwdss a b three main subsets 1 the entire dataset of 119 archaea samples main drivers i e clusters of the archaea communities 2 cold water from non disinfected dwdss a b consisting of

further analysis of the archaea in the dna based library all samples from waterworks a and b cold water and water meter biofilm samples from waterworks d location 3 as well as biofilm samples from waterworks e were selected for further archaea analyses table 1 in the rna based library only cold water and biofilms from the non disinfected dwdss a and b contained enough archaea reads for analysis table 2 3 2 archaea communities in water and biofilms a total of 119 samples were analysed for their archaea communities and produced 375 reads classified as archaea rarefaction value of archaea sub

in one sample from these 1384 asvs supplementary file 1 table s1 only 36 asvs 2 6 could be identified at the genus level and 138 asvs at the order level 10 most asvs achieved identification only at

the studied dwdss cluster iv fig 1 a the alpha diversities species richness according to the chao1 index and species richness and evenness according to shannon diversity estimate indicated higher archaea diversity in the water from dwdss a b compared to the water from dwds d and the water meter biofilms fig 1b c a heatmap clustering analysis revealed that non disinfected water from dwdss a b contained the highest abundance of archaea reads from the classes micrarchaeia methanomicrobia and nanohaloarchaeia in the rna based library cluster i and classes woesearchaeia and group 11c in the dna based library cluster ii fig 2 a relative abundance table per sample further revealed that most of the archaeal classes in this study were present in the dwdss a b water samples clusters i ii in contrast to the dwds d water samples cluster iii and biofilms cluster iv that consisted of only two or three archaeal classes supplementary file 2 table s2 at the genera level only canditatus nitrosoarchaeum candidatus methanoperedens and candidatus nitrosotalea were abundant in both water sample rna based libraries average 10 14 cluster 1 and dna based libraries average 2 8 cluster ii moreover water from dwds d cluster iii and the biofilms cluster iv contained a notably high abundance of reads from one class nitrososphaeria fig 2 forming on average 84 and 99 relative abundance in these samples respectively supplementary file 2 of this class the genus canditatus nitrosoarchaeum was highly abundant 90 100 in disinfected systems i e dwds d water samples taken in the winter spring

disinfected water 3 3 1 the effect of the season the beta diversity of cold water from dwdss a b n 84 indicated separate rna based and dna based clusters r 0 54 p 0 001 anosim followed by a minor effect of the season r 0 18 p 0 001 anosim fig 3 a the species richness chao1 of the total archaea community n 47 dna based was significantly affected by the season p 0 01 kruskal wallis fig 3b the same phenomenon was seen in the active community n 37 rna based but was not statistically significant fig 3c in both the total and active communities the number of estimated species reached the lowest values in winter and grouped apart from samples from other seasons fig 3a c moreover the average relative abundance of the archaeal class woesearchaeia seemed higher in winter compared to other seasons while the occurrence of a few other classes methanomicrobia nitrosphaeria bathyarchaeia seemed less abundant in winter in both the dna based and rna based samples fig 3d e moreover the relative abundance of the taxa profiles suggested the nitrososphaeria class was particularly active in the autumn spring and summer seasons and methanomicrobia to be active in all seasons based on their higher abundance of rna based compared to dna based fig 3d e 3 3 2 the effect of the location the effect of the distance from the waterworks i e the sampling location reflecting the water age was notable in dwds a for both the active n 17 fig 4 supplementary file 3 fig s1 and total n 23 supplementary file 3 fig s2 s4 archaea communities differences in the rna based sequence libraries according to the sampling location for dwds a are visible in the weighted beta diversity plot r 0 64 p 0 001 anosim fig 4a the location also affected the alpha diversities and the lowest alpha diversity values were noted in location 3 according to the chao1 richness index fig 4b and shannon evenness index supplementary file 3 fig s1 although these were not statistically significant p 0 06 0

additionally the alpha diversity values were significantly different between the locations p 0 05 kruskal wallis supplementary file 3 fig s2 s3 however the taxa abundance profiles of the dna based sequences appeared similar via visual inspection between the locations supplementary file 3 fig s4 instead the rna based sequence libraries seemed to display some minor changes in the relative abundances of a few archaeal classes between the locations fig 4c the relative abundance of methanomicrobia and nitrososphaeria increased whereas the relative abundance of bathyarchaeia and micrarchaea decreased in location three compared to the first location the same effect was not evident in dwds b as beta diversity rna based n 20 dna based n 24 and alpha diversities were not different between the locations p 0 05 supplementary file 4 fig s5 s6 3 3 3 archaea communities between cold and hot water systems the groups of cold and hot water samples from the sampling location 2 in dwdss a b dna based n 29 created distinct clusters in a weighted beta diversity bray curtis analysis r 0 37 p 0 001 anosim in which also the winter samples three cold water and one hot water created separate clusters regardless of the water system supplementary file 5 fig s7 the archaea community characteristics in the cold and hot water systems within comparable time points spring summer and autumn seasons are presented in table 3 the alpha diversities measured as chao1 and shannon indexes were similar for the groups p 0 05 table 3 the archaeal class abundance profiles were similar for the cold and hot water samples except for a few classes that seemed slightly more abundant in hot water bathyarchaea or cold water methanomicrobia table 3 4 discussion 4 1 active or dormant rna based archaea communities exist in dwdss and display different characteristics to the total dna based archaea community to our knowledge our work is the first to combine both approaches using cdna derived from ribosomal rna to describe the active or dormant fraction of an archaea community and using the rrna gene dna to describe the total community in order to obtain the most realistic picture of the archaea community inhabiting full scale dwdss despite the successful recovery in the archaea with the dna based method with 85 100 reads of the total reads in the dwdss a b samples on average the same recovery rate was not achieved by using the rna based method in this study the maximum bacteria recovery sequence reads identified as bacteria with rna based method in dwdss a b was 57 of cold water and biofilm samples due to successful archaea recovery table 2 this deviated from bacteria recovery in all samples from dwdss c e as well as in the hot water samples from dwdss a b which was on average 95 interestingly in those samples containing enough rna based sequence reads for comparison the dna based and rna based archaea communities were crucially different as shown by the separate clusters in the beta diversity analysis as earlier reported in the aerobic digestion process vrieze et al 2018 the lower archaea recovery with the rna based method could be due to the lower abundance of active or dormant archaea compared to the corresponding bacteria due to an average higher growth rate of bacteria than archaea vrieze et al 2018 the phenomenon may be dependent on the environmental conditions for example higher optimum temperature and lower ph in the soil for nitrification potential is usually preferred for ammonia oxidizing archaea than for ammonia oxidizing bacteria gubry rangin et al 2010 zeng et al 2011 mukhtar et al 2019 regardless of the methodology archaea are considered to be less abundant than bacteria in drinking water distribution systems and related habitats such as bottled groundwater with archaea being detected at very low levels manz et al 1993 frança et al 2015 bautista de los santos et al 2016 in one earlier dwds study specific probes were used to target rrna but archaea were not detected above the estimated detection limit of 103 to 104 ribosomes per cell manz et al 1993 the low abundance of rna of some species might play a greater role in metabolism than previously thought and has been reported for novel methanogen species in the rumen kang et al 2013 4 2 archaea communities show more diversity in non disinfected water compared to biofilms or disinfected water of the potential ecological disturbances active or dormant archaea seemed especially sensitive to disinfection based on the lack of archaea reads for analysis recovered from any of the samples collected from the disinfected systems dwdss c e to support this in an extensive meta study utilizing dna archaea sequences were detected in less than 20 in chlorinated systems and almost 90 in disinfectant residual free systems bautista de los santos et al 2016 in the present study water samples taken from non disinfected dwdss a b were more diverse with higher species richness than the biofilms or disinfected dwds d water and were grouped apart from them according to their beta diversity lower diversity in biofilms to water suggests that only part of the archaea members present in water were able to attach in biofilms and survive there a finding similar to our earlier observations when dwds bacteria were studied inkinen et al 2016 earlier observations by others report a generally lower abundance of microbial communities in disinfected water systems and sensitivity of some important archaea to chlorination such as ammonia oxidizing archaea in water treatment processes and dwdss kasuga et al 2010 bautista de los santos et al 2016 dai et al 2020 archaea similarly to other microorganisms may be protectively sheltered in biofilms against chlorination schwering et al 2013 fish and boxall 2018 biofilms showed different characteristics to water with a lower asv richness and a high abundance of only a few taxa mainly nitrosophaeria previous research has similarly reported archaea as part of the biofilm community in dwdss with low archaea diversity which may involve different interactions with the environment than more diverse bacteria fish et al 2015 overall archaeal phyla euryarchaeota nanoarchaeaeota diapherotrites thaumarchaeota and crenarchaeota have been found in both dna based and rna based templates and these have been also detected earlier in dwdss or drinking water related environments frança et al 2015 roeselers et al 2015 bautista de los santos et al 2016 dai et al 2020 similar to the abovementioned studies we could not reach beyond the phylum or class level only 3 of the asvs were identified at the genus level supplementary file 1 which suggests that typical archaea in dwdss are not fully covered in the current silva reference database 4 3 water temperature season and location in dwds affect archaea communities archaea were not recovered from the rna based library of the hot water samples suggesting the high water temperature on average 53 8 57 7 c in the dwdss a b water samples inkinen et al 2019 effectively controlled the active and dormant fraction of the archaea communities the selective pressure of hot water has been shown in earlier studies to affect also bacterial and eukaryotic communities dai et al 2018 inkinen et al 2019 slightly lower species richness was observed in hot water compared to the archaea in cold water however this difference was not found to be statistically significant our earlier work from the same system found a reduced number of eukaryotic diversity in hot water as compared to the cold water systems inkinen et al 2019 in dna based libraries of the present work the same archaeal classes occurred in cold and hot water with an increased relative abundance of bathyarchaiea suggesting this class may have at some point had a competitive advantage due to the ecological disturbance of the high temperature the season had an impact on the archaea communities with the lowest species richness in the winter season in dwdss a b in both dna based and rna based sequencing read libraries this may be in part due to changes in the water temperature and also absorbance varies between the seasons in the studied dwdss ikonen et al 2017 previous studies have highlighted this phenomenon for total cell counts and bacterial communities in dwdss where the seasonal variation is typical and correlates especially with temperature pinto et al 2014 prest et al 2016 schleich et al 2019 some archaea members e g methanomicrobia were less abundant in the winter than other seasons this class has earlier been reported to flourish in the summer season in littoral sediment in the sea yan et al 2018 moreover changes in raw water quality could also explain the changes in the dwdss because structures of archaea communities in freshwater are known to change along with the seasons of the year li et al 2015 the location within the dwdss might affect the archaea communities too in this study the sampling locations in dwds a created separate clusters in terms of their beta diversity and differences in the asv richness values were observed in an earlier study of the same five dwdss targeting eukaryote communities the effect of location on the species richness was even more pronounced covering all dwdss inkinen et al 2019 in the same system also heterotrophic bacteria plate counts varied between locations in dwdss a and b ikonen et al 2017 moreover earlier studies have reported changes in bacterial community structures between different locations in full scale dwdss and even within a single building pinto et al 2014 inkinen et al 2016 schleich et al 2019 possible reasons for spatial differences could include changes in environmental factors or archaea species regrowth interactions with biofilms or the differences in survival the relative abundance of the class nitrososphaeria the most abundant class in the biofilm samples was increased in rna based sequencing read libraries at dwds a location 3 suggesting the detachment of biofilms in the water wingender and flemming 2004 moreover the archaea that were found solely in the disinfected dwds d water at location 3 the farthest sampling location may have originated from biofilms as the water samples were clustered close to the biofilm in a beta diversity plot and contained mainly the archaeal genus candidatus nitrosoarcheaum nitrososphaeria class which is a genus found especially rich in the biofilms of disinfected systems dwdss d e our study has indicated not only bacteria but also a wide set of archaea can grow in dwds especially in unchlorinated systems the domain archaea and its functions are not well understood yet and more work is required to develop the taxonomic database to enable the assignment of the sequencing reads to the genus level without such information the exact implications of the findings to the water systems management are difficult to make of the identified archaea in our study dwds d distributing water disinfected by using chloramination implicated that the farthest location from the waterworks 19 km s distance was inhabited with aoa this might tentatively affect the efficiency of the post chlorination and or cause disinfection byproducts waak et al 2019 in the future more phenomena could be explained by using a holistic approach studying all members of the microbiome for example in addition to 16s and 18s rrna gene studies also metagenomics and virus communities could be investigated eventually one future aspect could be even to engineer the dwds microbiome in a way that the microbes causing adverse health effects could be suspended neu and hammes 2020 this would require further understanding of the relationships between different domains of lives occurring in the dwds 5 conclusions archaea communities including active or dormant archaea were revealed in the drinking water system at detectable levels in certain environmental conditions especially dwds supplying for non disinfected waters cold non disinfected water from the two separate waterworks from the same city and both using artificial groundwater sources contained an especially diverse archaea community in non disinfected water up to ten archaeal classes were present as opposed to less diverse biofilms and in disinfected water that accounted only for a few highly abundant taxa disinfection seemed to control both total and active archaea occurrence in dwds water and hot water temperature seemed to control the active archaea occurrence in dwds water the season and distance from the waterworks both affected the archaea communities the functional role of archaea in dwds may be more important than

the two counties combined a t test was performed on log transformed concentrations to compare mean differences between coliphage type within each county and on a combined county basis values were

similar to the entire dataset except for the lack of statistical differences between july and february and for november and december data not shown repeat samples do not appear to confound the

no relationship was found between rainfall and either somatic p 0 756 or male specific coliphages p 0 103 in orange county on the other hand a moderate positive relationship was found between somatic coliphages r 0 440 p 0 001 as well as male specific coliphages r 0 562 p 0 001 and monthly rainfall in robeson county discussion coliphage occurrence and comparison to fib studies have often reported on the occurrence of enteroviruses and other viruses in groundwater systems both private and public wells but there are limited studies performed on coliphage detection in private wells including coliphage data for private wells is of particular interest because fecal viral contamination of public health concern may be present in such sources even when a particular human pathogenic virus may not be detected in a given sample the frequency of detection in the present study is considerably higher than in previous research conducted by epa on groundwater wells specifically from the southeast including nc and other regions in the united states epa 2006 researchers reported that somatic coliphages were found in 7 of the wells 2 of 27 wells and male specific coliphages were found in 4 of the wells 1 of 27 wells in the southeastern usa while somatic and male specific coliphages were detected in 57 16 28 and 39 11 28 of wells in the northeast the prevalence reported in the present study was broadly comparable to the prevalence of coliphages detected in wells from the northeastern usa differences between the present study and the 2006 epa study as well as between regions in the epa study may be explained in part by differences in the types depths and or construction characteristics of wells sampled sampling months temperature and or rainfall and proximity to septic systems or other environmental sources of fecal contamination all of the wells in the present study were private wells sampled in the sampling window from july august to february whereas the samples in the epa study included public water groundwater supply and non community transient public water supplies campgrounds but sampling months were not reported male specific somatic or either coliphage was detected in greater proportions than total coliforms or e coli in the present study e coli was found in two cases in orange county only and was detected at very low levels 1 cfu 1000 ml the occurrence of total coliforms in 20 of water samples from private wells in this study is roughly comparable to results reported for coliforms in private well water samples from wake county nc stillo and gibson 2017 as well as studies reporting occurrence of total coliforms in samples from wells in iowa 27 and nebraska 26 gosselin et al 1997 kross et al 1993 most fib do not always have direct relationship with coliphage or pathogenic viruses and do not always predict health risks leclerc et al 2000 noble and fuhrman 2001 payment and locas 2011 however coliphages do appear to have a positive association with viral pathogens vergara et al 2015 given this potential association and the high coliphage prevalence in private wells in this study incorporating a multi indicator approach may be more informative about the microbiological quality of groundwater lucena et al 2006 and using coliphages in addition to or in place of fib is suggested occurrence and concentration of coliphage type in each and combined counties studies have overall reported somatic coliphages in greater proportions than male specific coliphages in surface water nappier et al 2019 but this trend is not always seen in groundwater systems jofre et al 2016 in the present study it is interesting to note the frequencies of male specific coliphages were only about 10 higher than somatic coliphages but male specific concentrations were 0 4 of a log10 higher in robeson and combined counties similarly the pattern of higher levels of male specific to somatic phages emerged on a monthly basis in most cases researchers have found soil characteristics and attachment affinities of phage groups could play a role in their differing occurrence in groundwater jofre et al 2016 skraber et al 2007 others suggest differential susceptibilities of different bacteriophage families to unfavorable environmental factors such as high or low ph high salinity etc jończyk et al 2011 in the present study the concentration range for either coliphage type was greater in robeson than orange county and soil type and land use could play a role in this observation approximately 68 of soils in robeson county are classified as hydric soils with poor drainage characteristics that could promote coliphage persistence in ponded areas surrounding unprotected wellheads after rainfall events with eventual intrusion and infiltration into especially shallow wells agriculture is the dominant land use in robeson county and deposition of coliphages in fecal waste from livestock may contribute to the greater range of coliphages than in orange county assessment of hydrogeological and physicochemical properties that may be influencing differential phage type occurrences and concentrations is warranted the concentrations for male specific coliphages in this study are similar to baselines levels 10 to 30 pfu 100 ml in a study investigating gastrointestinal illness in users of an artificial white water course lee et al 1997 while somatic coliphage concentrations are comparable to levels 0 3 to 1 7 pfu 100 ml found at a marine beach that were associated with gi illness in bathers abdelzaher et al 2011 abdelzaher et al 2010 although these studies are not groundwater related this does provide evidence to further consider future epidemiological studies associated with coliphages in groundwater wells monthly evaluation of coliphage type in each county and relation to rainfall concentrations for phages were generally higher in july aug december january and february than october and november at least for robeson county wells there was a positive relationship for both phage groups and monthly rainfall amounts which suggests precipitation in part as a factor driving coliphage concentrations the pattern was less evident in orange county and could have been because of less variability of rainfall or small sample sizes reducing the effect size studies investigating monthly profiles of coliphages in groundwater are limited but one study from usa groundwater wells found peaks in july and november for a male specific phage abbaszadegan et al 2003 male specific phages were 137 pfu 100 ml in july from a community well water system serviced by a groundwater source and dropped to 7 pfu 100 ml by september atherholt et al 2003 nappier et al 2019 conducted a meta analysis of coliphage occurrence in wastewater and surface water and reported higher coliphage concentrations in the months of december through may than june through november our findings are partially consistent with the findings of nappier et al except for the peak in july aug in robeson county which may have been elevated after a rain event when homeowners provided well depth over half 57 wells were less than 10 6 m or 35 ft and transport of phages during rainfall events could have impacted shallow wells more so than deeper ones sampling coverage of warmer and rainier months such as march april and may will be important to gain a picture of how temperature during wetter season factor into coliphage presence measurement of viral pathogens noble et al 2003 and serotyping of f coliphages to discriminate between human and non human sources of fecal contamination brion et al 2002 cole et al 2003 griffin et al 2000 stewart pullaro et al 2006 to elucidate sources of coliphage is warranted all of the households in the sampling campaign are also serviced by a septic system and it is plausible sewage could have infiltrated into wells during rainfall events going forward use of sophisticated bayesian maximum entropy bme mapping analysis to describe spatial distribution of microbial contamination and land use regression to identify key spatial determinants such as rainfall flooding proximity to animal feeding operations soil characteristics and integrity of septic and sewage systems that could influence coliphage presence will lead to a more holistic understanding of resilience of private wells and risk to homeowners conclusions the frequency of detection of coliphages was considerably higher than in previous research conducted on groundwater wells from the southeastern usa male specific somatic or either phage was detected in greater proportions than total coliforms or e coli in both robeson and orange counties frequencies and concentrations of male specific coliphages were higher than of somatic coliphages and the pattern was evident on monthly basis in most cases rainfall appears to be partly influencing higher coliphage levels in july aug december january and february

cover consist of 61 agricultural 32 7 natural 3 9 cultural in the form of urban and transportation corridors and 2 4 other e g open water or barren rock approximately 68 of soils in the lumber watershed are considered hydric soils which are generally classified as poorly draining the haw river watershed is considerably larger and drains 1526 m2iles with 27 agricultural 43 forest 17 urban and 13 land use cover categories soils in orange county are either well or moderately drained wells were sampled at each of the following periods of time 1 late july early aug 2 october 3 november 4 december 2019 5 january and 6 february 2020 repeat monthly sampling occurred for a subset of wells in most months for orange n 4 and robeson n 12 counties and the remainder of wells in robeson n 42 were sampled on a one time basis in july n 4 october n 2 november n 10 december n 9 and january n 17 for a total of 122 samples age of wells in years ranged from 20 n 14 20 30 n 8 30 n 18 or were

by a septic system the inside and outside of well head spigots or the nearest outdoor spigot access point if the wellhead itself did not have a tap were wiped with 70 ethanol the ethanol was allowed to evaporate for approximately 30 s and the well head spigots were then flushed at full flow for one minute before sample collection water was collected directly into autoclave sterilized 4 l polypropylene containers placed on ice for transport and refrigerated at 4 c prior to processing which generally occurred within 24 h in some cases sample hold times were extended to within 30 h for bacterial analysis and 48 h for coliphage assays based on guidance from epa protocols a 30 hour window is an acceptable processing time for coliform samples collected for non regulatory purposes a 48 hour time limit is also acceptable for coliphage analysis according to epa method 1602 male specific f and somatic coliphage in water by single agar layer sal procedure epa 2001b 2015 regardless of

somatic e coli cn 13 atcc 700 609 or male specific e coli famp atcc 700 891 coliphage host was grown to exponential log phase confirmed by a540 measured using a spectrophotometer the log phase host plus 0 5 ml of 4 m mgcl2 was added to 100 ml of sample held at 36 5 c in a water bath the resulting sample host was then added to 100 ml of molten 2x tryptic soy agar containing either nalidixic acid 200 mg l or ampicillin streptomycin 30 mg l as selective antibiotics for the somatic or male specific hosts respectively the 200 ml aliquot of sample agar mixture was then divided evenly and plated on five replicate 150 mm x 15 mm plates allowed to solidify and incubated at 36 5 c plaques which indicate lysis of the e coli host by infectious coliphages were counted at 20 24 h and were reported as plaque forming units per 100 ml of original sample volume pfu 100 ml ambiguous plaques were confirmed by a spot plate test per method 1602 bacterial contamination in wells was quantified by epa method 1604 total coliform and escherichia coli in water by membrane filtration using a simultaneous detection technique mi medium epa 2002 because bacterial concentrations were expected to be low in well water a volume of 1000 ml instead of 100 ml was vacuum filtered through a sterile mixed cellulose ester 0 45 µm filter millipore emd filters were rinsed with phosphate buffered saline solution and transferred to 60 mm x 15 mm culture plates containing mi agar plates were incubated at 36 5 c and colony forming units per 100 ml of sample cfu 100 ml were counted after 24 h incubation statistics a z score test was used to compare the frequency of occurrence for coliforms total coliforms e coli and the frequency of male specific somatic or either coliphage group for each individual county and the two counties combined a t test was performed on log transformed concentrations to compare mean differences between coliphage type within each county and on a combined county basis values were initially log transformed to reduce skewness and improve normality a t test was assessed in advance of pooling a coliphage type within a county for combined county analyses in order to perform statistical analyses in the case of samples with non detect values one half of the detection limit of i e 0 05 cfu 100 ml or 0 5 pfu 100 ml was assigned as a continuity correction for statistical comparisons epa 2006 silvestri et al 2017 separate one way anova tests followed by a post hoc analysis using dunnett s t3 were used to compare mean monthly log10 concentrations for each phage type per county a non parametric spearman s rank correlation coefficient was used to determine if a relationship existed between monthly rainfall levels and coliphage concentrations for each phage type per county an alpha α 0 05 was used as the significance level of all statistical tests results were presented as plaque forming units per 100 ml pfu 100 ml for coliphage analysis and colony forming units per 100 ml cfu 100 ml for total coliform and e coli analyses results occurrence and frequency comparison of coliphages and coliforms in private wells overall coliphages regardless of group were detected more frequently than bacterial indicators in the counties both individually and combined while e coli was detected only twice 10 in orange county either coliphage group was detected more frequently at 55 in robeson county e coli was not detected but either coliphage was detected in 74 of samples fig 2 either coliphage was detected at 40 57 and 54 more frequently than total coliforms in orange robeson and the combined counties respectively fig 2 fig 3 results of z score tests comparing frequencies of coliforms and coliphages are presented in table 1 observations of e coli in orange were rare n 2 and expectedly frequencies of occurrence were different than for male specific somatic or either coliphage type p 0 001 there were significant differences p 0 05 in the proportions between coliforms and coliphages in most cases except for total coliforms and somatic coliphages in orange county p 0 10 table 1 comparison of concentrations between coliphage type for individual and combined counties the concentrations of coliphages were generally low in all samples and male specific mean log10 of 0 16 pfu 100 ml and somatic coliphage concentrations mean log10 of 0

the case for male specific f5 54 6 659 p 0 001 and somatic coliphages f5 54 6 659 p 0 001 the significance patterns of the repeated sample subset for male specific coliphage concentrations were exactly the same as results presented in fig 5 inclusive of repeat and one time samples data not shown differences in somatic coliphage concentrations in subset of repeated well samples were overall similar to the entire dataset except for the lack of statistical differences between july and february and for november and december data not shown repeat samples do not appear to confound the variability of either male specific or somatic coliphages concentrations spearman rank correlation test for association between monthly rainfall totals and concentration for each coliphage and county no relationship was found between rainfall and either somatic p 0 756 or male specific coliphages p 0 103 in orange county on the other hand a moderate positive relationship was found between somatic coliphages r 0 440 p 0 001 as well as male specific coliphages r 0 562 p 0 001 and monthly rainfall in robeson county discussion coliphage occurrence and comparison to fib studies have often reported on the occurrence of enteroviruses and other viruses in groundwater systems both private and public wells but there are limited studies performed on coliphage detection in private wells including coliphage data for private wells is of particular interest because fecal viral contamination of public health concern may be present in such sources even when a particular human pathogenic virus may not be detected in a given sample the frequency of detection in the present study is considerably higher than in previous research conducted by epa on groundwater wells specifically from the southeast including nc and other regions in the united states epa 2006 researchers reported that somatic coliphages were found in 7 of the wells 2 of 27 wells and male specific coliphages were found in 4 of the wells 1 of 27 wells in the southeastern usa while somatic and male specific coliphages were detected in 57 16 28 and 39 11 28 of wells in the northeast the prevalence reported in the present study was broadly comparable to the prevalence of coliphages detected in wells from the northeastern usa differences between the present study and the 2006 epa study as well as between regions in the epa study may be explained in part by differences in the types depths and or construction characteristics of wells sampled sampling months temperature and or rainfall and proximity to septic systems or other environmental sources of fecal contamination all of the wells in the present study were private wells sampled in the sampling window from july august to february whereas the samples in the epa study included public water groundwater supply and non community transient public water supplies campgrounds but sampling months were not reported male specific somatic or either coliphage was detected in greater proportions than total coliforms or e coli in the present study e coli was found in two cases in orange county only and was detected at very low levels 1 cfu 1000 ml the occurrence of total coliforms in 20 of water samples from private wells in this study is roughly comparable to results reported for coliforms in private well water samples from wake county nc stillo and gibson 2017 as well as studies reporting occurrence of total coliforms in samples from wells in iowa 27 and nebraska 26 gosselin et al 1997 kross et al 1993 most fib do not always have direct relationship with coliphage or pathogenic viruses and do not always predict health risks leclerc et al 2000 noble and fuhrman 2001 payment and locas 2011 however coliphages do appear to have a positive association with viral pathogens vergara et al 2015 given this potential association and the high coliphage prevalence in private wells in this study incorporating a multi indicator approach may be more informative about the microbiological quality of groundwater lucena et al 2006 and using coliphages in addition to or in place of fib is suggested occurrence and concentration of coliphage type in each and combined counties studies have overall reported somatic coliphages in greater proportions than male specific coliphages in surface water nappier et al 2019 but this trend is not always seen in groundwater systems jofre et al 2016 in the present study it is interesting to note the frequencies of male specific coliphages were only about 10 higher than somatic coliphages but male specific concentrations were 0 4 of a log10 higher in robeson and combined counties similarly the pattern of higher levels of male specific to somatic phages emerged on a monthly basis in most cases researchers have found soil characteristics and attachment affinities of phage groups could play a role in their differing occurrence in groundwater jofre et al 2016 skraber et al 2007 others suggest differential susceptibilities of different bacteriophage families to unfavorable environmental factors such as high or low ph high salinity etc jończyk et al 2011 in the present study the concentration range for either coliphage type was greater in robeson than orange county and soil type and land use could play a role in this observation approximately 68 of soils in robeson county are classified as hydric soils with poor drainage characteristics that could promote coliphage persistence in ponded areas surrounding unprotected wellheads after rainfall events with eventual intrusion and infiltration into especially shallow wells agriculture is the dominant land use in robeson county and deposition of coliphages in fecal waste from livestock may contribute to the greater range of coliphages than in orange county assessment of hydrogeological and physicochemical properties that may be influencing differential phage type occurrences and concentrations is warranted the concentrations for male specific coliphages in this study are similar to baselines levels 10 to 30 pfu 100 ml in a study investigating gastrointestinal illness in users of an artificial white water course lee et al 1997 while somatic coliphage concentrations are comparable to levels 0 3 to 1 7 pfu 100 ml found at a marine beach that were associated with gi illness in bathers abdelzaher et al 2011 abdelzaher et al 2010 although these studies are not groundwater related this does provide evidence to further consider future epidemiological studies associated with coliphages in groundwater wells monthly evaluation of coliphage type in each county and relation to rainfall concentrations for phages were generally higher in july aug december january and february than october and november at least for robeson county wells there was a positive relationship for both phage groups and monthly rainfall amounts which suggests precipitation in part as a factor driving coliphage concentrations the pattern was less evident in orange county and could have been because of less variability of rainfall or small sample sizes reducing the effect size studies investigating monthly profiles of coliphages in groundwater are limited but one study from usa groundwater wells found peaks in july and november for a male specific phage abbaszadegan et al 2003 male specific phages were 137 pfu 100 ml in july from a community well water system serviced by a groundwater source and dropped to 7 pfu 100 ml by september atherholt et al 2003 nappier et al 2019 conducted a meta analysis of coliphage occurrence in wastewater and surface water and reported higher coliphage concentrations in the months of december through may than june through november our findings are partially consistent with the findings of nappier et al except for the peak in july aug in robeson county which may have been elevated after a rain event when homeowners provided well depth over half 57 wells were less than 10 6 m or 35 ft and transport of phages during rainfall events could have impacted shallow wells more so than deeper ones sampling coverage of warmer and rainier months such as march april and may will be important to gain a picture of how temperature during wetter season factor into coliphage presence measurement of viral pathogens noble et al 2003 and serotyping of f coliphages to discriminate between human and non human sources of fecal contamination brion et al 2002 cole et al 2003 griffin et al 2000 stewart pullaro et al 2006 to elucidate sources of coliphage is warranted all of the households in the sampling campaign are also serviced by a septic system and it is plausible sewage could have infiltrated into wells during rainfall events going forward use of sophisticated bayesian maximum entropy bme mapping analysis to describe spatial distribution of microbial contamination and land use regression to identify key spatial determinants such as rainfall flooding proximity to animal feeding operations soil characteristics and integrity of septic and sewage systems that could influence coliphage presence will lead to a more holistic understanding of resilience of private wells and risk to homeowners conclusions the frequency of detection of coliphages was considerably higher than in previous research conducted on groundwater wells from the southeastern usa male specific somatic or either phage was detected in greater proportions than total coliforms or e coli in both robeson and orange counties frequencies and concentrations of male specific coliphages were higher than of somatic coliphages and the pattern was evident on monthly basis in most cases rainfall appears to be partly influencing higher coliphage levels in july aug december january and february this work underscores the utility and importance of considering coliphages in conjunction or instead of fib to investigate contamination in private drinking wells to protect consumers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
