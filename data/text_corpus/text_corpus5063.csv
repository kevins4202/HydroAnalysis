25315,in many host pathogen systems pathogen transmission requires close contact between infectious and susceptible hosts the contact rates among individuals depend upon how they move in the landscape because functional connectivity can affect interactions between individuals yet few studies have explored the interplay between contact rates conspecific density and functional connectivity using a spatially explicit individual based model we investigated how empirical movement rules translate into spatial patterns of contact rates among disease hosts in complex landscapes we developed dynamic models of functional connectivity by characterizing movement behaviors of radio collared raccoons which are the main hosts of the raccoon rabies virus on this basis we simulated space use dynamics of raccoons in virtual landscapes varying in conspecific density forest availability and landscape connectivity we then characterized spatial patterns in the density of per capita contact rates of simulated raccoons radio collared raccoons were more likely to choose large habitat patches that were reached by traveling along least cost paths and had relatively long residence times in anthropogenic areas especially during daytime these movement rules that were applied to simulated raccoons in virtual landscapes revealed three key patterns in contact rates first few simulated raccoons were responsible for most contacts between individuals a pattern that emerged even though all simulated raccoons obeyed the same movement rules second per capita contact rates increased linearly with individual density under most conditions which indicates that raccoon rabies transmission should be density dependent rather than frequency dependent third functional connectivity created a broad range of patterns in the density of per capita contact rates from decreasing to increasing values depending upon the availability of land cover types overall the contacts between hosts tended to occur at highest densities in forests anthropogenic areas and agricultural corridors we show that complex patterns of contact rates can emerge from simple empirical movement rules and therefore can be key drivers of disease spread dynamics the strong spatial heterogeneity observed in contact rates implies that the effectiveness of particular control interventions can strongly vary depending upon host density landscape composition and functional connectivity this study provides key functional relationships for tailoring interventions to changes in local conditions keywords animal movement contact rate landscape connectivity individual based model infectious disease management raccoon 1 introduction the contact rate among individual hosts is a fundamental component for predicting the dynamics of infectious disease spread in wild populations and thus for developing cost effective disease control strategies craft 2015 white et al 2017 in particular the pathogen transmission rate depends upon the rate at which an individual host comes into contact with another individual and the probability that such contact is infectious begon et al 2002 simple mathematical formulations of disease transmission dynamics mccallum et al 2001 predict that contact rates either increase linearly with individual density in a population resulting in density dependent transmission anderson and may 1979 may and anderson 1979 or are constant irrespective of individual density leading frequency dependent transmission thrall et al 1993 thrall et al 1995 empirical studies have shown however that contact rates could follow a nonlinear relationship in which contact rates increase with individual density but become saturated at high density habib et al 2011 ji et al 2005 ramsey et al 2002 implying that pathogen transmission dynamics in wildlife often lie between extreme assumptions of density dependent and frequency dependent transmission smith et al 2009 although previous research has shown that this nonlinearity could be driven by changes in host behavior that is associated with social group ranges habib et al 2011 or individual home ranges ramsey et al 2002 the role of spatial heterogeneity in shaping such patterns of disease transmission remains unclear to optimize control interventions quantifying variation in contact rates among individual hosts and across space is needed paull et al 2011 some individuals in the landscape can have a disproportionately high number of contacts compared to the mean which can cause superspreading events over large scales lloyd smith et al 2005 for example woolhouse et al 1997 proposed the 20 80 rule wherein 20 of infected hosts known as superspreaders are responsible for 80 of infection transmission in host pathogen systems although physiology and social behavior of individual hosts have been recognized as being significant sources of variation in contact rates by affecting individual susceptibility and competence vanderwaal and ezenwa 2016 wilson et al 2002 few studies have assessed the interplay between host contact rates and landscape physiognomy habib et al 2011 kj√¶r et al 2008 knowledge of the interactions between contact rates and landscape characteristics can directly inform on the likely locations of hotspots for pathogen transmission in human fragmented landscapes maintaining connectivity between habitat patches is important for biodiversity conservation fahrig and merriam 1985 but could also enhance spread and transmission of infectious diseases for example in the great plains of north america canada and usa sylvatic plague yersinia pestis is more likely to spread among colonies of black tailed prairie dogs cynomys ludovicianus that are spatially close together and located in close proximity to dispersal corridors collinge et al 2005 johnson et al 2011 landscape connectivity can affect disease transmission and spread because it determines the spatial dynamics of animal movement and the contact risk among potential hosts meentemeyer et al 2012 in landscapes where high quality habitat patches can be delimited over space mobile animals must decide how long to remain within a patch where to go next and how to get there these decisions can strongly depend upon the structural and functional connectivity of the landscape courbin et al 2014 dancose et al 2010 structural connectivity describes the physical links between habitat patches such as the euclidean distance between them kindlmann and burel 2008 tischendorf and fahrig 2000 animals however do not necessary navigate between high quality patches along straight paths functional connectivity considers the adjustment of animal movements to the characteristics of the surrounding matrix taylor et al 1993 although such fine scale movements can directly alter the contact rates between individual hosts koen et al 2017 tracey et al 2014 only a few studies of infectious disease dynamics have considered functional connectivity nobert et al 2016 rees et al 2013 also most of them provide predictions of disease occurrence while the spatial distributions of infectious diseases depend crucially upon contact mechanisms between individual hosts arthur et al 2017 white et al 2017 neglecting the role of contacts could affect our understanding of pathogen transmission and spread processes in heterogeneous landscapes such that a modeling tool that would allow incorporating functional connectivity should improve the ability to anticipate the spatial dynamics of infectious diseases in wildlife populations spatially explicit individual based models ibms provide a modeling framework to simulate complex dynamic systems where emergent phenomena can be observed matthews et al 2007 railsback 2001 in spatially explicit ibms individuals are represented as autonomous entities that interact with their environment and other individuals grimm and railsback 2005 the advantage of spatially explicit ibms is that they can integrate stochastic and spatially dependent processes at the individual level that are difficult to quantify empirically deangelis and mooij 2005 consequently spatially explicit ibms have been largely used for modeling animal movement in heterogeneous landscapes e g bauduin et al 2016 kramer schadt et al 2004 palmer et al 2011 tracey et al 2014 recently marrotte et al 2017 have associated host movement behavior with a directional measure of landscape connectivity based on movement costs to assess contact probability between white footed mice that are important reservoir hosts of lyme bacteria prediction of contact rates however should also require modeling inter patch movement decisions that consider residence time within habitat patches and choice of the next patch the current lack of information on the functional link between contact rates conspecific density and landscape connectivity impedes the development of cost effective disease control strategies in this study we built a spatially explicit ibm to assess how changes in conspecific density landscape composition and functional connectivity alter contact rates between individual hosts to do this we integrated components of space use in the ibm by estimating from empirical data residence time within high quality habitat patches and choice of the next high quality patch and by simulating intra and inter patch movements in different virtual landscapes that differed in habitat availability and connectivity the model has been constructed for raccoons procyon lotor l one of the main hosts of the raccoon rabies virus variant in north america finnegan et al 2002 2 materials and methods we developed a spatially explicit ibm that integrates three main components 1 virtual landscapes 2 simulated individuals representing raccoons and 3 empirical rules of space use that are used by the simulated individuals to move across the virtual landscapes the ibm was implemented in netlogo version 5 0 5 wilensky 1999 2 1 components of the ibm 2 1 1 virtual landscapes to assess the influence of changes in landscape composition and connectivity on per capita contact rates among individual hosts we simulated the movement of raccoons in 15 virtual landscapes differing in terms of forest proportion and spatial configuration of agricultural corridors in landscapes dominated by forest patches and agricultural fields spatial distribution of raccoons is closely linked to forest cover and agricultural corridors tardy et al 2015 2014 in particular raccoons use corridors to move between habitat patches beasley et al 2007 the spatial scales used for building virtual landscapes were defined from those of agriculturally fragmented landscapes in the mont√©r√©gie region of southern qu√©bec canada where 104 rabies cases had been reported between 2006 and 2009 rees et al 2011 the virtual landscapes were represented as raster grids of 1000 1000 cells and had an extent of 100 km¬≤ we defined cells of 10 10 m which corresponds to the minimal width of agricultural corridors in the mont√©r√©gie landscapes tardy et al 2014 the virtual landscapes were comprised of eight land cover types that are typical of agriculturally fragmented landscapes forests corn maize fields other crops including vegetable and fruit crops together with cereal fields such as oat wheat soybean hay and barley open uncultivated areas water bodies lakes wetlands riparian areas around lakes anthropogenic areas and agricultural corridors fig b1 supplementary material the set of adjacent cells that were composed of the same land cover type defined a habitat polygon each cell was identified by its centroid and was characterized by state variables referring to habitat polygons to which they belonged i e the unique id number of the polygon size of the polygon and movement cost to model the movement of raccoons between habitat polygons in the virtual landscapes we used a resistance surface by applying a cost value of movement at each land cover type see section 2 2 4 for details the boundaries of virtual landscapes acted as reflective barriers so that all movements of simulated raccoons occurred within the landscapes to reduce the boundary effects on per capita contact rates these latter were measured within the virtual landscapes that excluded the two border rows using a grid pattern to represent agricultural corridors we defined two systematic configurations of corridors by varying the length width ratio of grid squares ratio 1 1 i e length width 20 20 cells which results in a grid of 50 50 squares and ratio 2 1 i e length width 20 10 cells which results in a grid of 50 100 squares fig b2 supplementary material according to such configurations the agricultural corridors were linear strips of 1 unit width i e 10 m connecting habitat polygons the sizes of agricultural fields resulting from the different corridor configurations i e 20 20 cells for 1 1 ratio and 20 10 cells for 2 1 ratio corresponded to those observed in the mont√©r√©gie region according to satellite images that had been acquired in 2011 by the financi√®re agricole du qu√©bec by using the 1 1 ratio as the reference grid we also drew three random configurations of agricultural corridors by randomly removing 25 50 and 75 of square sides in the grid fig b2 supplementary material finally the systematic and random configurations of agricultural corridors resulted in different levels of landscape connectivity in our study connectivity was defined as the average number of agricultural corridors connecting polygons of a given land cover type in the virtual landscapes similar to the measure of node degree in a network rayfield et al 2010 consequently the 75 random configuration corresponded to the lowest level of landscape connectivity a polygon being connected on average by 1 38 corridors and the 2 1 ratio systematic configuration was associated with the highest level of landscape connectivity a polygon being connected on average by 4 23 corridors in addition we included three levels of forest proportion 0 7 0 14 and 0 28 the proportion of 0 14 corresponded to the mean proportion of forests that is observed in the mont√©r√©gie region the sizes of forests 11 29 ha anthropogenic areas 3 25 ha wetlands 0 56 ha and water bodies 0 25 ha did not change between the virtual landscapes and were estimated from 1 15 000 scale aerial photographs of the mont√©r√©gie region that had been taken in 1999 by the minist√®re des ressources naturelles et de la faune quebec ministry of natural resources and wildlife while the proportion of anthropogenic areas 0 08 wetlands 0 03 and water bodies 0 02 remained constant in the virtual landscapes variation in the proportions of cornfields crops and open uncultivated areas resulted from gradients in the forest proportion and spatial configuration of agricultural corridors fig b3 supplementary material 2 1 2 simulated individuals simulated individuals were characterized by a unique id number coordinates of the cell centroid and a unique id number of the habitat polygon where they were located during simulation together with departure and arrival time in the habitat polygon the individuals were also defined by state variables that were linked to the components of space use i e residence time within the habitat polygon unique id number of the next polygon that would be visited and the list of cells that would be traversed to go to the next polygon to assess the influence of changes in conspecific density on per capita contact rates among individual hosts we varied four levels of density of simulated raccoons in each virtual landscape 0 1 1 5 and 10 raccoons km¬≤ 2 2 empirical rules of space use to model mechanisms of functional connectivity land cover types of virtural landscapes were summarized as high quality habitat polygons and the habitat matrix dancose et al 2010 thus we considered polygons of forests cornfields anthropogenic areas and wetlands as high quality polygons because these land cover types are rich in resources and are strongly selected by raccoons tardy et al 2014 agricultural corridors and the other land cover types i e crops open uncultivated areas and lakes represented the matrix as these land cover types either are used by raccoons to move within the landscape or are avoided tardy et al 2014 we built four submodels to integrate the components of space use in the ibm 1 residence time in the high quality polygons 2 movement within the high quality polygons 3 choice of the next high quality polygon and 4 movement between the high quality polygons the parameters that were included in the submodels were estimated from empirical data these data were obtained through global positioning system gps based tracking of 54 raccoons from 2009 to 2011 in two areas of southern qu√©bec canada the first area was located in the mont√©r√©gie region 45 23 23 n 73 06 05 w and the second in the estrie region 45 28 54 n 71 40 05 w both areas were spatially near and had habitat characteristics that were similar to the areas where rabid raccoons had been detected more details on capture procedure and telemetry data of raccoons are given in tardy et al 2014 section monitoring of habitat selection by raccoons to build our submodels we considered gps locations with 2 h relocation interval 2 2 1 residence time in high quality polygons in the ibm each simulated raccoon moved within a high quality polygon until a predetermined residence time in the polygon is exceeded fig 1 from sequences of gps locations 2 h relocation interval we assessed habitat characteristics that influence average time in hours spent by raccoons in the high quality polygons as proposed by bastille rousseau et al 2011 residence time was defined as the duration from the arrival of individuals to their departure from a polygon and was estimated by considering the number of successive gps locations along parts of the movement path entering and leaving a polygon to correct for missing gps locations 48 often caused by forest cover interference each location was adjusted by a weighting factor frair et al 2010 that was defined by 1 elapsed time in hours between the location at time t and the location at time t 1 the weighting factor for the first location of each radio collared raccoon was equal to 0 the weighting factor was varied between 0 and 1 in this way the locations that were close in time had a greater influence in the estimation of model parameters to estimate residence time as a function of habitat characteristics we built a linear mixed effects model using a gaussian distribution with log transformed residence time as the dependent variable the model included a random intercept for individual nested within year to account for the hierarchical structure of the data and the unbalanced number of observations among raccoons together with to accommodate for non independence of observations of the same raccoon within a given year gillies et al 2006 the linear mixed effects model had the following general structure 1 y i k t x Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ land cover x land cover i k t Œ≤ area x area i k t Œ≤ land cover area x land cover i k t x area i k t Œ≤ land cover time x land cover i k t x time i k t Œ≥ 0 k t where y i k t x represents the log transformed residence time in high quality polygon i for raccoon k within year t Œ≤ 0 is the mean intercept Œ≤ are coefficients for covariates x and Œ≥ 0 k t is the random intercept associated with raccoon k nested within year t the term x land cover i k t corresponds to the land cover type i e forest cornfield anthropogenic area or wetland of high quality polygon i for raccoon k within year t coded as a dichotomous covariate the term x area i k t is the log transformed area in hectares of high quality polygon i for raccoon k within year t this covariate was also standardized by subtracting its means and dividing by its standard deviation to improve model convergence and to reduce collinearity between interaction terms quinn and keough 2002 we dropped the wetland area interaction because it caused multicollinearity variance inflation factor 10 dormann et al 2013 the term x time i k t represents either the day coded as 1 or night coded as 0 period during which raccoon k within year t is in high quality polygon i the night period extended from the beginning of dusk sunset 1h until the end of dawn sunrise 1h whereas the day period went from the end of dawn until the beginning of dusk data obtained from national research council canada and available at http www nrc cnrc gc ca eng services sunrise we considered the time period in the model because raccoons tend to rest at day and be active during the night gehrt 2003 like forester et al 2009 we included this covariate as an interaction term to capture variation in the residence times during the time period night and day further we added a variance structure to stabilize residual heteroscedasticity by allowing for variance increases or decreases with predicted values pinheiro and bates 2000 normality of random effects and residuals were respected the model estimates were computed with the package nlme of r statistical software version 3 3 1 r development core team 2014 2 2 2 movement within high quality polygons when the predetermined residence time in the high quality polygon was not exceeded fig 1 the movement of a simulated raccoon within the polygon was modeled as a correlated random walk turchin 1998 we randomly selected random steps from the distribution of turning angles i e a measure of directionality between the current and previous step that is ranged from 0 to 360 of radio collared raccoons that was specific to each high quality land cover type and time period day 179 80 mean standard deviation for forests 193 83 for cornfields 174 84 for anthropogenic areas 177 70 for wetlands night 180 104 for forests 179 102 for cornfields 171 95 for anthropogenic areas 191 103 for wetlands at each time step a simulated raccoon randomly moved into one of eight adjacent cells from their current cell 2 2 3 choice of the next high quality polygon once a simulated raccoon left a high quality polygon i e when the predetermined residence time in the high quality polygon was exceeded the raccoon had to choose which high quality polygon to visit next fig 1 we first calculated the relative probability of use of all available high quality polygons that were situated within a 2 km buffer around the simulated raccoon and then the simulated raccoon moved to the polygon with the highest relative probability of use the probabilities that were considered in the ibm were determined from an empirical model we used sequences of gps locations 2 h relocation interval from radio collared raccoons to characterize their successive use of high quality polygons following the approach proposed by dancose et al 2010 we identified the high quality polygons that contained at least one gps location i e the source polygons and the associated high quality polygons that were visited next i e the destination polygons each destination polygon was then matched with 10 random high quality polygons that were selected within a 2 km radius of the source polygon to estimate availability of landscape attributes the 2 km buffer encompassed 99 of distances between the source and destination polygons the choice of the number of random samples habitat polygons in our case generally depends on the research question and computational limitations but a large sample number is not always necessary to obtain robust estimates of model coefficients for example a high number of random samples can be appropriate to characterize the availability of landscape attributes that are rare fortin et al 2005 by contrast the size of random samples can be small with no impact on coefficient estimation considering a case control design thurfjell et al 2014 addressing the issues associated with step selection functions that are based on conditional logistic regression approaches thurfjell et al 2014 suggest that a small number of random samples i e random steps or even one random sample can be sufficient to analyze animal movement we contrasted habitat characteristics of the destination score 1 and associated random score 0 polygons by using conditional logistic regressions in which each stratum included one destination polygon and its 10 associated random polygons dancose et al 2010 fortin et al 2005 all strata for a given radio collared raccoon nested within a given year were assigned to a unique cluster to obtain robust standard errors fortin et al 2005 the model had the following general structure 2 w j k t x exp Œ≤ land cover x land cover j k t Œ≤ area x area j k t Œ≤ cost x cost i j k t Œ≤ land cover residence x land cover j k t x residence i k t where w j k t x represents the relative probability of use of destination or random polygon j for raccoon k within year t and Œ≤ are coefficients for covariates x the term x land cover j k t corresponds to the land cover type i e forest cornfield anthropogenic area or wetland of destination or random polygon j for raccoon k within year t coded as a dichotomous covariate the term x area j k t is the log transformed area in hectares of destination or random polygon j for raccoon k within year t we dropped the wetland area interaction because it caused multicollinearity variance inflation factor 10 dormann et al 2013 the term x cost i j k t is the log transformed cost of the least cost path between source polygon i in which raccoon k within year t is located and destination or random polygon j a least cost path lcp represents the most likely travel route that an individual should follow to reach its destination polygon theobald 2006 porter et al 2015 showed that using lcps could be adequate to predict raccoon movement between habitat polygons to build lcps we defined a resistance surface that is based on relative costs of moving through different land cover types in the landscape zeller et al 2012 as the cost values are often assigned to cells on a raster map douglas 1994 we converted vector maps of the mont√©r√©gie and estrie study areas into raster maps at a spatial resolution of 10 m following the approach proposed by chetkiewicz and boyce 2009 the resistance surface was generated by taking the inverse of the odds ratio 1 exp selection coefficient from the land cover selection model in tardy et al 2014 for night and day each land cover type was thus assigned to a cost value during nighttime or daytime table a1 in supplementary material the lcp cost was then calculated by summing the cost value of each landscape cell along the radio collared raccoon path adriaensen et al 2003 the term x residence i k t is the log transformed residence time in hours in source polygon i in which raccoon k within year t is located see the section 2 2 1 for details this covariate was not included as a simple effect in the model but as an interaction term because each destination polygon and its 10 associated random polygons were assigned to the same log transformed residence time as for the group size effect in fortin et al 2009 we built models for each land cover type of source polygons by using the package clogit of r statistical software version 3 3 1 r development core team 2014 we evaluated model robustness by using 5 fold cross validation that was adapted for case control designs see fortin et al 2009 for details we performed the procedure 100 times to obtain average spearman rank correlations r s for which a high r s indicates high predictive power 2 2 4 movement between high quality polygons once the next high quality polygon was chosen fig 1 the simulated raccoon used the lcp between the cell in which it was located during the simulation and the next high quality polygon to move towards this polygon the procedure for constructing lcps is the same as that used in the section 2 2 3 for each virtual landscape we defined a resistance surface where each land cover type was assigned to a cost value during nighttime or daytime table a1 supplementary material we used the a star search algorithm to find the best lcp between the cell where the simulated raccoon was located during the simulation and all cells situated at the edge of the next high quality polygon hart et al 1968 this algorithm has the advantage to be faster than the dijkstra s algorithm because it reduces the search space of the lcp by considering only the cells that have a greater chance of appearing in the path soltani et al 2002 2 3 simulation experiments the ibm evolved according to discrete three minute time steps we used this temporal scale because preliminary analyses have shown that radio collared raccoons moved at a rate of about 200 m h as also reported by rosatte et al 2010 thus simulated raccoons should take about three minutes to cross a 10 m cell in agriculturally fragmented landscapes in southern qu√©bec corn zea mays l is the main food source of raccoons rivest and bergeron 1981 when it becomes available about 1 august 15 october instead of setting the temporal extent to the entire period of corn maturation we ran our model over four weeks 28 days from 1 august because home range size of radio collared raccoons remained stable during this period fig b4 supplementary material at the beginning of each simulation the time counter and then the cells of the virtual landscape were initialized the time counter started 1 august at 00 00 once the landscape cells were initialized simulated raccoons were randomly placed within a cell within a single time step landscape cells were updated for movement costs cost values for nighttime or daytime and then simulated raccoons moved on a cell and updated their location finally the time counter was updated once all simulated raccoons had made a move simulated raccoons moved independently of each other in all simulations as stochasticity was only included in the placement of simulated raccoons within cells 100 simulation replicates for each virtual landscape including 0 1 raccoon km¬≤ and 15 simulation replicates for each virtual landscape containing 1 5 and 10 raccoons km¬≤ were sufficient to obtain low standard deviations around mean values of per capita contact rates from the ibm we executed a total of 2175 simulations i e 100 replicates 15 virtual landscapes 1 level of conspecific density corresponding to 0 1 raccoon km¬≤ 15 replicates 15 virtual landscapes 3 levels of conspecific density corresponding to 1 5 and 10 raccoons km¬≤ in which each simulated raccoon had 13 441 steps one step was recorded at each three minute time step over 28 days 2 4 analyses of contact data for directly transmitted diseases pathogen transmission depends upon the number of direct contacts per time unit between individual hosts mccallum et al 2001 in the ibm a direct contact between two simulated raccoons happened when both individuals co occurred in the same cell for each virtual landscape and level of conspecific density we computed 1 the number of per capita cumulative contacts i e average number of conspecifics that have been in contact with a given simulated raccoon after all simulation replicates within any given land cover type and time period and 2 the number of per capita unique contacts i e average number of different conspecifics that have been in contact at least once with a given simulated raccoon after all simulation replicates within any given land cover type and time period we considered these two metrics because they provide different information about contact events for example seven contacts for a given simulated raccoon could be distributed as either four contacts with one conspecific and three contacts with another conspecific or one contact with seven different conspecifics while the probability of transmitting pathogens tends to increase when individuals repeatedly contact conspecifics e g creech et al 2012 modeling of unique contacts can be used to characterize superspreading events e g clay et al 2009 finally for each virtual landscape and level of conspecific density we estimated the density of cumulative and unique contact rates per simulated raccoon within any given land cover type and time period by dividing the number of per capita cumulative or unique contacts by the total area occupied by this land cover type in the landscape from per capita contact rates we performed two analyses first we assessed variation in contact rates among simulated raccoons based upon the average frequency distribution of raccoons according to the number of unique contacts observed per individual n 100 simulation replicates for the conspecific density of 0 1 raccoon km¬≤ and n 15 simulation replicates for the conspecific densities of 1 5 and 10 raccoons km¬≤ for each virtual landscape and conspecific density the corrected moment estimate of the parameter k of the negative binomial distribution was used to quantify aggregation in contact rates among individuals elliott 1977 this estimate was calculated from the mean x and variance œÉ 2 of the average frequency distribution of simulated raccoons elliott 1977 wilson et al 2002 k x 2 œÉ 2 n œÉ 2 x where n is the sample size which partially corrects the bias associated with small samples gregory and woolhouse 1993 when k is large 20 the distribution is random whereas when k is near zero the distribution is highly aggregated and follows a negative binomial distribution a host frequency distribution of the number per capita unique contacts that is highly aggregated suggests the presence of heterogeneity in contact patterns with a small portion of hosts supporting the majority of contacts clay et al 2009 using lorenz curves lorenz 1905 and the associated gini coefficient gini 1921 we then quantified inequality in contact rates among simulated raccoons a lorenz curve was built for each virtual landscape containing 5 and 10 simulated raccoons km¬≤ by plotting the cumulative percentage of per capita unique contacts against the cumulative percentage of simulated raccoons also see poulin 1993 for a detailed application in a host parasite system this relationship was used to determine if the contact dynamics of simulated raccoons at high conspecific densities could follow the 20 80 rule of woolhouse et al 1997 the gini coefficient was defined as the area between the lorenz curve and the 45 degree line of equality in contact rates per individual and is ranged from 0 no inequality in per capita contact rates to 1 high inequality in per capita contact rates the lorenz curves with the associated gini coefficient were performed with the package ineq of r statistical software version 3 3 1 r development core team 2014 second we represented 1 the density of per capita cumulative and unique contact rates within each land cover type during day and night as a function of conspecific density for each combination of levels of forest proportion and spatial configuration of agricultural corridors specific to virtual landscapes first set of graphs and 2 the density of per capita cumulative and unique contact rates within forests cornfields and anthropogenic areas during day and night as a function of landscape connectivity for each combination of levels of forest proportion and conspecific density second set of graphs to describe the functional relationships between the contact rates conspecific density and landscape physiognomy for the first set of graphs we used nonlinear least squares regressions to estimate the values of the parameter q which controls the concavity of relationships between per capita contact rates and individual density in a population see eq 2 in smith et al 2009 when q 0 per capita contact rates increase linearly with individual density leading to density dependent transmission and when q 1 per capita contact rates are independent of individual density leading to frequency dependent transmission other values of the parameter q yield nonlinear relationships see fig 2a in smith et al 2009 the models were built by using the package nls of r statistical software version 3 3 1 r development core team 2014 for the second set of graphs we considered the density of per capita cumulative and unique contact rates within forests cornfields and anthropogenic areas because the first set of graphs showed that these land cover types contained a higher density of cumulative and unique contact rates compared to other land cover types see section 3 2 5 uncertainty and sensitivity analyses first we conducted an uncertainty analysis to quantify the variability in contact rates among simulated raccoons given uncertainty in the ibm input parameters second we performed a sensitivity analysis of the ibm to assess the influence of input parameters on the variability in contact rates in particular this analysis helps to identify the input parameters that are the most influential on the model output and proves useful in determining the most important biological processes in the ibm broeke et al 2016 we chose to perform a global sensitivity analysis in which the values of input parameters are varied simultaneously using latin hypercube sampling lhs over large ranges of uncertainty in order to assess the simple and interaction effects of parameters on the model output saltelli et al 2008 as proposed in marino et al 2008 the global sensitivity of our ibm to input parameters was measured from partial rank correlation coefficients prccs that quantify the strength of nonlinear and monotonic relationships between model output and parameters campolongo et al 2000 the prcc values vary between 1 and 1 in particular values close to 1 indicate that the input parameter is positively and very strongly correlated with the model output whereas values close to 1 indicate that there is a strong negative correlation between the parameter and model output marino et al 2008 for the prccs we used the lhs technique that is considered as a more efficient sampling method given that all input value combinations explored cover the full range of parameter space blower and dowlatabadi 1994 mckay et al 1979 in our sensitivity analysis we considered the Œ≤ coefficients of empirical submodels that determine residence time in high quality polygons see the eq 1 in the section 2 2 1 and choice of the next high quality polygon see the eq 2 in the section 2 2 3 as input parameters and the contact rates represented the model output we explored the sensitivity of these submodels given the lack of knowledge about inter patch movement decisions of raccoons the uncertainty ranges of Œ≤ coefficients were estimated from bootstrapping for hierarchical data van der leeden et al 2008 considering the multilevel structure of data using this method we resampled with replacement the two first hierarchical levels of our data i e individual and year levels in the submodels from the highest level so that summary statistic distributions were uncorrelated for the bootstrapping analysis 1500 bootstrap replicates of Œ≤ coefficients were performed because firstly the standard deviations of bootstrap distributions for each coefficient reached an equilibrium level within less than 1500 replications fig d1 supplementary material and secondly nevitt and hancock 2001 suggest that 200 and more bootstrap samples are preferable to obtain robust estimates then we generated input parameter samples using lhs that was drawn from approximate parametric distributions of the bootstrapped Œ≤ coefficients we assumed that the bootstrap sampling distributions of coefficients followed normal distributions for the lhs the original values of Œ≤ coefficients tables 1 and 2 and standard deviations of the distributions of bootstrapped Œ≤ coefficients were used as parameters for the normal distributions based on the recommendations of mckay et al 1979 100 samples were generated from the lhs method satisfying the minimum value of 4k 3 where k is the number of input parameters from one raster map of a real landscape of the mont√©r√©gie region including 5 simulated raccoons km¬≤ fig d2 supplementary material we finally ran the ibm using the set of Œ≤ coefficients obtained from the lhs based on the preferences of modeling tools of thiele et al 2014 we used the packages lhs and sensitivity of r statistical software version 3 3 1 r development core team 2014 to perform the sensitivity analysis carnell 2012 pujol et al 2017 2 6 model validation to validate our ibm we verified that emergent behaviors of simulated raccoons were representative of those of radio collared raccoons we used raster maps of real landscapes in the mont√©r√©gie region fig d2 supplementary material and from these raster maps that had the same spatial resolution as those of virtual landscapes i e size of the study area 100 km¬≤ size of cells 10 10 m we ran our ibm with simulated raccoons that were placed at the centroid of each radio collared raccoon s home range n 12 we compared the home range size and proportion of returns within forests cornfields and anthropogenic areas between radio collared and simulated raccoons home ranges were built by using a brownian bridge movement model that estimates space utilization distributions of animals from their movement trajectories horne et al 2007 3 results 3 1 empirical rules of space use radio collared raccoons spent from 1 to 77 h in individual habitat polygons mean 1 52 h residence time in habitat polygons was higher during the day when raccoons are less active than at night table 1 time spent in anthropogenic areas was four times longer during the day than at night residence time further depended upon polygon size in the landscape with raccoons displaying longer residence times in large than in small cornfields table 1 radio collared raccoons were also more likely to choose habitat polygons that were reached by traveling along a path with relatively low movement costs table 2 except for wetlands raccoons more strongly selected large than small polygons table 2 in addition raccoons leaving a forest polygon were more likely to transit to a cornfield than another forest polygon table 2 when raccoons left cornfields however they avoided ending up again in cornfields and wetlands relative to forests table 2 the probability of transiting from anthropogenic areas to wetlands was lower than the probability of transiting from anthropogenic areas to forests table 2 furthermore raccoons were less likely to move from wetlands to anthropogenic areas than from wetlands to forests table 2 residence time influenced the choice of the next polygon when raccoons were within anthropogenic areas and wetlands the probability that the next visited polygon was an anthropogenic area or cornfield decreased as raccoons spent an increasing amount of time in anthropogenic areas and wetlands respectively table 2 therefore the movement rules were context dependent which created strong spatio temporal variation in path trajectories we used these movement rules in our ibm to assess how landscape physiognomy should influence the contact rates among raccoons 3 2 variability in contact rates among simulated raccoons the per capita unique contact rates varied broadly among simulated raccoons depending upon both conspecific density and landscape characteristics for each combination of levels of forest proportion spatial configuration of agricultural corridors and conspecific density the host frequency distribution of the number per capita unique contacts did not follow a random distribution the distribution was highly aggregated k 20 fig c1 supplementary material suggesting that a minority of simulated raccoons was responsible for a large number of unique contacts in the virtual landscapes for example the top 20 of simulated raccoons that had the highest number of unique contacts in the virtual landscapes with densities of 5 and 10 raccoons km¬≤ accounted for 45 min 43 and max 50 and 43 min 40 and max 47 of all unique contacts respectively table c1 and fig c2 supplementary material the gini coefficients associated with the lorenz curves suggest that inequalities in contact rates exist among simulated raccoons in the virtual landscapes ranges 0 395 0 49 for the conspecific density of 5 simulated raccoons km¬≤ and 0 356 0 458 for the conspecific density of 10 raccoons simulated km¬≤ table c2 supplementary material the percentage of unique contacts produced by the top 20 of simulated raccoons was highest in landscapes that were highly connected by agricultural corridors and contained a low proportion of forests table c1 and fig c2 supplementary material 3 3 relation between contact rates conspecific density and landscape physiognomy in most conditions the parameter q in the contact rate density equation of smith et al 2009 did not differ from 0 indicating that per capita cumulative and unique contact rates were simply density dependent in virtual landscapes table a2 supplementary material overall the density of per capita contact rates was higher in forests anthropogenic areas and cornfields ranked from highest to lowest than in wetlands crops or open uncultivated areas during both day and night fig 2 and a1 supplementary material per capita cumulative contact rates were observed at their highest densities in forests and anthropogenic areas during the day especially in landscapes with a low proportion of forests 7 and high or low landscape connectivity by agricultural corridors respectively fig 2 we observed differences between spatial distributions of per capita unique and cumulative contact rates for example when landscapes were poorly connected by agricultural corridors or contained a high proportion of forests 28 the density of per capita cumulative contact rates was highest in anthropogenic areas during the day fig 2 under the same conditions however per capita unique contact rates occurred at highest densities in agricultural corridors fig 2 also when landscapes were composed of a high proportion of forests the highest densities of per capita cumulative contact rates were observed in cornfields during the night fig a1 supplementary material in contrast under the same conditions the density of per capita unique contact rates was highest in agricultural corridors fig a1 supplementary material we observed effects of landscape connectivity on the density of per capita contact rates that depended upon land cover types and the proportion of forests the spatial patterns in the density of per capita contact rates did not differ between day fig 3 and night fig a2 supplementary material we provide an example for each of the three trends first the density of per capita cumulative contact rates in forests increased with connectivity of forests by agricultural corridors and this increase was steeper in landscapes with a low rather than a high proportion of forests fig 3 second the density of per capita contact rates in cornfields decreased with connectivity of cornfields by agricultural corridors fig 3 at low connectivity of cornfields per capita contact rates occurred at highest densities in landscapes that were composed of a high rather than a low proportion of forests third connectivity of anthropogenic areas by agricultural corridors had a convex quadratic relationship with the density of per capita contact rates in anthropogenic areas with highest densities of per capita contact rates being observed in landscapes that were poorly or highly connected by agricultural corridors and comprised of a relatively small proportion of forests fig 3 this trend was also observed for the per capita unique contact rates in forests fig 3 3 4 uncertainty and sensitivity analyses to assess the variability in per capita contact rates we performed an uncertainty analysis by exploring the distributions of per capita cumulative and unique contact rates fig d3 supplementary material we found a mean standard deviation of 1400 465 575 824 per capita cumulative contacts and 11 949 2 118 per capita unique contacts among simulated raccoons our contact rates seem plausible compared to independent data sets derived from field estimates for example robert et al 2012 reported between 7 and 16 383 contacts 4 332 1 051 mean standard error among 15 adult female raccoons over one year in mont orford provincial park qu√©bec canada another study of robert et al 2013 mentioned a mean of 9799 contacts between raccoons 2376 standard error over 2 years we then performed a sensitivity analysis to determine which input parameters were responsible for the variability in per capita cumulative and unique contact rates in particular we calculated prccs to characterize the association between per capita contact rates cumulative and unique and each Œ≤ coefficient of empirical submodels that define residence time in high quality polygons and choice of the next high quality polygon fig d4 supplementary material the Œ≤ anthropogenic and Œ≤ log area coefficients of the submodel defining the choice of the next polygon from cornfield were positively and moderately correlated with the per capita cumulative contact rates prccs between 0 3 and 0 5 fig d4 supplementary material while the Œ≤ anthropogenic Œ≤ log cost 1 and Œ≤ forest log residence coefficients of the submodel describing the choice of the next polygon from cornfield were positively and moderately associated with the per capita unique contact rates prccs between 0 3 and 0 5 fig d4 supplementary material the Œ≤ log area coefficient was positively and strongly correlated with the per capita unique contact rates prcc 0 7 fig d4 supplementary material these results suggest that raccoon movements from cornfields towards large habitat polygons or anthropogenic areas should promote high per capita cumulative and unique contact rates when raccoons leave cornfields per capita unique contact rates would be more likely to occur in isolated habitat polygons i e not easily accessible or in forests as raccoons spend an increasing amount of time in cornfields inversely negative correlations with the per capita cumulative contact rates were observed for the Œ≤ log area Œ≤ forest log area Œ≤ corn log area and Œ≤ wetland day coefficients of the submodel defining residence time within polygons and for the Œ≤ corn coefficient of the submodel describing the choice of the next polygon from forest however these correlations were moderate prccs between 0 5 and 0 2 fig d4 supplementary material these results suggest that per capita cumulative contact rates should decrease when raccoons spend an increasing amount of time in large forest or cornfield polygons or in wetlands during the day raccoon movements from forests towards cornfields should also promote low per capita cumulative contact rates for the other Œ≤ coefficients their correlations with the per capita contact rates were not significantly different from zero 3 5 model validation simulated raccoons in the real landscapes were able to reproduce some behaviors of radio collared raccoons in particular home range sizes between radio collared 86 06 12 42 ha mean standard error and simulated 76 56 11 51 ha raccoons were not significantly different two sample t test t 0 561 df 21 874 p 580 fig e1 supplementary material similarly the proportion of returns within high quality habitat polygons did not differ between radio collared 0 38 0 13 and simulated 0 37 0 21 raccoons two sample t test t 0 011 df 3 351 p 992 fig e2 supplementary material 4 discussion our spatially explicit individual based model illustrates that contact patterns are driven by functional connectivity which in turn varies with conspecific density and landscape physiognomy a sensitivity analysis revealed that movement decisions between habitat polygons based on residence time within polygons and choice of the next polygon could affect per capita contact rates quantifying variability in contact rates among hosts and across space is fundamental to implementing cost effective interventions that can successfully limit infectious disease spread paull et al 2011 white et al 2017 our study contributes in that respect by characterizing three general patterns in per capita contact rates that emerge naturally from empirical movement rules derived from radio collared raccoons first we observed disparity in contact rates among simulated raccoons with a minority of individuals being responsible for a large number of the contacts among conspecifics second per capita contact rates increased linearly with conspecific density indicating that raccoon rabies transmission should be density dependent rather than frequency dependent under most conditions third depending upon land cover types and landscape composition functional connectivity had a broad range of effects on the density of per capita contact rates among hosts from increasing to decreasing densities of contact rates all these patterns emerged from simple empirical movement rules derived from the interplay between the movement of radio collared raccoons and landscape heterogeneity 4 1 space use behavior of radio collared raccoons radio collared raccoons were more likely to choose forests as their next destination when they were not situated in forests in particular raccoons should achieve relatively high fitness by selecting areas that are comprised of a high proportion of forests in landscapes containing few conspecifics tardy et al 2015 forests offer large quantities of resources such as den sites e g tree cavities and food items e g small mammals birds insects chamberlain et al 2003 wilson and nielsen 2007 when leaving a forest raccoons selectively moved to a cornfield under high conspecific densities in agriculturally fragmented landscapes raccoons select cornfields in areas with high densities of corn forest edges and a low proportion of cornfields tardy et al 2014 presumably to benefit from the proximity and abundance of high quality food that is available in cornfields and the safety provided by forest cover houle et al 2011 we further found that radio collared raccoons were generally more likely to transit to large polygons and to use paths with low movement costs i e selection for least cost paths to proceed towards their next destination these results support previous studies showing that raccoons can maintain low costs of travel porter et al 2015 and short movement distances cullingham et al 2008 dharmarajan et al 2009 when resources are readily available which suggest that this species can occupy relatively small home ranges bozek et al 2007 prange et al 2004 our empirical models also revealed that radio collared raccoons had longer residence times in anthropogenic areas compared to other land cover types particularly during the day when they are less active in urbanized landscapes raccoons take advantage of residential areas that provide them with both abundant food sources e g human food garbage and resting dens e g burrows under buildings during the day hadidian et al 1991 hoffmann and gottschang 1977 the sensitivity analysis identified residence time within habitat polygons and choice of the next polygon as important ecological processes in assessing per capita contact rates in particular the land cover type of polygons size of polygons and time period can be critical factors affecting the magnitude of contact rates among raccoons and the influence of these factors should vary as a function of contact types cumulative or unique for example per capita cumulative and unique contact rates would be abundant in large habitat polygons or in anthropogenic areas when raccoons move from cornfields in landscapes however per capita cumulative contact rates would be low when raccoons spend an increasing amount of time in large habitat polygons forest or cornfield polygons or in wetlands during the day while raccoon movements from forests towards cornfields could promote low per capita cumulative contact rates their movements from cornfields towards forests could increase per capita unique contact rates in particular when raccoons display long residence times in cornfields 4 2 contact heterogeneity among simulated raccoons our simulations showed that given the empirical movement rules only a small portion of a raccoon population should be responsible for a large number of unique contacts for example we found that in virtual landscapes with a maximal density of 10 raccoons km¬≤ the top 20 of simulated raccoons that had the highest number of unique contacts accounted for more 40 of all unique contacts at high conspecific densities in the landscape the contact dynamics of raccoons should thus approach the 20 80 rule which is based on the common observation that 20 of infected hosts i e those generating the highest number of secondary cases are commonly responsible for at least 80 of transmission events within host pathogen systems woolhouse et al 1997 this pattern has been observed for vector borne diseases such as tick borne encephalitis perkins et al 2003 and west nile virus kilpatrick et al 2006 as well as for diseases transmitted by direct contact such as sin nombre virus clay et al 2009 pathogen transmission heterogeneity among hosts is often due to variation in their exposure and susceptibility to pathogens and in turn these characteristics are affected by age sex body condition behavior or genetics of hosts vanderwaal and ezenwa 2016 wilson et al 2002 in our case contact heterogeneity emerges in virtual landscapes from simulated raccoons that all obey the same movement rules while simulated raccoons started at random locations their subsequent use of the landscape was such that some simulated individuals exhibited high home range overlap with others thereby leading to high rates of unique contacts given that home range size of simulated raccoons was similar to that of radio collared raccoons our simulations demonstrate that simple movement rules in heterogeneous landscapes combined with stochasticity in conspecific distributions are sufficient to result in strong heterogeneity of the contribution of individual hosts to infectious disease transmission 4 3 spatial heterogeneity in contact rates in host pathogen systems the effects of habitat fragmentation on the dynamics of infectious diseases have been studied theoretically from metapopulation models gog et al 2002 hess 1996 mccallum and dobson 2002 which has led to different predictions according to the mode of pathogen transmission for example if the transmission rate depends upon the proportion or frequency of infected hosts fragmentation should have no direct effect on transmission within habitat polygons as this mode of transmission assumes that hosts have the same number of contacts regardless of individual density within polygons mccallum and dobson 2002 alternatively if the transmission rate is dependent upon the density of infected hosts fragmentation should increase transmission within habitat polygons by reducing animal movements between polygons hess 1996 mccallum and dobson 2002 in our simulation study the mode of transmission was density dependent rather than frequency dependent with per capita contact rates increasing linearly with conspecific density in most virtual landscapes the simulations were based on a range of 0 1 to 10 simulated raccoons km¬≤ which overlaps the observed range of 0 5 to 13 9 raccoons km¬≤ mean 5 raccoons km¬≤ that has been reported for the mont√©r√©gie and estrie regions of southern qu√©bec mass√© 2010 density dependent transmission is common in host pathogen systems anderson et al 1981 berthier et al 2000 brown and brown 2004 unlike frequency dependent models thrall et al 1995 density dependent models predict the existence of a host density threshold below which infectious pathogens cannot invade or persist in a population of susceptible hosts and above which the pathogens can spread anderson et al 1981 getz and pickering 1983 accordingly measures that can result in a decrease in population density e g using culling or sterilization techniques should be effective at reducing the risk of raccoon rabies spread our simulations revealed that the density of per capita contact rates tended to be lower in landscapes that were largely comprised of forests 28 because the isolation of forest polygons is lower in landscapes with high rather than low forest cover short distances between forest polygons decreased the use of agricultural corridors in landscapes that were largely comprised of forests thus increasing forest cover in landscapes that are highly connected by agricultural corridors should decrease the positive effect of functional connectivity on the density of per capita contact rates we also found that the highest densities of per capita cumulative contact rates should occur in highly connected forest polygons and in poorly connected anthropogenic areas during the day especially in landscapes containing few forests 7 consistently forests and anthropogenic areas were strongly selected by radio collared raccoons while focusing control interventions on these two land cover types might seem a cost effective approach for reducing the risk of rabies spread the efficiency of these interventions can strongly vary as a function of landscape physiognomy in particular our study shows that contact rates greatly depend upon 1 whether we consider unique or cumulative contacts and 2 landscape composition and functional connectivity 4 3 1 spatial distribution of cumulative versus unique contact rates we found large differences between areas where cumulative and unique contact rates occurred at highest densities for example when landscapes were poorly connected by agricultural corridors or contained a high proportion of forests per capita cumulative contact rates were observed at highest densities during the day in anthropogenic areas under the same conditions however per capita unique contact rates were the most abundant in agricultural corridors when landscapes were composed of a high forest proportion the density of per capita cumulative contact rates also was highest in cornfields during the night under the same conditions the density of per capita unique contact rates was highest in agricultural corridors when pathogen transmission is density dependent as is expected for raccoon rabies according to our simulations per capita cumulative contact rates influence the probability of transmitting or contracting infectious pathogens habib et al 2011 ji et al 2005 whereas per capita unique contact rates inform on the risk for superspreading events clay et al 2009 thus forests and anthropogenic areas would be potential hotspots for raccoon rabies transmission among individuals whereas agricultural corridors would increase the risk of superspreading events however in landscapes that are highly connected by agricultural corridors but with 14 of forests superspreading events are more likely to occur in forests than in agricultural corridors despite some variation among virtual landscapes our ibm indicates that hotspots are unlikely to be found in crops wetlands and open areas 4 3 2 landscape composition and functional connectivity influence contact rates our study demonstrates how functional connectivity can influence the density of per capita contact rates within a given land cover type for example when conspecific density was at least 1 individual km¬≤ the density of per capita cumulative contact rates increased in forest polygons as they became more strongly connected by agricultural corridors fig 3 this increase was even steeper in landscapes with a low proportion of forests agricultural corridors largely determined the functional connectivity in virtual landscapes which reflected our field observations on radio collared raccoons in agriculturally fragmented landscapes corridors can intensify the use of habitat polygons either by creating dispersal conduits that facilitate animal movement between isolated habitat polygons levey et al 2005 tewksbury et al 2002 or by acting as drift fences that intercept animals moving through the matrix and reorienting them to connected polygons fried et al 2005 haddad and baum 1999 accordingly when moving to forest polygons in landscapes containing a small proportion of forests simulated raccoons used agricultural corridors because cost values of moving in agricultural corridors were lower compared to other land cover types i e crops open areas and water bodies the presence of numerous corridors increased accessibility to forest polygons and when there were relatively few of those polygons individuals ended up experiencing high densities of contacts in forests as the proportion of forests increased in the landscape however individuals became spread among more forest polygons and their encounter rate decreased under these conditions functional connectivity tended to only have a weak effect on contact rates especially at low host densities because home ranges were broadly distributed in the landscape unlike cumulative contacts the density of per capita unique contact rates in forest polygons varied following a convex quadratic relationship with forest connectivity by agricultural corridors in landscapes that were comprised of a small proportion of forests the density of per capita unique contact rates declined as forest connectivity increased from low to intermediate levels average range 3 8 corridors see fig 3 and then was augmented with further increases in forest connectivity a similar pattern was detected in anthropogenic areas with per capita contact rates being lowest in landscapes where these areas were connected by an average of 3 5 agricultural corridors rather than by fewer or more corridors the reduction of connectivity decreased the movement of simulated raccoons between polygons which led to small and overlapping home ranges in the landscape in particular simulated raccoons returned to previously visited polygons because their movements were more costly in landscapes with a low rather than a high connectivity by agricultural corridors the sensitivity analysis showed that the isolation of habitat polygons can affect contact rates for some species living in highly isolated habitat polygons the surrounding matrix can be perceived as hostile and individuals may become reluctant to move away from polygons fortin and arnold 1997 krebs et al 1969 this situation can lead to local higher densities in the polygons of landscapes that are poorly connected by agricultural corridors than in those of highly connected landscapes where higher movement rates would result in a stronger use of the matrix adler and levins 1994 bayne and hobson 1998 when few agricultural corridors were present in the landscape simulated raccoons also used anthropogenic areas to reach their destination polygon because cost values were lower when moving in these areas than in other land cover types especially during the day as the number of agricultural corridors increased in the landscape simulated raccoons started to rely more upon corridors to reach their destination polygon and the density of per capita contact rates in anthropogenic areas declines until these areas become more connected we also observed that the density of per capita contact rates in cornfields decreased with connectivity of cornfields by agricultural corridors when connectivity of cornfields was low per capita contact rates occurred at highest densities in landscapes that were largely comprised of forests given that radio collared raccoons displayed longer residence times in large cornfields a decrease in the number of agricultural corridors should be associated with an increase in residence time this should also result in increased per capita contact rates in cornfields because cornfields tended to be larger in poorly than highly connected landscapes in addition a higher proportion of forests led to more frequent transitions between forests and cornfields thereby increasing the encounter rates of individuals within cornfields overall these few examples show how simple movement rules can interact with landscape properties to create rather complex patterns of spatial heterogeneity in the risk of disease spread such heterogeneity can have strong implications for disease management and prevention 4 4 implication for management of infectious diseases in north america oral vaccine baits that are used to control rabies virus are often distributed over large areas which can generate substantial costs slate et al 2005 to achieve an optimal immunization rate at the lowest cost vaccine bait densities should be distributed as a function of densities of per capita contact rates in the landscape boyer et al 2011 often the predictions regarding the effects of habitat fragmentation on infectious disease dynamics are based on virtual landscapes in which cells are simply classified as low quality or high quality habitats bonnell et al 2010 rees et al 2013 tracey et al 2014 rioux paquette et al 2014 however have emphasized that the identification of habitat specific dispersal routes of rabies spread can help to optimize vaccination interventions we show that the density of contact rates can strongly differ among land cover types depending upon their availability and accessibility and upon the density of conspecifics in the landscape while contact patterns that are observed at low conspecific density could imply that oral vaccine baits should be uniformly distributed across the landscape patterns that are observed at high conspecific density indicate that the efficiency of vaccination strategies depends upon landscape composition and functional connectivity the distribution of oral vaccine baits should focus on anthropogenic areas in landscapes that are poorly connected by agricultural corridors and which contain a high or low proportion of forests in fragmented landscapes that are highly connected by agricultural corridors a high density of baits should be dropped within forests and anthropogenic areas however oral vaccine baits should be more uniformly distributed in the landscapes that are highly connected by agricultural corridors and encompass a high proportion of forests furthermore control interventions should concentrate a large density of oral vaccine baits within agricultural corridors especially in landscapes with a high forest extent and few agricultural corridors using a spatially explicit individual based model our study shows that a broad range of patterns in per capita contact rates can emerge from simulated raccoons that all obey the same and simple empirically derived movement rules this strong spatial heterogeneity in contact rates was driven by conspecific density landscape composition and functional connectivity density dependent models of functional connectivity thus provide a strong basis for building control

25315,in many host pathogen systems pathogen transmission requires close contact between infectious and susceptible hosts the contact rates among individuals depend upon how they move in the landscape because functional connectivity can affect interactions between individuals yet few studies have explored the interplay between contact rates conspecific density and functional connectivity using a spatially explicit individual based model we investigated how empirical movement rules translate into spatial patterns of contact rates among disease hosts in complex landscapes we developed dynamic models of functional connectivity by characterizing movement behaviors of radio collared raccoons which are the main hosts of the raccoon rabies virus on this basis we simulated space use dynamics of raccoons in virtual landscapes varying in conspecific density forest availability and landscape connectivity we then characterized spatial patterns in the density of per capita contact rates of simulated raccoons radio collared raccoons were more likely to choose large habitat patches that were reached by traveling along least cost paths and had relatively long residence times in anthropogenic areas especially during daytime these movement rules that were applied to simulated raccoons in virtual landscapes revealed three key patterns in contact rates first few simulated raccoons were responsible for most contacts between individuals a pattern that emerged even though all simulated raccoons obeyed the same movement rules second per capita contact rates increased linearly with individual density under most conditions which indicates that raccoon rabies transmission should be density dependent rather than frequency dependent third functional connectivity created a broad range of patterns in the density of per capita contact rates from decreasing to increasing values depending upon the availability of land cover types overall the contacts between hosts tended to occur at highest densities in forests anthropogenic areas and agricultural corridors we show that complex patterns of contact rates can emerge from simple empirical movement rules and therefore can be key drivers of disease spread dynamics the strong spatial heterogeneity observed in contact rates implies that the effectiveness of particular control interventions can strongly vary depending upon host density landscape composition and functional connectivity this study provides key functional relationships for tailoring interventions to changes in local conditions keywords animal movement contact rate landscape connectivity individual based model infectious disease management raccoon 1 introduction the contact rate among individual hosts is a fundamental component for predicting the dynamics of infectious disease spread in wild populations and thus for developing cost effective disease control strategies craft 2015 white et al 2017 in particular the pathogen transmission rate depends upon the rate at which an individual host comes into contact with another individual and the probability that such contact is infectious begon et al 2002 simple mathematical formulations of disease transmission dynamics mccallum et al 2001 predict that contact rates either increase linearly with individual density in a population resulting in density dependent transmission anderson and may 1979 may and anderson 1979 or are constant irrespective of individual density leading frequency dependent transmission thrall et al 1993 thrall et al 1995 empirical studies have shown however that contact rates could follow a nonlinear relationship in which contact rates increase with individual density but become saturated at high density habib et al 2011 ji et al 2005 ramsey et al 2002 implying that pathogen transmission dynamics in wildlife often lie between extreme assumptions of density dependent and frequency dependent transmission smith et al 2009 although previous research has shown that this nonlinearity could be driven by changes in host behavior that is associated with social group ranges habib et al 2011 or individual home ranges ramsey et al 2002 the role of spatial heterogeneity in shaping such patterns of disease transmission remains unclear to optimize control interventions quantifying variation in contact rates among individual hosts and across space is needed paull et al 2011 some individuals in the landscape can have a disproportionately high number of contacts compared to the mean which can cause superspreading events over large scales lloyd smith et al 2005 for example woolhouse et al 1997 proposed the 20 80 rule wherein 20 of infected hosts known as superspreaders are responsible for 80 of infection transmission in host pathogen systems although physiology and social behavior of individual hosts have been recognized as being significant sources of variation in contact rates by affecting individual susceptibility and competence vanderwaal and ezenwa 2016 wilson et al 2002 few studies have assessed the interplay between host contact rates and landscape physiognomy habib et al 2011 kj√¶r et al 2008 knowledge of the interactions between contact rates and landscape characteristics can directly inform on the likely locations of hotspots for pathogen transmission in human fragmented landscapes maintaining connectivity between habitat patches is important for biodiversity conservation fahrig and merriam 1985 but could also enhance spread and transmission of infectious diseases for example in the great plains of north america canada and usa sylvatic plague yersinia pestis is more likely to spread among colonies of black tailed prairie dogs cynomys ludovicianus that are spatially close together and located in close proximity to dispersal corridors collinge et al 2005 johnson et al 2011 landscape connectivity can affect disease transmission and spread because it determines the spatial dynamics of animal movement and the contact risk among potential hosts meentemeyer et al 2012 in landscapes where high quality habitat patches can be delimited over space mobile animals must decide how long to remain within a patch where to go next and how to get there these decisions can strongly depend upon the structural and functional connectivity of the landscape courbin et al 2014 dancose et al 2010 structural connectivity describes the physical links between habitat patches such as the euclidean distance between them kindlmann and burel 2008 tischendorf and fahrig 2000 animals however do not necessary navigate between high quality patches along straight paths functional connectivity considers the adjustment of animal movements to the characteristics of the surrounding matrix taylor et al 1993 although such fine scale movements can directly alter the contact rates between individual hosts koen et al 2017 tracey et al 2014 only a few studies of infectious disease dynamics have considered functional connectivity nobert et al 2016 rees et al 2013 also most of them provide predictions of disease occurrence while the spatial distributions of infectious diseases depend crucially upon contact mechanisms between individual hosts arthur et al 2017 white et al 2017 neglecting the role of contacts could affect our understanding of pathogen transmission and spread processes in heterogeneous landscapes such that a modeling tool that would allow incorporating functional connectivity should improve the ability to anticipate the spatial dynamics of infectious diseases in wildlife populations spatially explicit individual based models ibms provide a modeling framework to simulate complex dynamic systems where emergent phenomena can be observed matthews et al 2007 railsback 2001 in spatially explicit ibms individuals are represented as autonomous entities that interact with their environment and other individuals grimm and railsback 2005 the advantage of spatially explicit ibms is that they can integrate stochastic and spatially dependent processes at the individual level that are difficult to quantify empirically deangelis and mooij 2005 consequently spatially explicit ibms have been largely used for modeling animal movement in heterogeneous landscapes e g bauduin et al 2016 kramer schadt et al 2004 palmer et al 2011 tracey et al 2014 recently marrotte et al 2017 have associated host movement behavior with a directional measure of landscape connectivity based on movement costs to assess contact probability between white footed mice that are important reservoir hosts of lyme bacteria prediction of contact rates however should also require modeling inter patch movement decisions that consider residence time within habitat patches and choice of the next patch the current lack of information on the functional link between contact rates conspecific density and landscape connectivity impedes the development of cost effective disease control strategies in this study we built a spatially explicit ibm to assess how changes in conspecific density landscape composition and functional connectivity alter contact rates between individual hosts to do this we integrated components of space use in the ibm by estimating from empirical data residence time within high quality habitat patches and choice of the next high quality patch and by simulating intra and inter patch movements in different virtual landscapes that differed in habitat availability and connectivity the model has been constructed for raccoons procyon lotor l one of the main hosts of the raccoon rabies virus variant in north america finnegan et al 2002 2 materials and methods we developed a spatially explicit ibm that integrates three main components 1 virtual landscapes 2 simulated individuals representing raccoons and 3 empirical rules of space use that are used by the simulated individuals to move across the virtual landscapes the ibm was implemented in netlogo version 5 0 5 wilensky 1999 2 1 components of the ibm 2 1 1 virtual landscapes to assess the influence of changes in landscape composition and connectivity on per capita contact rates among individual hosts we simulated the movement of raccoons in 15 virtual landscapes differing in terms of forest proportion and spatial configuration of agricultural corridors in landscapes dominated by forest patches and agricultural fields spatial distribution of raccoons is closely linked to forest cover and agricultural corridors tardy et al 2015 2014 in particular raccoons use corridors to move between habitat patches beasley et al 2007 the spatial scales used for building virtual landscapes were defined from those of agriculturally fragmented landscapes in the mont√©r√©gie region of southern qu√©bec canada where 104 rabies cases had been reported between 2006 and 2009 rees et al 2011 the virtual landscapes were represented as raster grids of 1000 1000 cells and had an extent of 100 km¬≤ we defined cells of 10 10 m which corresponds to the minimal width of agricultural corridors in the mont√©r√©gie landscapes tardy et al 2014 the virtual landscapes were comprised of eight land cover types that are typical of agriculturally fragmented landscapes forests corn maize fields other crops including vegetable and fruit crops together with cereal fields such as oat wheat soybean hay and barley open uncultivated areas water bodies lakes wetlands riparian areas around lakes anthropogenic areas and agricultural corridors fig b1 supplementary material the set of adjacent cells that were composed of the same land cover type defined a habitat polygon each cell was identified by its centroid and was characterized by state variables referring to habitat polygons to which they belonged i e the unique id number of the polygon size of the polygon and movement cost to model the movement of raccoons between habitat polygons in the virtual landscapes we used a resistance surface by applying a cost value of movement at each land cover type see section 2 2 4 for details the boundaries of virtual landscapes acted as reflective barriers so that all movements of simulated raccoons occurred within the landscapes to reduce the boundary effects on per capita contact rates these latter were measured within the virtual landscapes that excluded the two border rows using a grid pattern to represent agricultural corridors we defined two systematic configurations of corridors by varying the length width ratio of grid squares ratio 1 1 i e length width 20 20 cells which results in a grid of 50 50 squares and ratio 2 1 i e length width 20 10 cells which results in a grid of 50 100 squares fig b2 supplementary material according to such configurations the agricultural corridors were linear strips of 1 unit width i e 10 m connecting habitat polygons the sizes of agricultural fields resulting from the different corridor configurations i e 20 20 cells for 1 1 ratio and 20 10 cells for 2 1 ratio corresponded to those observed in the mont√©r√©gie region according to satellite images that had been acquired in 2011 by the financi√®re agricole du qu√©bec by using the 1 1 ratio as the reference grid we also drew three random configurations of agricultural corridors by randomly removing 25 50 and 75 of square sides in the grid fig b2 supplementary material finally the systematic and random configurations of agricultural corridors resulted in different levels of landscape connectivity in our study connectivity was defined as the average number of agricultural corridors connecting polygons of a given land cover type in the virtual landscapes similar to the measure of node degree in a network rayfield et al 2010 consequently the 75 random configuration corresponded to the lowest level of landscape connectivity a polygon being connected on average by 1 38 corridors and the 2 1 ratio systematic configuration was associated with the highest level of landscape connectivity a polygon being connected on average by 4 23 corridors in addition we included three levels of forest proportion 0 7 0 14 and 0 28 the proportion of 0 14 corresponded to the mean proportion of forests that is observed in the mont√©r√©gie region the sizes of forests 11 29 ha anthropogenic areas 3 25 ha wetlands 0 56 ha and water bodies 0 25 ha did not change between the virtual landscapes and were estimated from 1 15 000 scale aerial photographs of the mont√©r√©gie region that had been taken in 1999 by the minist√®re des ressources naturelles et de la faune quebec ministry of natural resources and wildlife while the proportion of anthropogenic areas 0 08 wetlands 0 03 and water bodies 0 02 remained constant in the virtual landscapes variation in the proportions of cornfields crops and open uncultivated areas resulted from gradients in the forest proportion and spatial configuration of agricultural corridors fig b3 supplementary material 2 1 2 simulated individuals simulated individuals were characterized by a unique id number coordinates of the cell centroid and a unique id number of the habitat polygon where they were located during simulation together with departure and arrival time in the habitat polygon the individuals were also defined by state variables that were linked to the components of space use i e residence time within the habitat polygon unique id number of the next polygon that would be visited and the list of cells that would be traversed to go to the next polygon to assess the influence of changes in conspecific density on per capita contact rates among individual hosts we varied four levels of density of simulated raccoons in each virtual landscape 0 1 1 5 and 10 raccoons km¬≤ 2 2 empirical rules of space use to model mechanisms of functional connectivity land cover types of virtural landscapes were summarized as high quality habitat polygons and the habitat matrix dancose et al 2010 thus we considered polygons of forests cornfields anthropogenic areas and wetlands as high quality polygons because these land cover types are rich in resources and are strongly selected by raccoons tardy et al 2014 agricultural corridors and the other land cover types i e crops open uncultivated areas and lakes represented the matrix as these land cover types either are used by raccoons to move within the landscape or are avoided tardy et al 2014 we built four submodels to integrate the components of space use in the ibm 1 residence time in the high quality polygons 2 movement within the high quality polygons 3 choice of the next high quality polygon and 4 movement between the high quality polygons the parameters that were included in the submodels were estimated from empirical data these data were obtained through global positioning system gps based tracking of 54 raccoons from 2009 to 2011 in two areas of southern qu√©bec canada the first area was located in the mont√©r√©gie region 45 23 23 n 73 06 05 w and the second in the estrie region 45 28 54 n 71 40 05 w both areas were spatially near and had habitat characteristics that were similar to the areas where rabid raccoons had been detected more details on capture procedure and telemetry data of raccoons are given in tardy et al 2014 section monitoring of habitat selection by raccoons to build our submodels we considered gps locations with 2 h relocation interval 2 2 1 residence time in high quality polygons in the ibm each simulated raccoon moved within a high quality polygon until a predetermined residence time in the polygon is exceeded fig 1 from sequences of gps locations 2 h relocation interval we assessed habitat characteristics that influence average time in hours spent by raccoons in the high quality polygons as proposed by bastille rousseau et al 2011 residence time was defined as the duration from the arrival of individuals to their departure from a polygon and was estimated by considering the number of successive gps locations along parts of the movement path entering and leaving a polygon to correct for missing gps locations 48 often caused by forest cover interference each location was adjusted by a weighting factor frair et al 2010 that was defined by 1 elapsed time in hours between the location at time t and the location at time t 1 the weighting factor for the first location of each radio collared raccoon was equal to 0 the weighting factor was varied between 0 and 1 in this way the locations that were close in time had a greater influence in the estimation of model parameters to estimate residence time as a function of habitat characteristics we built a linear mixed effects model using a gaussian distribution with log transformed residence time as the dependent variable the model included a random intercept for individual nested within year to account for the hierarchical structure of the data and the unbalanced number of observations among raccoons together with to accommodate for non independence of observations of the same raccoon within a given year gillies et al 2006 the linear mixed effects model had the following general structure 1 y i k t x Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ land cover x land cover i k t Œ≤ area x area i k t Œ≤ land cover area x land cover i k t x area i k t Œ≤ land cover time x land cover i k t x time i k t Œ≥ 0 k t where y i k t x represents the log transformed residence time in high quality polygon i for raccoon k within year t Œ≤ 0 is the mean intercept Œ≤ are coefficients for covariates x and Œ≥ 0 k t is the random intercept associated with raccoon k nested within year t the term x land cover i k t corresponds to the land cover type i e forest cornfield anthropogenic area or wetland of high quality polygon i for raccoon k within year t coded as a dichotomous covariate the term x area i k t is the log transformed area in hectares of high quality polygon i for raccoon k within year t this covariate was also standardized by subtracting its means and dividing by its standard deviation to improve model convergence and to reduce collinearity between interaction terms quinn and keough 2002 we dropped the wetland area interaction because it caused multicollinearity variance inflation factor 10 dormann et al 2013 the term x time i k t represents either the day coded as 1 or night coded as 0 period during which raccoon k within year t is in high quality polygon i the night period extended from the beginning of dusk sunset 1h until the end of dawn sunrise 1h whereas the day period went from the end of dawn until the beginning of dusk data obtained from national research council canada and available at http www nrc cnrc gc ca eng services sunrise we considered the time period in the model because raccoons tend to rest at day and be active during the night gehrt 2003 like forester et al 2009 we included this covariate as an interaction term to capture variation in the residence times during the time period night and day further we added a variance structure to stabilize residual heteroscedasticity by allowing for variance increases or decreases with predicted values pinheiro and bates 2000 normality of random effects and residuals were respected the model estimates were computed with the package nlme of r statistical software version 3 3 1 r development core team 2014 2 2 2 movement within high quality polygons when the predetermined residence time in the high quality polygon was not exceeded fig 1 the movement of a simulated raccoon within the polygon was modeled as a correlated random walk turchin 1998 we randomly selected random steps from the distribution of turning angles i e a measure of directionality between the current and previous step that is ranged from 0 to 360 of radio collared raccoons that was specific to each high quality land cover type and time period day 179 80 mean standard deviation for forests 193 83 for cornfields 174 84 for anthropogenic areas 177 70 for wetlands night 180 104 for forests 179 102 for cornfields 171 95 for anthropogenic areas 191 103 for wetlands at each time step a simulated raccoon randomly moved into one of eight adjacent cells from their current cell 2 2 3 choice of the next high quality polygon once a simulated raccoon left a high quality polygon i e when the predetermined residence time in the high quality polygon was exceeded the raccoon had to choose which high quality polygon to visit next fig 1 we first calculated the relative probability of use of all available high quality polygons that were situated within a 2 km buffer around the simulated raccoon and then the simulated raccoon moved to the polygon with the highest relative probability of use the probabilities that were considered in the ibm were determined from an empirical model we used sequences of gps locations 2 h relocation interval from radio collared raccoons to characterize their successive use of high quality polygons following the approach proposed by dancose et al 2010 we identified the high quality polygons that contained at least one gps location i e the source polygons and the associated high quality polygons that were visited next i e the destination polygons each destination polygon was then matched with 10 random high quality polygons that were selected within a 2 km radius of the source polygon to estimate availability of landscape attributes the 2 km buffer encompassed 99 of distances between the source and destination polygons the choice of the number of random samples habitat polygons in our case generally depends on the research question and computational limitations but a large sample number is not always necessary to obtain robust estimates of model coefficients for example a high number of random samples can be appropriate to characterize the availability of landscape attributes that are rare fortin et al 2005 by contrast the size of random samples can be small with no impact on coefficient estimation considering a case control design thurfjell et al 2014 addressing the issues associated with step selection functions that are based on conditional logistic regression approaches thurfjell et al 2014 suggest that a small number of random samples i e random steps or even one random sample can be sufficient to analyze animal movement we contrasted habitat characteristics of the destination score 1 and associated random score 0 polygons by using conditional logistic regressions in which each stratum included one destination polygon and its 10 associated random polygons dancose et al 2010 fortin et al 2005 all strata for a given radio collared raccoon nested within a given year were assigned to a unique cluster to obtain robust standard errors fortin et al 2005 the model had the following general structure 2 w j k t x exp Œ≤ land cover x land cover j k t Œ≤ area x area j k t Œ≤ cost x cost i j k t Œ≤ land cover residence x land cover j k t x residence i k t where w j k t x represents the relative probability of use of destination or random polygon j for raccoon k within year t and Œ≤ are coefficients for covariates x the term x land cover j k t corresponds to the land cover type i e forest cornfield anthropogenic area or wetland of destination or random polygon j for raccoon k within year t coded as a dichotomous covariate the term x area j k t is the log transformed area in hectares of destination or random polygon j for raccoon k within year t we dropped the wetland area interaction because it caused multicollinearity variance inflation factor 10 dormann et al 2013 the term x cost i j k t is the log transformed cost of the least cost path between source polygon i in which raccoon k within year t is located and destination or random polygon j a least cost path lcp represents the most likely travel route that an individual should follow to reach its destination polygon theobald 2006 porter et al 2015 showed that using lcps could be adequate to predict raccoon movement between habitat polygons to build lcps we defined a resistance surface that is based on relative costs of moving through different land cover types in the landscape zeller et al 2012 as the cost values are often assigned to cells on a raster map douglas 1994 we converted vector maps of the mont√©r√©gie and estrie study areas into raster maps at a spatial resolution of 10 m following the approach proposed by chetkiewicz and boyce 2009 the resistance surface was generated by taking the inverse of the odds ratio 1 exp selection coefficient from the land cover selection model in tardy et al 2014 for night and day each land cover type was thus assigned to a cost value during nighttime or daytime table a1 in supplementary material the lcp cost was then calculated by summing the cost value of each landscape cell along the radio collared raccoon path adriaensen et al 2003 the term x residence i k t is the log transformed residence time in hours in source polygon i in which raccoon k within year t is located see the section 2 2 1 for details this covariate was not included as a simple effect in the model but as an interaction term because each destination polygon and its 10 associated random polygons were assigned to the same log transformed residence time as for the group size effect in fortin et al 2009 we built models for each land cover type of source polygons by using the package clogit of r statistical software version 3 3 1 r development core team 2014 we evaluated model robustness by using 5 fold cross validation that was adapted for case control designs see fortin et al 2009 for details we performed the procedure 100 times to obtain average spearman rank correlations r s for which a high r s indicates high predictive power 2 2 4 movement between high quality polygons once the next high quality polygon was chosen fig 1 the simulated raccoon used the lcp between the cell in which it was located during the simulation and the next high quality polygon to move towards this polygon the procedure for constructing lcps is the same as that used in the section 2 2 3 for each virtual landscape we defined a resistance surface where each land cover type was assigned to a cost value during nighttime or daytime table a1 supplementary material we used the a star search algorithm to find the best lcp between the cell where the simulated raccoon was located during the simulation and all cells situated at the edge of the next high quality polygon hart et al 1968 this algorithm has the advantage to be faster than the dijkstra s algorithm because it reduces the search space of the lcp by considering only the cells that have a greater chance of appearing in the path soltani et al 2002 2 3 simulation experiments the ibm evolved according to discrete three minute time steps we used this temporal scale because preliminary analyses have shown that radio collared raccoons moved at a rate of about 200 m h as also reported by rosatte et al 2010 thus simulated raccoons should take about three minutes to cross a 10 m cell in agriculturally fragmented landscapes in southern qu√©bec corn zea mays l is the main food source of raccoons rivest and bergeron 1981 when it becomes available about 1 august 15 october instead of setting the temporal extent to the entire period of corn maturation we ran our model over four weeks 28 days from 1 august because home range size of radio collared raccoons remained stable during this period fig b4 supplementary material at the beginning of each simulation the time counter and then the cells of the virtual landscape were initialized the time counter started 1 august at 00 00 once the landscape cells were initialized simulated raccoons were randomly placed within a cell within a single time step landscape cells were updated for movement costs cost values for nighttime or daytime and then simulated raccoons moved on a cell and updated their location finally the time counter was updated once all simulated raccoons had made a move simulated raccoons moved independently of each other in all simulations as stochasticity was only included in the placement of simulated raccoons within cells 100 simulation replicates for each virtual landscape including 0 1 raccoon km¬≤ and 15 simulation replicates for each virtual landscape containing 1 5 and 10 raccoons km¬≤ were sufficient to obtain low standard deviations around mean values of per capita contact rates from the ibm we executed a total of 2175 simulations i e 100 replicates 15 virtual landscapes 1 level of conspecific density corresponding to 0 1 raccoon km¬≤ 15 replicates 15 virtual landscapes 3 levels of conspecific density corresponding to 1 5 and 10 raccoons km¬≤ in which each simulated raccoon had 13 441 steps one step was recorded at each three minute time step over 28 days 2 4 analyses of contact data for directly transmitted diseases pathogen transmission depends upon the number of direct contacts per time unit between individual hosts mccallum et al 2001 in the ibm a direct contact between two simulated raccoons happened when both individuals co occurred in the same cell for each virtual landscape and level of conspecific density we computed 1 the number of per capita cumulative contacts i e average number of conspecifics that have been in contact with a given simulated raccoon after all simulation replicates within any given land cover type and time period and 2 the number of per capita unique contacts i e average number of different conspecifics that have been in contact at least once with a given simulated raccoon after all simulation replicates within any given land cover type and time period we considered these two metrics because they provide different information about contact events for example seven contacts for a given simulated raccoon could be distributed as either four contacts with one conspecific and three contacts with another conspecific or one contact with seven different conspecifics while the probability of transmitting pathogens tends to increase when individuals repeatedly contact conspecifics e g creech et al 2012 modeling of unique contacts can be used to characterize superspreading events e g clay et al 2009 finally for each virtual landscape and level of conspecific density we estimated the density of cumulative and unique contact rates per simulated raccoon within any given land cover type and time period by dividing the number of per capita cumulative or unique contacts by the total area occupied by this land cover type in the landscape from per capita contact rates we performed two analyses first we assessed variation in contact rates among simulated raccoons based upon the average frequency distribution of raccoons according to the number of unique contacts observed per individual n 100 simulation replicates for the conspecific density of 0 1 raccoon km¬≤ and n 15 simulation replicates for the conspecific densities of 1 5 and 10 raccoons km¬≤ for each virtual landscape and conspecific density the corrected moment estimate of the parameter k of the negative binomial distribution was used to quantify aggregation in contact rates among individuals elliott 1977 this estimate was calculated from the mean x and variance œÉ 2 of the average frequency distribution of simulated raccoons elliott 1977 wilson et al 2002 k x 2 œÉ 2 n œÉ 2 x where n is the sample size which partially corrects the bias associated with small samples gregory and woolhouse 1993 when k is large 20 the distribution is random whereas when k is near zero the distribution is highly aggregated and follows a negative binomial distribution a host frequency distribution of the number per capita unique contacts that is highly aggregated suggests the presence of heterogeneity in contact patterns with a small portion of hosts supporting the majority of contacts clay et al 2009 using lorenz curves lorenz 1905 and the associated gini coefficient gini 1921 we then quantified inequality in contact rates among simulated raccoons a lorenz curve was built for each virtual landscape containing 5 and 10 simulated raccoons km¬≤ by plotting the cumulative percentage of per capita unique contacts against the cumulative percentage of simulated raccoons also see poulin 1993 for a detailed application in a host parasite system this relationship was used to determine if the contact dynamics of simulated raccoons at high conspecific densities could follow the 20 80 rule of woolhouse et al 1997 the gini coefficient was defined as the area between the lorenz curve and the 45 degree line of equality in contact rates per individual and is ranged from 0 no inequality in per capita contact rates to 1 high inequality in per capita contact rates the lorenz curves with the associated gini coefficient were performed with the package ineq of r statistical software version 3 3 1 r development core team 2014 second we represented 1 the density of per capita cumulative and unique contact rates within each land cover type during day and night as a function of conspecific density for each combination of levels of forest proportion and spatial configuration of agricultural corridors specific to virtual landscapes first set of graphs and 2 the density of per capita cumulative and unique contact rates within forests cornfields and anthropogenic areas during day and night as a function of landscape connectivity for each combination of levels of forest proportion and conspecific density second set of graphs to describe the functional relationships between the contact rates conspecific density and landscape physiognomy for the first set of graphs we used nonlinear least squares regressions to estimate the values of the parameter q which controls the concavity of relationships between per capita contact rates and individual density in a population see eq 2 in smith et al 2009 when q 0 per capita contact rates increase linearly with individual density leading to density dependent transmission and when q 1 per capita contact rates are independent of individual density leading to frequency dependent transmission other values of the parameter q yield nonlinear relationships see fig 2a in smith et al 2009 the models were built by using the package nls of r statistical software version 3 3 1 r development core team 2014 for the second set of graphs we considered the density of per capita cumulative and unique contact rates within forests cornfields and anthropogenic areas because the first set of graphs showed that these land cover types contained a higher density of cumulative and unique contact rates compared to other land cover types see section 3 2 5 uncertainty and sensitivity analyses first we conducted an uncertainty analysis to quantify the variability in contact rates among simulated raccoons given uncertainty in the ibm input parameters second we performed a sensitivity analysis of the ibm to assess the influence of input parameters on the variability in contact rates in particular this analysis helps to identify the input parameters that are the most influential on the model output and proves useful in determining the most important biological processes in the ibm broeke et al 2016 we chose to perform a global sensitivity analysis in which the values of input parameters are varied simultaneously using latin hypercube sampling lhs over large ranges of uncertainty in order to assess the simple and interaction effects of parameters on the model output saltelli et al 2008 as proposed in marino et al 2008 the global sensitivity of our ibm to input parameters was measured from partial rank correlation coefficients prccs that quantify the strength of nonlinear and monotonic relationships between model output and parameters campolongo et al 2000 the prcc values vary between 1 and 1 in particular values close to 1 indicate that the input parameter is positively and very strongly correlated with the model output whereas values close to 1 indicate that there is a strong negative correlation between the parameter and model output marino et al 2008 for the prccs we used the lhs technique that is considered as a more efficient sampling method given that all input value combinations explored cover the full range of parameter space blower and dowlatabadi 1994 mckay et al 1979 in our sensitivity analysis we considered the Œ≤ coefficients of empirical submodels that determine residence time in high quality polygons see the eq 1 in the section 2 2 1 and choice of the next high quality polygon see the eq 2 in the section 2 2 3 as input parameters and the contact rates represented the model output we explored the sensitivity of these submodels given the lack of knowledge about inter patch movement decisions of raccoons the uncertainty ranges of Œ≤ coefficients were estimated from bootstrapping for hierarchical data van der leeden et al 2008 considering the multilevel structure of data using this method we resampled with replacement the two first hierarchical levels of our data i e individual and year levels in the submodels from the highest level so that summary statistic distributions were uncorrelated for the bootstrapping analysis 1500 bootstrap replicates of Œ≤ coefficients were performed because firstly the standard deviations of bootstrap distributions for each coefficient reached an equilibrium level within less than 1500 replications fig d1 supplementary material and secondly nevitt and hancock 2001 suggest that 200 and more bootstrap samples are preferable to obtain robust estimates then we generated input parameter samples using lhs that was drawn from approximate parametric distributions of the bootstrapped Œ≤ coefficients we assumed that the bootstrap sampling distributions of coefficients followed normal distributions for the lhs the original values of Œ≤ coefficients tables 1 and 2 and standard deviations of the distributions of bootstrapped Œ≤ coefficients were used as parameters for the normal distributions based on the recommendations of mckay et al 1979 100 samples were generated from the lhs method satisfying the minimum value of 4k 3 where k is the number of input parameters from one raster map of a real landscape of the mont√©r√©gie region including 5 simulated raccoons km¬≤ fig d2 supplementary material we finally ran the ibm using the set of Œ≤ coefficients obtained from the lhs based on the preferences of modeling tools of thiele et al 2014 we used the packages lhs and sensitivity of r statistical software version 3 3 1 r development core team 2014 to perform the sensitivity analysis carnell 2012 pujol et al 2017 2 6 model validation to validate our ibm we verified that emergent behaviors of simulated raccoons were representative of those of radio collared raccoons we used raster maps of real landscapes in the mont√©r√©gie region fig d2 supplementary material and from these raster maps that had the same spatial resolution as those of virtual landscapes i e size of the study area 100 km¬≤ size of cells 10 10 m we ran our ibm with simulated raccoons that were placed at the centroid of each radio collared raccoon s home range n 12 we compared the home range size and proportion of returns within forests cornfields and anthropogenic areas between radio collared and simulated raccoons home ranges were built by using a brownian bridge movement model that estimates space utilization distributions of animals from their movement trajectories horne et al 2007 3 results 3 1 empirical rules of space use radio collared raccoons spent from 1 to 77 h in individual habitat polygons mean 1 52 h residence time in habitat polygons was higher during the day when raccoons are less active than at night table 1 time spent in anthropogenic areas was four times longer during the day than at night residence time further depended upon polygon size in the landscape with raccoons displaying longer residence times in large than in small cornfields table 1 radio collared raccoons were also more likely to choose habitat polygons that were reached by traveling along a path with relatively low movement costs table 2 except for wetlands raccoons more strongly selected large than small polygons table 2 in addition raccoons leaving a forest polygon were more likely to transit to a cornfield than another forest polygon table 2 when raccoons left cornfields however they avoided ending up again in cornfields and wetlands relative to forests table 2 the probability of transiting from anthropogenic areas to wetlands was lower than the probability of transiting from anthropogenic areas to forests table 2 furthermore raccoons were less likely to move from wetlands to anthropogenic areas than from wetlands to forests table 2 residence time influenced the choice of the next polygon when raccoons were within anthropogenic areas and wetlands the probability that the next visited polygon was an anthropogenic area or cornfield decreased as raccoons spent an increasing amount of time in anthropogenic areas and wetlands respectively table 2 therefore the movement rules were context dependent which created strong spatio temporal variation in path trajectories we used these movement rules in our ibm to assess how landscape physiognomy should influence the contact rates among raccoons 3 2 variability in contact rates among simulated raccoons the per capita unique contact rates varied broadly among simulated raccoons depending upon both conspecific density and landscape characteristics for each combination of levels of forest proportion spatial configuration of agricultural corridors and conspecific density the host frequency distribution of the number per capita unique contacts did not follow a random distribution the distribution was highly aggregated k 20 fig c1 supplementary material suggesting that a minority of simulated raccoons was responsible for a large number of unique contacts in the virtual landscapes for example the top 20 of simulated raccoons that had the highest number of unique contacts in the virtual landscapes with densities of 5 and 10 raccoons km¬≤ accounted for 45 min 43 and max 50 and 43 min 40 and max 47 of all unique contacts respectively table c1 and fig c2 supplementary material the gini coefficients associated with the lorenz curves suggest that inequalities in contact rates exist among simulated raccoons in the virtual landscapes ranges 0 395 0 49 for the conspecific density of 5 simulated raccoons km¬≤ and 0 356 0 458 for the conspecific density of 10 raccoons simulated km¬≤ table c2 supplementary material the percentage of unique contacts produced by the top 20 of simulated raccoons was highest in landscapes that were highly connected by agricultural corridors and contained a low proportion of forests table c1 and fig c2 supplementary material 3 3 relation between contact rates conspecific density and landscape physiognomy in most conditions the parameter q in the contact rate density equation of smith et al 2009 did not differ from 0 indicating that per capita cumulative and unique contact rates were simply density dependent in virtual landscapes table a2 supplementary material overall the density of per capita contact rates was higher in forests anthropogenic areas and cornfields ranked from highest to lowest than in wetlands crops or open uncultivated areas during both day and night fig 2 and a1 supplementary material per capita cumulative contact rates were observed at their highest densities in forests and anthropogenic areas during the day especially in landscapes with a low proportion of forests 7 and high or low landscape connectivity by agricultural corridors respectively fig 2 we observed differences between spatial distributions of per capita unique and cumulative contact rates for example when landscapes were poorly connected by agricultural corridors or contained a high proportion of forests 28 the density of per capita cumulative contact rates was highest in anthropogenic areas during the day fig 2 under the same conditions however per capita unique contact rates occurred at highest densities in agricultural corridors fig 2 also when landscapes were composed of a high proportion of forests the highest densities of per capita cumulative contact rates were observed in cornfields during the night fig a1 supplementary material in contrast under the same conditions the density of per capita unique contact rates was highest in agricultural corridors fig a1 supplementary material we observed effects of landscape connectivity on the density of per capita contact rates that depended upon land cover types and the proportion of forests the spatial patterns in the density of per capita contact rates did not differ between day fig 3 and night fig a2 supplementary material we provide an example for each of the three trends first the density of per capita cumulative contact rates in forests increased with connectivity of forests by agricultural corridors and this increase was steeper in landscapes with a low rather than a high proportion of forests fig 3 second the density of per capita contact rates in cornfields decreased with connectivity of cornfields by agricultural corridors fig 3 at low connectivity of cornfields per capita contact rates occurred at highest densities in landscapes that were composed of a high rather than a low proportion of forests third connectivity of anthropogenic areas by agricultural corridors had a convex quadratic relationship with the density of per capita contact rates in anthropogenic areas with highest densities of per capita contact rates being observed in landscapes that were poorly or highly connected by agricultural corridors and comprised of a relatively small proportion of forests fig 3 this trend was also observed for the per capita unique contact rates in forests fig 3 3 4 uncertainty and sensitivity analyses to assess the variability in per capita contact rates we performed an uncertainty analysis by exploring the distributions of per capita cumulative and unique contact rates fig d3 supplementary material we found a mean standard deviation of 1400 465 575 824 per capita cumulative contacts and 11 949 2 118 per capita unique contacts among simulated raccoons our contact rates seem plausible compared to independent data sets derived from field estimates for example robert et al 2012 reported between 7 and 16 383 contacts 4 332 1 051 mean standard error among 15 adult female raccoons over one year in mont orford provincial park qu√©bec canada another study of robert et al 2013 mentioned a mean of 9799 contacts between raccoons 2376 standard error over 2 years we then performed a sensitivity analysis to determine which input parameters were responsible for the variability in per capita cumulative and unique contact rates in particular we calculated prccs to characterize the association between per capita contact rates cumulative and unique and each Œ≤ coefficient of empirical submodels that define residence time in high quality polygons and choice of the next high quality polygon fig d4 supplementary material the Œ≤ anthropogenic and Œ≤ log area coefficients of the submodel defining the choice of the next polygon from cornfield were positively and moderately correlated with the per capita cumulative contact rates prccs between 0 3 and 0 5 fig d4 supplementary material while the Œ≤ anthropogenic Œ≤ log cost 1 and Œ≤ forest log residence coefficients of the submodel describing the choice of the next polygon from cornfield were positively and moderately associated with the per capita unique contact rates prccs between 0 3 and 0 5 fig d4 supplementary material the Œ≤ log area coefficient was positively and strongly correlated with the per capita unique contact rates prcc 0 7 fig d4 supplementary material these results suggest that raccoon movements from cornfields towards large habitat polygons or anthropogenic areas should promote high per capita cumulative and unique contact rates when raccoons leave cornfields per capita unique contact rates would be more likely to occur in isolated habitat polygons i e not easily accessible or in forests as raccoons spend an increasing amount of time in cornfields inversely negative correlations with the per capita cumulative contact rates were observed for the Œ≤ log area Œ≤ forest log area Œ≤ corn log area and Œ≤ wetland day coefficients of the submodel defining residence time within polygons and for the Œ≤ corn coefficient of the submodel describing the choice of the next polygon from forest however these correlations were moderate prccs between 0 5 and 0 2 fig d4 supplementary material these results suggest that per capita cumulative contact rates should decrease when raccoons spend an increasing amount of time in large forest or cornfield polygons or in wetlands during the day raccoon movements from forests towards cornfields should also promote low per capita cumulative contact rates for the other Œ≤ coefficients their correlations with the per capita contact rates were not significantly different from zero 3 5 model validation simulated raccoons in the real landscapes were able to reproduce some behaviors of radio collared raccoons in particular home range sizes between radio collared 86 06 12 42 ha mean standard error and simulated 76 56 11 51 ha raccoons were not significantly different two sample t test t 0 561 df 21 874 p 580 fig e1 supplementary material similarly the proportion of returns within high quality habitat polygons did not differ between radio collared 0 38 0 13 and simulated 0 37 0 21 raccoons two sample t test t 0 011 df 3 351 p 992 fig e2 supplementary material 4 discussion our spatially explicit individual based model illustrates that contact patterns are driven by functional connectivity which in turn varies with conspecific density and landscape physiognomy a sensitivity analysis revealed that movement decisions between habitat polygons based on residence time within polygons and choice of the next polygon could affect per capita contact rates quantifying variability in contact rates among hosts and across space is fundamental to implementing cost effective interventions that can successfully limit infectious disease spread paull et al 2011 white et al 2017 our study contributes in that respect by characterizing three general patterns in per capita contact rates that emerge naturally from empirical movement rules derived from radio collared raccoons first we observed disparity in contact rates among simulated raccoons with a minority of individuals being responsible for a large number of the contacts among conspecifics second per capita contact rates increased linearly with conspecific density indicating that raccoon rabies transmission should be density dependent rather than frequency dependent under most conditions third depending upon land cover types and landscape composition functional connectivity had a broad range of effects on the density of per capita contact rates among hosts from increasing to decreasing densities of contact rates all these patterns emerged from simple empirical movement rules derived from the interplay between the movement of radio collared raccoons and landscape heterogeneity 4 1 space use behavior of radio collared raccoons radio collared raccoons were more likely to choose forests as their next destination when they were not situated in forests in particular raccoons should achieve relatively high fitness by selecting areas that are comprised of a high proportion of forests in landscapes containing few conspecifics tardy et al 2015 forests offer large quantities of resources such as den sites e g tree cavities and food items e g small mammals birds insects chamberlain et al 2003 wilson and nielsen 2007 when leaving a forest raccoons selectively moved to a cornfield under high conspecific densities in agriculturally fragmented landscapes raccoons select cornfields in areas with high densities of corn forest edges and a low proportion of cornfields tardy et al 2014 presumably to benefit from the proximity and abundance of high quality food that is available in cornfields and the safety provided by forest cover houle et al 2011 we further found that radio collared raccoons were generally more likely to transit to large polygons and to use paths with low movement costs i e selection for least cost paths to proceed towards their next destination these results support previous studies showing that raccoons can maintain low costs of travel porter et al 2015 and short movement distances cullingham et al 2008 dharmarajan et al 2009 when resources are readily available which suggest that this species can occupy relatively small home ranges bozek et al 2007 prange et al 2004 our empirical models also revealed that radio collared raccoons had longer residence times in anthropogenic areas compared to other land cover types particularly during the day when they are less active in urbanized landscapes raccoons take advantage of residential areas that provide them with both abundant food sources e g human food garbage and resting dens e g burrows under buildings during the day hadidian et al 1991 hoffmann and gottschang 1977 the sensitivity analysis identified residence time within habitat polygons and choice of the next polygon as important ecological processes in assessing per capita contact rates in particular the land cover type of polygons size of polygons and time period can be critical factors affecting the magnitude of contact rates among raccoons and the influence of these factors should vary as a function of contact types cumulative or unique for example per capita cumulative and unique contact rates would be abundant in large habitat polygons or in anthropogenic areas when raccoons move from cornfields in landscapes however per capita cumulative contact rates would be low when raccoons spend an increasing amount of time in large habitat polygons forest or cornfield polygons or in wetlands during the day while raccoon movements from forests towards cornfields could promote low per capita cumulative contact rates their movements from cornfields towards forests could increase per capita unique contact rates in particular when raccoons display long residence times in cornfields 4 2 contact heterogeneity among simulated raccoons our simulations showed that given the empirical movement rules only a small portion of a raccoon population should be responsible for a large number of unique contacts for example we found that in virtual landscapes with a maximal density of 10 raccoons km¬≤ the top 20 of simulated raccoons that had the highest number of unique contacts accounted for more 40 of all unique contacts at high conspecific densities in the landscape the contact dynamics of raccoons should thus approach the 20 80 rule which is based on the common observation that 20 of infected hosts i e those generating the highest number of secondary cases are commonly responsible for at least 80 of transmission events within host pathogen systems woolhouse et al 1997 this pattern has been observed for vector borne diseases such as tick borne encephalitis perkins et al 2003 and west nile virus kilpatrick et al 2006 as well as for diseases transmitted by direct contact such as sin nombre virus clay et al 2009 pathogen transmission heterogeneity among hosts is often due to variation in their exposure and susceptibility to pathogens and in turn these characteristics are affected by age sex body condition behavior or genetics of hosts vanderwaal and ezenwa 2016 wilson et al 2002 in our case contact heterogeneity emerges in virtual landscapes from simulated raccoons that all obey the same movement rules while simulated raccoons started at random locations their subsequent use of the landscape was such that some simulated individuals exhibited high home range overlap with others thereby leading to high rates of unique contacts given that home range size of simulated raccoons was similar to that of radio collared raccoons our simulations demonstrate that simple movement rules in heterogeneous landscapes combined with stochasticity in conspecific distributions are sufficient to result in strong heterogeneity of the contribution of individual hosts to infectious disease transmission 4 3 spatial heterogeneity in contact rates in host pathogen systems the effects of habitat fragmentation on the dynamics of infectious diseases have been studied theoretically from metapopulation models gog et al 2002 hess 1996 mccallum and dobson 2002 which has led to different predictions according to the mode of pathogen transmission for example if the transmission rate depends upon the proportion or frequency of infected hosts fragmentation should have no direct effect on transmission within habitat polygons as this mode of transmission assumes that hosts have the same number of contacts regardless of individual density within polygons mccallum and dobson 2002 alternatively if the transmission rate is dependent upon the density of infected hosts fragmentation should increase transmission within habitat polygons by reducing animal movements between polygons hess 1996 mccallum and dobson 2002 in our simulation study the mode of transmission was density dependent rather than frequency dependent with per capita contact rates increasing linearly with conspecific density in most virtual landscapes the simulations were based on a range of 0 1 to 10 simulated raccoons km¬≤ which overlaps the observed range of 0 5 to 13 9 raccoons km¬≤ mean 5 raccoons km¬≤ that has been reported for the mont√©r√©gie and estrie regions of southern qu√©bec mass√© 2010 density dependent transmission is common in host pathogen systems anderson et al 1981 berthier et al 2000 brown and brown 2004 unlike frequency dependent models thrall et al 1995 density dependent models predict the existence of a host density threshold below which infectious pathogens cannot invade or persist in a population of susceptible hosts and above which the pathogens can spread anderson et al 1981 getz and pickering 1983 accordingly measures that can result in a decrease in population density e g using culling or sterilization techniques should be effective at reducing the risk of raccoon rabies spread our simulations revealed that the density of per capita contact rates tended to be lower in landscapes that were largely comprised of forests 28 because the isolation of forest polygons is lower in landscapes with high rather than low forest cover short distances between forest polygons decreased the use of agricultural corridors in landscapes that were largely comprised of forests thus increasing forest cover in landscapes that are highly connected by agricultural corridors should decrease the positive effect of functional connectivity on the density of per capita contact rates we also found that the highest densities of per capita cumulative contact rates should occur in highly connected forest polygons and in poorly connected anthropogenic areas during the day especially in landscapes containing few forests 7 consistently forests and anthropogenic areas were strongly selected by radio collared raccoons while focusing control interventions on these two land cover types might seem a cost effective approach for reducing the risk of rabies spread the efficiency of these interventions can strongly vary as a function of landscape physiognomy in particular our study shows that contact rates greatly depend upon 1 whether we consider unique or cumulative contacts and 2 landscape composition and functional connectivity 4 3 1 spatial distribution of cumulative versus unique contact rates we found large differences between areas where cumulative and unique contact rates occurred at highest densities for example when landscapes were poorly connected by agricultural corridors or contained a high proportion of forests per capita cumulative contact rates were observed at highest densities during the day in anthropogenic areas under the same conditions however per capita unique contact rates were the most abundant in agricultural corridors when landscapes were composed of a high forest proportion the density of per capita cumulative contact rates also was highest in cornfields during the night under the same conditions the density of per capita unique contact rates was highest in agricultural corridors when pathogen transmission is density dependent as is expected for raccoon rabies according to our simulations per capita cumulative contact rates influence the probability of transmitting or contracting infectious pathogens habib et al 2011 ji et al 2005 whereas per capita unique contact rates inform on the risk for superspreading events clay et al 2009 thus forests and anthropogenic areas would be potential hotspots for raccoon rabies transmission among individuals whereas agricultural corridors would increase the risk of superspreading events however in landscapes that are highly connected by agricultural corridors but with 14 of forests superspreading events are more likely to occur in forests than in agricultural corridors despite some variation among virtual landscapes our ibm indicates that hotspots are unlikely to be found in crops wetlands and open areas 4 3 2 landscape composition and functional connectivity influence contact rates our study demonstrates how functional connectivity can influence the density of per capita contact rates within a given land cover type for example when conspecific density was at least 1 individual km¬≤ the density of per capita cumulative contact rates increased in forest polygons as they became more strongly connected by agricultural corridors fig 3 this increase was even steeper in landscapes with a low proportion of forests agricultural corridors largely determined the functional connectivity in virtual landscapes which reflected our field observations on radio collared raccoons in agriculturally fragmented landscapes corridors can intensify the use of habitat polygons either by creating dispersal conduits that facilitate animal movement between isolated habitat polygons levey et al 2005 tewksbury et al 2002 or by acting as drift fences that intercept animals moving through the matrix and reorienting them to connected polygons fried et al 2005 haddad and baum 1999 accordingly when moving to forest polygons in landscapes containing a small proportion of forests simulated raccoons used agricultural corridors because cost values of moving in agricultural corridors were lower compared to other land cover types i e crops open areas and water bodies the presence of numerous corridors increased accessibility to forest polygons and when there were relatively few of those polygons individuals ended up experiencing high densities of contacts in forests as the proportion of forests increased in the landscape however individuals became spread among more forest polygons and their encounter rate decreased under these conditions functional connectivity tended to only have a weak effect on contact rates especially at low host densities because home ranges were broadly distributed in the landscape unlike cumulative contacts the density of per capita unique contact rates in forest polygons varied following a convex quadratic relationship with forest connectivity by agricultural corridors in landscapes that were comprised of a small proportion of forests the density of per capita unique contact rates declined as forest connectivity increased from low to intermediate levels average range 3 8 corridors see fig 3 and then was augmented with further increases in forest connectivity a similar pattern was detected in anthropogenic areas with per capita contact rates being lowest in landscapes where these areas were connected by an average of 3 5 agricultural corridors rather than by fewer or more corridors the reduction of connectivity decreased the movement of simulated raccoons between polygons which led to small and overlapping home ranges in the landscape in particular simulated raccoons returned to previously visited polygons because their movements were more costly in landscapes with a low rather than a high connectivity by agricultural corridors the sensitivity analysis showed that the isolation of habitat polygons can affect contact rates for some species living in highly isolated habitat polygons the surrounding matrix can be perceived as hostile and individuals may become reluctant to move away from polygons fortin and arnold 1997 krebs et al 1969 this situation can lead to local higher densities in the polygons of landscapes that are poorly connected by agricultural corridors than in those of highly connected landscapes where higher movement rates would result in a stronger use of the matrix adler and levins 1994 bayne and hobson 1998 when few agricultural corridors were present in the landscape simulated raccoons also used anthropogenic areas to reach their destination polygon because cost values were lower when moving in these areas than in other land cover types especially during the day as the number of agricultural corridors increased in the landscape simulated raccoons started to rely more upon corridors to reach their destination polygon and the density of per capita contact rates in anthropogenic areas declines until these areas become more connected we also observed that the density of per capita contact rates in cornfields decreased with connectivity of cornfields by agricultural corridors when connectivity of cornfields was low per capita contact rates occurred at highest densities in landscapes that were largely comprised of forests given that radio collared raccoons displayed longer residence times in large cornfields a decrease in the number of agricultural corridors should be associated with an increase in residence time this should also result in increased per capita contact rates in cornfields because cornfields tended to be larger in poorly than highly connected landscapes in addition a higher proportion of forests led to more frequent transitions between forests and cornfields thereby increasing the encounter rates of individuals within cornfields overall these few examples show how simple movement rules can interact with landscape properties to create rather complex patterns of spatial heterogeneity in the risk of disease spread such heterogeneity can have strong implications for disease management and prevention 4 4 implication for management of infectious diseases in north america oral vaccine baits that are used to control rabies virus are often distributed over large areas which can generate substantial costs slate et al 2005 to achieve an optimal immunization rate at the lowest cost vaccine bait densities should be distributed as a function of densities of per capita contact rates in the landscape boyer et al 2011 often the predictions regarding the effects of habitat fragmentation on infectious disease dynamics are based on virtual landscapes in which cells are simply classified as low quality or high quality habitats bonnell et al 2010 rees et al 2013 tracey et al 2014 rioux paquette et al 2014 however have emphasized that the identification of habitat specific dispersal routes of rabies spread can help to optimize vaccination interventions we show that the density of contact rates can strongly differ among land cover types depending upon their availability and accessibility and upon the density of conspecifics in the landscape while contact patterns that are observed at low conspecific density could imply that oral vaccine baits should be uniformly distributed across the landscape patterns that are observed at high conspecific density indicate that the efficiency of vaccination strategies depends upon landscape composition and functional connectivity the distribution of oral vaccine baits should focus on anthropogenic areas in landscapes that are poorly connected by agricultural corridors and which contain a high or low proportion of forests in fragmented landscapes that are highly connected by agricultural corridors a high density of baits should be dropped within forests and anthropogenic areas however oral vaccine baits should be more uniformly distributed in the landscapes that are highly connected by agricultural corridors and encompass a high proportion of forests furthermore control interventions should concentrate a large density of oral vaccine baits within agricultural corridors especially in landscapes with a high forest extent and few agricultural corridors using a spatially explicit individual based model our study shows that a broad range of patterns in per capita contact rates can emerge from simulated raccoons that all obey the same and simple empirically derived movement rules this strong spatial heterogeneity in contact rates was driven by conspecific density landscape composition and functional connectivity density dependent models of functional connectivity thus provide a strong basis for building control

25316,species range shifts under climate change have predominantly been projected by models correlating species observations with climatic conditions however geographic range shifting may depend on biotic factors such as demography dispersal and species interactions recently suggested hybrid models include these factors however parameterization of hybrid models suffers from lack of detailed ecological data across many taxa further it is methodologically unclear how to upscale ecological information from scales relevant to ecological processes to the coarser resolution of species distribution data often 100 km2 or even 2500 km2 we tackle these problems by developing a novel modelling and calibration framework which allows hybrid model calibration from static presence absence data that is available for many species the framework improves understanding of the influence of biotic processes on range projections and reveals critical sources of uncertainty that limit projection reliability we demonstrate its performance for the case of the butterfly titania s fritillary boloria titania abbreviations c sdm correlative species distribution model g ecm grid cell extinction colonization model h sdm hybrid species distribution model keywords biotic interaction colonization extinction range projection process based dispersal 1 introduction projections of species distributions under changing environmental conditions are needed to support the conservation of biodiversity dawson et al 2011 pereira et al 2010 most models such as bio climatic envelope models synonyms ecological niche models habitat models or species distribution models statistically correlate species observations and environmental conditions elith and leathwick 2009 guisan and zimmermann 2000 yalcin and leroux 2017 because of their correlative calibration approach we refer to them as correlative species distribution models c sdms the correlative approach takes advantage of the type of widely available data such as raster maps of species occurrence and environmental factors usually derived from atlas data the models however often for technical reasons singer et al 2016 ignore key biotic mechanisms that affect species distributions urban et al 2016 recent methodological advances suggest ways to enhance structural realism of species distribution models by incorporating biotic factors bocedi et al 2014 cabral et al 2017 evans et al 2016 kissling et al 2012 schurr et al 2012 talluto et al 2016 zurell 2017 and have been shown to improve range projections zurell et al 2016 one approach are hybrid species distribution models h sdms dormann et al 2012 also called niche population models fordham et al 2013 h sdms are based on c sdms that constitute filtering by the abiotic environment but add further relevant biotic processes or factors such as interspecific interactions kissling et al 2010 meier et al 2012 schweiger et al 2012 individual variability and local adaptation swab et al 2015 dispersal or transport buse and griebeler 2011 chapman et al 2016 de c√°ceres and brotons et al 2012 kramer schadt et al 2004 or demography keith et al 2008 these studies used additional ecological knowledge to parameterize the biotic processes and showed differences in range projections compared to such based on abiotic environmental information only however for many species ecological process knowledge is lacking therefore it would be desirable to parameterize h sdms from widely available data similarly to c sdms clearly such an endeavor has its limitations because model projections cannot be more reliable than the information from which they are constructed missing knowledge on model and process structure or model parameters can compromise projection reliability singer et al 2016 nevertheless we will show that hybrid models can improve species range projections based on generally available biogeographic information such as presence absence data in this study we develop a hybrid modelling framework consisting of six steps that allows including and calibrating demographic processes and dispersal from currently available maps on species occupancy and environmental variables to demonstrate its merits the framework was exemplarily applied to project the range of the holarctic butterfly titania s fritillary boloria titania almost monophagously feeding as larvae on adderwort bistorta officinalis we analyzed the calibration framework with respect to its ability to shrink parameter and structural uncertainty and studied the consequences of remaining uncertainty for projection reliability 2 material and methods we developed a generic framework fig 1 to construct h sdms from currently available data left boxes in fig 1 the type of data that is generally available for species distribution modelling comprises variables on abiotic environmental conditions third left box in fig 1 and maps of observed species occupancy patterns fourth left box in fig 1 however information on biotic processes is often limited to general theory first left box in fig 1 information on interspecific dependencies second left box in fig 1 or expert knowledge fifth left box in fig 1 in sec 2 1 we describe major challenges arising from data limitations and suggest solutions in sec 2 2 we operationalize these solutions in a protocol for the h sdm model construction and calibration 2 1 major challenges and suggested solutions challenge 1 lack of information we identify two types of knowledge gaps that can limit projection reliability of species distributions structural gaps and data gaps structural gaps e g concerning the relevant environmental drivers or the formulation of ecological response processes to these drivers compromise the structure of the model resulting in structural uncertainty data gaps or uncertainty of data measurements compromise model parameterization resulting in parameter uncertainty both structural and parameter uncertainty reduce projection reliability singer et al 2016 solution 1 knowledge gap analysis identifying knowledge gaps prior to implementing the model helps addressing them adequately by 1 filling the gaps with complementary information e g from targeted empirical studies bierman et al 2010 manceur and k√ºhn 2014 by 2 assessing their impact on projection reliability or by 3 projecting metrics that are robust in spite of missing knowledge gould et al 2014 focusing here on models with a defined endpoint i e projection of spatiotemporal species occurrence we are mainly concerned with the second aspect consequences of structural gaps can be assessed by implementing alternative model formulations as suggested in pattern oriented modelling grimm and railsback 2011 to shrink the number of alternative models model formulations can be weighted or even rejected based on their plausibility plausibility criteria might comprise statistical parsimony ecological theory expert knowledge gallien et al 2010 or post hoc sensitivity analyses saltelli et al 2000 consequences of data gaps can be assessed by parameter uncertainty analyses saltelli et al 2000 finally the joint impact of structural and data gaps on projection reliability can be estimated in ensemble projections of the alternative models and parameterizations challenge 2 coarse spatial resolution impedes detailed description of ecological processes the coarse spatial resolution of available species distribution data exceeds the fine spatial resolution of ecological processes soberon and nakamura 2009 therefore distribution data contains only up scaled information about spatial ecological processes and biotic responses to the environment solution 2a grid cell extinction colonization model g ecm aggregates local population dynamics and dispersal we follow suggestions of applying a metapopulation approach to implement ecological dynamics in species distribution models talluto et al 2017 thuiller et al 2013 for metapopulations at landscape scale local dynamics within patches are aggregated and patch occupancy patterns reflect small scale ecological processes etienne et al 2004 grimm et al 2004 hanski 1994 this metapopulation approach has been transferred to larger spatial scales of geographic grid cells e g buse and griebeler 2011 de c√°ceres and brotons et al 2012 we implement the approach as a grid cell extinction colonization model g ecm see section 2 2 4 that tracks species occupancy dynamics at geographic grid cells however we point out that in contrast to metapopulations hanski 1992 ter braak et al 1998 scaling rules of ecological processes are unclear at the biogeographic scale barwell et al 2014 henle et al 2014 pearson et al 2004 therefore a strict ecological interpretation of the extinction and colonization parameters is not possible at the large geographic grid scale solution 2b interspecific dependency as a geographic filter for species distributions small scale interspecific interactions can affect species distributions at large scales and prior knowledge on interspecific interactions can refine projections of species distributions kissling et al 2012 singer et al 2016 wisz et al 2013 particularly if one species depends on other host species to complete its lifecycle the distribution of the dependent species is constrained by presence of the host species consequently we suggest limiting the distribution of a species by the distribution of its host species i e applying the spatial distribution of host species as a geographic filter schweiger et al 2012 2008 this filtering approach is suitable for predominantly unidirectional interactions called here interspecific dependency e g commensalism mutualism or parasitism with weak feedbacks a recently suggested advancement staniczenko et al 2017 based on bayesian networks promises to account for more complex interspecific interactions e g competition facilitation or predator prey interactions however caution should be taken concerning interspecific interactions with strong feedbacks because feedbacks can lead to complex effects on range dynamics singer et al 2016 2013 challenge 3 lack of temporal information temporal information is essential to calibrate dynamics of species distributions de c√°ceres and brotons et al 2012 in extinction colonization models parameters should be estimated from turnover data or a set of occupancy maps taken at different points in time etienne et al 2004 moilanen 2004 1999 o hara et al 2002 ter braak and etienne 2003 recent methods to calibrate dynamic species distribution models apply hierarchical likelihood based techniques cabral and schurr 2010 evans et al 2016 marion et al 2012 pagel and schurr 2012 talluto et al 2017 these methods require detail in spatiotemporal occupancy talluto et al 2017 or abundance time series pagel and schurr 2012 however in atlas data temporally resolved information is usually pooled to gain spatial coverage the current lack of time series data across large extents impedes grid cell turnover estimates for most species but see schurr et al 2012 for suggestions to improve the situation solution 3a sequential h sdm calibration we use an h sdm consisting of a c sdm coupled with a g ecm and parameterize c sdm and g ecm in subsequent steps which is a common approach dormann et al 2012 however sequential parameter estimation can introduce bias in model calibration particularly in the initial calibration step the c sdm might confound patterns from biological processes for effects from abiotic filters schurr et al 2012 as a consequence the g ecm calibration in the second step might not be based on the full biotic information or both calibration steps might pick up the biotic information resulting in double accounting for the biotic impact gallien et al 2010 nevertheless this assumption is widely used in h sdm approaches e g holloway et al 2016 keith et al 2008 meier et al 2012 regan et al 2012 to assess and cope with potential bias in parameter estimates detailed analysis of the dynamic model projections have to be performed solution 3b equilibrium calibration followed by simulations of the stochastic spatiotemporal dynamics we resort to calibrating the g ecm assuming the species is in equilibrium and its equilibrium distribution is represented by its distribution map the equilibrium assumption has been successfully applied to calibrate dynamic metapopulation models from single patch occupancy patterns pioneered by hanski 1994 and to calibrate a demographic plant species distribution model from a single abundance pattern cabral and schurr 2010 yet we point out that calibration of a dynamic model from a single snapshot can cause biased parameter estimates moilanen 2000 this may happen if the species distribution is not in equilibrium such as for invasive or currently range changing species therefore after equilibrium calibration we proceed with simulations of the explicit stochastic occupancy dynamics of the h sdm 2 2 protocol of the generic modelling and calibration framework these challenges and our solutions are the basis for the six steps of our generic hybrid modelling framework fig 1 right 1 identifying knowledge gaps and accounting for them in a set of plausible alternative model scenarios 2 accounting for interspecific dependency 3 estimating the abiotic species niche through environmental filtering in a c sdm 4 modelling the ecological dynamics based on a g ecm taking into account both interspecific dependency step 2 and abiotic conditions step 3 and calibrating the parameters assuming the system is in equilibrium 5 simulating the stochastic spatiotemporal dynamics of occupancy of the h sdm for different calibrated parameter combinations to further confine parameter ranges and 6 repeating the previous steps for the alternative model scenarios identified in step 1 with each step we aim at extracting additional information on the species environmental response from the species spatial occupancy pattern these steps are now explained in detail and can be followed in fig 1 2 2 1 step 1 establishing alternative calibration scenarios from an analysis of knowledge gaps we suggest constructing model scenarios that describe alternative model formulations in accordance with the available knowledge about the system for example if lack of knowledge on a species dispersal pattern impedes resolving the dispersal mechanism different likely dispersal kernels should be considered in alternative model scenarios if several knowledge gaps exist the study design should account for interactions among sources of uncertainties e g in a full factorial design 2 2 2 step 2 accounting for interspecific dependency known interspecific dependencies of the species are taken into account to limit its spatial extent in all modelling steps only grid cells are accessible on which host species are present 2 2 3 step 3 modelling abiotic influence c sdms are used to estimate the suitability of grid cells a large variety of modelling algorithms exists ranging from more traditional regression based methods such as generalized linear models or generalized additive models to more advanced machine learning methods like boosted regression trees or maxent with different advantages and shortcomings e g elith et al 2006 the choice of the algorithm usually depends on the requirements like interpolation ability or model transferability e g heikkinen et al 2012 and the reliability of absence data e g presence only presence background or presence absence methods within our framework we need reliable absence data see below and thus respective methods should be used in all modeling approaches we suggest to consider interactions among environmental variables as well as non linear responses of species to environmental variables we strongly recommend to avoid overfitting by proper variable selection or regularization procedures the output of presence absence methods usually are occurrence probabilities which depend on the prevalence of the species for the subsequent g ecm calibration step 4 resulting occurrence probabilities should be centered at a prevalence of 0 5 therefore we suggest weighting absences to ensure a prevalence of 0 5 maggini et al 2006 we interpret the projected probability of species occurrence as the suitability of abiotic environmental conditions for the species which we call grid cell suitability hi t of grid cell i at time t hi t covers the spatial environmental heterogeneity among grid cells and has the potential to consider environmental change over time with grid cell suitability hi t we link abiotic information with ecological processes step 4 following previous approaches buse and griebeler 2011 de c√°ceres and brotons et al 2012 meier et al 2010 swab et al 2015 2 2 4 step 4 modelling ecological dynamics and equilibrium calibration to track ecological dynamics we implement a grid cell extinction colonization model g ecm at the spatial scale of geographic grid cells in the g ecm the occupancy of a grid cell can change from two stochastic population dynamical processes these are species extinction from a previously occupied cell or colonization of a previously empty cell both population dynamical processes are applied in each modelled time step and act simultaneously they are defined as follows extinction a species in grid cell i goes extinct at time t with extinction probability 1 e i t min 1

ways see moilanen 2002 in the context of metapopulation model calibration false absences of high quality grid cells might increase estimates of grid cell extinction rate additionally distances among occupied cells would appear larger due to missing occupied cells which might result in over estimation of dispersal distances and colonization success the calibration can be supported by potentially available ecological information e g expert or anecdotal knowledge on species dispersal or local extinction risk fig 1 bottom left this often coarse information can indicate reasonable parameter ranges and filter out unrealistic parameter estimates selection of parameter sets we suggest a hierarchical latin hypercube design to estimate likely parameter values from eq 6 applying rejection sampling latin hypercube rejection sampling lhs is commonly applied for the calibration of complex ecological models hartig et al 2011 jakoby et al 2014 the structure of eq 5 allows splitting the parameter space in two lower dimensional parameter spaces one for the colonization and extinction related parameters c and e the other containing dispersal kernel parameters this splitting reduces computation time because estimation of complex dispersal kernels for long distances can be computationally costly however the splitting destroys homogeneity of the lhs to avoid under sampled areas of the parameter space the sample size in each of the split samples has to be high in tests we found that g ecm calibration can suffer from equifinality i e different parameter combinations might equally likely fit the data equifinality leads to uncertainty about the best suitable parameterization to account for this uncertainty we suggest selecting several best parameter sets that result in low negative log likelihood values eq 6 the amount of best parameter sets should be adjusted according to flatness of the likelihood function and available computational power for the subsequent model simulations 2 2 5 step 5 simulating stochastic spatial occupancy dynamics with the h sdm to simulate the stochastic spatial dynamics of species extinction from and colonization of grid cells are implemented as bernoulli random processes with probabilities according to eq 1 and 2 and parameterized with the best parameter sets resulting from the equilibrium calibration procedure step 4 model simulations are performed for each parameter set separately each simulation starts from the observed distribution data and is run until a dynamic equilibrium is reached the stochastic simulation is replicated to project the stochastic distribution of model outcomes to evaluate projection reliability model outcomes are compared to the observed distribution 2 2 6 step 6 analyzing alternative model scenarios for each model scenario step 1 interspecific dependences are applied as geographic filters step 2 the respective model formulation is calibrated step 3 and 4 and simulated step 5 independently subsequently projections from the alternative model scenarios can be aggregated to reflect projection uncertainty they can also be analysed comparatively to identify how each of the alternative model scenarios contributes to projection uncertainty 3 case study we aimed to analyse the distribution of titania s fritillary 3 1 available data 3 1 1 species geographic distribution presence and absence data of the host plant bistorta officinalis delarbre adderwort was taken from the database on atlas florae europaeae afe jalas and suominen 1979 compiled by the afe secretariat at the finish museum of natural history dark gray dots in fig 2 a distribution data for boloria titania esper titania s fritillary was taken from a database which constituted also the basis for the distribution atlas of butterflies in europe kudrna et al 2011 red crosses in fig 2a in order to run the model for both species at the same spatial resolution butterfly distribution data from about 7000 georeferenced localities were aggregated to the 50 km x 50 km cgrs grid used by afe for the butterfly and its host plant the distribution data can be assumed to provide a good representation of true presences and absences given the large spatial resolution the aggregation of data from several decades and a reasonably large sampling effort 3 1 2 environmental variables we used monthly interpolated climate data fronzek et al 2012 originally provided via the alarm project settele et al 2005 at a 10 arcmin grid resolution and aggregated it to the cgrs grid used by afe in accordance with settele et al 2008 we used aggregated climate variables mean annual accumulated growing degree days with a base temperature of 5 c until august range of annual temperature c range of annual precipitation mm and soil water content for the upper horizon 0 5 m soil water content was taken from the dynamic vegetation model lpj guess hickler et al 2009 2004 and represented a process based water balance in terrestrial systems we used averaged values for the period 1971 2000 for the climate data to match the time span used for butterfly occurrence data 3 2 application of the generic modelling and calibration framework the modelling and calibration framework was implemented in statistical language r 3 2 1 step 1 establishing alternative model scenarios we accounted for uncertainty in model structure and data considering four sources of uncertainty for each of these sources of uncertainty we assumed two alternative hypotheses leading to a full factorial design of 16 alternative models 1 distributional data on titania s fritillary it can be expected that agricultural land use and corresponding habitat loss constrains the range of the alpine titania s fritillary population and excludes butterflies from lower particularly northern alpine regions therefore the observed occurrence might not reflect the butterfly s abiotic and dispersal limited niche to account for related uncertainties we considered two occurrence scenarios occupancy observed oo the available distributional data occupancy land use corrected ol available distributional data plus grid cells at lower altitudes in the alps that would have been climatically suitable according to the c sdm yellow area in fig 2a 2 butterfly dispersal kernel species specific information on the butterfly s dispersal behavior was not available to evaluate potential impact of rare long distance dispersal chesson and lee 2005 hastings et al 2004 which can significantly affect projected species distributions holloway

maximum distances of cell centers dmin 33 km was smaller than 50 km due to few smaller cells that corrected for the planar cgrs grid projection dma x 4509 km calibration parameters x and Œ± were related to dispersal distance the continuous dispersal kernels were adapted to the grid structure by an approximate normalization for total area chipperfield et al 2011 3 geographic extent for the equilibrium calibration procedure the european alps the carpathian mountains and to lower extent the baltic states make up the main distributional range of titania s fritillary red crosses in fig 2a consequently at european scale most grid cells are empty grid cells might be unoccupied because they are i climatically unsuitable or ii unreachable due to dispersal limitations both reasons should be distinguished during calibrations soberon and nakamura 2009 finally the butterfly also occurs in russian and belorussian areas for which occupancy maps are not available to test the influence of the spatial extent on model calibration and projection we considered the two scenarios extent all ea the entire area for which data was available including an observed population in the baltics extent central europe ec a smaller area around the currently observed range in the alps area enclosed by blue line in fig 2a ec excludes the baltic population in this scenario the number of observed presences and absences is roughly equal 4 alternative host plant scenarios distribution of the butterfly s obligate host plant b officinalis strongly determines which grid cells are accessible for the butterfly step 2 however the impact of ecological processes on the distribution of b officinalis is largely unknown therefore prior to modelling the butterfly we modelled and projected distributions of its obligate host plant following the same methodology supplementary material appendix a we considered two alternative host plant projections which differed in dispersal kernels similar to the butterfly kernels p1 negative exponential host plant dispersal kernel p2 power law host plant dispersal kernel to account for uncertainty in long distance plant dispersal see also supplementary material appendix a for further details 3 2 2 step 2 accounting for interspecific dependency to account for the butterfly s obligate host plant dependence the butterfly c sdm sec 3 2 3 and equilibrium calibration of the g ecm sec 3 2 4 were restricted to grid cells where its obligate host plant was present in the observed data schweiger et al 2008 similarly in the h sdm projections sec 3 2 5 butterflies could only colonize and survive in grid cells where the host plant had been projected to be present by the host plant h sdm supplementary material appendix a 3 2 3 step 3 modelling abiotic influence c sdm as one of the modelling approaches combining both high prediction accuracy and transferability heikkinen et al 2012 we used boosted regression trees for calibrating the c sdm we assumed a binomial error structure and used a logit link function boosted regression trees were constructed with a relatively slow learning rate of 0 005 to obtain optimal model fits elith et al 2008 we allowed up to three way interactions among climate variables to avoid overfitting we identified the appropriate number of trees contributing to the final model by analyzing 10 fold cross validated predictive deviance elith et al 2008 we also weighted absences to ensure a prevalence of 0 5 see maggini et al 2006 3 2 4 step 4 modelling ecological dynamics and equilibrium calibration we calibrated parameters e eq 1 c and m eqs 2 3 in the g ecm as well as either x or Œ± depending on the dispersal kernel scenario eqs 7 or 8 using eqs 5 and 6 as described in sec 2 2 4 using function improvedlhs from r package lhs for the hierarchical lhs we first generated 400 parameter combinations for the dispersal parameters m and x or Œ± respectively we secondly generated 400 parameter combinations of e and c the total sample contained 160 000 parameter sets from the full factorial combination of the two samples initial parameter ranges are shown in fig 3 we selected the ten best parameter sets that resulted in the ten lowest negative log likelihood values to exemplify the variability of the outcome due to parameter correlation 3 2 5 step 5 simulating stochastic spatial occupancy dynamics we performed stochastic dynamic projections with the h sdm according to sec 2 2 5 for the ten best parameter sets each simulation ran for 1000 time steps to ensure that the model reached equilibrium conditions for each parameter set we repeated the stochastic simulation 100 times note because this study focused on testing performance of the calibration method only we did not project the model under climate change conditions i e hi t is constant over time in our case study 3 2 6 step 6 analyzing alternative model scenarios the first three sources of uncertainties see step 1 resulted in eight model scenarios that affected butterfly calibration resulting in 8 10 suitable parameter sets projection models were then parameterized with each of these parameter sets and additionally the two alternative dynamic host plant projections fourth source of uncertainty see step 1 which resulted in 160 differently parameterized models in total each of these stochastic models were repeated 100 times which summed to in total 16 000 simulation runs 3 3 statistical analysis 3 3 1 model performance we evaluated discriminative model performance lawson et al 2014 by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc r package rocr for the c sdm calibration step 3 the equilibrium calibration procedure using the g ecm step 4 and the dynamic occupancy projections of the h sdm step 5 since we do not translate the resulting occurrence probabilities of a particular step into presence absence data but rather use them as direct input for the subsequent steps we rely on auc as a threshold independent measure of model performance in addition to auc we also considered probabilistic versions of accuracy and sensitivity bennett et al 2013 lawson et al 2014 if appropriate and visually compared spatial model projections to observed geographic occupancy data for the c sdm auc calculations were based on 10 fold cross validation for the data restricted to host plant presence for projection results from the g ecm equilibrium calibration auc values were calculated separately for each selected parameter set for the h sdm we estimated the probability of grid cell occupancy for each of the modeled calibration scenarios at the end of the simulation after it had reached equilibrium from 100 replicates before calculating the respective auc values for the g ecm equilibrium calibration and the dynamic occupancy projections with the h sdm standard procedures for cross validation are not applicable since random exclusion of grid cells would disturb the structure of spatial grid cell connectivity and potentially impact model calibration moilanen 2002 3 3 2 parameter sets from the equilibrium calibration procedure we analysed correlations among model scenarios and selected parameters parameter correlations were linearly decomposed by pca and associated to model scenarios r package vegan see also borcard et al 2011 from inspection of scatter plots among parameter values see supplementary material appendix b fig b 1 we derived a non linear combination that accounted for relations among model parameters 9 z m c e the aggregated parameter z can be interpreted as turn over 3 3 3 parameter sets from the stochastic dynamic occupancy projections from the stochastic dynamic h sdm projections fig 1 step 5 we calculated the quasi stationary means and standard deviations of the number of occupied grid cells and compared them with the observed number of occupied grid cells these statistics aggregated the 100 repetitions the spatial extent of projections and the last 50 time steps of the simulation by assuming quasi stationarity we reflected the current situation where indeed the species exists and is observed kudrna et al 2011 quasi stationarity was achieved by excluding parameter combinations from the analysis where the butterfly population went extinct during simulation runs this procedure eliminated some extreme and ecologically unrealistic parameter combinations spatially resolved probabilities of grid cell occupancy were calculated as means over the projected presences and absences at the end of the simulation from all replicates of a modelling scenario 4 results 4 1 calibration of the c sdm auc of the c sdm was 0 90 the c sdm projection step 3 covered the current range of the butterfly however it further indicated climatically suitable conditions in other mountainous areas and in scandinavia fig 2b which are unoccupied the potential scandinavian range is currently not suitable due to the lack of the host plant see gray dots in fig 2a and schweiger et al 2008 4 2 equilibrium calibration procedure when parameterized with the selected suitable parameter sets of the equilibrium calibration procedure step 4 the g ecm equilibrium solution eq 5 closely reproduced the observed occupancy pattern for an example see fig 2c for each of the selected parameter sets probabilistic accuracy i e the average probability to correctly project butterfly occupancy on a grid cell where host plants occur ranged between 0 93 and 0 94 in contrast sensitivity the average probability to correctly project only butterfly presence ranged between 0 68 and 0 81 this indicated that the model better projected absences than presences the auc values for all 80 selected parameter sets 10 best sets for 8 butterfly related modelling scenarios were 0 96 high probabilities of butterfly occupancy could be expected only around the butterfly s current range fig 2c in all model scenarios initial ranges for the parameters were reduced fig 3 calibrated ranges for m e and c were rather similar whereas calibrated ranges of dispersal distance related parameters x and Œ± varied among the scenarios this variation could not be attributed to one specific calibration scenario fig 3 the equilibrium calibration procedure delivered different parameter sets that performed equally well table 1 and fig 3 this is not surprising as eqs 4 and 5 respectively can generate equal mean cell occupancy with different but correlated extinction and colonization parameters variation of suitable parameter values could be explained as follows firstly we identified a dynamic and a static solution in the equally well performing parameter sets fig 3 supplementary material appendix b fig b1 the dynamic solution was characterized by turnover in grid cell occupancy i e non zero values of e and c in the static solution turn over was suppressed i e nearly zero values of e and c as the static solution only reproduces the c sdm these parameter sets were excluded from further analysis secondly a principal component analysis fig 4 that reduced dimensionality of the parameter space revealed the correlation among the parameters table 1 the first two axes explained more than 80 of variance the first axis was related to colonization parameters m c and Œ± or x the second axis to the extinction parameter e the aggregated variable z eq 8 subsumed the correlations using the aggregated parameter z in the pca parameter sets arranged along the z direction but clustered parallel shift according to specific Œ± values fig 4c d 4 3 stochastic dynamic occupancy projections stochastic dynamic occupancy projections of the h sdm step 5 using the best parameter sets of the equilibrium calibration procedure i e the 10 best sets of step 4 for each of the 16 model scenarios performed worse than projections of the equilibrium calibration procedure mean of all auc values calculated for each of the 160 projected parameter sets was 0 81 standard deviation 0 15 and increased to 0 84 0 12 if we used only the single best parameter set of each projection scenario interestingly in the dynamic stochastic occupancy projections the butterfly exceeded the observed range and occupied regions further north to the alps fig 2d moreover the dynamic projections suggested only a very low occupancy in the baltics and southern finland in contrast to the observations compare crosses in the baltics and southern finland north east in fig 2a and that are not reflected in fig 2d the projected numbers of occupied grid cells varied among sets of selected parameters and scattered around the observed occupancy fig 5 the aggregated parameter z was a good predictor for projected occupancy fig 5i j butterfly occupancy to a minor degree also depended on the underlying host plant projection where we found that projection p1 caused butterfly occupancy to be slightly lower than projection p2 most importantly for some parameter combinations z Œ± or x and host plant projection the model closely projected the observed butterfly occupancy see fig 5 5 discussion we suggest a generic framework to calibrate hybrid species distribution models h sdms from maps of species occupancy and variables describing environmental conditions sec 2 2 in contrast to other h sdms reviewed in fordham et al 2013 our framework requires only weak or incomplete independent information on biotic processes and factors tackling the problem of lacking mechanistic biotic information about the species spatial population dynamics model construction was confronted with three major challenges concerning i spatial and ii temporal scales as well as iii process detail which can encompass several independent processes our suggested solutions enable the construction of model based projections of species distribution dynamics even if critical dynamic information is lacking the lack of knowledge compromises the resolution of biotic processes in the model and therefore the reliability of the model projections however due to the included model scenario analysis steps 1 and 6 and the detailed dynamic analysis of different parameter sets step 5 the framework is able to identify parameter sets that are in accordance with the available data and to estimate their impact on model projections thus it provides crucial insight in the impact of biotic factors on the spatial dynamics of species and can reveal critical sources of uncertainty in the following we discuss the merits and limitations of the framework on the example of the case study 5 1 performance of the modelling framework the suitability model c sdm step 3 reproduced the current distribution of the butterfly in the european alps the carpathian mountains and in the baltics fig 2b and corroborated results from schweiger et al 2008 that environmentally suitable habitat also exists far beyond the presently observed distribution which however is inaccessible due to host plant absence fig 2a projections of the equilibrium solution step 4 performed better because they revealed dispersal limitation which restricted butterfly projections to areas close to the observed butterfly range fig 2c the stochastic dynamic projections of the h sdm step 5 indicated a potential for colonization of mountainous regions adjacent to the alps where the butterfly currently is not present fig 2d however they also showed absence of the butterfly in the baltic area where it is presently observed we hypothesize that these discrepancies to the observed occupancy pattern could be caused by parameter uncertainty e g from unresolved correlations by the impact of land use excluding the butterfly from potentially suitable areas by a secondary host plant or that the baltic boloria titania population might be a sink in the species colonization extinction dynamics these points are discussed in the following 5 2 parameter uncertainty and correlation there are two sources of parameter uncertainty in the calibration i alternative states and ii equifinality as explained below they might also be the reason why we could not identify a strong impact of calibration scenarios on the parameter values fig 4 we identified two alternative solutions see sec 4 2 a static solution without colonization extinction dynamics corresponding rates are nearly zero and a dynamic solution with colonization extinction dynamics and corresponding nonzero rates the static solution represented the c sdm by suppressing dynamics the existence of the dynamic solution indicates that the abiotic niche described by the c sdm could not explain the entire distribution of the butterfly and thus points to the importance of biotic processes for this distribution the dynamic solution could not be uniquely resolved by model calibration instead we found alternative parameter sets fig 3 that equally well explained the observed butterfly occupancy pattern equifinality equifinality beven and freer 2001 indicates over parameterization dormann et al 2012 and is the result of insufficient information content in the data to parameterize the biotic processes in this study one possible reason for a reduction in information content could have been the sequential model calibration if the calibrated c sdm had incorrectly attributed biotic information to environmental factors e g due to covariation we had to assume reduced explanatory power of the latter calibrated dynamic h sdm therefore we particularly aimed at avoiding over fitting while constructing the c sdm sec 3 2 3 we assume that the c sdm calibration had not strongly reduced information content for the latter h sdm equilibrium calibration instead we consider correlation among the dynamic parameters as the main calibration problem the derived parameter z eq 9 reflects this correlation as it can be interpreted as a descriptor of grid cell turnover i e the ratio between rates of local colonization of empty grid cells and extinction from occupied grid cells in the equilibrium calibration procedure step 4 this ratio cannot be resolved further because equal numbers of grid cells had to be colonized and vacated in order to keep occupancy constant single snapshot occupancy data provide too limited information to resolve correlated biotic processes gu and swihart 2003 therefore the subsequent stochastic dynamic occupancy projections step 5 are essential to gauge consequences of alternative suitable parameterization for model projections 5 3 dispersal ability the stochastic dynamic occupancy projections produced variations in the average grid cell occupancy fig 5 even if the turn over parameter z was constant this variance arose from insufficient knowledge about dispersal in combination with two simplifications of the equilibrium calibration procedure compared to the full dynamics of the h sdm the equilibrium calibration firstly calibrated colonization probability of empty grid cells from the species dispersal ability during a single time step eq 5 dispersal in several steps was ignored secondly being based on the first moment approximation eq 4 the equilibrium calibration procedure could not account for variability from immigration extinction stochasticity hanski 1994 in contrast the dynamic projections allowed for subsequent random colonization events that were not immediately compensated by extinctions thus variance in projected occurrence that could not be resolved by parameter z can be attributed to uncertainty about dispersal abilities of the butterfly including its stochasticity our analysis therefore identifies dispersal as a critical source of uncertainty in our case study 5 4 projected range expansion around the european alps does land use limit the butterfly range the stochastic dynamic occupancy projections of the h sdm led to an extended range beyond the currently observed butterfly range in the european alps compare fig 2a d this challenges our assumption that currently the butterfly population is in equilibrium however given the long term and intensive monitoring effort we trust the observed absences of boloria titania and believe that the population indeed is in equilibrium more likely land use might have limited the observed species range but was not explicitly considered in the model we found that taking into account land use impact in the equilibrium calibration procedure affected the dispersal related parameters Œ± and x fig 3 the slightly expanded geographic range in mountainous regions predicted by the dynamic projections fig 2d compared to the equilibrium calibration procedure fig 2c likely indicates the butterfly s potential geographic range without impact of anthropogenic land use thus our analysis identifies land use as a potentially important factor for the distribution of boloria titania which agrees with findings for high latitude butterflies eskildsen et al 2013 5 5 the baltic boloria titania is potentially a sink population the stochastic dynamic occupancy projections provided new important insight in the existence of the baltic butterfly population we found that the butterfly population in the baltic states and finland was projected very likely to go extinct this result conflicts with the observed presence of titania s fritillary in the baltic states and southern finland there are two likely explanations for this discrepancy firstly the baltic and finnish butterfly populations are potentially oligophagous and might utilize viola species as a secondary host plant see supplementary information in p√∂yry et al 2008 for the observed feeding behaviour in finland and northern europe since we do not have reliable distribution data for viola species nor detailed information about the possible density dependent benefits of a secondary host plant we could not consider such effects in the model a secondary host plant might enhance the suitable butterfly area secondly the baltic and finnish populations might be connected to larger populations in russia kudrna et al 2011 for these populations reliable occupancy data is not available which restricts the spatial extent of our study however the impact of the spatial extent on parameter estimates including or not the baltic and finnish populations and the eastern border see fig 3 was low because only grid cells at the eastern border of the modeled area should be affected moilanen 2002 given the fact that ignoring the eastern butterfly range in our dynamic occupancy projections the baltic and finnish populations likely went extinct in the model we hypothesize that these populations could be sink populations connected to a source east of the modeled area moilanen 2002 on biased occupancy projections due to disconnection of patches source sink dynamics have been considered one potential source of bias to static species distribution models but can be revealed with demographic approaches pagel and schurr 2012 6 conclusions we present a hybrid modelling and calibration framework to project species distributions taking into account demographic processes and dispersal the framework is distinct in its attempt to be calibrated from widely available data on geographic distributions of species and environmental factors relying on rather low data requirements the framework can potentially be applied to a wide range of species however the small information base also reveals knowledge gaps that impact model projection reliability a problematic knowledge gap is the lack of data to inform spatial population dynamics e g time series of species distributions or species specific functional trait information particularly the available information is not sufficient to resolve correlation among colonization and extinction processes this causes uncertainty in the species dispersal ability and subsequently in the range projections even assuming temporally constant environmental conditions under environmental change we expect uncertainties to even increase to cope with the lack of knowledge we suggest within the framework extensive and detailed analyses of the data and structural gaps step 1 and of the results of the modelling and calibration steps 2 5 fig 1 in particular step 5 the stochastic dynamic projections of the h sdm is essential as it selects the dynamic biotic processes species extinction and colonization rates including dispersal distances that most likely reflect the data the model scenario analysis step 6 is important as it allows evaluating projection reliability model scenarios that provide biased projections of current occupancy should not be ignored but thoroughly investigated as they provide insights in confounding factors and achievable projection reliability executing the steps of the framework narrows the parameter range and reveals critical knowledge gaps that can compromise projection reliability e g the lack of data to inform the population dynamics or dispersal processes further it can explain mechanisms that drive the propagation of uncertainties with the presently available data the framework cannot be expected to provide highly reliable quantitative projections of species distributions instead it can enhance mechanistic understanding of the species range dynamics estimate the reliability of species range projections and reveal which additional data would improve projections this is often the best possible achievement to support management facing data limitations singer et al 2011 very importantly this framework provides potential

25316,species range shifts under climate change have predominantly been projected by models correlating species observations with climatic conditions however geographic range shifting may depend on biotic factors such as demography dispersal and species interactions recently suggested hybrid models include these factors however parameterization of hybrid models suffers from lack of detailed ecological data across many taxa further it is methodologically unclear how to upscale ecological information from scales relevant to ecological processes to the coarser resolution of species distribution data often 100 km2 or even 2500 km2 we tackle these problems by developing a novel modelling and calibration framework which allows hybrid model calibration from static presence absence data that is available for many species the framework improves understanding of the influence of biotic processes on range projections and reveals critical sources of uncertainty that limit projection

2000 yalcin and leroux 2017 because of their correlative calibration approach we refer to them as correlative species distribution models c sdms the correlative approach takes advantage of the type of widely available data such as raster maps of species occurrence and environmental factors usually derived from atlas data the models however often for technical reasons singer et al 2016 ignore key biotic mechanisms that affect species distributions urban et al 2016 recent methodological advances suggest ways to enhance structural realism of species distribution models by incorporating biotic

approach are hybrid species distribution models h sdms dormann et al 2012 also called niche population models fordham et al 2013 h sdms are based on c sdms that constitute filtering by the abiotic environment but add further relevant biotic processes or factors such as interspecific interactions kissling et al 2010 meier et al 2012 schweiger et al 2012 individual variability and local adaptation swab et al 2015 dispersal or transport buse and griebeler 2011 chapman et al 2016 de c√°ceres and brotons et al 2012 kramer schadt et al 2004 or demography keith et al 2008 these studies used additional ecological knowledge to parameterize the biotic processes and showed differences in range projections compared to such based on abiotic environmental information only however for many species ecological process knowledge is lacking therefore it would be desirable to parameterize h sdms from widely available data similarly to c sdms clearly such an endeavor has its limitations because model projections cannot be more reliable than the information from which they are constructed missing knowledge on model and process structure or model parameters can compromise projection reliability singer et al 2016 nevertheless we will show that hybrid models can improve species range projections based on generally available biogeographic information such as presence absence data in this study we develop a hybrid modelling framework consisting of six steps that allows including and calibrating demographic processes and dispersal from currently available maps on species occupancy and environmental variables to demonstrate its merits the framework was exemplarily applied to project the range of the holarctic butterfly titania s fritillary boloria titania almost monophagously

remaining uncertainty for projection reliability 2 material and methods we developed a generic framework fig 1 to construct h sdms from currently available data left boxes in fig 1 the type of data

the second aspect consequences of structural gaps can be assessed by implementing alternative model formulations as suggested in pattern oriented modelling grimm and railsback 2011 to shrink the number of alternative models model formulations can be weighted or even rejected based on their plausibility plausibility criteria might comprise statistical parsimony ecological theory expert knowledge gallien et al 2010 or post hoc sensitivity analyses saltelli et al 2000 consequences of data gaps can be assessed by parameter uncertainty analyses saltelli et al 2000 finally the joint impact of structural and data gaps on projection reliability can be estimated in ensemble projections of the alternative models and parameterizations challenge 2 coarse spatial resolution impedes detailed description of ecological processes the coarse spatial resolution of available species distribution data exceeds the fine spatial resolution of ecological processes soberon and nakamura 2009 therefore distribution data contains only up scaled information about spatial ecological processes and biotic responses to the environment solution 2a grid cell extinction colonization model g ecm aggregates local population dynamics and dispersal we follow suggestions of applying a metapopulation approach to implement ecological dynamics in species distribution models talluto et al 2017 thuiller et al 2013 for metapopulations at landscape scale local dynamics within patches are aggregated and patch occupancy patterns reflect small scale ecological processes etienne et al 2004 grimm et al 2004 hanski 1994 this metapopulation approach has been transferred to larger spatial scales of geographic grid cells e g buse and griebeler 2011 de c√°ceres and brotons et al 2012 we implement the approach as a grid cell extinction colonization model g ecm see section 2 2 4 that tracks species occupancy dynamics at geographic grid cells however we point out that in contrast to metapopulations hanski 1992 ter braak et al 1998 scaling rules of ecological processes are unclear at the biogeographic scale barwell et al 2014 henle et al 2014 pearson et al 2004 therefore a strict ecological interpretation of the extinction and colonization parameters is not possible at the large geographic grid scale solution 2b interspecific dependency as a geographic filter for species distributions small scale interspecific interactions can affect species distributions at large scales and prior knowledge on interspecific interactions can refine projections of species distributions kissling et al 2012 singer et al 2016 wisz et al 2013 particularly if one species depends on other host species to complete its lifecycle the distribution of the dependent species is constrained by presence of the host species consequently we suggest limiting the distribution of a species by the distribution of its host species i e applying the spatial distribution of host species as a geographic filter schweiger et al 2012 2008 this filtering approach is suitable for predominantly unidirectional interactions called here interspecific dependency e g commensalism mutualism or parasitism with weak feedbacks a recently suggested advancement staniczenko et al 2017 based on bayesian networks promises to account for more complex interspecific interactions e g competition facilitation or predator prey interactions however caution should be taken concerning interspecific interactions with strong feedbacks because feedbacks can lead to complex effects on range dynamics singer et al 2016 2013 challenge 3 lack of temporal information temporal information is essential to calibrate dynamics of species distributions de c√°ceres and brotons et al 2012 in extinction colonization models parameters should be estimated from turnover data or a set of occupancy maps taken at different points in time etienne et al 2004 moilanen 2004 1999 o hara et al 2002 ter braak and etienne 2003 recent methods to calibrate dynamic species distribution models apply hierarchical likelihood based techniques cabral and schurr 2010 evans et al 2016 marion et al 2012 pagel and schurr 2012 talluto et al 2017 these methods require detail in spatiotemporal occupancy talluto et al 2017 or abundance time series pagel and schurr 2012 however in atlas data temporally resolved information is usually pooled to gain spatial coverage the current lack of time series data across large extents impedes grid cell turnover estimates for most species but see schurr et al 2012 for suggestions to improve the situation solution 3a sequential h sdm calibration we use an h sdm consisting of a c sdm coupled with a g ecm and parameterize c sdm and g ecm in subsequent steps which is a common approach dormann et al 2012 however sequential parameter estimation can introduce bias in model calibration particularly in the initial calibration step the c sdm might confound patterns from biological processes for effects from abiotic filters schurr et al 2012 as a consequence the g ecm calibration in the second step might not be based on the full biotic information or both calibration steps might pick up the biotic information resulting in double accounting for the biotic impact gallien et al 2010 nevertheless this assumption is widely used in h sdm approaches e g holloway et al 2016 keith et al 2008 meier et al 2012 regan et al 2012 to assess and cope with potential bias in parameter estimates detailed analysis of the dynamic model projections have to be performed solution 3b equilibrium calibration followed by simulations of the stochastic spatiotemporal dynamics we resort to calibrating the g ecm assuming the species is in equilibrium and its equilibrium distribution is represented by its distribution map the equilibrium assumption has been successfully applied to calibrate dynamic metapopulation models from single patch occupancy patterns pioneered by hanski 1994 and to calibrate a demographic plant species distribution model from a single abundance pattern cabral and schurr 2010 yet we point out that calibration of a dynamic model from a single snapshot can cause biased parameter estimates moilanen 2000 this may happen if the species distribution is not in equilibrium such as for invasive or currently range changing species therefore after equilibrium calibration we proceed with simulations of the explicit stochastic occupancy dynamics of the h sdm 2 2 protocol of the generic modelling and calibration framework these challenges and our solutions are the basis for the six steps of our generic hybrid modelling framework fig 1 right 1 identifying knowledge gaps and accounting for them in a set of plausible alternative model scenarios 2 accounting for interspecific dependency 3 estimating the abiotic species niche through environmental filtering in a c sdm 4 modelling the ecological dynamics based on a g ecm taking into account both interspecific dependency step 2 and abiotic conditions step 3 and calibrating the parameters assuming the system is in equilibrium 5 simulating the stochastic spatiotemporal dynamics of occupancy of the h sdm for different calibrated parameter combinations to further confine parameter ranges and 6 repeating the previous steps for the alternative model scenarios identified in step 1 with each step we aim at extracting additional information on the species environmental response from the species spatial occupancy pattern these steps are now explained in detail and can be followed in fig 1 2 2 1 step 1 establishing alternative calibration scenarios from an analysis of knowledge gaps we suggest constructing model scenarios that describe alternative model formulations in accordance with the available knowledge about the system for example if lack of knowledge on a species dispersal pattern impedes resolving the dispersal mechanism different likely dispersal kernels should be considered in alternative model scenarios if several knowledge gaps exist the study design should account for interactions among sources of uncertainties e g in a full factorial design 2 2 2 step 2 accounting for interspecific dependency known interspecific dependencies of the species are taken into account to limit its spatial extent in all modelling steps only grid cells are accessible on which host species are present 2 2 3 step 3 modelling abiotic influence c sdms are used to estimate the suitability of grid cells a large variety of modelling algorithms exists ranging from more traditional regression based methods such as generalized linear models or generalized additive models to more advanced machine learning methods like boosted regression trees or maxent with different advantages and shortcomings e g elith et al 2006 the choice of the algorithm usually depends on the requirements like interpolation ability or model transferability e g heikkinen et al 2012 and the reliability of absence data e g presence only presence background or presence absence methods within our framework we need reliable absence data see below and thus respective methods should be used in all modeling approaches we suggest to consider interactions among environmental variables as well as non linear responses of species to environmental variables we strongly recommend to avoid overfitting by proper variable selection or regularization procedures the output of presence absence methods usually are occurrence probabilities which depend on the prevalence of the species for the subsequent g ecm calibration step 4 resulting occurrence probabilities should be centered at a prevalence of 0 5 therefore we suggest weighting absences to ensure a prevalence of 0 5 maggini et al 2006 we interpret the projected probability of species occurrence as the suitability of abiotic environmental conditions for the species which we call grid cell suitability hi t of grid cell i at time t hi t covers the spatial environmental heterogeneity among grid cells and has the potential to consider environmental change over time with grid cell suitability hi t we link abiotic information with ecological processes step 4 following previous approaches buse and griebeler 2011 de c√°ceres and brotons et al 2012 meier et al 2010 swab et al 2015 2 2 4 step 4 modelling ecological dynamics and equilibrium calibration to track ecological dynamics we implement a grid cell extinction colonization model g ecm at the spatial scale of geographic grid cells in the g ecm the occupancy of a grid cell can change from two stochastic population dynamical processes these are species extinction from a previously occupied cell or colonization of a previously empty cell both population dynamical processes are applied in each modelled time step and act simultaneously they are defined as follows extinction a species in grid cell i goes extinct at time t with extinction probability 1 e i t min 1 e 1 h i t where hi t denotes the cell suitability estimated in the c sdm step 3 for all accessible cells step 2 eq 1 assumes a linear decline of ei t with increasing grid cell suitability hi t model parameter e describes the ability of the species to cope with local habitat conditions and scales with time step length and grid cell size colonization an empty accessible step 2 cell i is colonized by a species in time step t with probability 2 c i t 1 1 c i i t where c is a parameter that indicates an individual s ability to establish ii t denotes the number of immigrants arriving at the empty cell i we assume that immigrants can originate only from grid cells that are occupied in the previous time step t 1 therefore 3 i i t m j i g d i j j j t 1 where m is the number of emigrants per grid cell jj t 1 is occupancy of cell j at time step t 1 g dij denotes a dispersal kernel depending on distance dij between grid cells i and j explicit modelling of dispersal is rare in species distribution modelling holloway and miller 2017 although the inclusion of probabilistic dispersal kernels g dij can improve projections of species distributions holloway et al 2016 equilibrium calibration we follow the incidence function approach hanski 1994 that is technically suitable to calibrate the model parameters from the equilibrium state of grid cell occupancy j i etienne et al 2004 4 j i c i c i e i where we assume constancy of grid cell occupancy j i during time steps t and t 1 which is a reasonable approximation for the quasi stationary equilibrium state hanski 1999

grid cell occupancy j i parameter values can be estimated from eq 5 by minimizing the negative log likelihood 6 l p o i a l l o c c u p i e d c e l l s i n o ln j i p i a l l e m p t y c e l l s i n o ln 1 j i p for the observed occupancy o and parameter set p as mentioned above our modelling framework assumes reliable presence absence data false absences could affect g ecm calibration in several ways see moilanen 2002 in the context of metapopulation model calibration false absences of high quality grid cells might increase estimates of grid cell extinction rate additionally distances among occupied cells would appear larger due to missing occupied cells which might result in over estimation of dispersal distances and colonization success the calibration can be supported by potentially available ecological information e g expert or anecdotal knowledge on species dispersal or local extinction risk fig 1 bottom left this often coarse information can indicate reasonable parameter ranges and filter out unrealistic parameter estimates selection of parameter sets we suggest a hierarchical latin hypercube design to estimate likely parameter values from eq 6 applying rejection sampling latin hypercube rejection sampling lhs is commonly applied for the calibration of complex ecological models hartig et al 2011 jakoby et al 2014 the structure of eq 5 allows splitting the parameter space in two lower dimensional parameter spaces one for the colonization and extinction related parameters c and e the other containing dispersal kernel parameters this splitting reduces computation time because estimation of complex dispersal kernels for long distances can be computationally costly however the splitting destroys homogeneity of the lhs to avoid under sampled areas of the parameter space the sample size in each of the split samples has to be high in tests we found that g ecm calibration can suffer from equifinality i e different parameter combinations might equally likely fit the data equifinality leads to uncertainty about the best suitable parameterization to account for this uncertainty we suggest selecting several best parameter sets that result in low negative log likelihood values eq 6 the amount of best parameter sets should be adjusted according to flatness of the likelihood function and available computational power for the subsequent model simulations 2 2 5 step 5 simulating stochastic spatial occupancy dynamics with the h sdm to simulate the stochastic spatial dynamics of species extinction from and colonization of grid cells are implemented as bernoulli random processes with probabilities according to eq 1 and 2 and parameterized with the best parameter sets resulting from the equilibrium calibration procedure step 4 model simulations are performed for each parameter set separately each simulation starts from the observed distribution data and is run until a dynamic equilibrium is reached the stochastic simulation is replicated to project the stochastic distribution of model outcomes to evaluate projection reliability model outcomes are compared to the observed distribution 2 2 6 step 6 analyzing alternative model scenarios for each model scenario step 1 interspecific dependences are applied as geographic filters step 2 the respective model formulation is calibrated step 3 and 4 and simulated step 5 independently subsequently projections from the alternative model scenarios can be aggregated to reflect projection uncertainty they can also be analysed comparatively to identify how each of the alternative model scenarios contributes to projection uncertainty 3 case study we aimed to analyse the distribution of titania s fritillary 3 1 available data 3 1 1 species geographic distribution presence and absence data of the host plant bistorta officinalis delarbre adderwort was taken from the database on atlas florae europaeae afe jalas and suominen 1979 compiled by the afe secretariat at the finish museum of natural history dark gray dots in fig 2 a distribution data for boloria titania esper titania s fritillary was taken from a database which constituted also the basis for the distribution atlas of butterflies in europe kudrna et al 2011 red crosses in fig 2a in order to run the model for both species at the same spatial resolution butterfly distribution data from about 7000 georeferenced localities were aggregated to the 50 km x 50 km cgrs grid used by afe for the butterfly and its host plant the distribution data can be assumed to provide a good representation of true presences and absences given the large spatial resolution the aggregation of data from several decades and a reasonably large sampling effort 3 1 2 environmental variables we used monthly interpolated climate data fronzek et al 2012 originally provided via the alarm project settele et al 2005 at a 10 arcmin grid resolution and aggregated it to the cgrs grid used by afe in accordance with settele et al 2008 we used aggregated climate variables mean annual accumulated growing degree days with a base temperature of 5 c until august range of annual temperature c range of annual precipitation mm and soil water content for the upper horizon 0 5 m soil water content was taken from the dynamic vegetation model lpj guess hickler et al 2009 2004 and represented a process based water balance in terrestrial systems we used averaged values for the period 1971 2000 for the climate data to match the time span used for butterfly occurrence data 3 2 application of the generic modelling and calibration framework the modelling and calibration framework was implemented in statistical language r 3 2 1 step 1 establishing alternative model scenarios we accounted for uncertainty in model structure and data considering four sources of uncertainty for each of these sources of uncertainty we assumed two alternative hypotheses leading to a full factorial design of 16 alternative models 1 distributional data on titania s fritillary it can be expected that agricultural land use and corresponding habitat loss constrains the range of the alpine titania s fritillary population and excludes butterflies from lower particularly northern alpine regions therefore the observed occurrence might not reflect the butterfly s abiotic and dispersal limited niche to account for related uncertainties we considered two occurrence scenarios occupancy observed oo the available distributional data occupancy land use corrected ol available distributional data plus grid cells at lower altitudes in the alps that would have been climatically suitable according to the c sdm yellow area in fig 2a 2 butterfly dispersal kernel species specific information on the butterfly s dispersal behavior was not available to evaluate potential impact of rare long distance dispersal chesson and lee 2005 hastings et al 2004 which can significantly affect projected species distributions holloway et al 2016 we compared two alternative dispersal kernels negative exponential kernel exp 7 g e x p d i j a c e l l e x p Œ± d i j 2 œÄ Œ± 2 1 Œ± d m i n exp Œ± d m i n 1 Œ± d m a x exp Œ± d m a x

maximum distances of cell centers dmin 33 km was smaller than 50 km due to few smaller cells that corrected for the planar cgrs grid projection dma x 4509 km calibration parameters x and Œ± were related to dispersal distance the continuous dispersal kernels were adapted to the grid structure by an approximate normalization for total area chipperfield et al 2011 3 geographic extent for the equilibrium calibration procedure the european alps the carpathian mountains and to lower extent the baltic states make up the main distributional range of titania s fritillary red crosses in fig 2a consequently at european scale most grid cells are empty grid cells might be unoccupied because they are i climatically unsuitable or ii unreachable due to dispersal limitations both reasons should be distinguished during calibrations soberon and nakamura 2009 finally the butterfly also occurs in russian and belorussian areas for which occupancy maps are not available to test the influence of the spatial extent on model calibration and projection we considered the two scenarios extent all ea the entire area for which data was available including an observed population in the baltics extent central europe ec a smaller area around the currently observed range in the alps area enclosed by blue line in fig 2a ec excludes the baltic population in this scenario the number of observed presences and absences is roughly equal 4 alternative host plant scenarios distribution of the butterfly s obligate host plant b officinalis strongly determines which grid cells are accessible for the butterfly step 2 however the impact of ecological processes on the distribution of b officinalis is largely unknown therefore prior to modelling the butterfly we modelled and projected distributions of its obligate host plant following the same methodology supplementary material appendix a we considered two alternative host plant projections which differed in dispersal kernels similar to the butterfly kernels p1 negative exponential host plant dispersal kernel p2 power law host plant dispersal kernel to account for uncertainty in long distance plant dispersal see also supplementary material appendix a for further details 3 2 2 step 2 accounting for interspecific dependency to account for the butterfly s obligate host plant dependence the butterfly c sdm sec 3 2 3 and equilibrium calibration of the g ecm sec 3 2 4 were restricted to grid cells where its obligate host plant was present in the observed data schweiger et al 2008 similarly in the h sdm projections sec 3 2 5 butterflies could only colonize and survive in grid cells where the host plant had been projected to be present by the host plant h sdm supplementary material appendix a 3 2 3 step 3 modelling abiotic influence c sdm as one of the modelling approaches combining both high prediction accuracy and transferability heikkinen et al 2012 we used boosted regression trees for calibrating the c sdm we assumed a binomial error structure and used a logit link function boosted regression trees were constructed with a relatively slow learning rate of 0 005 to obtain optimal model fits elith et al 2008 we allowed up to three way interactions among climate variables to avoid overfitting we identified the appropriate number of trees contributing to the final model by analyzing 10 fold cross validated predictive deviance elith et al 2008 we also weighted absences to ensure a prevalence of 0 5 see maggini et al 2006 3 2 4 step 4 modelling ecological dynamics and equilibrium calibration we calibrated parameters e eq 1 c and m eqs 2 3 in the g ecm as well as either x or Œ± depending on the dispersal kernel scenario eqs 7 or 8 using eqs 5 and 6 as described in sec 2 2 4 using function improvedlhs from r package lhs for the hierarchical lhs we first generated 400 parameter combinations for the dispersal parameters m and x or Œ± respectively we secondly generated 400 parameter combinations of e and c the total sample contained 160 000 parameter sets from the full factorial combination of the two samples initial parameter ranges are shown in fig 3 we selected the ten best parameter sets that resulted in the ten lowest negative log likelihood values to exemplify the variability of the outcome due to parameter correlation 3 2 5 step 5 simulating stochastic spatial occupancy dynamics we performed stochastic dynamic projections with the h sdm according to sec 2 2 5 for the ten best parameter sets each simulation ran for 1000 time steps to ensure that the model reached equilibrium conditions for each parameter set we repeated the stochastic simulation 100 times note because this study focused on testing performance of the calibration method only we did not project the model under climate change conditions i e hi t is constant over time in our case study 3 2 6 step 6 analyzing alternative model scenarios the first three sources of uncertainties see step 1 resulted in eight model scenarios that affected butterfly calibration resulting in 8 10 suitable parameter sets projection models were then parameterized with each of these parameter sets and additionally the two alternative dynamic host plant projections fourth source of uncertainty see step 1 which resulted in 160 differently parameterized models in total each of these stochastic models were repeated 100 times which summed to in total 16 000 simulation runs 3 3 statistical analysis 3 3 1 model performance we evaluated discriminative model performance lawson et al 2014 by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc r package rocr for the c sdm calibration step 3 the equilibrium calibration procedure using the g ecm step 4 and the dynamic occupancy projections of the h sdm step 5 since we do not translate the resulting occurrence probabilities of a particular step into presence absence data but rather use them as direct input for the subsequent steps we rely on auc as a threshold independent measure of model performance in addition to auc we also considered probabilistic versions of accuracy and sensitivity bennett et al 2013 lawson et al 2014 if appropriate and visually compared spatial model projections to observed geographic occupancy data for the c sdm auc calculations were based on 10 fold cross validation for the data restricted to host plant presence for projection results from the g ecm equilibrium calibration auc values were calculated separately for each selected parameter set for the h sdm we estimated the probability of grid cell occupancy for each of the modeled calibration scenarios at the end of the simulation after it had reached equilibrium from 100 replicates before calculating the respective auc values for the g ecm equilibrium calibration and the dynamic occupancy projections with the h sdm standard procedures for cross validation are not applicable since random exclusion of grid cells would disturb the structure of spatial grid cell connectivity and potentially impact model calibration moilanen 2002 3 3 2 parameter sets from the equilibrium calibration procedure we analysed correlations among model scenarios and selected parameters parameter correlations were linearly decomposed by pca and associated to model scenarios r package vegan see also borcard et al 2011 from inspection of scatter plots among parameter values see supplementary material appendix b fig b 1 we derived a non linear combination that accounted for relations among model parameters 9 z m c e the aggregated parameter z can be interpreted as turn over 3 3 3 parameter sets from the stochastic dynamic occupancy projections from the stochastic dynamic h sdm projections fig 1 step 5 we calculated the quasi stationary means and standard deviations of the number of occupied grid cells and compared them with the observed number of occupied grid cells these statistics aggregated the 100 repetitions the spatial extent of projections and the last 50 time steps of the simulation by assuming quasi stationarity we reflected the current situation where indeed the species exists and is observed kudrna et al 2011 quasi stationarity was achieved by excluding parameter combinations from the analysis where the butterfly population went extinct during simulation runs this procedure eliminated some extreme and ecologically unrealistic parameter combinations spatially resolved probabilities of grid cell occupancy were calculated as means over the projected presences and absences at the end of the simulation from all replicates of a modelling scenario 4 results 4 1 calibration of the c sdm auc of the c sdm was 0 90 the c sdm projection step 3 covered the current range of the butterfly however it further indicated climatically suitable conditions in other mountainous areas and in scandinavia fig 2b which are unoccupied the potential scandinavian range is currently not suitable due to the lack of the host plant see gray dots in fig 2a and schweiger et al 2008 4 2 equilibrium calibration procedure when parameterized with the selected suitable parameter sets of the equilibrium calibration procedure step 4 the g ecm equilibrium solution eq 5 closely reproduced the observed occupancy pattern for an example see fig 2c for each of the selected parameter sets probabilistic accuracy i e the average probability to correctly project butterfly occupancy on a grid cell where host plants occur ranged between 0 93 and 0 94 in contrast sensitivity the average probability to correctly project only butterfly presence ranged between 0 68 and 0 81 this indicated that the model better projected absences than presences the auc values for all 80 selected parameter sets 10 best sets for 8 butterfly related modelling scenarios were 0 96 high probabilities of butterfly occupancy could be expected only around the butterfly s current range fig 2c in all model scenarios initial ranges for the parameters were reduced fig 3 calibrated ranges for m e and c were rather similar whereas calibrated ranges of dispersal distance related parameters x and Œ± varied among the scenarios this variation could not be attributed to one specific calibration scenario fig 3 the equilibrium calibration procedure delivered different parameter sets that performed equally well table 1 and fig 3 this is not surprising as eqs 4 and 5 respectively can generate equal mean cell occupancy with different but correlated extinction and colonization parameters variation of suitable parameter values could be explained as follows firstly we identified a dynamic and a static solution in the equally well performing parameter sets fig 3 supplementary material appendix b fig b1 the dynamic solution was characterized by turnover in grid cell occupancy i e non zero values of e and c in the static solution turn over was suppressed i e nearly zero values of e and c as the static solution only reproduces the c sdm these parameter sets were excluded from further analysis secondly a principal component analysis fig 4 that reduced dimensionality of the parameter space revealed the correlation among the parameters table 1 the first two axes explained more than 80 of variance the first axis was related to colonization parameters m c and Œ± or x the second axis to the extinction parameter e the aggregated variable z eq 8 subsumed the correlations using the aggregated parameter z in the pca parameter sets arranged along the z direction but clustered parallel shift according to specific Œ± values fig 4c d 4 3 stochastic dynamic occupancy projections stochastic dynamic occupancy projections of the h sdm step 5 using the best parameter sets of the equilibrium calibration procedure i e the 10 best sets of step 4 for each of the 16 model scenarios performed worse than projections of the equilibrium calibration procedure mean of all auc values calculated for each of the 160 projected parameter sets was 0 81 standard deviation 0 15 and increased to 0 84 0 12 if we used only the single best parameter set of each projection scenario interestingly in the dynamic stochastic occupancy projections the butterfly exceeded the observed range and occupied regions further north to the alps fig 2d moreover the dynamic projections suggested only a very low occupancy in the baltics and southern finland in contrast to the observations compare crosses in the baltics and southern finland north east in fig 2a and that are not reflected in fig 2d the projected numbers of occupied grid cells varied among sets of selected parameters and scattered around the observed occupancy fig 5 the aggregated parameter z was a good predictor for projected occupancy fig 5i j butterfly occupancy to a minor degree also depended on the underlying host plant projection where we found that projection p1 caused butterfly occupancy to be slightly lower than projection p2 most importantly for some parameter combinations z Œ± or x and host plant projection the model closely projected the observed butterfly occupancy see fig 5 5 discussion we suggest a generic framework to calibrate hybrid species distribution models h sdms from maps of species occupancy and variables describing environmental conditions sec 2 2 in contrast to other h sdms reviewed in fordham et al 2013 our framework requires only weak or incomplete independent information on biotic processes and factors tackling the problem of lacking mechanistic biotic information about the species spatial population dynamics model construction was confronted with three major challenges concerning i spatial and ii temporal scales as well as iii process detail which can encompass several independent processes our suggested solutions enable the construction of model based projections of species distribution dynamics even if critical dynamic information is lacking the lack of knowledge compromises the resolution of biotic processes in the model and therefore the reliability of the model projections however due to the included model scenario analysis steps 1 and 6 and the detailed dynamic analysis of different parameter sets step 5 the framework is able to identify parameter sets that are in accordance with the available data and to estimate their impact on model projections thus it provides crucial insight in the impact of biotic factors on the spatial dynamics of species and can reveal critical sources of uncertainty in the following we discuss the merits and limitations of the framework on the example of the case study 5 1 performance of the modelling framework the suitability model c sdm step 3 reproduced the current distribution of the butterfly in the european alps the carpathian mountains and in the baltics fig 2b and corroborated results from schweiger et al 2008 that environmentally suitable habitat also exists far beyond the presently observed distribution which however is inaccessible due to host plant absence fig 2a projections of the equilibrium solution step 4 performed better because they revealed dispersal limitation which restricted butterfly projections to areas close to the observed butterfly range fig 2c the stochastic dynamic projections of the h sdm step 5 indicated a potential for colonization of mountainous regions adjacent to the alps where the butterfly currently is not present fig 2d however they also showed absence of the butterfly in the baltic area where it is presently observed we hypothesize that these discrepancies to the observed occupancy pattern could be caused by parameter uncertainty e g from unresolved correlations by the impact of land use excluding the butterfly from potentially suitable areas by a secondary host plant or that the baltic boloria titania population might be a sink in the species colonization extinction dynamics these points are discussed in the following 5 2 parameter uncertainty and correlation there are two sources of parameter uncertainty in the calibration i alternative states and ii equifinality as explained below they might also be the reason why we could not identify a strong impact of calibration scenarios on the parameter values fig 4 we identified two alternative solutions see sec 4 2 a static solution without colonization extinction dynamics corresponding rates are nearly zero and a dynamic solution with colonization extinction dynamics and corresponding nonzero rates the static solution represented the c sdm by suppressing dynamics the existence of the dynamic solution indicates that the abiotic niche described by the c sdm could not explain the entire distribution of the butterfly and thus points to the importance of biotic processes for this distribution the dynamic solution could not be uniquely resolved by model calibration instead we found alternative parameter sets fig 3 that equally well explained the observed butterfly occupancy pattern equifinality equifinality beven and freer 2001 indicates over parameterization dormann et al 2012 and is the result of insufficient information content in the data to parameterize the biotic processes in this study one possible reason for a reduction in information content could have been the sequential model calibration if the calibrated c sdm had incorrectly attributed biotic information to environmental factors e g due to covariation we had to assume reduced explanatory power of the latter calibrated dynamic h sdm therefore we particularly aimed at avoiding over fitting while constructing the c sdm sec 3 2 3 we assume that the c sdm calibration had not strongly reduced information content for the latter h sdm equilibrium calibration instead we consider correlation among the dynamic parameters as the main calibration problem the derived parameter z eq 9 reflects this correlation as it can be interpreted as a descriptor of grid cell turnover i e the ratio between rates of local colonization of empty grid cells and extinction from occupied grid cells in the equilibrium calibration procedure step 4 this ratio cannot be resolved further because equal numbers of grid cells had to be colonized and vacated in order to keep occupancy constant single snapshot occupancy data provide too limited information to resolve correlated biotic processes gu and swihart 2003 therefore the subsequent stochastic dynamic occupancy projections step 5 are essential to gauge consequences of alternative suitable parameterization for model projections 5 3 dispersal ability the stochastic dynamic occupancy projections produced variations in the average grid cell occupancy fig 5 even if the turn over parameter z was constant this variance arose from insufficient knowledge about dispersal in combination with two simplifications of the equilibrium calibration procedure compared to the full dynamics of the h sdm the equilibrium calibration firstly calibrated colonization probability of empty grid cells from the species dispersal ability during a single time step eq 5 dispersal in several steps was ignored secondly being based on the first moment approximation eq 4 the equilibrium calibration procedure could not account for variability from immigration extinction stochasticity hanski 1994 in contrast the dynamic projections allowed for subsequent random colonization events that were not immediately compensated by extinctions thus variance in projected occurrence that could not be resolved by parameter z can be attributed to uncertainty about dispersal abilities of the butterfly including its stochasticity our analysis therefore identifies dispersal as a critical source of uncertainty in our case study 5 4 projected range expansion around the european alps does land use limit the butterfly range the stochastic dynamic occupancy projections of the h sdm led to an extended range beyond the currently observed butterfly range in the european alps compare fig 2a d this challenges our assumption that currently the butterfly population is in equilibrium however given the long term and intensive monitoring effort we trust the observed absences of boloria titania and believe that the population indeed is in equilibrium more likely land use might have limited the observed species range but was not explicitly considered in the model we found that taking into account land use impact in the equilibrium calibration procedure affected the dispersal related parameters Œ± and x fig 3 the slightly expanded geographic range in mountainous regions predicted by the dynamic projections fig 2d compared to the equilibrium calibration procedure fig 2c likely indicates the butterfly s potential geographic range without impact of anthropogenic land use thus our analysis identifies land use as a potentially important factor for the distribution of boloria titania which agrees with findings for high latitude butterflies eskildsen et al 2013 5 5 the baltic boloria titania is potentially a sink population the stochastic dynamic occupancy projections provided new important insight in the existence of the baltic butterfly population we found that the butterfly population in the baltic states and finland was projected very likely to go extinct this result conflicts with the observed presence of titania s fritillary in the baltic states and southern finland there are two likely explanations for this discrepancy firstly the baltic and finnish butterfly populations are potentially oligophagous and might utilize viola species as a secondary host plant see supplementary information in p√∂yry et al 2008 for the observed feeding behaviour in finland and northern europe since we do not have reliable distribution data for viola species nor detailed information about the possible density dependent benefits of a secondary host plant we could not consider such effects in the model a secondary host plant might enhance the suitable butterfly area secondly the baltic and finnish populations might be connected to larger populations in russia kudrna et al 2011 for these populations reliable occupancy data is not available which restricts the spatial extent of our study however the impact of the spatial extent on parameter estimates including or not the baltic and finnish populations and the eastern border see fig 3 was low because only grid cells at the eastern border of the modeled area should be affected moilanen 2002 given the fact that ignoring the eastern butterfly range in our dynamic occupancy projections the baltic and finnish populations likely went extinct in the model we hypothesize that these populations could be sink populations connected to a source east of the modeled area moilanen 2002 on biased occupancy projections due to disconnection of patches source sink dynamics have been considered one potential source of bias to static species distribution models but can be revealed with demographic approaches pagel and schurr 2012 6 conclusions we present a hybrid modelling and calibration framework to project species distributions taking into account demographic processes and dispersal the framework is distinct in its attempt to be calibrated from widely available data on geographic distributions of species and environmental factors relying on rather low data requirements the framework can potentially be applied to a wide range of species however the small information base also reveals knowledge gaps that impact model projection reliability a problematic knowledge gap is the lack of data to inform spatial population dynamics e g time series of species distributions or species specific functional trait information particularly the available information is not sufficient to resolve correlation among colonization and extinction processes this causes uncertainty in the species dispersal ability and subsequently in the range projections even assuming temporally constant environmental conditions under environmental change we expect uncertainties to even increase to cope with the lack of knowledge we suggest within the framework extensive and detailed analyses of the data and structural gaps step 1 and of the results of the modelling and calibration steps 2 5 fig 1 in particular step 5 the stochastic dynamic projections of the h sdm is essential as it selects the dynamic biotic processes species extinction and colonization rates including dispersal distances that most likely reflect the data the model scenario analysis step 6 is important as it allows evaluating projection reliability model scenarios that provide biased projections of current occupancy should not be ignored but thoroughly investigated as they provide insights in confounding factors and achievable projection reliability executing the steps of the framework narrows the parameter range and reveals critical knowledge gaps that can compromise projection reliability e g the lack of data to inform the population dynamics or dispersal processes further it can explain mechanisms that drive the propagation of uncertainties with the presently available data the framework cannot be expected to provide highly reliable quantitative projections of species distributions instead it can enhance mechanistic understanding of the species range dynamics estimate the reliability of species range projections and reveal which additional data would improve projections this is often the best possible achievement to support management facing data limitations singer et al 2011 very importantly this framework provides potential

25317,agricultural activities are one of the leading causes of influencing deforestation and land degradation which desperately needs reasonable land use planning schemes land use planning is a beforehand task that needs to estimate the possible eco hydrological consequences of land use changes at the watershed scale the method based on combination of land use scenarios and hydrological model simulations usually provides guidance suggestions for land use planning and land management however the setting of land use scenarios often ignores the objective natural conditions in local region in this paper a suitability evaluation method was developed which synthetically considered the topographic soil meteorological and water supply conditions on the agriculture land to obtain land use planning scenarios in the upstream of the huaihe river basin subsequently the soil and water assessment tool swat model was employed to evaluate the influences of land use scenarios on eco hydrological responses model calibration and validation were performed based on the land use status in 2000 after which the validated simulations were conducted based on the planning scenarios suitability evaluation results demonstrated that 40 83 of the existing agriculture land in 2000 was considered to be unsuitable especially in the northern part of the studied area where plantations of grass and forest were implemented to derive the short term and long term land planning scenarios respectively the swat model with daily time step was set up for the studied area it simulated reasonably the relationship between rainfall and runoff with the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values of 0 72 and 0 66 for the calibration and the validation periods relative changes of eco hydrological components simulated by the validated swat model were analyzed both temporally and spatially the simulation results counted at multiple temporal scales showed that both short term and long term land use planning operations reduced the maximum runoff and total water yield as well as the total sediment loads meanwhile increased the evapotranspiration for runoff components the decreasing surface runoff and the increasing groundwater were much more significant than the increasing lateral flow sub basin analyses revealed that the simulated changes in eco hydrological responses varied spatially whereas the decreases in total water yield and the surface runoff and the increase in evapotranspiration were closely related to the percentages of de farming in sub basins overall the eco hydrological responses to long term land use planning were more profound than that to short term land use planning this study provides a synthetic suitability evaluation method for creating land use planning scenario which overcomes the shortcoming of traditional way of assigning land use scenario that being lack of objectivity keywords swat model land use planning land suitability evaluation eco hydrological responses 1 introduction more and more demands of food fuel fiber water and other resources coming from the rapid development of human society have resulted in a great pressure on ecological system of the many human activities agriculture may be one of the major causes of the rapid deforestation and land degradation especially in developing counties barbier 2004 dolisca 2005 giliba et al 2011 marshall 2012 this is also the case in china the fast growing economy in china is at the cost of environmental degradation to address this issue china s central government has launched the so called grain for green project ggp since 1999 corchero et al 2013 the ggp is to resume forest system so as to reduce the soil erosion on sloping farmland where the farmland is actually inefficient after a long term implementation of the ggp according to the observed data of 11 rivers in china runoff and soil erosion significantly decreased li et al 2012 therefore there is no doubt that the appropriate planning policy for agriculture land does provide an effective way to protect the ecological environment and promote the sustainable development of human society land suitability evaluation can provide a reliable way to assist in land use planning at a regional level since it takes into account various limiting factors that are essential for specific land use types while the ggp only emphasizes the importance of slope gradient wang et al 2007 land suitability evaluation is by broadly definition identifying the spatial appropriateness for possible land uses according to geo environmental conditions hopkins 1977 agriculture land suitability evaluation represents an important issue in many research papers and associated applications gong et al 2012 hossain and das 2010 kurtener 2008 mendas et al 2013 the final evaluation result usually presents a map that spatially allocates the agriculture land into different suitability classes in such terms as most suitable moderately suitable and not suitable all the information can provide evidence for constructing the land use planning scenario quantitatively and qualitatively hydrological models can present a better interpretation of the interactions among the various physical systems in a watershed and predict the eco hydrological responses to proposed land use planning scenarios bedient et al 2007 beven 1989 distributed and semi distributed hydrological models show better performances in such applications since they can take account of the spatial inhomogeneity of the underlying surface kinouchi and watanabe 2012 the soil and water assessment tool swat model arnold and fohrer 2005 arnold et al 1998 srinivasan et al 1998 developed by the united states department of agriculture usda in 1994 is a typical semi distributed eco hydrological model that can simulate long term surface and subsurface discharge sediment deposition nutrient transport and transformation processes under varying soil conditions land use types and management conditions numerous studies have used scenario based methods to quantify the impacts of land use scenarios on hydrologic components with swat model cai et al 2012 deng et al 2015 githui et al 2009 memarian et al 2014 nie et al 2011 wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 designs of these land use scenarios mainly include extreme land use patterns historical land use information and trend extrapolation of historical land use ignoring the guidance of land use planning in practice even for those studies which considered the policy of land use planning land use scenarios seemed to be rather simplistic and qualitative however the land use planning as a beforehand task should conform to objective reality in local regions complex issues involving meteorology topography landform etc need to be taken into account when making decisions due to the unreasonable utilization of land resources the huaihe river basin has experienced severe soil erosion during recent decades particularly in the upper mountainous regions cai et al 2012 in this study a land suitability evaluation for agriculture land in the upstream watershed of the huaihe river basin is presented multiple criteria that involve terrain soil properties climatic conditions and water sources are included for the evaluation process given the land use status in 2000 land use planning scenarios are developed by identifying and recovering the unreasonable areas eco hydrological responses are evaluated by using a validated swat model for land use in 2000 as well as the land planning scenarios the influences of the land planning scenarios on eco hydrological components are analyzed both temporally and spatially 2 data and methodologies 2 1 study area the huaihe river basin 30 55 36 36 n 111 55 121 25 e is situated in the eastern part of china the changtaiguan ctg watershed is located in the upstream regions of the huaihe river basin and was chosen as the study area for this paper fig 1 the ctg watershed has a drainage area of 3012 33 km2 the southwestern upstream watershed is characterized as a mountain range with a maximum elevation of 1110 m above sea level the central and eastern downstream regions are dominated by plains the ctg watershed is a subtropical zone with an annual average temperature of 15 c the long term average annual rainfall varies from 800 mm in the north to 1125 mm in the south since the watershed is dominated by a monsoon climate approximately 60 of the annual rainfall occurs during the flood season from june to september ctg is an agricultural dominant watershed with intense rice and wheat cultivation occupying nearly half of the whole study area light silty soils sandy loam and a few pockets of silty clay are distributed in the watershed 2 2 land suitability evaluation land suitability evaluation can act as an effective tool for scientific establishment of land use planning scenario the evaluated land use type was agricultural land since it was the dominant land use type in study area 2 2 1 evaluation criteria and scores due to a large number of qualitative and quantitative evaluation criteria involved in decision making land suitability evaluation has been identified as a multiple criteria decision making mcdm issue elkawy et al 2010 reshmidevi et al 2009 among numerous evaluation criteria the physical criteria compared to the socio economic criteria remain relatively stable dent and young 1982 fao 1976 triantafilis et al 2001 in this study topographic soil meteorological and water supply conditions were considered to be the physical criteria affecting the allocation of agriculture land use the specific evaluation criteria included elevation slope geomorphology soil organic matter soil drainage condition soil ph mean annual rainfall accumulated temperature of 10 c and distance from water source all these evaluation criteria came from the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc http www resdc cn and were projected into the same scale boundary extent resolution and spatial reference and were resampled to a uniform size of 30 m many evaluation criteiria measured at different scales and different approaches were not in the same dimension to solve this problem five limitation degrees introduced by the food and agricultural organization fao 1976 were used to reconcile the dimensions of different criteiria in this study and for each degree zhang 1989 introduced a limitation score table 1 for agriculture land the higher the limitation scores the more restrictions for the allocation of agriculture land accordingly the classification of the criteria and the limitation scores in this study are presented in table 2 2 2 2 criteria weights analytic hierarchy process ahp was used in this paper to determine the weights of evaluation criteria ahp was firstly developed as an effective tool for mcdm because it allows policymakers to solve complex problems in a hierarchical framework integrating the relationships of the goal criteria and sub criteria saaty 1980 ahp technique has played a vital role in determining the criteria weights in many land suitability evaluation cases aydi et al 2016 chandio et al 2011 rasoul et al 2013 saadabadi et al 2015 there were three hierarchies named goal hierarchy criteria hierarchy and sub criteria hierarchy in terms of land suitability evaluation for agriculture in this study fig 2 depicts the tree hierarchies of all considered criteria the pairwise comparison and consistency verification followed the steps in previous researches nazeri et al 2014 olaniyi et al 2015 2 2 3 evaluation model the total score for each land use unit was derived by integrating the criteria scores and criteria weights the weighted linear combination wlc chakma 2014 dubovyk et al 2014 mohit and ali 2006 nazeri et al 2014 was applied to yield a total score map using the following expression 1 s j i 1 n c i j w i j 1 2 m i 1 2 n where sj is the total score of the j th land unit cij is the score for the i th criterion in the j th land unit wi is the i th criterion weight that is determined by the ahp method n is the number of criteria m is the number of land units in study area the total score was finally distributed in the whole study area natural breaks jenks is a classification method to group the spatial distributed score into different categories aretano et al 2015 baz et al 2009 berry and bendor 2015 paulekas et al 2009 this method has the advantages of minimizing the statistical variation within each data class and maximizing the statistical variation between classes simultaneously the final suitability map was classified into 4 levels in terms of fao fao 1976 suitability classes s1 highly suitable s2 moderately suitable s3 marginally suitable and n unsuitable 2 3 land use planning scenario the agriculture land suitability evaluation was just a hypothetical judgment based on the physical properties of each land unit rather than the inevitable implementation of the land planning affecting by the socio economic activities the certain development policy for land use may to some extent be against the will of land suitability practical land use patterns in several developing stages are the consequence of those human activities during the long process of land use transition and must be taken into consideration when making the land use planning thus an overlay analysis method was introduced by overlapping the land use status in 2000 and agriculture land suitability map land use planning should be designed aimed at converting the marginally suitable and unsuitable agriculture land because continued use of these unreasonable lands would increase severe desertification problems wang et al 2007 the agriculture land in 2000 which belongs to the suitability classes n and s3 was converted to grass land or forest land meanwhile the remaining regions maintained the status quo the application of these performances then yielded short term and long term land use planning scenarios respectively 2 4 input data and swat model set up swat is a physically process based hydrological model which allows various processes such as streamflow sediment nutrients or pesticides to be simulated within a watershed to spatially characterize the inhomogeneity the swat model delineates a watershed into a number of sub basins which were subsequently divided into hydrologic response units hrus based on soil types and land use data fig 3 in swat model hurs are basic simulation units of the land phase of the hydrological cycle and control the total yield of streamflow sediment pesticide and nutrient to the main channel in corresponding sub basin afterwards the routing phase converges the land phase results to the watershed outlet through the channel network in this study the swat model was used to simulate the daily streamflow in study area to construct and execute the swat model a digital elevation model dem together with land use and soil type data is required according to fig 3 weather data including rainfall temperature wind speed etc are also used the dem data were downloaded from the website of the u s geological survey usgs with a spatial resolution of 90 m http srtm csi cgiar org the altitude varies from 1110 m in the mountainous areas to 69 m at the outlet ctg the watershed was delineated into 15 sub basins a land use map in year 2000 was collected from the huaihe river water resources commission with a grid size of 30 m http www resdc cn five categories of land use were identified for this study area as shown in fig 4 agricultural land agrl 48 53 forest land frst 44 4 3 grass land past 2 38 water bodies watr 2 72 and urban land urbn 1 94 soil data in study area were obtained from the harmonized world soil database hwsd with a spatial resolution of 30 arc seconds nachtergaele et al 2009 the hwsd provides more than 16000 different soil type units and covers the existing updates of soil attributes worldwide since the default soil database within the swat model does not include the soil information in study area user defined soil parameters were calculated using the method proposed by jiang et al 2014 fig 5 exhibits the distribution of soil types in study area according to the fao 90 soil classification cumulic anthrosols atc and eutric planosols ple are the two main soil types with area percentages of 30 01 and 23 45 respectively the swat model uses a weather generator to simulate the climatic characteristics of the watershed wind speed relative humidity minimum and maximum air temperatures and solar radiation were obtained from the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr which was designed based on the forecast system of the national centers for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar to provide an estimation for a set of climate variability from 1979 to the present day weather stations w3231138 w3231134 and w3261138 were included in studied area to calculate the statistical parameters of weather generator a rain gauge network consisting of 17 gauges exists in the study area as illustrated in fig 1 daily observed rainfall data from these 17 gauges were retrieved from 1995 to 2003 were used while other climatic data were simulated by the weather generator over the simulation period 2 5 swat model calibration and validation due to the high spatial heterogeneity within the hydrological processes simulated by the swat model determining the values of numerous parameters via manual calibration will be time consuming therefore the application of an automatic calibration method to estimate the model parameters that minimize the errors between the observed and simulated results is necessary the shuffled complex evolution university of arizona sce ua algorithm duan et al 1992 is used here as an auto calibration method the sce ua algorithm has been applied to multiple physically based hydrological models gan and biftu 1996 luce and cundy 1994 sorooshian et al 1993 and has exhibited good performances that are similar to other global search procedures cooper et al 1997 jeon et al 2014 kuczera 1997 thyer et al 1999 daily streamflow simulations were performed within the time span from 1995 to 2003 using daily observed flow data at the outlet of ctg one year 1995 was selected as the model warm up period the period from 1996 to 1999 was used for the model calibration and the remaining data from 2000 to 2003 were employed for validation multiple statistical values including the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the coefficient of determination r 2 and the percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 were used in this study to evaluate the model performances sediment process was not calibrated due to the lack of relevant data hydrological models generally need to be calibrated against corresponding historical observed data before it put into use unfortunately the ungauged issue usually hampers the applications of the swat model in some fields such as sediment and nutrition simulating in this study an alternative solution was to directly reference the sediment parameters form the previous study cai et al 2012 in the upper huaihe river basin 3 results 3 1 agriculture land suitability evaluation results the results of sub criteria weights are displayed in table 3 the consistency ratios of decisions in pairwise comparisons were less than 0 1 revealing that judgments expressed logical consistency and acceptability among all the criteria soil conditions are the most important factors affecting the location of the agriculture land in the study area the suitability evaluation results of agriculture land are presented in table 4 and fig 6 according to eq 1 the suitability scores of the study area range from 0 48 to 17 11 the higher the suitability score the fewer limitation for the allocation of agriculture land it could be seen from table 4 that 7 27 of the study area 218 99 km2 has high suitability s1 34 56 1041 06 km2 of the study area has moderate suitability s2 34 28 1032 63 km2 of the study area has marginal suitability s3 and 23 89 719 65 km2 of the study area is not suitable for agriculture n the entire study area is found to have a considerable amount of land that is unsuitable for agriculture e g land labeled with s3 and n classes most of which is located in the northern and southwest part of the study area as illustrated in fig 6 less than half of the area s1 and s2 is suitable for agriculture location which is distributed aside the mainstream of the huaihe river in general north part of the huaihe river is more suitable for agriculture than that south part for since there are more lands categorized into s1 class in northern huaihe river 3 2 analysis of land planning scenario the agriculture land suitability in land use 2000 is identified by overlapping the land suitability results map over the land use 2000 map statistical results of agriculture land suitability in land use 2000 are summarized in table 5 nearly 60 s1 s2 of the agriculture land in 2000 shows good suitability indicating that the development of agriculture land is reasonable in 2000 however it does not mean that there is no need to develop a land planning scenario what cannot be neglected however is that 40 83 n s3 of the agriculture land in 2000 is used unsuitably moreover this situation would be even worse if no preventive measures are taken the short term and long term land planning scenarios are obtained in fig 7 to analyze the land use changes in more detail the reductions of agriculture land in each sub basin are counted in table 6 it could be found that the de farming occurred mainly in sub basin 2 and 4 locating in the northern part of the study area the proportions of de farming in those two sub basins are 36 44 and 54 47 for land use planning respectively as a consequence there is a total de farming area of 606 60 km2 accounting for 20 14 of the whole watershed 3 3 analysis of swat model performances for streamflow simulation the calibrated parameters for daily streamflow simulation in this study are presented in table 7 the statistical indicators of model performances for daily and monthly streamflow simulations at the outlet of the ctg watershed are summarized in table 8 the daily nse value is 0 72 for the calibration period and 0 66 for the validation period these two values of the daily nse both exceed 0 65 which is considered to be satisfactory according to performance ratings for evaluation statistics recommended by moriasi et al 2007 the daily r 2 values are 0 85 and 0 81 for the calibration and validation periods respectively indicating that the simulated daily streamflow is in good agreement with the observed data the pbias values indicated that the swat model overestimated the daily streamflow for calibration and validation by 7 74 and 14 18 visual comparisons between the observed and simulated daily streamflows for both calibration and validation periods are shown in fig 8 from which it can be observed that the swat model could simulate well the temporal variation of streamflow at daily time scale in addition monthly model performances were evaluated based on the daily calibration results all the statistical indicators suggest that the model performances at monthly time scale are much better than that at daily time scale in general the streamflow simulation results obtained from the swat model at the outlet ctg demonstrate a reasonable applicability 3 4 analysis of eco hydrological responses land use change is a key factor affecting both the water quantity and quality at the watershed scale the validated swat model was used to quantify the influences of land use changes on eco hydrological responses taking the land use in 2000 as the baseline scenario and the short term and long term land planning as the affected scenarios percentage changes in eco hydrological components were analyzed both temporally and spatially 3 4 1 eco hydrological responses at different time scales 1 daily scale flash floods can aggravate the soil erosion thus worsening the eco system and potential risks sustainable land use management is an effective non structural measure to defend floods the maximum 1 day runoff 1d max maximum 3 day runoff 3d max and maximum 7 day runoff 7d max in each year were chosen as flood indicators to assess the effects of land use planning schemes on flood control table 9 shows the percentage changes of those flood indicators simulated by two land use planning scenarios with respect to the baseline scenario land use in 2000 generally all flood indicators are observed to decrease for both short term and long term land use planning scenarios and better performances for flood control could be obtained from the long term land use planning for instance the relative changes of maximum 1 day runoff caused by long term land use planning range from 36 08 to 8 94 greater than the 17 72 to 1 25 changes caused by short term land use planning the average maximum 1 day runoff decrease by 6 29 and 20 76 for short term and long term land use planning respectively the reductions of the maximum 3 day runoff and maximum 7 day runoff are not so significant as that of the maximum 1 day runoff averaged reductions are 6 15 and 18 81 in the maximum 3 day runoff 6 09 and 17 68 in the maximum 7 day runoff for the two land use planning scenarios 1 average monthly scale average monthly model outputs present the seasonal variations of eco hydrological responses fig 9 shows the average monthly changes in eco hydrological components between land use 2000 and land use planning scenarios for all seasons an increased evapotranspiration et trend and a decreased total water yield wyld trend are detected under both short term and long term land use planning scenarios in fig 9 a and b monthly wyld declines with an extent between 2 51 and 25 60 for the short term land use planning and between 10 39 and 41 60 for the long term land use planning meanwhile the et rises with a range from 5 57 to 11 54 and 10 98 to 22 20 for short term and long term land use planning respectively the results also indicate that more profound changes in wyld and et appear under the long term land use planning scenario than under the short term land use planning scenario the total water yield is composed of surface runoff surq lateral flow latq and groundwater gwq in swat model output it can be noted that both land use planning scenarios induce the decrease of monthly surq in fig 9 c and the increases of monthly latq and gwq in fig 9 d and e at the same time and the changes in surq and gwq are more significant with the average values of 23 02 and 84 63 respectively zhou et al 2013 also reported that surface runoff and groundwater were found more sensitive to land use changes in addition remarkable monthly changes are occurring under the long term land use planning scenario when compared with the short term one except for the april and march this exception suggests that the ability of forests to recharge the groundwater would be restricted due to the low antecedent soil conditions at the beginning of the flood season april and the ending of the dry season march in terms of seasonal changes significant differences of the main runoff components are found in later dry weather january march and early flood season april may while slight changes are observed in flood season from june to july suggesting that the high precipitation would weaken the impacts of land use planning on the hydrological responses fig 9 f presents the changes of monthly sediment loads under two land use planning scenarios all monthly sediment loads agree on a distinct decrease under both short term and long term land use planning scenarios remarkable declines are found to occur in the long term land use planning scenario especially in november and january with the decreases of 64 29 and 63 64 1 annual scale annual wyld in fig 10 a simulated by land use planning scenarios exhibits a downward by 4 67 to 38 82 as compared with that simulated by baseline land use scenario conversely the annual et in fig 10 b appears an increase trend by 5 87 to 18 79 as a consequence of land use planning management not unexpectedly the long term land use planning scenario still results in more severe impacts than the short term scenario general annual changes in hydrological components in fig 10 c e driven by those two land use planning scenarios completely agree with the average monthly results exhibiting the decrease of surq and increases of latq and gwq over all years among the three runoff components the annual surq in fig 10 c and gwq in fig 10 e are much more susceptible to land use changes with the change rates varying from 41 09 to 6 53 and 14 68 to 71 35 respectively as well the changes driven by long term land use planning are remarkably higher than that driven by short term scenario except for the results of annual gwq in the year 1999 the consistent decreases of annual sediment driven by the two land use planning scenarios have been found in fig 10 f furthermore the decline caused by long term land planning falls between 52 88 and 60 00 with an average drop of 57 07 and is more prominent than that caused by short term land use planning in the range between 45 96 and 58 52 with an average decrease of 51 81 3 4 2 eco hydrological responses at sub basin scale the average annual changes in eco hydrological components resulted from short term and long term land use planning are counted at the sub basin scale in fig 11 in general the land use planning scenarios induce the decreases of average annual wyld 50 85 to 0 01 and the increases of average annual et 0 01 52 26 in all sub basins it can be seen that the most striking differences are all found in sub basin 4 for wyld and et under both land use planning scenarios moreover the spatial changes are strongly related to the percentages of de farming in table 6 meaning that the larger percentage of de farming the sub basin has the more dramatic the decline of average annual wyld and the increase of average annual et in that sub basin are the alterations of the three runoff components surq latq and gwq are unevenly distributed at sub basin scale according to fig 11 c1 e1 and c2 e2 the yields of surq in all sub basins agree on a reduction trend in consequence of land use planning scenarios leading to the decreases in the range of 0 01 to 58 46 the changes in average annual latq spatially range from decrease of 4 42 to increase of 11 21 for short term scenario decrease of 27 48 to increase of 26 52 for long term scenario the long term land use planning scenario can lead to consistent increases 8 10 296 75 in gwq for all sub basins while the short term land use planning even causes slight decreases in some sub basins among these runoff components only the surq changes have negative correlation with the de farming percentages it means that the surq can be affected directly by the land use change while the changes of latq and gw are not only controlled by land use changes but also regulated by other spatial factors such as soil properties and shallow aquifer characteristics according to kiniry et al 2005 according to the average annual results obtained from the short term land use planning the sediment loads in fig 11 f1 decrease in most sub basins but keep unchanged in sub basin 12 due to its negligible newly built grass land in table 6 however all sub basins without exception show remarkable decreases 70 42 to 6 53 in average annual sediment under the long term land use planning scenario in fig 11 f2 spatially the long term land use planning always shows more obvious influences on eco hydrological responses than the short term land use planning whether in the increasing or the decreasing situations 4 discussion 4 1 land suitability results and land use planning scenarios the land suitability evaluation for agriculture purpose was conducted to illustrate the different degrees of suitability and their spatial representations in ctg watershed it was evident that the suitability classifications had spatial distribution characteristics in fig 6 the highly suitable and moderately suitable categories were mainly located along the banks of the mainstream due to the stable water supply and flat terrain in study watershed the northern and southwestern regions near the watershed border were observed to have coverage of marginally suitable and unsuitable lands for agriculture following from the weighing results of the ahp analysis the restrictions on the allocation of agriculture land could be explained by steep slope and poor soil properties consistent with previous studies yalew et al 2016 reported that the unsuitable lands were dominated by steep slope low percentage of soil water content and high level of soil stoniness the ggp is the most renowned land use planning to combat land degradation and desertification basically the ggp only calls for steep agriculture land slope 25 to be converted to vegetation in this study the land use planning could depend on more comprehensive information obtained from land suitability results rather than merely terrain slope however the land use planning should be implemented by considering the time efficiency and cost effectiveness though forest is recognized as the most ecological friendly coverage the long term land planning scenario in this study would take around 10 years for forests to grow to full maturity and require more investment wang et al 2007 argued that massive afforestation without considering the growth conditions would probably not achieve the expected ecological goals and even causing potential environmental problems the short term land use planning by contrast is more applicable for various natural conditions and needs much lower operational costs inevitably contradiction always exists between ecological targets and economic benefits as suggested by wang et al 2007 the land use planning should follow the principles of gradual improvement and site specific recommendations 4 2 swat model simulation results meteorologic elements are the driving force for hydrological cycle however weather data except for precipitation are unavailable in study watershed in this case the weather generator embedded in the swat model generated the missing climatic data for daily stream flow simulation schuol and abbaspour 2007 the utilization of cfsr weather data to calculate the monthly statistics for the weather generator resulted in satisfactory daily flow results in this study in many applications of the swat model the cfsr data set have provided a valuable option in data scarce regions auerbach et al 2016 dile and srinivasan 2015 fuka et al 2015 however roth and lemann 2016 argued that the simulations with cfsr data resulted in far less results for streamflow than simulations with the conventional site data there might be room for improving the current model performances by the use of measured climate data from the meteorological stations in further work although the sediment simulation was performed without a real calibration procedure in this study due to the lack of relevant observed data it is still reasonable to reflect the sediment process in the study watershed the sediment related parameters were set according to a study cai et al 2012 that investigated the impacts of land use change on the sediment yield results in the upper huaihe river cai et al 2012 selected the xixian hydrological station as the case study site that located in the downstream of ctg station for the entire watershed in this study the simulated average annual sediment load was 355 t km2 which was higher than the estimate of average annual sediment load of 156 t km2 at xixian station in cai et al 2012 there is reason to believe the sediment prediction in this study since the ctg watershed is the source region with steep terrain that experiences higher soil erosion moreover the distributions of sediment yield in all sub basins ranged from 151 20 t km2 to 621 50 t km2 in this study showing good agreement with the spatial sediment results in cai et al 2012 4 3 eco hydrological implications land use planning could effectively reduce the flood peak flow according to the swat model simulation results flood represents one of the most severe natural disasters not only threatening the human life and property but also leading to ecological environment problems land degradation situations in the case study watershed are soil erosion caused by water zhao 2006 in particular flash floods accompanied by advancing intense kinematic water wave can induce considerable sediment transport guan et al 2015 floods have also been associated with water pollution zhang 2013 suggested that agricultural pollution significantly increased during a flood event moreover high magnitude flood events probably cause major damage to fisheries habitat stefanidis et al 2016 water resources are closely bound up with the functionality and health of ecological system land use planning has altered the runoff response by changing the allocation between surface runoff and groundwater more than 90 of the total water yield came from the surface runoff which is the main contribution to the streamflow in the study watershed while the ctg watershed relies on the surface runoff to maintain the streamflow dynamic the decreasing surface runoff caused by land use planning would cause potential drought risk worse still as presented by the simulation results in figs 9 b and 10 b restoring the cultivation to vegetation increased the evapotranspiration consumption in watershed which may add another opportunity for drought according to yan jun et al 2012 most of the huaihe river basin is prone to mild medium drought severe drought rarely occurred yan jun et al 2012 also declared that the negative impact of drought would be relieved by current situation of climate change all the more important then is to reveal the positive outcomes of land use planning from an ecological perspective within the whole watershed potential nonpoint source pollutants are transported by surface runoff haan et al 2006 the ctg watershed and even the whole huaihe river basin are identified as agricultural dominant regions and as a result the agricultural non point source pollution is causative of deterioration of the river water therefore both temporal and spatial decreases in surface runoff simulated by the swat model were linked to the decreased entrainment of nitrogen and phosphorus and the remission of water eutrophication groundwater is an important resource for drinking water supplies agricultural irrigation and social and economic development as well as for eco environment maintenance in semiarid watershed yang et al 2001 according to the survey hui et al 2010 the huaihe river basin has experienced the overexploitation of ground water which leads to a series of serious eco environmental problems such as land subsidence soil salinization water level drawdown and spring cutoff a significantly increased groundwater volume resulted from land use planning in this study could effectively alleviate the shortage of groundwater resources soil water loss has become the environmental and ecological issues of concern in the upstream of the huaihe river basin cai et al 2012 generally speaking soil erosion impairs the soil quality thereby diminishing the valuable diversity of plants animals and microbes pimentel and kounang 1998 pimentel 2006 concluded that soil erosion reduced the productivity of terrestrial ecosystems including soil water availability nutrient loss soil organic matter and soil depth sediment is generated from various soil erosion processes given that the sustainable erosion rate is less than 50 100 t km2 the short term and long term land planning scenarios in this study were able to reduce the sediment loads from 355 t km2 to 172 t km2 and 155 t km2 respectively which is considered to be in accord with the eco sustainable principles along with inflow of sediment into the river it would have adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems elevated sediment loads can directly affect the fish physiology fish behavior and fish populations anderson 1996 the huaihe is the third largest river in china with abundant fish resources in this study land use planning scenarios reduced the sediment loads both temporally and spatially thus the plantations of grass or forest are beneficial for protection and restoration of water ecosystem 5 conclusions 5 1 land planning scenario designing land use scenarios is a popular technique in planning and management consulting because it offers an opportunity for assessing the present situation and the rational development oriented situation in the future land suitability evaluation for each land unit is realized in a spatially explicit manner depending on a multiple criteria decision making approach which can provide a synthetic way to determine land planning scenario quantitatively and qualitatively a case study was carried out on a 3012 33 km2 watershed located in the headwater region of the huaihe river basin the physical criteria including elevation slope geomorphology etc were used to evaluate the suitability of agriculture the weights of all these criteria calculated by the ahp approach showed that soil organic matter and slope were important factors affecting the allocation of agriculture land by overlapping the land use map in 2000 and agriculture land suitability map 40 83 of agriculture land in the year 2000 was found to be inappropriate for agriculture therefore in those regions the de farming was performed while the remaining area remained unchanged to obtain the short term and long term land planning scenarios since the land suitability evaluation is a mcdm operation one of the most crucial components is the relative importance of each criterion however the weighting of the multiple criteria that was determined by ahp method in this study must have a certain subjective attitude which needs to be properly validated moreover social and economic factors influencing the specific land allocation cannot be ignored thus the land planning scenario presented in this study could be only regarded as a guideline for the area with slow evolution of urbanization 5 2 eco hydrological responses to land use changes the application of the swat model in the study area showed a satisfactory model performance in the daily streamflow simulation with the nse values are 0 72 for the calibration period and 0 66 for the validation period the good applicability of swat model in this study laid the foundation for investigating the possible effects of land use scenarios on eco hydrological responses taking the land use in 2000 as a baseline period and the short term and long term land planning scenarios as the affected periods land use scenarios were simulated separately to compare the differences of eco hydrological responses firstly the land use operations were able to reduce the maximum runoff then at monthly and annual time scales both land use planning scenarios reduced the total water yield and sdiment loads at the watershed outlet while increasing the evapotranspiration among the three components of runoff the surface runoff and groundwater were found much more sensitive to land use planning than lateral flow finally all the eco hydrological responses to both land use planning scenarios varied at different sub basins spatial changes in total water yield surface ruoff and evapotranspiration were highly correlated with the de farming percentages of sub basins taken together the long term land use planning may cause more significant changes in eco hydrological responses than short term land use planning what s more the land use planning scenarios in this study could provide a perspective way to solve the eco environment issues acknowledgments this research has been supported by non profit industry financial program of ministry of water resources of china no 201301066 national key research and development

25317,agricultural activities are one of the leading causes of influencing deforestation and land degradation which desperately needs reasonable land use planning schemes land use planning is a beforehand task that needs to estimate the possible eco hydrological consequences of land use changes at the watershed scale the method based on combination of land use scenarios and hydrological model simulations usually provides guidance suggestions for land use planning and land management however the setting of land use scenarios often ignores the objective natural conditions in local region in this paper a suitability evaluation method was developed which synthetically considered the topographic soil meteorological and water supply conditions on the agriculture land to obtain land use planning scenarios in the upstream of the huaihe river basin subsequently the soil and water assessment tool swat model was employed to evaluate the influences of land use scenarios on eco hydrological responses model calibration and validation were performed based on the land use status in 2000 after which the validated simulations were conducted based on the planning scenarios suitability evaluation results demonstrated that 40 83 of the existing agriculture land in 2000 was considered to be unsuitable especially in the northern part of the studied area where plantations of grass and forest were implemented to derive the short term and long term land planning scenarios respectively the swat model with daily time step was set up for the studied area it simulated reasonably the relationship between rainfall and runoff with the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values of 0 72 and 0 66 for the calibration and the validation periods relative changes of eco hydrological components simulated by the validated swat model were analyzed both temporally and spatially the simulation results counted at multiple temporal scales showed that both short term and long term land use planning operations reduced the maximum runoff and total water yield as well as the total sediment loads meanwhile increased the evapotranspiration for runoff components the decreasing surface runoff and the increasing groundwater were much more significant than the increasing lateral flow sub basin analyses revealed that the simulated changes in eco hydrological responses varied spatially whereas the decreases in total water yield and the surface runoff and the increase in evapotranspiration were closely related to the percentages of de farming in sub basins overall the eco hydrological responses to long term land use planning were more profound than that to short term land use planning this study provides a synthetic suitability evaluation method for creating land use planning scenario which overcomes the shortcoming of traditional way of assigning land use scenario that being lack of objectivity keywords swat model land use planning land suitability evaluation eco hydrological responses 1 introduction more and more demands of food fuel fiber water and other resources coming from the rapid development of human society have resulted in a great pressure on ecological system of the many human activities agriculture may be one of the major causes of the rapid deforestation and land degradation especially in developing counties barbier 2004 dolisca 2005 giliba et al 2011 marshall 2012 this is also the case in china the fast growing economy in china is at the cost of environmental degradation to address this issue china s central government has launched the so called grain for green project ggp since 1999 corchero et al 2013 the ggp is to resume forest system so as to reduce the soil erosion on sloping farmland where the farmland is actually inefficient after a long term implementation of the ggp according to the observed data of 11 rivers in china runoff and soil erosion significantly decreased li et al 2012 therefore there is no doubt that the appropriate planning policy for agriculture land does provide an effective way to protect the ecological environment and promote the sustainable development of human society land suitability evaluation can provide a reliable way to assist in land use planning at a regional level since it takes into account various limiting factors that are essential for specific land use types while the ggp only emphasizes the importance of slope gradient wang et al 2007 land suitability evaluation is by broadly definition identifying the spatial appropriateness for possible land uses according to geo environmental conditions hopkins 1977 agriculture land suitability evaluation represents an important issue in many research papers and associated applications gong et al 2012 hossain and das 2010 kurtener 2008 mendas et al 2013 the final evaluation result usually presents a map that spatially allocates the agriculture land into different suitability classes in such terms as most suitable moderately suitable and not suitable all the information can provide evidence for constructing the land use planning scenario quantitatively and qualitatively hydrological models can present a better interpretation of the interactions among the various physical systems in a watershed and predict the eco hydrological responses to proposed land use planning scenarios bedient et al 2007 beven 1989 distributed and semi distributed hydrological models show better performances in such applications since they can take account of the spatial inhomogeneity of the underlying surface kinouchi and watanabe 2012 the soil and water assessment tool swat model arnold and fohrer 2005 arnold et al 1998 srinivasan et al 1998 developed by the united states department of agriculture usda in 1994 is a typical semi distributed eco hydrological model that can simulate long term surface and subsurface discharge sediment deposition nutrient transport and transformation processes under varying soil conditions land use types and management conditions numerous studies have used scenario based methods to quantify the impacts of land use scenarios on hydrologic components with swat model cai et al 2012 deng et al 2015 githui et al 2009 memarian et al 2014 nie et al 2011 wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 designs of these land use scenarios mainly include extreme land use patterns historical land use information and trend extrapolation of historical land use ignoring the guidance of land use planning in practice even for those studies which considered the policy of land use planning land use scenarios seemed to be rather simplistic and qualitative however the land use planning as a beforehand task should conform to objective reality in local regions complex issues involving meteorology topography landform etc need to be taken into account when making decisions due to the unreasonable utilization of land resources the huaihe river basin has experienced severe soil erosion during recent decades particularly in the upper mountainous regions cai et al 2012 in this study a land suitability evaluation for agriculture land in the upstream watershed of the huaihe river basin is presented multiple criteria that involve terrain soil properties climatic conditions and water sources are included for the evaluation process given the land use status in 2000 land use planning scenarios are developed by identifying and recovering the unreasonable areas eco hydrological responses are evaluated by using a validated swat model for land use in 2000 as well as the land planning scenarios the influences of the land planning scenarios on eco hydrological components are analyzed both temporally and spatially 2 data and methodologies 2 1 study area the huaihe river basin 30 55 36 36 n 111 55 121 25 e is situated in the eastern part of china the changtaiguan ctg watershed is located in the upstream regions of the huaihe river basin and was chosen as the study area for this paper fig 1 the ctg watershed has a drainage area of 3012 33 km2 the southwestern upstream watershed is characterized as a mountain range with a maximum elevation of 1110 m above sea level the central and eastern downstream regions are dominated by plains the ctg watershed is a subtropical zone with an annual average temperature of 15 c the long term average annual rainfall varies from 800 mm in the north to 1125 mm in the south since the watershed is dominated by a monsoon climate approximately 60 of the annual rainfall occurs during the flood season from june to september ctg is an agricultural dominant watershed with intense rice and wheat cultivation occupying nearly half of the whole study area light silty soils sandy loam and a few pockets of silty clay are distributed in the watershed 2 2 land suitability evaluation land suitability evaluation can act as an effective tool for scientific establishment of land use planning scenario the evaluated land use type was agricultural land since it was the dominant land use type in study area 2 2 1 evaluation criteria and scores due to a large number of qualitative and quantitative evaluation criteria involved in decision making land suitability evaluation has been identified as a multiple criteria decision making mcdm issue elkawy et al 2010 reshmidevi et al 2009 among numerous evaluation criteria the physical criteria compared to the socio economic criteria remain relatively stable dent and young 1982 fao 1976 triantafilis et al 2001 in this study topographic soil meteorological and water supply conditions were considered to be the physical criteria affecting the allocation of agriculture land use the specific evaluation criteria included elevation slope geomorphology soil organic matter soil drainage condition soil ph mean annual rainfall accumulated temperature of 10 c and distance from water source all these evaluation criteria came from the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences resdc http www resdc cn and were projected into the same scale boundary extent resolution and spatial reference and were resampled to a uniform size of 30 m many evaluation criteiria measured at different scales and different approaches were not in the same dimension to solve this problem five limitation degrees introduced by the food and agricultural organization fao 1976 were used to reconcile the dimensions of different criteiria in this study and for each degree zhang 1989 introduced a limitation score table 1 for agriculture land the higher the limitation scores the more restrictions for the allocation of agriculture land accordingly the classification of the criteria and the limitation scores in this study are presented in table 2 2 2 2 criteria weights analytic hierarchy process ahp was used in this paper to determine the weights of evaluation criteria ahp was firstly developed as an effective tool for mcdm because it allows policymakers to solve complex problems in a hierarchical framework integrating the relationships of the goal criteria and sub criteria saaty 1980 ahp technique has played a vital role in determining the criteria weights in many land suitability evaluation cases aydi et al 2016 chandio et al 2011 rasoul et al 2013 saadabadi et al 2015 there were three hierarchies named goal hierarchy criteria hierarchy and sub criteria hierarchy in terms of land suitability evaluation for agriculture in this study fig 2 depicts the tree hierarchies of all considered criteria the pairwise comparison and consistency verification followed the steps in previous researches nazeri et al 2014 olaniyi et al 2015 2 2 3 evaluation model the total score for each land use unit was derived by integrating the criteria scores and criteria weights the weighted linear combination wlc chakma 2014 dubovyk et al 2014 mohit and ali 2006 nazeri et al 2014 was applied to yield a total score map using the following expression 1 s j i 1 n c i j w i j 1 2 m i 1 2 n where sj is the total score of the j th land unit cij is the score for the i th criterion in the j th land unit wi is the i th criterion weight that is determined by the ahp method n is the number of criteria m is the number of land units in study area the total score was finally distributed in the whole study area natural breaks jenks is a classification method to group the spatial distributed score into different categories aretano et al 2015 baz et al 2009 berry and bendor 2015 paulekas et al 2009 this method has the advantages of minimizing the statistical variation within each data class and maximizing the statistical variation between classes simultaneously the final suitability map was classified into 4 levels in terms of fao fao 1976 suitability classes s1 highly suitable s2 moderately suitable s3 marginally suitable and n unsuitable 2 3 land use planning scenario the agriculture land suitability evaluation was just a hypothetical judgment based on the physical properties of each land unit rather than the inevitable implementation of the land planning affecting by the socio economic activities the certain development policy for land use may to some extent be against the will of land suitability practical land use patterns in several developing stages are the consequence of those human activities during the long process of land use transition and must be taken into consideration when making the land use planning thus an overlay analysis method was introduced by overlapping the land use status in 2000 and agriculture land suitability map land use planning should be designed aimed at converting the marginally suitable and unsuitable agriculture land because continued use of these unreasonable lands would increase severe desertification problems wang et al 2007 the agriculture land in 2000 which belongs to the suitability classes n and s3 was converted to grass land or forest land meanwhile the remaining regions maintained the status quo the application of these performances then yielded short term and long term land use planning scenarios respectively 2 4 input data and swat model set up swat is a physically process based hydrological model which allows various processes such as streamflow sediment nutrients or pesticides to be simulated within a watershed to spatially characterize the inhomogeneity the swat model delineates a watershed into a number of sub basins which were subsequently divided into hydrologic response units hrus based on soil types and land use data fig 3 in swat model hurs are basic simulation units of the land phase of the hydrological cycle and control the total yield of streamflow sediment pesticide and nutrient to the main channel in corresponding sub basin afterwards the routing phase converges the land phase results to the watershed outlet through the channel network in this study the swat model was used to simulate the daily streamflow in study area to construct and execute the swat model a digital elevation model dem together with land use and soil type data is required according to fig 3 weather data including rainfall temperature wind speed etc are also used the dem data were downloaded from the website of the u s geological survey usgs with a spatial resolution of 90 m http srtm csi cgiar org the altitude varies from 1110 m in the mountainous areas to 69 m at the outlet ctg the watershed was delineated into 15 sub basins a land use map in year 2000 was collected from the huaihe river water resources commission with a grid size of 30 m http www resdc cn five categories of land use were identified for this study area as shown in fig 4 agricultural land agrl 48 53 forest land frst 44 4 3 grass land past 2 38 water bodies watr 2 72 and urban land urbn 1 94 soil data in study area were obtained from the harmonized world soil database hwsd with a spatial resolution of 30 arc seconds nachtergaele et al 2009 the hwsd provides more than 16000 different soil type units and covers the existing updates of soil attributes worldwide since the default soil database within the swat model does not include the soil information in study area user defined soil parameters were calculated using the method proposed by jiang et al 2014 fig 5 exhibits the distribution of soil types in study area according to the fao 90 soil classification cumulic anthrosols atc and eutric planosols ple are the two main soil types with area percentages of 30 01 and 23 45 respectively the swat model uses a weather generator to simulate the climatic characteristics of the watershed wind speed relative humidity minimum and maximum air temperatures and solar radiation were obtained from the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr which was designed based on the forecast system of the national centers for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar to provide an estimation for a set of climate variability from 1979 to the present day weather stations w3231138 w3231134 and w3261138 were included in studied area to calculate the statistical parameters of weather generator a rain gauge network consisting of 17 gauges exists in the study area as illustrated in fig 1 daily observed rainfall data from these 17 gauges were retrieved from 1995 to 2003 were used while other climatic data were simulated by the weather generator over the simulation period 2 5 swat model calibration and validation due to the high spatial heterogeneity within the hydrological processes simulated by the swat model determining the values of numerous parameters via manual calibration will be time consuming therefore the application of an automatic calibration method to estimate the model parameters that minimize the errors between the observed and simulated results is necessary the shuffled complex evolution university of arizona sce ua algorithm duan et al 1992 is used here as an auto calibration method the sce ua algorithm has been applied to multiple physically based hydrological models gan and biftu 1996 luce and cundy 1994 sorooshian et al 1993 and has exhibited good performances that are similar to other global search procedures cooper et al 1997 jeon et al 2014 kuczera 1997 thyer et al 1999 daily streamflow simulations were performed within the time span from 1995 to 2003 using daily observed flow data at the outlet of ctg one year 1995 was selected as the model warm up period the period from 1996 to 1999 was used for the model calibration and the remaining data from 2000 to 2003 were employed for validation multiple statistical values including the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the coefficient of determination r 2 and the percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 were used in this study to evaluate the model performances sediment process was not calibrated due to the lack of relevant data hydrological models generally need to be calibrated against corresponding historical observed data before it put into use unfortunately the ungauged issue usually hampers the applications of the swat model in some fields such as sediment and nutrition simulating in this study an alternative solution was to directly reference the sediment parameters form the previous study cai et al 2012 in the upper huaihe river basin 3 results 3 1 agriculture land suitability evaluation results the results of sub criteria weights are displayed in table 3 the consistency ratios of decisions in pairwise comparisons were less than 0 1 revealing that judgments expressed logical consistency and acceptability among all the criteria soil conditions are the most important factors affecting the location of the agriculture land in the study area the suitability evaluation results of agriculture land are presented in table 4 and fig 6 according to eq 1 the suitability scores of the study area range from 0 48 to 17 11 the higher the suitability score the fewer limitation for the allocation of agriculture land it could be seen from table 4 that 7 27 of the study area 218 99 km2 has high suitability s1 34 56 1041 06 km2 of the study area has moderate suitability s2 34 28 1032 63 km2 of the study area has marginal suitability s3 and 23 89 719 65 km2 of the study area is not suitable for agriculture n the entire study area is found to have a considerable amount of land that is unsuitable for agriculture e g land labeled with s3 and n classes most of which is located in the northern and southwest part of the study area as illustrated in fig 6 less than half of the area s1 and s2 is suitable for agriculture location which is distributed aside the mainstream of the huaihe river in general north part of the huaihe river is more suitable for agriculture than that south part for since there are more lands categorized into s1 class in northern huaihe river 3 2 analysis of land planning scenario the agriculture land suitability in land use 2000 is identified by overlapping the land suitability results map over the land use 2000 map statistical results of agriculture land suitability in land use 2000 are summarized in table 5 nearly 60 s1 s2 of the agriculture land in 2000 shows good suitability indicating that the development of agriculture land is reasonable in 2000 however it does not mean that there is no need to develop a land planning scenario what cannot be neglected however is that 40 83 n s3 of the agriculture land in 2000 is used unsuitably moreover this situation would be even worse if no preventive measures are taken the short term and long term land planning scenarios are obtained in fig 7 to analyze the land use changes in more detail the reductions of agriculture land in each sub basin are counted in table 6 it could be found that the de farming occurred mainly in sub basin 2 and 4 locating in the northern part of the study area the proportions of de farming in those two sub basins are 36 44 and 54 47 for land use planning respectively as a consequence there is a total de farming area of 606 60 km2 accounting for 20 14 of the whole watershed 3 3 analysis of swat model performances for streamflow simulation the calibrated parameters for daily streamflow simulation in this study are presented in table 7 the statistical indicators of model performances for daily and monthly streamflow simulations at the outlet of the ctg watershed are summarized in table 8 the daily nse value is 0 72 for the calibration period and 0 66 for the validation period these two values of the daily nse both exceed 0 65 which is considered to be satisfactory according to performance ratings for evaluation statistics recommended by moriasi et al 2007 the daily r 2 values are 0 85 and 0 81 for the calibration and validation periods respectively indicating that the simulated daily streamflow is in good agreement with the observed data the pbias values indicated that the swat model overestimated the daily streamflow for calibration and validation by 7 74 and 14 18 visual comparisons between the observed and simulated daily streamflows for both calibration and validation periods are shown in fig 8 from which it can be observed that the swat model could simulate well the temporal variation of streamflow at daily time scale in addition monthly model performances were evaluated based on the daily calibration results all the statistical indicators suggest that the model performances at monthly time scale are much better than that at daily time scale in general the streamflow simulation results obtained from the swat model at the outlet ctg demonstrate a reasonable applicability 3 4 analysis of eco hydrological responses land use change is a key factor affecting both the water quantity and quality at the watershed scale the validated swat model was used to quantify the influences of land use changes on eco hydrological responses taking the land use in 2000 as the baseline scenario and the short term and long term land planning as the affected scenarios percentage changes in eco hydrological components were analyzed both temporally and spatially 3 4 1 eco hydrological responses at different time scales 1 daily scale flash floods can aggravate the soil erosion thus worsening the eco system and potential risks sustainable land use management is an effective non structural measure to defend floods the maximum 1 day runoff 1d max maximum 3 day runoff 3d max and maximum 7 day runoff 7d max in each year were chosen as flood indicators to assess the effects of land use planning schemes on flood control table 9 shows the percentage changes of those flood indicators simulated by two land use planning scenarios with respect to the baseline scenario land use in 2000 generally all flood indicators are observed to decrease for both short term and long term land use planning scenarios and better performances for flood control could be obtained from the long term land use planning for instance the relative changes of maximum 1 day runoff caused by long term land use planning range from 36 08 to 8 94 greater than the 17 72 to 1 25 changes caused by short term land use planning the average maximum 1 day runoff decrease by 6 29 and 20 76 for short term and long term land use planning respectively the reductions of the maximum 3 day runoff and maximum 7 day runoff are not so significant as that of the maximum 1 day runoff averaged reductions are 6 15 and 18 81 in the maximum 3 day runoff 6 09 and 17 68 in the maximum 7 day runoff for the two land use planning scenarios 1 average monthly scale average monthly model outputs present the seasonal variations of eco hydrological responses fig 9 shows the average monthly changes in eco hydrological components between land use 2000 and land use planning scenarios for all seasons an increased evapotranspiration et trend and a decreased total water yield wyld trend are detected under both short term and long term land use planning scenarios in fig 9 a and b monthly wyld declines with an extent between 2 51 and 25 60 for the short term land use planning and between 10 39 and 41 60 for the long term land use planning meanwhile the et rises with a range from 5 57 to 11 54 and 10 98 to 22 20 for short term and long term land use planning respectively the results also indicate that more profound changes in wyld and et appear under the long term land use planning scenario than under the short term land use planning scenario the total water yield is composed of surface runoff surq lateral flow latq and groundwater gwq in swat model output it can be noted that both land use planning scenarios induce the decrease of monthly surq in fig 9 c and the increases of monthly latq and gwq in fig 9 d and e at the same time and the changes in surq and gwq are more significant with the average values of 23 02 and 84 63 respectively zhou et al 2013 also reported that surface runoff and groundwater were found more sensitive to land use changes in addition remarkable monthly changes are occurring under the long term land use planning scenario when compared with the short term one except for the april and march this exception suggests that the ability of forests to recharge the groundwater would be restricted due to the low antecedent soil conditions at the beginning of the flood season april and the ending of the dry season march in terms of seasonal changes significant differences of the main runoff components are found in later dry weather january march and early flood season april may while slight changes are observed in flood season from june to july suggesting that the high precipitation would weaken the impacts of land use planning on the hydrological responses fig 9 f presents the changes of monthly sediment loads under two land use planning scenarios all monthly sediment loads agree on a distinct decrease under both short term and long term land use planning scenarios remarkable declines are found to occur in the long term land use planning scenario especially in november and january with the decreases of 64 29 and 63 64 1 annual scale annual wyld in fig 10 a simulated by land use planning scenarios exhibits a downward by 4 67 to 38 82 as compared with that simulated by baseline land use scenario conversely the annual et in fig 10 b appears an increase trend by 5 87 to 18 79 as a consequence of land use planning management not unexpectedly the long term land use planning scenario still results in more severe impacts than the short term scenario general annual changes in hydrological components in fig 10 c e driven by those two land use planning scenarios completely agree with the average monthly results exhibiting the decrease of surq and increases of latq and gwq over all years among the three runoff components the annual surq in fig 10 c and gwq in fig 10 e are much more susceptible to land use changes with the change rates varying from 41 09 to 6 53 and 14 68 to 71 35 respectively as well the changes driven by long term land use planning are remarkably higher than that driven by short term scenario except for the results of annual gwq in the year 1999 the consistent decreases of annual sediment driven by the two land use planning scenarios have been found in fig 10 f furthermore the decline caused by long term land planning falls between 52 88 and 60 00 with an average drop of 57 07 and is more prominent than that caused by short term land use planning in the range between 45 96 and 58 52 with an average decrease of 51 81 3 4 2 eco hydrological responses at sub basin scale the average annual changes in eco hydrological components resulted from short term and long term land use planning are counted at the sub basin scale in fig 11 in general the land use planning scenarios induce the decreases of average annual wyld 50 85 to 0 01 and the increases of average annual et 0 01 52 26 in all sub basins it can be seen that the most striking differences are all found in sub basin 4 for wyld and et under both land use planning scenarios moreover the spatial changes are strongly related to the percentages of de farming in table 6 meaning that the larger percentage of de farming the sub basin has the more dramatic the decline of average annual wyld and the increase of average annual et in that sub basin are the alterations of the three runoff components surq latq and gwq are unevenly distributed at sub basin scale according to fig 11 c1 e1 and c2 e2 the yields of surq in all sub basins agree on a reduction trend in consequence of land use planning scenarios leading to the decreases in the range of 0 01 to 58 46 the changes in average annual latq spatially range from decrease of 4 42 to increase of 11 21 for short term scenario decrease of 27 48 to increase of 26 52 for long term scenario the long term land use planning scenario can lead to consistent increases 8 10 296 75 in gwq for all sub basins while the short term land use planning even causes slight decreases in some sub basins among these runoff components only the surq changes have negative correlation with the de farming percentages it means that the surq can be affected directly by the land use change while the changes of latq and gw are not only controlled by land use changes but also regulated by other spatial factors such as soil properties and shallow aquifer characteristics according to kiniry et al 2005 according to the average annual results obtained from the short term land use planning the sediment loads in fig 11 f1 decrease in most sub basins but keep unchanged in sub basin 12 due to its negligible newly built grass land in table 6 however all sub basins without exception show remarkable decreases 70 42 to 6 53 in average annual sediment under the long term land use planning scenario in fig 11 f2 spatially the long term land use planning always shows more obvious influences on eco hydrological responses than the short term land use planning whether in the increasing or the decreasing situations 4 discussion 4 1 land suitability results and land use planning scenarios the land suitability evaluation for agriculture purpose was conducted to illustrate the different degrees of suitability and their spatial representations in ctg watershed it was evident that the suitability classifications had spatial distribution characteristics in fig 6 the highly suitable and moderately suitable categories were mainly located along the banks of the mainstream due to the stable water supply and flat terrain in study watershed the northern and southwestern regions near the watershed border were observed to have coverage of marginally suitable and unsuitable lands for agriculture following from the weighing results of the ahp analysis the restrictions on the allocation of agriculture land could be explained by steep slope and poor soil properties consistent with previous studies yalew et al 2016 reported that the unsuitable lands were dominated by steep slope low percentage of soil water content and high level of soil stoniness the ggp is the most renowned land use planning to combat land degradation and desertification basically the ggp only calls for steep agriculture land slope 25 to be converted to vegetation in this study the land use planning could depend on more comprehensive information obtained from land suitability results rather than merely terrain slope however the land use planning should be implemented by considering the time efficiency and cost effectiveness though forest is recognized as the most ecological friendly coverage the long term land planning scenario in this study would take around 10 years for forests to grow to full maturity and require more investment wang et al 2007 argued that massive afforestation without considering the growth conditions would probably not achieve the expected ecological goals and even causing potential environmental problems the short term land use planning by contrast is more applicable for various natural conditions and needs much lower operational costs inevitably contradiction always exists between ecological targets and economic benefits as suggested by wang et al 2007 the land use planning should follow the principles of gradual improvement and site specific recommendations 4 2 swat model simulation results meteorologic elements are the driving force for hydrological cycle however weather data except for precipitation are unavailable in study watershed in this case the weather generator embedded in the swat model generated the missing climatic data for daily stream flow simulation schuol and abbaspour 2007 the utilization of cfsr weather data to calculate the monthly statistics for the weather generator resulted in satisfactory daily flow results in this study in many applications of the swat model the cfsr data set have provided a valuable option in data scarce regions auerbach et al 2016 dile and srinivasan 2015 fuka et al 2015 however roth and lemann 2016 argued that the simulations with cfsr data resulted in far less results for streamflow than simulations with the conventional site data there might be room for improving the current model performances by the use of measured climate data from the meteorological stations in further work although the sediment simulation was performed without a real calibration procedure in this study due to the lack of relevant observed data it is still reasonable to reflect the sediment process in the study watershed the sediment related parameters were set according to a study cai et al 2012 that investigated the impacts of land use change on the sediment yield results in the upper huaihe river cai et al 2012 selected the xixian hydrological station as the case study site that located in the downstream of ctg station for the entire watershed in this study the simulated average annual sediment load was 355 t km2 which was higher than the estimate of average annual sediment load of 156 t km2 at xixian station in cai et al 2012 there is reason to believe the sediment prediction in this study since the ctg watershed is the source region with steep terrain that experiences higher soil erosion moreover the distributions of sediment yield in all sub basins ranged from 151 20 t km2 to 621 50 t km2 in this study showing good agreement with the spatial sediment results in cai et al 2012 4 3 eco hydrological implications land use planning could effectively reduce the flood peak flow according to the swat model simulation results flood represents one of the most severe natural disasters not only threatening the human life and property but also leading to ecological environment problems land degradation situations in the case study watershed are soil erosion caused by water zhao 2006 in particular flash floods accompanied by advancing intense kinematic water wave can induce considerable sediment transport guan et al 2015 floods have also been associated with water pollution zhang 2013 suggested that agricultural pollution significantly increased during a flood event moreover high magnitude flood events probably cause major damage to fisheries habitat stefanidis et al 2016 water resources are closely bound up with the functionality and health of ecological system land use planning has altered the runoff response by changing the allocation between surface runoff and groundwater more than 90 of the total water yield came from the surface runoff which is the main contribution to the streamflow in the study watershed while the ctg watershed relies on the surface runoff to maintain the streamflow dynamic the decreasing surface runoff caused by land use planning would cause potential drought risk worse still as presented by the simulation results in figs 9 b and 10 b restoring the cultivation to vegetation increased the evapotranspiration consumption in watershed which may add another opportunity for drought according to yan jun et al 2012 most of the huaihe river basin is prone to mild medium drought severe drought rarely occurred yan jun et al 2012 also declared that the negative impact of drought would be relieved by current situation of climate change all the more important then is to reveal the positive outcomes of land use planning from an ecological perspective within the whole watershed potential nonpoint source pollutants are transported by surface runoff haan et al 2006 the ctg watershed and even the whole huaihe river basin are identified as agricultural dominant regions and as a result the agricultural non point source pollution is causative of deterioration of the river water therefore both temporal and spatial decreases in surface runoff simulated by the swat model were linked to the decreased entrainment of nitrogen and phosphorus and the remission of water eutrophication groundwater is an important resource for drinking water supplies agricultural irrigation and social and economic development as well as for eco environment maintenance in semiarid watershed yang et al 2001 according to the survey hui et al 2010 the huaihe river basin has experienced the overexploitation of ground water which leads to a series of serious eco environmental problems such as land subsidence soil salinization water level drawdown and spring cutoff a significantly increased groundwater volume resulted from land use planning in this study could effectively alleviate the shortage of groundwater resources soil water loss has become the environmental and ecological issues of concern in the upstream of the huaihe river basin cai et al 2012 generally speaking soil erosion impairs the soil quality thereby diminishing the valuable diversity of plants animals and microbes pimentel and kounang 1998 pimentel 2006 concluded that soil erosion reduced the productivity of terrestrial ecosystems including soil water availability nutrient loss soil organic matter and soil depth sediment is generated from various soil erosion processes given that the sustainable erosion rate is less than 50 100 t km2 the short term and long term land planning scenarios in this study were able to reduce the sediment loads from 355 t km2 to 172 t km2 and 155 t km2 respectively which is considered to be in accord with the eco sustainable principles along with inflow of sediment into the river it would have adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems elevated sediment loads can directly affect the fish physiology fish behavior and fish populations anderson 1996 the huaihe is the third largest river in china with abundant fish resources in this study land use planning scenarios reduced the sediment loads both temporally and spatially thus the plantations of grass or forest are beneficial for protection and restoration of water ecosystem 5 conclusions 5 1 land planning scenario designing land use scenarios is a popular technique in planning and management consulting because it offers an opportunity for assessing the present situation and the rational development oriented situation in the future land suitability evaluation for each land unit is realized in a spatially explicit manner depending on a multiple criteria decision making approach which can provide a synthetic way to determine land planning scenario quantitatively and qualitatively a case study was carried out on a 3012 33 km2 watershed located in the headwater region of the huaihe river basin the physical criteria including elevation slope geomorphology etc were used to evaluate the suitability of agriculture the weights of all these criteria calculated by the ahp approach showed that soil organic matter and slope were important factors affecting the allocation of agriculture land by overlapping the land use map in 2000 and agriculture land suitability map 40 83 of agriculture land in the year 2000 was found to be inappropriate for agriculture therefore in those regions the de farming was performed while the remaining area remained unchanged to obtain the short term and long term land planning scenarios since the land suitability evaluation is a mcdm operation one of the most crucial components is the relative importance of each criterion however the weighting of the multiple criteria that was determined by ahp method in this study must have a certain subjective attitude which needs to be properly validated moreover social and economic factors influencing the specific land allocation cannot be ignored thus the land planning scenario presented in this study could be only regarded as a guideline for the area with slow evolution of urbanization 5 2 eco hydrological responses to land use changes the application of the swat model in the study area showed a satisfactory model performance in the daily streamflow simulation with the nse values are 0 72 for the calibration period and 0 66 for the validation period the good applicability of swat model in this study laid the foundation for investigating the possible effects of land use scenarios on eco hydrological responses taking the land use in 2000 as a baseline period and the short term and long term land planning scenarios as the affected periods land use scenarios were simulated separately to compare the differences of eco hydrological responses firstly the land use operations were able to reduce the maximum runoff then at monthly and annual time scales both land use planning scenarios reduced the total water yield and sdiment loads at the watershed outlet while increasing the evapotranspiration among the three components of runoff the surface runoff and groundwater were found much more sensitive to land use planning than lateral flow finally all the eco hydrological responses to both land use planning scenarios varied at different sub basins spatial changes in total water yield surface ruoff and evapotranspiration were highly correlated with the de farming percentages of sub basins taken together the long term land use planning may cause more significant changes in eco hydrological responses than short term land use planning what s more the land use planning scenarios in this study could provide a perspective way to solve the eco

25318,managers of urban lakes are faced with the challenge of finding a balance between saving water resources and preventing eutrophication one way to address both of these issues is to use the unconventional water source s such as stormwater and reclaimed water to maintain the water supply in urban constructed ponds we validated and calibrated the environmental fluid dynamics code and then evaluated the risks of eutrophication from various water supply scenarios such as different proportions of stormwater sw reclaimed water rw and tap water tw we found that the different types of water influenced the nutrient or chla levels in the constructed ponds but that there was little difference between different hydrological years the range of the trophic state index in the study pond increased from 5 55 to 68 17 in the urban ponds as the proportion of rw increased from 0 to 100 stormwater collection strategies had a clear effect on the trophic state of tw fed ponds but not of rw fed ponds using an index that integrated the eutrophication risks eutrophication state and economic costs we found that the optimal water supply strategy was to collect treated sw and use tw to replenish the water supply keywords efdc eutrophication risk water supply strategy scenario analysis urban constructed pond 1 introduction eutrophication is a common problem in urban ponds smith and schindler 2009 it has various negative effects causes the color taste transparency and odor of pond water to change reduces the pond biodiversity and also results in super saturation and deficits of oxygen in the surface water and bottom water layers respectively ellwood et al 2009 grochowska et al 2014 dunalska et al 2015 in water scarce areas the risks of eutrophication in urban lakes or ponds can be very high because there is insufficient water to dilute the non point source pollutants and nutrients in the lake or pond wang et al 2014 chen et al 2016b gao et al 2014 water managers in water scarce areas therefore have to ensure there is enough water of suitable quality in urban lakes and ponds to prevent eutrophication reclaimed water rw can contribute to sustainable and effective water resource management in water scarce areas such as beijing and california zhou et al 2017 marks 2006 however we know that when rw is introduced to aquatic systems the bacterial communities shift because of changes to their habitat vaquersunyer et al 2016 and biogeochemical cycling of nutrients is altered wakelin et al 2008 wang et al 2016 where rw with high levels of organic matter and nutrients is introduced to aquatic systems beaulieu et al 2013 mart√≠ et al 2009 ribot et al 2017 primary production may decrease vaquersunyer et al 2016 and the phytoplankton species composition may be altered with consequences for the chlorophyll a chla concentrations kraus et al 2017 various factors including sewage outflows season will determine the influence of rw rodr√≠guezcastillo et al 2017 yang et al 2016 while numerous studies have reported how rw influences receiving water systems there is a lack of information about how rw can be used to avoid or reduce the risks of eutrophication stormwater sw can also be used to replenish urban lakes however sw may contain nutrients at high concentrations hobbie et al 2017 which may contribute to degradation of the water quality of the receiving system and may result in harmful cyanobacterial blooms and high levels of microcystin toxins wu et al 2016 studies have shown that because of the first flush phenomenon the initial 30 of the runoff volume can contain between 40 and 70 of the nutrient load for the entire event gunaratne et al 2017 bach et al 2010 nutrients should therefore be removed before sw is used to supplement the water supply in urban ponds glaister et al 2017 in the event that the supply of sw is not sufficient for a given pond it will have to be mixed with other types of water further because the nutrients contents in sw generally vary widely bratieres et al 2008 we need to determine how inputs of treated sw might influence the trophic state of constructed urban ponds studies have shown that the trophic state of a lake or pond can be improved by ensuring a sufficient water supply or by implementing water diversion measures li et al 2013 sirunda and mazvimavi 2014 zeng et al 2015 the water quality in the lake may change depending on the source of the water supply hu et al 2010 and the hydro dynamic condition s in the lake gibbins et al 2010 there are numerous examples of how regulatory measures have been optimized to control eutrophication such as the yangtze estuary wang et al 2013 baiyangdian lake chong et al 2010 cheng ching lake kuo et al 2008 and in brackish tidal ponds cui and chui 2017 however while these regulation strategies have been widely used in natural lakes there are few reports of how regulation measures have been optimized for constructed ponds that receive artificial water supplies mathematical models can be used to predict the water quality and responses of algae to variations in external nutrient loadings and have been frequently used to find optimal solutions for various water quality problems chen et al 2016b wu and xu 2011 simulation system s such as the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc can be used to forecast the fate of water quality variables and quantify the trophic status under various conditions while the optimization systems can be used to identify the optimal water transfer strategies from a range of alternative scenarios dai et al 2016 zeng et al 2015 in this study we used the efdc model to analyze 25 different water supply scenarios for an urban pond in tianjin we then evaluated how the nutrient and chla levels and trophic state responded to these different water supply scenarios which included whether sw was collected and various mixing ratios of rw the specific objectives of the study were to 1 identify how different sw collection and treatment strategies impacted on the trophic state of an urban pond 2 verify whether it was feasible to use rw as the main source of extra water and 3 find the optimal water supply strategy that would both prevent eutrophication and minimize economic costs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study pond fig 1 was in the center of tianjin cultural park tcp in the hexi district of tianjin the pond has landscape and recreational functions it covers an area of 92 500 m2 and has a storage capacity of 160 000 m3 deeper in the east than in the west the pond has an average depth of 3 04 m the pond catchment is a multi function commercial area that mainly comprises buildings green spaces and roads the study area received 576 mm of rainfall during 2015 the pond has five inlets and two outlets the pond water is circulated continuously at a circulation rate of 400 m3 h by pumping water from two outlets and then reintroducing it into the pond through two inlets stormwater from the surrounding catchment is pre treated in a wetland and then is discharged into the pond via two inlets to maintain the water level during spring tw and rw are added to the pond through one outlet at a supply rate of 800 m3 d for a period of 80 days to date the constructed pond has been replenished with collected sw and tw 2 2 model description the efdc is a comprehensive three dimensional numerical model that was developed at the virginia institute of marine science hamrick 1992 it is a general purpose model for simulating biogeochemical processes in surface water systems and has been widely used to evaluate the risks of eutrophication in lakes or ponds chen et al 2016a wu and xu 2011 zeng et al 2015 the governing mass balance equation is based on the conservation of mass and can be expressed as follows tech 2007 t c x u c y v c z w c x k x x c y k y y c z k z z c s c where c is the concentration of the water quality state variable u v and w are the velocity components in the x y and z directions respectively kx ky and kz are the turbulent diffusivities in the x y and z directions respectively and sc is the internal and external sources and sinks per unit volume algae dynamics such as growth production basal metabolism predation and settling are included in the conservation equation and are described with the following kinetic equation he et al 2011 b x t p x b m x p r x b x z w s x b x w b x v where bx is the algal biomass of algal group x g cm 3 x 1 2 or 3 where 1 represents cyanobacteria 2 represents diatoms 3 represents

settling velocity of algal group x m day 1 wbx represents the external loads of algal group x g c day 1 and v is the cell volume m3 to facilitate comparisons we calculated the chla concentrations by dividing the computed biomass by the carbon to chlorophyll ratio bunch et al 2000 zeng et al 2015 the eutrophication module in the efdc model solves mass balance equations for 21 state variables in the water column which include 3 algal groups various components of the carbon nitrogen phosphorus and silica cycles dissolved oxygen dynamics and fecal coliform bacteria the interactions among those variables the atmosphere and sediment are illustrated in fig 2 which shows that the whole eutrophication process comprises physical chemical and biochemical reactions in fig 2 each box represents a state variable and the symbol denotes a sediment phase the arrows represent kinetic interactions among the state variables wu and xu 2011 2 3 model configuration 2 3 1 grid generation and bathymetry processing cartesian grids were used to represent the geometry of the study pond at a spatial resolution of 9 5 12 m the water quality model was set by allocating 738 active grids in the horizontal plane and one layer in the vertical direction the boundary and the corresponding topography of the constructed pond are shown in fig 3 2 3 2 initial conditions and boundary conditions in this study the initial conditions included the water surface elevation water temperature and water quality state represented by concentrations of water quality variables the starting time was march 12 2015 julian data 0 and the calibration period was from 12 march 2015 to 20 november 2015 which was the unfrozen period of the pond the initial elevation of the pond water surface was 3 04 m and was uniform the initial water temperature was set as 10 c in all the grids to reflect the homologous water temperature in the pond during spring information about the initial water quality was obtained from the field monitoring in the pond during march 2015 we need information about the lateral and surface boundary conditions to drive the water dynamics the lateral boundary conditions include the daily inflow outflow rates daily water temperature and fortnightly nutrients loadings we obtained meteorological data from china s meteorological scientific data sharing service network http www escience gov cn the flow rates were monitored at each inlet or outlet of the pond with a flow meter during the calibration period water samples were collected monthly from march to may the dry season and fortnightly from may to september the rainy season from the inlets and outlets of the pond we used the flow rates and the results from analysis of these samples to calculate the loads of the water quality variables in the inlets and outlets of the pond we collected samples of treated sw at the outlet of the wetland which also served as the inlet of the pond during 3 rain on 19 july 23 august and 5 september we calculated the event mean concentrations emcs of different water quality variables in the treated stormwater during these three events and then used the average emc for the three events to calculate the loads during rainfall we measured the water temperature secchi disc sd sense features phytoplankton ph and dissolved oxygen do in situ and analyzed the collected water samples for their demand codcr biochemical oxygen demand bod5 total nitrogen tn nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n ammonia nitrogen nh4 n total phosphorus tp dissolved phosphorus dp and chla concentrations we observed the sampling procedures and sample preservation and handling times outlined in the standard methods federation and association 2005 2 3 3 model calibration and validation the parameters of the eutrophication model were calibrated by trial and error method to match the simulation results with the field measured data we calibrated and validated the model for 4 monitoring stations in 2015 as we had most observed data for this period we calibrated the hydrodynamic module with water levels and water temperatures data and used do nh4 n tn tp and chla concentrations to calibrate the water quality module we calculated the relative errors root mean square errors rmse and the nash sutcliffe coefficient to evaluate whether we could use our model to simulate the process of eutrophication 2 4 scenario definitions we set up 25 simulation scenarios to evaluate how the spatial and temporal in the eutrophication risks in the pond would be affected by adding water from different sources scenario a0 was the baseline scenario in the reference year 2015 for this scenario we simulated the spatial and temporal patterns of the eutrophication risk after the pond water had been replenished by tw for a period of 80 days we know that the sw quality influences the pond water quality we determined the impact of sw collection strategies on the water quality of the pond with scenarios an cn and en n 1 2 3 4 5 and then examined how sw affected the water quality in the pond in different hydrological years with scenarios bn cn and dn n 1 2 3 4 5 the proportions of water from different sources such as rw and tw will also influence the water quality in the pond we determined how the eutrophication risk in the pond varied when water from the different sources was added in different proportions with scenarios m1 m2 m3 m4 and m5 m a b c d e which represented 100 tw 75 tw and 25 rw 50 rw and 50 tw 75 rw and 25 tw and 100 rw respectively detailed information about the different sw and different water source scenarios are listed in table 1 and the concentrations of the different water quality variables are listed in table 2 2 5 calculation of trophic state index the trophic state index tsi is frequently used to assess the trophic level in ponds or lakes dai et al 2016 hu et al 2014 it reflects the interactions between multiple eutrophication related indicators i e tsi and is calculated as follows jin 1995 t s i l 1 3 w l t s i l where l 1 for chla l 2 for tp and l 3 for tn w is the weighting factor for the lth indicator w l r l 1 2 l 1 3 r l 1 2 rl1 is the correlation coefficient between the lth indicator and the basic indicator i e chla we used weighting factors i e œâl of 0 45 0 39 and 0 16 for chla tp and tn respectively in our calculations the tsi value of the lth indicator i e tsi l can be calculated as follows carlson 1977 swanson 1998 xu et al 2011 t s i l Œ± l Œ≤ l l n c l where Œ±l and Œ≤l are constants defined as follows Œ±1 25 00 Œ±2 94 36 Œ±3 54 53 Œ≤1 10 86 Œ≤ 16 24 and Œ≤3 16 94 for chinese lakes or ponds c l is the temporal and spatial mean concentration of the lth indicator mg l over the sampling period and also for sampling sites and is calculated as follows c l j 1 m k 1 n c l j k m n where j is the number of months j 1 2 m k is sampling sites numbers k 1 2 n cljk is the concentration of the lth indicator at the kth sampling site on the jth month mg l which can be calculated through the efdc model the comprehensive tsi ranks the ponds on a numerical scale from 0 to 100 and the scale values correspond to different trophic state levels when 0 tsi 30 30 tsi 40 40 tsi 50 50 tsi 60 60 tsi 70 and 70 tsi the pond is oligotrophic oligo mesotrophic mesotrophic slightly eutrophic moderately eutrophic and hypereutrophic level respectively 2 6 incorporated optimization function to determine the optimal water supply strategies the weighting method had three objectives namely to minimize the eutrophication risk minimize the average eutrophication state and minimize the economic costs the eutrophication risk is reflected by k1 the maximum chla concentration index the average eutrophication state is reflected by k2 in the tsi index and the economic objective is reflected by the economic index k3 the economic objective comprises the water resources costs and the costs of constructing and maintaining sw collection and treatment facilities the economic objective is more representative than an objective that just accounts for the water resources costs because water transfer projects always involve the construction of pipeline and treatment facilities and ongoing long term maintenance the economic cost therefore represents the costs for maintenance and construction and the water resource costs the equations of the different indexes are as follows k1 cchl amn cchl amnmax k2 tsimn tsimax cost wrc cc mc k3 costmn costmax where cchl a mn and cchl a mnmax represent the maximum chla concentration of each scenario and for all the scenarios tsi mn and tsi max represent the tsi of each scenario and the maximum tsi out of all the scenarios cost mn and cost max represent the cost of each scenario and the maximum cost out of all the scenarios cost represents the economic cost of the model in chinese yuan wrc is the water resource cost cc is the construction cost and mc is the maintenance cost our goal was to minimize both the eutrophication risks and the economic costs if there are no significant differences among the three objectives then the model is a multi objective problem and we will obtain a set of non inferior solutions for the rivalry and incommensurability of the objectives in this study we used a linear weight sum method to transform the three objective problems into one objective minimization problem the following weighting method was used to integrate the three objectives wang et al 2013 m i n Œª 1 k 1 Œª 2 k 2 Œª 3 k 3 where Œª1 Œª2 and Œª3 are the weighting coefficients and Œª1 Œª2 Œª3 1 when there is no significant tendency among the three objectives Œª1 Œª2 Œª3 1 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation results we used the water quality data for 2015 to calibrate and verify the eutrophication model because this was the period for which we had most data we used the water quality data from stations 1 and 4 to calibrate the water quality model and the data from stations 2 and 5 to validate it we used do nh4 n tn tp and chla as the water quality variables in the calibration the error statistics of the model calibration and validation are displayed in table 3 the nash sutcliffe coefficients for the water quality variables ranged from 1 85 to 0 72 the relative errors re were between 1 41 and 76 4 and the values of the rmse for the water quality variables were between 0 06 and 9 14 other indexes of model performance were adjusted so that they were within the ranges reported in other similar studies chen et al 2016a we can therefore say that the simulated values agreed well with the measured values and that our eutrophication model was suitable for simulating eutrophication process in the pond the calibration and validation results for the water quality variables are displayed in figs 4 and 5 which show that the simulated values of the water quality variables fitted well with the measured values and that they reflected the actual changes in the measured data there was generally a good fit between the observed and simulated values of do figs 4 and 5 the contents of do tended to decrease from may to september reflecting the lower solubility of do in water with high temperatures and also the impact of algal biological processes on the do concentrations through photosynthesis and respiration in this period opdyke 2007 the simulated and observed values for tn tp and nh4 n also showed good agreement figs 4 and 5 the concentrations of nutrients peaked in may and september and responded rapidly to storm events concentrations of nh4 n tended to increase from may to september figs 4 and 5 taking all sites together the tn and tp concentrations fluctuated between 0 8 and 2 mg l and between 0 03 and 0 08 mg l respectively during the non storm period which means that when compared with the chinese national standards for surface water quality gb3838 2002 the water quality in this pond could be described as either grade iii to grade v we observed extreme values for tn 1 5 2 3 mg l and tp 0 12 mg l in may and september reflecting nutrient laden runoff transported during rainstorms in the rainy season the increases in the nh4 n concentrations reflect release of nh4 n during active biological metabolism of aquatic fauna in the pond when the water temperatures were high chen et al 2016a there was a good fit between the observed and simulated results for algae represented by chla figs 4 and 5 during the calibration and validation stage algae generally grow rapidly in summer and autumn resulting in high chla concentrations there was an obvious peak in chla during an intensive rain event 50 mm on 5 september when the nutrient concentrations were high concentrations of chla were also high in may other researchers have reported similar peaks at this time of year dai et al 2016 zeng et al 2015 and we believe they indicate the point where the phytoplankton biomass represented by chla stopped increasing and started to decrease because of a lack of nutrients and high metabolism rates when the concentration of nutrients fell below a certain level 3 2 spatial and temporal patterns in the baseline scenario a0 the actual spatial and temporal patterns of eutrophication represented by chla in the constructed pond when partly supplied with tw are shown in figs 6 and 7 temporal variations are presented in fig 6 which shows that chla concentrations ranged from 0 46 to 20 4 Œºg l and were highest in the autumn second highest in the summer and lowest in the spring these results contrast with the findings of zeng et al 2015 but agree with those of chen et al 2016a the results from these studies are not consistent because nutrient and chla concentrations are generally controlled by factors such as temperature or light in natural lakes but tend to be controlled by the incoming sw or supply water in constructed ponds that generally contain less water than natural lakes the chla concentrations varied spatially fig 7 and were higher in the western part of the pond than in the middle part this spatial variation reflects the high water temperatures and nutrient loadings in surface water during summer and autumn when the conditions were suitable for algal growth the higher chla concentrations in the western part also reflect the fact that the water was shallow in that part of the pond with the result that it was easy for algae to obtain nutrients from the sediment steinman et al 2012 xiang and zhou 2011 the inlets were also in the western part of the pond which means that algae have easy access to nutrients in inflowing water therefore the pond can be divided into two parts namely the sensitive part in the west and the insensitive part in the middle the algal biomass in the western and southern parts of the pond can serve as an early warning of high nutrients in inputs of water and so should be monitored closely in periods when water is added to protect the water quality in the pond 3 3 scenario analysis and implications for management of urban ponds 3 3 1 effect of water sources on the risks of eutrophication in different hydrological years the nutrients in rw make a major contribution to the eutrophication of the pond the impact of water sources on the trophic state in different hydrological years is shown in fig 8 the effects of the supplementary water on the nutrient and chla concentrations in the constructed pond were similar in the different hydrological years the pond ranged from oligo mesotrophic to hypereutrophic when the supplementary water comprised only tw and rw respectively as the proportions of rw increased the maximum tn tp and chla concentrations in the constructed pond increased from 32 02 to 335 24 32 43 to 158 64 and from 30 99 to 245 91 respectively and the tsi range increased from 5 55 to 68 17 comparison of the different water sources shows that there was little difference between the hydrological years and the maximum tn tp and chla concentrations in the different hydrological years ranged from 0 08 to 12 21 1 38 to 11 66 and 1 61 to 31 14 respectively approximately 120 000 m3 of water were diverted into the pond each year which represented approximately 75 of the existing total storage capacity approximately 160 000 m3 and so the added water had quite a strong influence on this pond welch and patmont 1980 compared other lakes or rivers with smaller eutrophic areas that receive diverted water the differences between the different hydrologic years were small compared to those reported for natural lakes ji et al 2017 and reflect the small catchment area also the catchment area is well maintained and is swept frequently which means that there is minimal pollutant accumulation on the surfaces 3 3 2 effect of stormwater collection strategies on the eutrophication risks in he constructed pond the nutrients in sw runoff from catchments contribute directly to eutrophication wu et al 2016 the impacts of sw collection strategies on the nutrient and chla concentrations are shown in fig 8 for tw based scenarios the trophic state was highest when untreated sw was collected followed by treated sw collection and was lowest when no sw was collected for rw based scenarios the trophic states were similar for the different sw collection strategies for tw based scenarios the maximum tn tp and chl a concentrations and tsi increased from 0 2 to 24 1 0 64 to 45 13 8 92 to 138 27 and from 0 64 to 5 34 respectively for treated sw collection compared to no sw collection and the maximum tn tp and chl a concentrations and tsi increased from 30 24 to 237 78 17 9 to 186 96 46 78 to 403 74 and from 0 08 to 22 51 for untreated sw collection compared to no sw collection for rw based scenarios however the changes in the maximum tn tp and chl a concentrations for the different sw collection strategies were much smaller and ranged from 6 92 to 0 34 stormwater can cause obvious differences in tw based scenarios because of the contribution of atmospheric p particles entering the lake with rain hobbie et al 2017 stormwater has much less influence than the supplied rw in rw based scenarios 3 3 3 implications for the management of urban lakes the trophic states of the urban pond under different water supply strategies are shown in table 4 the trophic states caused by various water sources were highest for rw followed by sw then treated rw and were lowest for tw in urban ponds with similar hydrological and hydraulic characteristics in ponds supplied by rw and sw rw replenishment had a significant influence on algal growth which shows that rw ponds were the cyanophyta chlorophyta bacillariophyta type and had high algal diversity while sw ponds were the cyanophyta type and had low diversity in rw ponds po3 p and no3 n are the main nutrients absorbed by planktonic microbes muhid et al 2013 by contrast organic nitrogen which is not readily absorbed by aquatic plants and phytoplankton is abundant in sw ponds the fact that cyanophyta do not compete as strongly for no3 n as other phytoplankton divisions berg et al 2003 rothenberger et al 2009 means that the richness of cyanophyta is much lower in rw ponds than in sw ponds with continued rw replenishment non dominant species tend to decrease significantly while dominant species tend to increase because of long term competition dakos et al 2009 pomati et al 2011 which results in increased biomass but decreased diversity engineering measures such as constructed wetlands and floating beds are beneficial for improving the quality of the supplied reclaimed water in rw ponds and have been widely used to inhibit algal growth and prevent water from becoming eutrophic li et al 2013 wakelin et al 2008 both plants and filters have important roles in nutrient removal water quality in treated rw ponds can vary seasonally and spatially corresponding with both the vegetation growth and water circulation li et al 2013 the water quality is best in tw ponds because of the low nutrient concentrations in the supplied water 3 3 4 optimized water supply strategies the cost and integrated objectives of the different water supply strategies are shown in figs 9 and 10 the total costs for the different scenarios were highest when sw was not collected followed by collection of treated sw and were lowest for collection of untreated sw apart from c1 e1 a1 the integrated objectives were highest when untreated sw was collected followed by the collection of treated sw and were lowest when sw was not collected the rank order of total costs reflects the fact that when sw is not collected the cost of pipeline reconstruction exceeds the cost of sw collection and treatment when sw is collected treatment facilities are needed whereas no treatment facilities are needed when sw is not treated when the objectives i e the eutrophication risks eutrophication state and economic costs are integrated the optimized water supply strategy is to collect treated sw and use tw as the water supply 4 conclusions through this study we have illustrated how chla and the trophic state in an urban constructed pond respond to different water supply strategies we have also suggested how the water supply should be optimized to minimize the risks of eutrophication the sw collection strategies did not have any obvious impact on the nutrient levels and trophic state of the constructed pond however there was a clear difference between the chla level and the tsi in the urban constructed pond for every increase of 25 in the contribution of rw to the water supply the constructed pond ranged from oligo mesotrophic when totally supplied with tw to hypereutrophic when completely supplied with rw our data show that to prevent the eutrophication risk and at the same time consider the economic cost it is best to collect treated sw and have tw as the main source we need to have further discussions about the trophic states of different urban constructed ponds with different catchment sizes and water supply strategies to find the best ways to minimize the risks of

25318,managers of urban lakes are faced with the challenge of finding a balance between saving water resources and preventing eutrophication one way to address both of these issues is to use the unconventional water source s such as stormwater and reclaimed water to maintain the water supply in urban constructed ponds we validated and calibrated the environmental fluid dynamics code and then evaluated the risks of eutrophication from various water supply scenarios such as different proportions of stormwater sw reclaimed water rw and tap water tw we found that the different types of water influenced the nutrient or chla levels in the constructed ponds but that there was little difference between different hydrological years the range of the trophic state index in the study pond increased from 5 55 to 68 17 in the urban ponds as the proportion of rw increased from 0 to 100 stormwater collection strategies had a clear effect on the trophic state of tw fed ponds but not of rw fed ponds using an index that integrated the eutrophication risks eutrophication state and economic costs we found that the optimal water supply strategy was to collect treated sw and use tw to replenish the water supply keywords efdc eutrophication risk water supply strategy scenario analysis urban constructed pond 1 introduction eutrophication is a common problem in urban ponds smith and schindler 2009 it has various negative effects causes the color taste transparency and odor of pond water to change reduces the pond biodiversity and also results in super saturation and deficits of oxygen in the surface water and bottom water layers respectively ellwood et al 2009 grochowska et al 2014 dunalska et al 2015 in water scarce areas the risks of eutrophication in urban lakes or ponds can be very high because there is insufficient water to dilute the non point source pollutants and nutrients in the lake or pond wang et al 2014 chen et al 2016b gao et al 2014 water managers in water scarce areas therefore have to ensure there is enough water of suitable quality in urban lakes and ponds to prevent eutrophication reclaimed water rw can contribute to sustainable and effective water resource management in water scarce areas such as beijing and california zhou et al 2017 marks 2006 however we know that when rw is introduced to aquatic systems the bacterial communities shift because of changes to their habitat vaquersunyer et al 2016 and biogeochemical cycling of nutrients is altered wakelin et al 2008 wang et al 2016 where rw with high levels of organic matter and nutrients is introduced to aquatic systems beaulieu et al 2013 mart√≠ et al 2009 ribot et al 2017 primary production may decrease vaquersunyer et al 2016 and the phytoplankton species composition may be altered with consequences for the chlorophyll a chla concentrations kraus et al 2017 various factors including sewage outflows season will determine the influence of rw rodr√≠guezcastillo et al 2017 yang et al 2016 while numerous studies have reported how rw influences receiving water systems there is a lack of information about how rw can be used to avoid or reduce the risks of eutrophication stormwater sw can also be used to replenish urban lakes however sw may contain nutrients at high concentrations hobbie et al 2017 which may contribute to degradation of the water quality of the receiving system and may result in harmful cyanobacterial blooms and high levels of microcystin toxins wu et al 2016 studies have shown that because of the first flush phenomenon the initial 30 of the runoff volume can contain between 40 and 70 of the nutrient load for the entire event gunaratne et al 2017 bach et al 2010 nutrients should therefore be removed before sw is used to supplement the water supply in urban ponds glaister et al 2017 in the event that the supply of sw is not sufficient for a given pond it will have to be mixed with other types of water further because the nutrients contents in sw generally vary widely bratieres et al 2008 we need to determine how inputs of treated sw might influence the trophic state of constructed urban ponds studies have shown that the trophic state of a lake or pond can be improved by ensuring a sufficient water supply or by implementing water diversion measures li et al 2013 sirunda and mazvimavi 2014 zeng et al 2015 the water quality in the lake may change depending on the source of the water supply hu et al 2010 and the hydro dynamic condition s in the lake gibbins et al 2010 there are numerous examples of how regulatory measures have been optimized to control eutrophication such as the yangtze estuary wang et al 2013 baiyangdian lake chong et al 2010 cheng ching lake kuo et al 2008 and in brackish tidal ponds cui and chui 2017 however while these regulation strategies have been widely used in natural lakes there are few reports of how regulation measures have been optimized for constructed ponds that receive artificial water supplies mathematical models can be used to predict the water quality and responses of algae to variations in external nutrient loadings and have been frequently used to find optimal solutions for various water quality problems chen et al 2016b wu and xu 2011 simulation system s such as the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc can be used to forecast the fate of water quality variables and quantify the trophic status under various conditions while the optimization systems can be used to identify the optimal water transfer strategies from a range of alternative scenarios dai et al 2016 zeng et al 2015 in this study we used the efdc model to analyze 25 different water supply scenarios for an urban pond in tianjin we then evaluated how the nutrient and chla levels and trophic state responded to these different water supply scenarios which included whether sw was collected and various mixing ratios of rw the specific objectives of the study were to 1 identify how different sw collection and treatment strategies impacted on the trophic state of an urban pond 2 verify whether it was feasible to use rw as the main source of extra water and 3 find the optimal water supply strategy that would both prevent eutrophication and minimize economic costs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study pond fig 1 was in the center of tianjin cultural park tcp in the hexi district of tianjin the pond has landscape and recreational functions it covers an area of 92 500 m2 and has a storage capacity of 160 000 m3 deeper in the east than in the west the pond has an average depth of 3 04 m the pond catchment is a multi function commercial area that mainly comprises buildings green spaces and roads the study area received 576 mm of rainfall during 2015 the pond has five inlets and two outlets the pond water is circulated continuously at a circulation rate of 400 m3 h by pumping water from two outlets and then reintroducing it into the pond through two inlets stormwater from the surrounding catchment is pre treated in a wetland and then is discharged into the pond via two inlets to maintain the water level during spring tw and rw are added to the pond through one outlet at a supply rate of 800 m3 d for a period of 80 days to date the constructed pond has been replenished with collected sw and tw 2 2 model description the efdc is a comprehensive three dimensional numerical model that was developed at the virginia institute of marine science hamrick 1992 it is a general purpose model for simulating biogeochemical processes in surface water systems and has been widely used to evaluate the risks of eutrophication in lakes or ponds chen et al 2016a wu and xu 2011 zeng et al 2015 the governing mass balance equation is based on the conservation of mass and can be expressed as follows tech 2007 t c x u c y v c z w c x k x x c y k y y c z k z z c s c where c is the concentration of the water quality state variable u v and w are the velocity components in the x y and z directions respectively kx ky and kz are the turbulent diffusivities in the x y and z directions respectively and sc is the internal and external sources and sinks per unit volume algae dynamics such as growth production basal metabolism predation and settling are included in the conservation equation and are described with the following kinetic equation he et al 2011 b x t p x b m x p r x b x z w s x b x w b x v where bx is the algal biomass of algal group x g cm 3 x 1 2 or 3 where 1 represents cyanobacteria 2 represents diatoms 3 represents green algae t is time days px is the production rate of algal group x day 1 bmx is the basal metabolism rate of algal group x day 1 prx is the predation rate of algal group x day 1 wsx is the positive settling velocity of algal group x m day 1 wbx represents the external loads of algal group x g c day 1 and v is the cell volume m3 to facilitate comparisons we calculated the chla concentrations by dividing the computed biomass by the carbon to chlorophyll ratio bunch et al 2000 zeng et al 2015 the eutrophication module in the efdc model solves mass balance equations for 21 state variables in the water column which include 3 algal groups various components of the carbon nitrogen phosphorus and silica cycles dissolved oxygen dynamics and fecal coliform bacteria the interactions among those variables the atmosphere and sediment are illustrated in fig 2 which shows that the whole eutrophication process comprises physical chemical and biochemical reactions in fig 2 each box represents a state variable and the symbol denotes a sediment phase the arrows represent kinetic interactions among the state variables wu and xu 2011 2 3 model configuration 2 3 1 grid generation and bathymetry processing cartesian grids were used to represent the geometry of the study pond at a spatial resolution of 9 5 12 m the water quality model was set by allocating 738 active grids in the horizontal plane and one layer in the vertical direction the boundary and the corresponding topography of the constructed pond are shown in fig 3 2 3 2 initial conditions and boundary conditions in this study the initial conditions included the water surface elevation water temperature and water quality state represented by concentrations of water quality variables the starting time was march 12 2015 julian data 0 and the calibration period was from 12 march 2015 to 20 november 2015 which was the unfrozen period of the pond the initial elevation of the pond water surface was 3 04 m and was uniform the initial water temperature was set as 10 c in all the grids to reflect the homologous water temperature in the pond during spring information about the initial water quality was obtained from the field monitoring in the pond during march 2015 we need information about the lateral and surface boundary conditions to drive the water dynamics the lateral boundary conditions include the daily inflow outflow rates daily water temperature and fortnightly nutrients loadings we obtained meteorological data from china s meteorological scientific data sharing service network http www escience gov cn the flow rates were monitored at each inlet or outlet of the pond with a flow meter during the calibration period water samples were collected monthly from march to may the dry season and fortnightly from may to september the rainy season from the inlets and outlets of the pond we used the flow rates and the results from analysis of these samples to calculate the loads of the water quality variables in the inlets and outlets of the pond we collected samples of treated sw at the outlet of the wetland which also served as the inlet of the pond during 3 rain on 19 july 23 august and 5 september we calculated the event mean concentrations emcs of different water quality variables in the treated stormwater during these three events and then used the average emc for the three events to calculate the loads during rainfall we measured the water temperature secchi disc sd sense features phytoplankton ph and dissolved oxygen do in situ and analyzed the collected water samples for their demand codcr biochemical oxygen demand bod5 total nitrogen tn nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n ammonia nitrogen nh4 n total phosphorus tp dissolved phosphorus dp and chla concentrations we observed the sampling procedures and sample preservation and handling times outlined in the standard methods federation and association 2005 2 3 3 model calibration and validation the parameters of the eutrophication model were calibrated by trial and error method to match the simulation results with the field measured data we calibrated and validated the model for 4 monitoring stations in 2015 as we had most observed data for this period we calibrated the hydrodynamic module with water levels and water temperatures data and used do nh4 n tn tp and chla concentrations to calibrate the water quality module we calculated the relative errors root mean square errors rmse and the nash sutcliffe coefficient to evaluate whether we could use our model to simulate the process of eutrophication 2 4 scenario definitions we set up 25 simulation scenarios to evaluate how the spatial and temporal in the eutrophication risks in the pond would be affected by adding water from different sources scenario a0 was the baseline scenario in the reference year 2015 for this scenario we simulated the spatial and temporal patterns of the eutrophication risk after the pond water had been replenished by tw for a period of 80 days we know that the sw quality influences the pond water quality we determined the impact of sw collection strategies on the water quality of the pond with scenarios an cn and en n 1 2 3 4 5 and then examined how sw affected the water quality in the pond in different hydrological years with scenarios bn cn and dn n 1 2 3 4 5 the proportions of water from different sources such as rw and tw will also influence the water quality in the pond we determined how the eutrophication risk in the pond varied when water from the different sources was added in different proportions with scenarios m1 m2 m3 m4 and m5 m a b c d e which represented 100 tw 75 tw and 25 rw 50 rw and 50 tw 75 rw and 25 tw and 100 rw respectively detailed information about the different sw and different water source scenarios are listed in table 1 and the concentrations of the different water quality variables are listed in table 2 2 5 calculation of trophic state index the trophic state index tsi is frequently used to assess the trophic level in ponds or lakes dai et al 2016 hu et al 2014 it reflects the interactions between multiple eutrophication related indicators i e tsi and is calculated as follows jin 1995 t s i l 1 3 w l t s i l where l 1 for chla l 2 for tp and l 3 for tn w is the weighting factor for the lth indicator w l r l 1 2 l 1 3 r l 1 2 rl1 is the correlation coefficient between the lth indicator and the basic indicator i e chla we used weighting factors i e œâl of 0 45 0 39 and 0 16 for chla tp and tn respectively in our calculations the tsi value of the lth indicator i e tsi l can be calculated as follows carlson 1977 swanson 1998 xu et al 2011 t s i l Œ± l Œ≤ l l n c l where Œ±l and Œ≤l are constants defined as follows Œ±1 25 00 Œ±2 94 36 Œ±3 54 53 Œ≤1 10 86 Œ≤ 16 24 and Œ≤3 16 94 for chinese lakes or ponds c l is the temporal and spatial mean concentration of the lth indicator mg l over the sampling period and also for sampling sites and is calculated as follows c l j 1 m k 1 n c l j k m n where j is the number of months j 1 2 m k is sampling sites numbers k 1 2 n cljk is the concentration of the lth indicator at the kth sampling site on the jth month mg l which can be calculated through the efdc model the comprehensive tsi ranks the ponds on a numerical scale from 0 to 100 and the scale values correspond to different trophic state levels when 0 tsi 30 30 tsi 40 40 tsi 50 50 tsi 60 60 tsi 70 and 70 tsi the pond is oligotrophic oligo mesotrophic mesotrophic slightly eutrophic moderately eutrophic and hypereutrophic level respectively 2 6 incorporated optimization function to determine the optimal water supply strategies the weighting method had three objectives namely to minimize the eutrophication risk minimize the average eutrophication state and minimize the economic costs the eutrophication risk is reflected by k1 the maximum chla concentration index the average eutrophication state is reflected by k2 in the tsi index and the economic objective is reflected by the economic index k3 the economic objective comprises the water resources costs and the costs of constructing and maintaining sw collection and treatment facilities the economic objective is more representative than an objective that just accounts for the water resources costs because water transfer projects always involve the construction of pipeline and treatment facilities and ongoing long term maintenance the economic cost therefore represents the costs for maintenance and construction and the water resource costs the equations of the different indexes are as follows k1 cchl amn cchl amnmax k2 tsimn tsimax cost wrc cc mc k3 costmn costmax where cchl a mn and cchl a mnmax represent the maximum chla concentration of each scenario and for all the scenarios tsi mn and tsi max represent the tsi of each scenario and the maximum tsi out of all the scenarios cost mn and cost max represent the cost of each scenario and the maximum cost out of all the scenarios cost represents the economic cost of the model in chinese yuan wrc is the water resource cost cc is the construction cost and mc is the maintenance cost our goal was to minimize both the eutrophication risks and the economic costs if there are no significant differences among the three objectives then the model is a multi objective problem and we will obtain a set of non inferior solutions for the rivalry and incommensurability of the objectives in this study we used a linear weight sum method to transform the three objective problems into one objective minimization problem the following weighting method was used to integrate the three objectives wang et al 2013 m i n Œª 1 k 1 Œª 2 k 2 Œª 3 k 3 where Œª1 Œª2 and Œª3 are the weighting coefficients and Œª1 Œª2 Œª3 1 when there is no significant tendency among the three objectives Œª1 Œª2 Œª3 1 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation results we used the water quality data for 2015 to calibrate and verify the eutrophication model because this was the period for which we had most data we used the water quality data from stations 1 and 4 to calibrate the water quality model and the data from stations 2 and 5 to validate it we used do nh4 n tn tp and chla as the water quality variables in the calibration the error statistics of the model calibration and validation are displayed in table 3 the nash sutcliffe coefficients for the water quality variables ranged from 1 85 to 0 72 the relative errors re were between 1 41 and 76 4 and the values of the rmse for the water quality variables were between 0 06 and 9 14 other indexes of model performance were adjusted so that they were within the ranges reported in other similar studies chen et al 2016a we can therefore say that the simulated values agreed well with the measured values and that our eutrophication model was suitable for simulating eutrophication process in the pond the calibration and validation results for the water quality variables are displayed in figs 4 and 5 which show that the simulated values of the water quality variables fitted well with the measured values and that they reflected the actual changes in the measured data there was generally a good fit between the observed and simulated values of do figs 4 and 5 the contents of do tended to decrease from may to september reflecting the lower solubility of do in water with high temperatures and also the impact of algal biological processes on the do concentrations through photosynthesis and respiration in this period opdyke 2007 the simulated and observed values for tn tp and nh4 n also showed good agreement figs 4 and 5 the concentrations of nutrients peaked in may and september and responded rapidly to storm events concentrations of nh4 n tended to increase from may to september figs 4 and 5 taking all sites together the tn and tp concentrations fluctuated between 0 8 and 2 mg l and between 0 03 and 0 08 mg l respectively during the non storm period which means that when compared with the chinese national standards for surface water quality gb3838 2002 the water quality in this pond could be described as either grade iii to grade v we observed extreme values for tn 1 5 2 3 mg l and tp 0 12 mg l in may and september reflecting nutrient laden runoff transported during rainstorms in the rainy season the increases in the nh4 n concentrations reflect release of nh4 n during active biological metabolism of aquatic fauna in the pond when the water temperatures were high chen et al 2016a there was a good fit between the observed and simulated results for algae represented by chla figs 4 and 5 during the calibration and validation stage algae generally grow rapidly in summer and autumn resulting in high chla concentrations there was an obvious peak in chla during an intensive rain event 50 mm on 5 september when the nutrient concentrations were high concentrations of chla were also high in may other researchers have reported similar peaks at this time of year dai et al 2016 zeng et al 2015 and we believe they indicate the point where the phytoplankton biomass represented by chla stopped increasing and started to decrease because of a lack of nutrients and high metabolism rates when the concentration of nutrients fell below a certain level 3 2 spatial and temporal patterns in the baseline scenario a0 the actual spatial and temporal patterns of eutrophication represented by chla in the constructed pond when partly supplied with tw are shown in figs 6 and 7 temporal variations are presented in fig 6 which shows that chla concentrations ranged from 0 46 to 20 4 Œºg l and were highest in the autumn second highest in the summer and lowest in the spring these results contrast with the findings of zeng et al 2015 but agree with those of chen et al 2016a the results from these studies are not consistent because nutrient and chla concentrations are generally controlled by factors such as temperature or light in natural lakes but tend to be controlled by the incoming sw or supply water in constructed ponds that generally contain less water than natural lakes the chla concentrations varied spatially fig 7 and were higher in the western part of the pond than in the middle part this spatial variation reflects the high water temperatures and nutrient loadings in surface water during summer and autumn when the conditions were suitable for algal growth the higher chla concentrations in the western part also reflect the fact that the water was shallow in that part of the pond with the result that it was easy for algae to obtain nutrients from the sediment steinman et al 2012 xiang and zhou 2011 the inlets were also in the western part of the pond which means that algae have easy access to nutrients in inflowing water therefore the pond can be divided into two parts namely the sensitive part in the west and the insensitive part in the middle the algal biomass in the western and southern parts of the pond can serve as an early warning of high nutrients in inputs of water and so should be monitored closely in periods when water is added to protect the water quality in the pond 3 3 scenario analysis and implications for management of urban ponds 3 3 1 effect of water sources on the risks of eutrophication in different hydrological years the nutrients in rw make a major contribution to the eutrophication of the pond the impact of water sources on the trophic state in different hydrological years is shown in fig 8 the effects of the supplementary water on the nutrient and chla concentrations in the constructed pond were similar in the different hydrological years the pond ranged from oligo mesotrophic to hypereutrophic when the supplementary water comprised only tw and rw respectively as the proportions of rw increased the maximum tn tp and chla concentrations in the constructed pond increased from 32 02 to 335 24 32 43 to 158 64 and from 30 99 to 245 91 respectively and the tsi range increased from 5 55 to 68 17 comparison of the different water sources shows that there was little difference between the hydrological years and the maximum tn tp and chla concentrations in the different hydrological years ranged from 0 08 to 12 21 1 38 to 11 66 and 1 61 to 31 14 respectively approximately 120 000 m3 of water were diverted into the pond each year which represented approximately 75 of the existing total storage capacity approximately 160 000 m3 and so the added water had quite a strong influence on this pond welch and patmont 1980 compared other lakes or rivers with smaller eutrophic areas that receive diverted water the differences between the different hydrologic years were small compared to those reported for natural lakes ji et al 2017 and reflect the small catchment area also the catchment area is well maintained and is swept frequently which means that there is minimal pollutant accumulation on the surfaces 3 3 2 effect of stormwater collection strategies on the eutrophication risks in he constructed pond the nutrients in sw runoff from catchments contribute directly to eutrophication wu et al 2016 the impacts of sw collection strategies on the nutrient and chla concentrations are shown in fig 8 for tw based scenarios the trophic state was highest when untreated sw was collected followed by treated sw collection and was lowest when no sw was collected for rw based scenarios the trophic states were similar for the different sw collection strategies for tw based scenarios the maximum tn tp and chl a concentrations and tsi increased from 0 2 to 24 1 0 64 to 45 13 8 92 to 138 27 and from 0 64 to 5 34 respectively for treated sw collection compared to no sw collection and the maximum tn tp and chl a concentrations and tsi increased from 30 24 to 237 78 17 9 to 186 96 46 78 to 403 74 and from 0 08 to 22 51 for untreated sw collection compared to no sw collection for rw based scenarios however the changes in the maximum tn tp and chl a concentrations for the different sw collection strategies were much smaller and ranged from 6 92 to 0 34 stormwater can cause obvious differences in tw based scenarios because of the contribution of atmospheric p particles entering the lake with rain hobbie et al 2017 stormwater has much less influence than the supplied rw in rw based scenarios 3 3 3 implications for the management of urban lakes the trophic states of the urban pond under different water supply strategies are shown in table 4 the trophic states caused by various water sources were highest for rw followed by sw then treated rw and were lowest for tw in urban ponds with similar hydrological and hydraulic characteristics in ponds supplied by rw and sw rw replenishment had a significant influence on algal growth which shows that rw ponds were the cyanophyta chlorophyta bacillariophyta type and had high algal diversity while sw ponds were the cyanophyta type and had low diversity in rw ponds po3 p and no3 n are the main nutrients absorbed by planktonic microbes muhid et al 2013 by contrast organic nitrogen which is not readily absorbed by aquatic plants and phytoplankton is abundant in sw ponds the fact that cyanophyta do not compete as strongly for no3 n as other phytoplankton divisions berg et al 2003 rothenberger et al 2009 means that the richness of cyanophyta is much lower in rw ponds than in sw ponds with continued rw replenishment non dominant species tend to decrease significantly while dominant species tend to increase because of long term competition dakos et al 2009 pomati et al 2011 which results in increased biomass but decreased diversity engineering measures such as constructed wetlands and floating beds are beneficial for improving the quality of the supplied reclaimed water in rw ponds and have been widely used to inhibit algal growth and prevent water from becoming eutrophic li et al 2013 wakelin et al 2008 both plants and filters have important roles in nutrient removal water quality in treated rw ponds can vary seasonally and spatially corresponding with both the vegetation growth and water circulation li et al 2013 the water quality is best in tw ponds because of the low nutrient concentrations in the supplied water 3 3 4 optimized water supply strategies the cost and integrated objectives of the different water supply strategies are shown in figs 9 and 10 the total costs for the different scenarios were highest when sw was not collected followed by collection of treated sw and were lowest for collection of untreated sw apart from c1 e1 a1 the integrated objectives were highest when untreated sw was collected followed by the collection of treated sw and were lowest when sw was not collected the rank order of total costs reflects the fact that when sw is not collected the cost of pipeline reconstruction exceeds the cost of sw collection and treatment when sw is collected treatment facilities are needed whereas no treatment facilities are needed when sw is not treated when the objectives i e the eutrophication risks eutrophication state and economic costs are integrated the optimized water supply strategy is to collect treated sw and use tw as the water supply 4 conclusions through this study we have illustrated how chla and the trophic state in an urban constructed pond respond to different water supply strategies we have also suggested how the water supply should be optimized to minimize the risks of eutrophication the sw collection strategies did not have any obvious impact on the nutrient levels and trophic state of the constructed pond however there was a clear difference between the chla level and the tsi in the urban constructed pond for every increase of 25 in the contribution of rw to the water supply the constructed pond ranged from oligo mesotrophic when totally supplied with tw to hypereutrophic when completely supplied with rw our data show that to prevent the eutrophication risk and at the same time consider the economic cost it is best to collect treated sw and have tw as the main source we need to have further discussions about the trophic states of different urban constructed ponds with different catchment sizes and water supply strategies to find the best ways to minimize the risks of

types using a bayesian estimator to investigate the impact of dynamic phenology on modeled gpp and hydrologic processes phenology predicted by the dcbp model is input to the duke coupled hydrology model with prognostic vegetation dchm pv and hydrologic conditions are input to the dcbp model to specify water availability constraints the coupled model framework was evaluated against ameriflux tower data and remotely sensed fpar and lai products sensitivity analysis of the predicted daily fpar lai and gpp to the diurnal cycle of root zone water indicates that mid day soil water availability is the primary control on seasonality across different pfts and soil textures in the dcbp model further calibrated parameters describing plant water relations change significantly depending on whether the inference period used in the data assimilation includes persistent meteorological drought thus effectively resulting in distinct plant water use strategies in the dchm pv the dynamics of water stress recovery are examined by mapping seasonal phenology into the phase space of soil water stress and carbon uptake in the southeast u s simulated annual differences in gpp can be as high as 350 g c m2 year with et increases up to 125 mm year during wet years these values represent first order estimates of the dynamics of plant water use feedbacks on the water and carbon budgets and highlight the need to incorporate vegetation specific phenology responses to water availability in order to accurately estimate the terrestrial carbon storage component of the global carbon budget at local and regional scales keywords predictive vegetation phenology coupled eco hydrologic modelling water stress data assimilation fraction of photosynthetically active radiation leaf area index 1 introduction photosynthesis is constrained by ecosystem water availability temperature and sunlight farquhar et al 1980 farquhar and von caemmerer 1982 extreme weather events e g droughts heat waves cold snaps and large storms alter these external conditions interrupting normal plant development and inhibiting healthy plant function during the growing season when the plant life cycle is stunted vegetation undergoes less efficient photosynthesis and will uptake less carbon in comparison to healthy conditions changes in the frequency and duration of droughts and extreme weather events are expected to increasingly impact areas with dense vegetation in the future richardson et al 2013 sheffield and wood 2007 meehl and tebaldi 2004 consequently there is a critical need to understand how changes in atmospheric and soil conditions control and limit plant growth and development and how this will impact carbon uptake by vegetation e g kim et al 2015 caldararu et al 2014 this study evaluates water light and temperature limitations on growing season productivity by using a coupled modeling approach to estimating carbon uptake across different vegetation types where both photosynthesis and the seasonal dynamics of canopy biophysical properties are physically constrained by concurrent meteorological and soil hydrological states healthy plant function and growth requires specific ranges of temperature sunlight soil moisture and atmospheric water vapor zhao and running 2010 thus these environmental factors are often incorporated into models of vegetation phenology e g kim et al 2015 caldararu et al 2014 forkel et al 2014 migliavacca et al 2012 st√∂ckli et al 2008 jolly et al 2005 canopy seasonal dynamics manifest as canopy greenness represented by leaf area index lai and canopy light availability referred to as the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar changes in these canopy biophysical properties in response to inter and intra seasonal changes in temperature and light and water availability modulate and control the variability in carbon assimilation rates lowman and barros 2016 sun et al 2011 tian et al 2010 it is difficult to predict how accounting for temperature light and water limitations on canopy seasonal dynamics will impact estimates of carbon uptake at daily seasonal and annual time scales because the relationship between lai and gross primary productivity gpp varies across ecosystems and soil types lowman and barros 2016 further lai decreases due to defoliation during drought and increases upon refoliation once favorable

metric of phenologic stage canopy greenness and foliar development based on concurrent meteorological conditions jolly et al 2005 st√∂ckli et al 2008 the atmospheric and land surface variables that impact plant phenology and are used to calculate gsi are temperature length of time exposed to sunlight i e photoperiod and plant water stress jolly et al 2005 jolly and running 2004 temperature and photoperiod modulate the seasonality of phenology for example they signal when plants should begin sprouting and flushing leaves atmospheric water demand a proxy for potential evaporation is represented by vapor pressure deficit vpd and determines variability in leaf growth and shedding that occurs intermittently during the growing season prior research has shown that total i e realistic water stress impacts on canopy greenness and carbon uptake cannot by captured by vpd alone sims et al 2014 kim et al 2015 and that soil moisture exerts an important control on vegetation phenology caldararu et al 2014 forkel et al 2014 zhou et al 2013 migliavacca et al 2012 viskari et al 2015 and st√∂ckli et al 2008 successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of using data assimilation da techniques to constrain model forecasts of canopy biophysical properties using observations in both studies predicted phenological cycles reasonably reproduce start and end of season dates that correspond to bud burst and leaf drop further viskari et al 2015 point out that modeling the sensitivity of the plant life cycle to environmental factors is key to predict fall leaf senescence the emphasis here is on modeling the temporal evolution of canopy biophysical properties throughout the year the goal is to predict lai and fpar toward improving carbon uptake estimates for this purpose a coupled model framework is proposed and tested where predicted fpar and lai are constrained by atmospheric and soil water conditions within a land surface hydrology model that concurrently modulates water heat and carbon fluxes thus coupling the water and carbon cycles specifically da is used first for estimating dynamic canopy biophysical properties dcbp model parameters in the context of a coupled eco hydrological framework including soil water availability and atmospheric water demand feedbacks on fpar lai and gpp fpar and lai forecasts depend on daily changes in the gsi driven by sub daily changes in atmospheric and soil water availability determined by the hydrology model the parameters of the modified gsi index functions used here vary by plant functional type and soil texture and are estimated by assimilating moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis mod15a2 fpar and lai products using an ensemble kalman filter based enkf model the bayesian approach allows for quantifying uncertainties in the parameter estimates in the present work the propagation of parameter uncertainties to model outputs are examined by running monte carlo simulations of the coupled hydrology and canopy models vegetation specific parameters required for the prognostic phenology model are estimated through an enkf based data assimilation model dcbp model parameter estimates that depend on the time period selected for da the objectives of this manuscript are 1 to determine an appropriate timescale to represent the feedbacks among phenologic and hydrologic processes and capture the intra seasonal variability of canopy biophysical properties 2 to evaluate sources of uncertainty in the data assimilation step that estimates prognostic phenology model parameters and uncertainty propagation through to the coupled land surface eco hydrology model with dynamic vegetation 3 to understand how specific vegetation water exchange processes control phenologic responses to water stress and 4 to quantify how incorporating dynamically varying fpar and lai in a coupled land surface eco hydrology model impact estimates of carbon uptake and evapotranspiration under wet and dry conditions 2 methods 2 1 overview the duke coupled hydrology model with vegetation dchm v is merged with a prognostic model for dynamic canopy biophysical properties dcbp that estimates the phenologic indicators of fpar and lai based on concurrent atmospheric and soil conditions within the model the dcbp model is based on the growing season index gsi originally developed by jolly et al 2005 and implemented by st√∂ckli et al 2008 the gsi describes water light and temperature controls on plant growth and senescence here a modified form of the gsi is used that includes an explicit dependence on soil water potential and thus root zone soil moisture demand in addition to the original dependence on atmospheric water demand represented by vpd the prognostic phenology model uses the gsi at the daily timescale to determine new leaf growth the method consists of using beer s law to relate a prognostic phenology state indicator to the biophysical state variables of fpar and lai sellers et al 1996 2 2 land surface eco hydrology model the dchm v is a physically based land surface hydrology model with coupled water and energy balances and a biochemical representation of photosynthesis lowman and barros 2016 garcia quijano and barros 2005 the dchm v consists of 1 a mass balance to solve for runoff soil moisture and soil temperature 2 an energy balance to solve for soil temperature and determine latent sensible and ground heat fluxes 3 snow accumulation and snowmelt physics and 4 a biochemical formulation of leaf photosynthesis barros 1995 devonec and barros 2002 garcia quijano and barros 2005 gebremichael and barros 2006 yildiz and barros 2005 2007 2009 tao and barros 2013 2014 lowman and barros 2016 here the model is implemented in 1 d column where water and energy fluxes are evaluated at individual pixels between the atmospheric boundary layer and three soil layers in the upper horizons including a superficial layer and two deeper layers in the rooting zone each column represents the land surface as a single soil texture selected based on the predominant soil type and land cover class with its own surface roughness and soil hydraulic properties 2 3 canopy biophysical properties model the dcbp model is based on the premise that meteorological and soil conditions control canopy greenness and uses gsi as the indicator of current vegetation phenologic state within the model temperature and daylength determine the seasonal cycle for the canopy biophysical outputs of fpar and lai minimum temperature t min below which photosynthesis shuts off is the dominant control on the seasonal cycle of the gsi daylength pht provides an indication of the photoperiod or the amount of time plants are exposed to solar radiation during the day and also controls the seasonal cycle of gsi as stated earlier the gsi formulation proposed by jolly et al 2005 is modified here to add soil water availability by using the soil water potential œà soil in addition to the metric of atmospheric water demand vpd this modification introduces a soil water stress constraint on canopy seasonal dynamics in addition to the meteorological water stress condition daily averages of vpd and œà soil vpd avg and œà s o i l a v g provide information about the inter seasonal impacts of meteorological and hydrological drought that may hinder and abate plant growth and impact warm season values of the gsi the specific averaging schemes for vpd avg and œà s o i l a v g that were evaluated for this study are described in detail in section 2 5 the gsi is calculated as the product of four indicator functions 1 g s i f t m i n f p h t 1 f v p d a v g f œà s o i l a v g it is a unitless index that varies between 0 and 1 with 0 indicating a period of no growth and 1 indicating a period of unconstrained growth examples of the indicator functions and gsi for the us dk2 ameriflux eddy covariance tower location demonstrate how the index functions for t min and pht govern the overall seasonality of plant growth while vpd avg and œà s o i l a v g track water availability restrictions during warm season months fig 1 the indicator functions that make up the gsi take the form of simple linear functions varying from 0 to 1 unhindered photosynthesis 2 f x 0 x x m i n x x m i n x m a x x m i n x m i n x x m a x 1 x x m a x where x is the representative daily value of the variable and x min and x max are the minimum and maximum values bracketing the range of suboptimal conditions for plant growth jolly et al 2005 the parameters for the gsi based prognostic phenology model are summarized in table 1 note that the gsi is simulated at daily timescale but vpd and œà soil are available at sub hourly intervals from the dchm v therefore the avg subscript refers to averaging at a timescale within the diurnal cycle that best captures water stress controls on gsi the indicator functions and gsi are calculated at the end of each 24 h period within the dchm v once the representative daily values for t min pht vpd avg and œà soil avg are calculated described in section 3 1 at the end of a complete diurnal cycle eq 2 is applied to determine the value of the indicator functions and eq 1 is used next to compute gsi the gsi provides the potential phenological state under current meteorological and soil conditions the prognostic phenology model builds upon the gsi by introducing a metric to describe the current phenological state p and using the difference between the potential and true phenological states to determine the rate of change of fpar the true prognostic state is defined in terms of a linear scaling of fpar st√∂ckli et al 2008 3 p f p a r f p a r m i n f p a r m a x f p a r m i n the relative growth vector Œ¥gsi is positive when the predicted potential phenological state gsi is greater than the current phenological state p and negative when the converse is true this indicates whether vegetation is growing or senescing with a relative magnitude 4 Œ¥ g s i g s i p leaf growth Œ¥ f p a r Œ¥ t depends on a growth rate term Œ≥ the growth rate vector Œ¥gsi and a logistic growth constraint p 1 p 5 Œ¥ f p a r Œ¥ t Œ≥ Œ¥ g s i p 1

including a separate integration step in the data assimilation scheme required for prognostic lai 2 4 parameter estimation for the dcbp model the gsi index functions require eight parameters defining the range of suboptimal growing conditions and three additional parameters are needed for fpar and lai calculations to describe canopy seasonal dynamics table 1 these parameters are estimated by assimilating the modis mod15a2 fpar and lai data separately at locations with different vegetation and soil characteristics the methodology consists of da with joint state i e fpar and lai and parameter estimation the joint state parameter estimation procedure was initially developed by moradkhani et al 2005 and later implemented by st√∂ckli et al 2008 in their prognostic phenology model the dual state and parameter estimator is an enkf model where a kalman gain function is applied to parameters and states separately essentially estimating the parameters based on predicted model states and then predicting and updating the model states based on the parameters when the data are available asynchronous assimilation the fpar and lai data are assimilated every 8 days native temporal resolution of the data product a full description of the da model is provided in appendix a the ensembles are initialized with a random seeding by sampling model parameters from gaussian distributions using initial values and variances informed from previous research table 1 the da model is run recursively using a single year or multiple years of input data spin up until the estimated parameters reach a steady state 3 rounds of spin up the period 2004 2006 was selected as the reference period for assimilating fpar and lai because it spans both wet 2004 and dry 2006 years providing an upper and lower bound for stressed 2006 and non stressed 2004 conditions in the southeast u s however the selection of the data assimilation window is examined to determine how the inter annual variability of wet and dry periods affects the inter annual variability of fpar and lai observations which in turn impact parameter estimates and model results in addition to 2004 2006 nine 3 year periods beginning with 2002 2004 and ending with 2010 2012 and one 11 year period from 2002 to 2012 are employed in the data assimilation model to evaluate how non stationarity impacts the overall coupled model approach 2 5 coupled model formulation and error analysis the duke coupled hydrology model with predictive vegetation dchm pv combines the dchm v and dcbp model fig 2 the model is implemented at 4 km spatial resolution for the southeast u s a time step of 30 min is used in the dchm v for this study and thus œà soil and vpd must be upscaled to representative daily values for input to the dcbp model in turn the dcbp model provides predicted fpar and lai that impact the water balance energy budget and photosynthesis rates through canopy interception and evapotranspiration in the dchm pv the predicted fpar and lai are held constant until updated by the dcbp model at the daily interval three simulation conditions are tested to determine the timescales at which parameterizations of soil water controls best capture impacts on canopy seasonal dynamics and to investigate the appropriate approach to estimate representative daily values of œà soil and vpd the weakest water limiting condition takes the daily average of vpd and œà soil as inputs for the gsi weak a more restrictive condition takes the average of vpd and œà soil over daylight hours from 11 to 23 utc approximately 7 am 7 pm lst strict finally the most stringent condition takes the average of the water limiting indices from 16 to 20 utc approximately 12 pm 4 pm lst very strict for each case a monte carlo ensemble of 2000 sets of parameter estimates were generated by sampling from gaussian distributions sharing the final means and standard deviations of the dcbp model parameters estimated from data assimilation a separate dchm pv simulation is run for each ensemble member 3 data 3 1 model forcing data the dchm pv uses atmospheric forcing from the north america land data assimilation

the nldas 2 as the dchm pv however it takes the daily minimum temperature value vpd avg and œà s o i l a v g are calculated by the dchm pv at the representative daily averages described previously

mod15a2 data were quality controlled gap filled and smoothed with timesat using an adaptive savitzky golay filter j√∂nsson and eklundh 2004 this filter preserves higher moments in the data and reduces the resulting bias chen et al 2004 the data were subsequently interpolated in space and time to the resolution required by the dchm v lowman and barros 2016 where available half hourly gpp estimates derived from co2 flux measurements from ameriflux eddy covariance flux towers located in the southeast u s were obtained for comparison to model gpp output baldocchi 2003 baldocchi et al 2001 these sites are summarized in table 2 and a map of their locations can be found in supplementary material fig s1 4 results 4 1 hydroclimatic non stationarity and data assimilation period the results from parameter estimation reflect the water stress conditions of the period used to assimilate modis fpar and lai data fig 3 whereas the parameters for t min pht fpar min and lai max show little sensitivity to inter annual variability the indicators of water stress and the growth rate Œ≥ demonstrate strong dependence on the hydroclimatic regime in the final year of the assimilation period which is to say on soil moisture availability this implies that the upper bound of the memory of the plant soil moisture feedback in the current implementation of the model is about one year in the years preceding and following serious droughts i e 2004 through 2008 œà soilmax estimates are 5 7 5 higher in 2009 and 2010 œà soilmax is 15 and 5 lower respectively compared to the 2012 control thus even when using all available modis fpar and lai observations the parameters estimated from data assimilation exhibit strong sensitivity to soil moisture conditions the first order effect of these different parameters is on the resulting gsi that identifies the potential phenologic state fig 4 the data assimilation periods that include drought years 2004 2006 and 2008 2010 exhibit sharp decreases in gsi under water stress the 2008 2010 period begins in a severe drought and consistently has the lowest gsi the 2004 2006 period starts under wet conditions and has the highest gsi except when under water stress we find that using parameters estimated from different data assimilation periods has the effect in the dchm pv of calibrating for an adaptive plant water use strategy that conserves soil moisture the vegetation parameters are trained to uptake water transpire and assimilate carbon whenever conditions are favorable and quickly shut down at the onset of water stress models of canopy conductance and transpiration an important component of the water and energy budget for forested areas depend on lai to scale from leaf or stand to canopy level transpiration e g sellers 1985 sellers et al 1992 our results demonstrate that a key source of variability in warm season lai predictions stems from how water stress is accounted for in the data assimilation model either by how sub daily atmospheric and soil water conditions are up scaled or by incorporating drought conditions into the assimilated data this is significant because a difference of 1 m2 m2 in lai can lead to a change in canopy transpiration of 0 5 mm day in pine forests tor ngern et al 2017 4 2 estimated parameters from data assimilation the da model estimates eleven index function and canopy seasonal dynamics parameters tables 3 and 4 the parameters are successfully constrained when a reduction of the ensemble standard deviation to within 20 of the initial uncertainty is achieved st√∂ckli et al 2008 successful constraints on the climatic parameters are demonstrated by the convergence of the parameter estimates and uncertainties during the first of 3 spin up simulations each spanning the 3 year reference period figs 5 and 6 not all of the intra seasonal water limitation parameters are successfully constrained within the first round of spin up however vpd min and œà s o i l m a x which indicate the onset of plant water stress and diminished photosynthetic capacity have significant reductions in uncertainty within the first spin up period fig 6 at nearly all tower sites initial uncertainty is successfully constrained after 3 rounds of spin up for the parameters determining the onset of reduced photosynthesis e g t m i n m a x pht max v p d a v g m i n and œà s o i l a v g m

all tower sites have pht max constrained to within 10 of initial uncertainty except us sp4 where pht max is constrained to below 20 the data assimilation model is less successful at reducing uncertainty in the parameters that signal complete photosynthesis shut down i e t m i n m i n v p d a v g m a x and œà s o i l a v g m i n local topography impacts the diurnal cycle of cold air flow and humidity and makes it difficult to pin down phenologically relevant values for the microclimate conditions of minimum daily temperature and vpd cory et al 2017 however the dchm pv simulations account for the high uncertainty in these parameters by using a monte carlo approach thus the uncertainty stemming from the data assimilation step is fully propagated in the coupled model results the canopy biophysical parameters of fpar min and lai max are well constrained to within the first round of spin up as a result of reduced uncertainty in the analyzed states fig 7 for all tower sites fpar min is estimated to within 10 of initial uncertainty and likewise for the growth rate parameter Œ≥ is constrained to within 10 of initial uncertainty at all sites but us sp4 table 4 overall all canopy biophysical parameters are constrained to below 20 of initial uncertainty thus the data assimilation model performs well for estimating the canopy biophysical parameters these dcbp model parameter estimates by the da model hold across all three simulation types for weak strict and very strict water limiting conditions see tables s1 s4 in supplementary material 4 3 predicted fpar and lai dchm pv model results are shown at three towers with different pfts figs 8 and 9 us chr deciduous broadleaf us dk1 mixed forest and us nc2 grassland table 2 during the wet year 2004 the predicted fpar and lai values remain near the minimum fpar and maximum lai values estimated from the data assimilation step table 4 and figs 8 and 9 in the dry year 2007 results show reduced fpar and lai during the growing season compared to 2004 due to drought in the southeast u s lowman and barros 2016 brun and barros 2014 additionally the us chr and us dk1 sites which contain more deciduous vegetation types show large decreases in predicted fpar and lai after august 2007 in response to drought induced water stress the modis data exhibit a similar reduction in fpar and lai for the us dk1 site but do not reproduce it for the us chr site note the unrealistic growing season for the grassland site with green up occurring in january 2007 at us nc2 during dormant months the predicted fpar and lai values for the wet and dry years are similar to the modis data there are no time series of fpar and lai available at any of the eddy covariance tower locations for comparison in order to evaluate the strength of the enforcement of growing season water stress in the dcbp the three different upscaling approaches to integrate sub daily water demand to the daily scale were evaluated the largest differences in the time series of fpar and lai resulting from the weak red strict green and very strict blue occur in the summertime and early fall and for dry conditions e g 2007 drought with very strict mid day controls resulting in lower values 4 4 dchm pv carbon assimilation rates gpp estimates derived from eddy covariance flux tower observations are not available for many of the ameriflux sites and where available the records are incomplete and rigorous uncertainty estimates are lacking the latter require both good understanding of the uncertainties in the measurements of the geophysical observables used to estimate gpp e g papale et al 2006 and uncertainty in the gpp estimates proper raj et al 2016 therefore the objective here is to evaluate whether and how the model captures the overall behavior and range of the observations fig 10 shows two years of predicted gpp at two collocated mixed forest sites us dk2 and us dk3 within the same model grid point against modis and tower based estimates every 8 days the nominal modis resolution the uncertainties associated with the predicted fpar and lai do not create large uncertainties in model estimated gpp as indicated by the nearly imperceptible 2œÉ interval fig 10 the weak strict and very strict simulations produce nearly the same estimates of daily gpp not shown dchm pv modis and ameriflux estimates are in good agreement until early summer in either 2002 or 2004 and likewise in the fall however in the early summer of 2004 before rainfall input from hurricane activity in late august and september and especially throughout the entire summer season in 2002 the model gpp is lower than the observations though exhibiting behavior consistent with the tower estimates which is overestimated by modis this is explained in part by lower rainfall in the stageiv product at 4 km resolution compared to point scale rain gauge observations at the tower and also by the timing of rainfall that redressed soil moisture deficits at the beginning of the warm season brun and barros 2014 in addition the dchm pv in its current formulation does not include a representation of deep roots and their ability to tap into the water table and the capillary fringe which could play a significant role under severe drought conditions at certain locations there is less spread in the water limiting simulations during the wet year 2004 compared to the dry year 2002 specifically during green up in the spring in 2002 uncertainty in estimated gpp increases during green up and again in the fall the timing of the increased uncertainty in gpp appears to correspond to soil water holding capacity so called soil field capacity that is tied to soil texture compare figs s2 and s3 for ameriflux sites with silty and clayey soils against figs s4 and s5 for locations in sandy soils gpp uncertainty is higher at sites with more porous soils in the growing season months than in the green up and senescence periods on the other hand sites with low porosity soils tend to have low uncertainty during the warm months overall the dchm pv gpp estimates for all sites agree well with the ameriflux tower data figs s2 s5 where two towers are collocated fig s2 for us dk2 us dk3 and fig s5 for us sp1 us sp2 the model gpp tends to be between the two towers albeit closer to one than another which is indicative of uncertainty linked to sub grid scale spatial variability 5 discussion 5 1 canopy conductance as an integrated metric of plant water use the canopy conductance g c is the primary plant function that modulates the plant carbon uptake response to changes in the fpar and lai as discussed in section 4 1 the estimated parameters depend on the choice of data assimilation periods which directly influence the gsi fpar and lai predictions made in the dchm pv are determined based on the gsi lai directly effects the canopy resistance function r c g c 1 used in the dchm pv garcia quijano and barros 2005 9 r c r c m i n l a i j w j f s i j t 1 0 6 ln v p d 1 Œ¥ 1 where rc min is the minimum canopy resistance for nighttime maintenance j w j f s i and j t represent functional dependencies on soil moisture incoming shortwave radiation and temperature respectively and Œ¥ is a parameter describes the sensitivity of canopy conductance to vpd in the model formulation eq 13 active lai directly scales the canopy conductance meaning that higher predicted lai will produce larger canopy conductance values this scaling can account for a change of canopy conductance by 1 33 cm s for values of lai less than 6 m2 m2 granier et al 2000 discerning active and inactive lai is limited within the dchm pv to the spatial resolution at which the simulations are conducted i e 16 sq km changes in precipitation and boundary layer meteorology result in changes in evapotranspiration and soil moisture availability and consequently phenology the feedbacks among hydrometeorological variability and predicted lai are examined in figs 11 and 12 using results from the very strict dchm pv simulations under different data assimilation periods and thus different dcbp model parameters as expected higher lai corresponds to greater canopy conductance and carbon assimilation rates in the wet year the simulation with the most aggressive water stress adaptation strategy 2004 2006 has the highest daily lai values and sub daily g c and gpp estimates fig 11 in contrast the simulation with the most conservative water use strategy 2008 2010 consistently has the lowest lai canopy conductance and carbon uptake rate estimates the results are similar during the green up period april in the dry year before the onset of extreme water stress fig 12 which is indicative of memory in the coupled soil plant water system in the summer months both the most aggressive and conservative strategies produce lower lai resulting in lower canopy conductance and gpp 5 2 seasonal dynamics of fpar lai and gpp the results for the dchm pv predicted fpar lai and gpp suggest that model uncertainty follows seasonal patterns specifically the seasonal dynamics of fpar and lai map narrow trajectories even when accounting for the uncertainty across the monte carlo simulations see appendix b and videos s1 s3 in supplementary materials at the us chr site there is little gpp variability across ensemble members on individual days during wet and dry years suggesting that gpp differences among ensemble members cannot be attributed to uncertainty in fpar and lai predictions figs 13a b and 14a b during the dry year there is a clear reduction in august in gpp that occurs in conjunction with a decrease in predicted fpar and lai fig 14a b in the post drought recovery there are days in september and october where gpp varies with fpar and lai this response is appropriate for a deciduous forest that would experience some degree of defoliation in response to prolonged drought during the refoliation period we expect the carbon assimilation rates to scale according to the amount of recovered canopy structure this behavior is similar to that observed in boreal deciduous vegetation where increases in photosynthesis rates after a defoliation event caused by drought freezing or infestation depend on the severity of the defoliating event man et al 2013 welp et al 2007 similarly post drought gpp estimates at the us chr site depend on canopy response to the drought severity observed by the individual ensemble members the mixed forest example is similar to the deciduous forest described above during the wet year daily gpp estimates do not show large variations across the ensemble members in response to different fpar and lai predictions fig 13c d at the us dk1 site there is a mix of deciduous and evergreen vegetation that alters the post drought response and results in large differences the evergreen vegetation canopies tend to be less sensitive to defoliation events and the corresponding reductions in gpp tend to be less severe than for deciduous trees welp et al 2007 consequently the range of lai and fpar values during and post drought for the deciduous forest is much larger than what is observed at the mixed forest site fig 14c d the grassland site us nc2 on sandy soil demonstrates higher variability in gpp estimates with fpar and lai predictions during both wet and dry years figs 13e f and 14e f during the wet years there are clear differences in gpp estimates among ensemble members during periods of green up april through mid may and senescence september through mid october this behavior is similar during the dry year and in addition we observe differences in gpp estimates across ensemble members during the summer drought note the isolated ensemble member in figs 13e f and 14e f corresponding to extreme water stress leading to strong reductions in fpar and lai during the warm season may oct in both years the higher model uncertainty in predicted fpar and lai during leaf out and senescing periods is consistent with results from other prognostic phenology models viskari et al 2015 showed that determining the initial bud burst produces the largest uncertainty in lai predictions during the spring indeed the larger ranges of uncertainty in fpar and lai in april and may show differing trajectories across ensemble members in terms of the initial bud burst timing and resulting green up period kim et al 2015 found larger errors in phenologic stage development when there is a higher discrepancy in soil water availability similarly our results show a smaller range in uncertainty for forested vegetation during a dry year in response to water limitations that impose growing season reductions on the canopy biophysical properties 5 3 mapping recovery responses to water stress the response to water stress is evaluated by mapping annual trajectories of gpp and soil water potential for different vegetation types summarized in fig 15 see figs s6 s9 organized by pft for trajectories for all tower sites the mean trajectories over the 11 years of simulation results demonstrate similar structures in soil water stress carbon phase space the highest mid day gpp 12 4 pm occurs during green up in may and decreases to dormant levels during late august and early september during the wet year 2004 the deciduous forest site us chr follows along a similar path as the mean climatology however the mixed forest and grassland sites us dk1 and us nc2 sustain higher mid day gpp during the warm season months the highest mid day gpp occurs during green up in the dry year 2007 but quickly decreases and remains low throughout the warm season at all three sites decreases in mid day gpp that remain within the range defined by the mean climatology are related to intermittent changes in precipitation not drought the signature of drought that is persistent water stress is evident when gpp falls below the mean trajectory during the warm months in 2007 gpp and soil water potential decrease in august showing the effect of soil water limiting plant productivity at the us chr site atmospheric water limitations are evident at the us dk1 and us nc2 towers in 2007 when gpp goes below the climatological trajectory range without a change in soil water potential in this case vegetation is regulating productivity by closing the stomata both the closure of stomata and decreased carbon fixation within the mesophyll cells contribute to reductions in carbon uptake under drought conditions zhou et al 2013 the vegetation processes modeled by the dchm pv account for both stomatal and non stomatal controls of photosynthesis during drought which allow for distinguishing the effects of atmospheric limitations on canopy conductance and the impact of soil water stress on carbon fixation lowman and barros 2016 garcia quijano and barros 2005 the average phenology regime is defined by the climatological trajectory in 2004 the us dk1 and us nc2 demonstrate how certain vegetation may exceed the gpp of the average phenology regime when there are no water restrictions weather controls during the warm season reduce gpp in the short term and temporarily dry the soils in this case gpp remains within the range defined by the average phenology regime as seen at the us chr site in 2007 atmospheric and soil water limitations arise when gpp falls below the average phenology regime soil water controls are dominant when soil water potential decreases with gpp atmospheric water controls dominate when gpp decreases without a decrease in soil water potential under severe drought conditions low gpp is sustained for a range of low soil water potential values choice of data assimilation period also influences vegetation recovery responses to water stress fig s10 there is little difference in the phase space plots when using all available years for data assimilation 2002 2012 or using a period of low water stress 2010 2012 further the trajectories when using parameters estimated during a water stress period 2004 2007 are similar to the others during a wet year however decreases in gpp due to reductions in soil water potential during july and august are larger in a dry year the shaded bands in fig s10 highlight the regions of phase space with much wider trajectory and thus hysteresis in the recovery of gpp and œà soil after extended periods without rain in the warm season in 2007 in contrast with the lack of hysteresis when using the parameters inferred from climatology or 2010 2012 hysteresis reflects a water use strategy aimed at soil moisture conservation 5 4 vegetation biophysical properties and water stress overall the dchm pv reproduces the expected biophysical plant relationships waring and landsberg 2011 and responses to water stress fig s11 stomatal conductance is controlled by soil moisture atmospheric water demand temperature and incoming shortwave radiation eq 13 vpd a proxy for atmospheric water demand should be a strong predictor for stomatal conductance the dchm pv results exhibit a strongly nonlinear relationship between vpd and stomatal conductance for all of the study sites fig 16 when atmospheric demand is high i e vpd 3 kpa the stomatal conductance quickly goes to zero for all vegetation types low values of vpd have little effect on stomatal conductance evident by the large spread in stomatal conductance when vpd 2 kpa consideration of how evapotranspiration et varies with root water uptake provides an interesting means of separating plant transpiration from soil evaporation fig 17 at continental locations the relationship between root water uptake and et is nearly linear when atmospheric demand is low fig 17a interestingly a bifurcation in the relationship between et and root water uptake is found in coastal sites fig 17b and c under soil water stress sandy soils demonstrate a nearly linear relationship between et and root water uptake however when there is low soil water stress this relationship is highly nonlinear fig 17c in non sandy soils the bifurcation is attributed to atmospheric water demand under low demand a nearly linear relationship between et and root water uptake exists however when there is high atmospheric water demand this relationship is highly nonlinear fig 17b transpiration presents as the linear component of these relationships when either vpd is high or sandy soils are excessively moist evaporation from soils is dominant future work will address some limitations of the modeling approach including shallow soils and root systems that may not be adequate to capture the response of low elevation forests to drought especially in locations where access to water table is possible as well as distributed hydrology with coupled groundwater e g tao et al 2016 tao and barros 2013 2014 5 5 impact of predicted versus prescribed phenology on gpp annual gpp and et values from two 11 year continuous simulations with predicted dchm pv and prescribed phenology dchm v using modis mod15a2 fpar and lai as forcing data are compared in fig 18 see figs s12 and s13 for all ameriflux towers in general the model with predictive phenology yields higher gpp and higher et except during drought at which time water use feedbacks control plant growth at all but the us sp4 sites annual gpp estimate are higher in the dchm pv strict simulations than in the dchm v simulations as expected the woody savannah and grassland sites show the least amount of change in gpp estimates with the introduction of variable canopy seasonal dynamics us cav us goo us nc2 us sp1 us sp3 and us sp4 for the deciduous broadleaf sites annual gpp estimate from the dchm pv tend to be 100 350 g c m2 year higher during non drought years but have similar estimates to the dchm v simulations under drought conditions fig 18 us chr and us wbw the sites with mixed forest vegetation tend to have larger annual gpp estimates in the simulations with predictive lai and fpar however these increases are not as large as those for the deciduous forest sites us akn us dk1 us dk2 and us nc1 likewise simulated et is generally higher in the dchm pv up to 125 mm year except in 2007 when strategic soil water use by vegetation results in lower evaporation and slightly lower gpp as shown in fig s13 for us chr and us wbw there are no significant differences in gpp for the us sp sites but the change in et is significant fig 18 shows the annual Œ¥gpp and Œ¥et differences as a synthesis of the net impact of plant soil water use feedbacks on the coupled carbon and water budgets which can represent 5 20 of the annual values despite large inter annual hydrometeorological variability these results suggest that dynamic accounting of water carbon cycle feedbacks should result in large evapotranspiration and higher gpp under wet meteorological regimes and the opposite under drought the coupled soil vegetation atmosphere system conserves water during drought by reducing transpiration and concurrently reducing gpp 5 6 relevance for ecological models the intent of the work presented is to inform ecological modelling by bringing to light key issues in modelling canopy biophysical states constrained by water availability thus linking the carbon and water cycles two main findings are 1 canopy biophysical properties are best predicted when considering water limitation during mid day hours consistent with garcia quijano and barros 2005 and 2 estimated parameters are calibrated to wet or dry conditions based on the underlying climate regime in the data assimilation inference period which reflects plants ability to adapt first the comparison across the different aggregation approaches for sub daily water demand demonstrated that the verystrict simulations were best able to capture the effects of growing season drought on canopy development this suggests that future modelling studies that consider growing season water restrictions at daily or coarser temporal scales should use the mid day conditions as an indicator of overall plant water status data assimilation is often adapted to determine biophysically relevant parameters for ecology models because of its ability to improve model predictions and uncertainty estimates e g viskari et al 2015 luo et al 2011 nevertheless questions remain around the sources of uncertainty that drive ecological predictability dietze 2017 and how that uncertainty relates to the physical and natural systems that are modelled dietze et al 2013 the second key result from this work provides an additional consideration for data assimilation applications in ecological models the importance of recognizing the climatological regime inherent in the data driving models is demonstrated through the effects of different inference periods on modelled results for plant growing season development i e gsi fpar and lai further we find that uncertainty in the parameter estimates in the data assimilation model serve as a surrogate for vegetation adaptive capacity to water stress linking uncertainty to the physical constraints of the ecological problem this manuscript lays a framework for developing smart or adaptive ecological models that adjust plant biophysical properties and growing capacity to the current environmental conditions based on the climate regime 6 conclusions in this manuscript a predictive model for canopy biophysical properties was coupled to a land surface hydrology model an adequate timescale for enforcement of atmospheric and soil water stress constraints required for realistic canopy seasonal dynamics was evaluated and model uncertainty propagation was assessed to our knowledge the approach taken to predict the canopy biophysical properties of fpar and lai is the first to account for atmospheric and soil water availability concurrently the results demonstrate that the daily changes in fpar and lai are most sensitive to vpd and soil water potential controls during hours of peak solar forcing additionally the strength of these sensitivities depend on water stress conditions of the data assimilation period which effectively determine the water stress adaptation for the modeled vegetation results show that the leaf out period for forested vegetation encompasses the largest range of uncertainty for predicted fpar and lai in the dchm pv simulations under both wet and dry conditions during the summer there tends to be a narrow range of uncertainty when there is ample precipitation however in drought conditions the uncertainty in the dcbp model parameters amplifies uncertainty in predicted fpar and lai the seasonal variation in uncertainty also depends on vegetation type and microclimate as low canopy vegetation and areas with warmer climates show less variability phase diagrams of gpp and soil water potential provide a means of separating atmospheric and soil water limitations on carbon uptake rates that is consistent across vegetation types thus the modeling approach allows for a quantitative determination of confidence in the coupled model results independently of uncertainties in predicted fpar and lai explicitly incorporating the nonlinear dependence of these canopy biophysical properties on atmospheric and soil conditions increases annual gpp estimates by up to 350 g c m2 year concurrent with et increases up to 125 mm year during periods of low water stress and reductions in gpp and et up to 200 g c m2 year and 125 mm year respectively during drought thus the coupled water carbon cycle

demonstrated by considering the joint distributions for predicted fpar and lai from verystrict simulations at the deciduous and mixed forest sites us chr and us dk1 april exhibits the largest range of uncertainty during both wet and dry years in january the forested vegetation sites do not grow and thus inhabit a narrow range in the parameter space in both years during the summer predicted fpar and lai show more than twice as much variability during the drought year than in the wet year the senescence period october encompasses a much narrower range of uncertainty than april demonstrating higher agreement across the models in end of season than during the leaf out period the deciduous forest demonstrates bi modal variability during the green up period in 2004 further illustrating the higher uncertainty in predicting canopy biophysical scaling properties when water availability is not a limiting factor the grassland site shows a narrow range of uncertainty during the dormant month the ranges of uncertainties for the growing and senescing seasons are similar for low canopy vegetation types and occupy a comparable uncertainty space to the senescing period for the forested vegetation

is the primary control on seasonality across different pfts and soil textures in the dcbp model further calibrated parameters describing plant water relations change significantly depending on whether the inference period used in the data assimilation includes persistent meteorological drought thus effectively resulting in distinct plant water use strategies in the dchm pv the dynamics of water stress recovery are examined by mapping seasonal phenology into the phase space of soil water stress and carbon uptake in the southeast u s simulated annual differences in gpp can be as high as 350 g

the need to incorporate vegetation specific phenology responses to water availability in order to accurately estimate the terrestrial carbon storage component of the global carbon budget at local and regional scales keywords predictive vegetation phenology coupled eco hydrologic modelling water stress data assimilation fraction of photosynthetically active radiation leaf area index 1 introduction photosynthesis is constrained by ecosystem water availability temperature and sunlight farquhar et al 1980 farquhar and von caemmerer 1982 extreme weather events e g droughts heat waves cold snaps and large storms alter these external conditions interrupting normal plant development and inhibiting healthy plant function during the growing season when the plant life cycle is stunted vegetation undergoes less efficient photosynthesis and will uptake less carbon in comparison to healthy conditions changes in the frequency and duration of droughts and extreme weather events are expected to increasingly impact areas with dense vegetation in the future richardson et al 2013 sheffield and wood 2007 meehl and tebaldi 2004 consequently there is a critical need to understand how changes in atmospheric and soil conditions control and limit plant growth and development and how this will impact carbon uptake by vegetation e g kim et al 2015 caldararu et al 2014 this study evaluates water light and temperature limitations on growing season productivity by using a coupled modeling approach to estimating carbon uptake across different vegetation types where both photosynthesis and the seasonal dynamics of canopy biophysical properties are physically constrained by concurrent meteorological and soil hydrological states healthy plant function and growth requires specific ranges of temperature sunlight soil moisture and atmospheric water vapor zhao and running 2010 thus these environmental factors are often incorporated into models of vegetation phenology e g kim et al 2015

temperature light and water limitations on canopy seasonal dynamics will impact estimates of carbon uptake at daily seasonal and annual time scales because the relationship between lai and gross

water stress impacts on canopy greenness and carbon uptake cannot by captured by vpd alone sims et al 2014 kim et al 2015 and that soil moisture exerts an important control on vegetation phenology caldararu et al 2014 forkel et al 2014 zhou et al 2013 migliavacca et al 2012 viskari et al 2015 and st√∂ckli et al 2008 successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of using data assimilation da techniques to constrain model forecasts of canopy biophysical properties using observations in both studies predicted phenological cycles reasonably reproduce start and end of season dates that correspond to bud burst and leaf drop further viskari et al 2015 point out that modeling the sensitivity of the plant life cycle to environmental factors is key to predict fall leaf senescence the emphasis here is on modeling the temporal evolution of canopy biophysical properties throughout the year the goal is to predict lai and fpar toward improving carbon uptake estimates for this purpose a coupled model framework is proposed and tested where predicted fpar and lai are constrained by atmospheric and soil water conditions within a land surface hydrology model that concurrently modulates water heat and carbon fluxes thus coupling the water and carbon cycles specifically da is used first for estimating dynamic canopy biophysical properties dcbp model parameters in the context of a coupled eco hydrological framework including soil water availability and atmospheric water demand feedbacks on fpar lai and gpp fpar and lai forecasts depend on daily changes in the gsi driven by sub

stress and 4 to quantify how incorporating dynamically varying fpar and lai in a coupled land surface eco hydrology model impact estimates of carbon uptake and evapotranspiration under wet and dry conditions 2 methods 2 1 overview the duke coupled hydrology model with vegetation dchm v is merged with a prognostic model for dynamic canopy biophysical properties dcbp that estimates the phenologic indicators of fpar and lai based on concurrent atmospheric and soil conditions within the model the dcbp model is based on the growing season index gsi originally developed by jolly et al 2005 and implemented by st√∂ckli et al 2008 the gsi describes water light and temperature controls on plant growth and senescence here a modified form of the gsi is used that includes an explicit dependence on soil water potential and thus root zone soil moisture demand in addition to the original dependence on atmospheric water demand represented by vpd the prognostic phenology model uses the gsi at the daily timescale to determine new leaf growth the method consists of using beer s law to relate a prognostic phenology state indicator to the biophysical state variables of fpar and lai sellers et al 1996 2 2 land surface eco hydrology model the dchm v is a physically based land surface hydrology model with coupled water and energy balances and a biochemical representation of photosynthesis lowman and barros 2016 garcia quijano and barros 2005 the dchm v consists of 1 a mass balance to solve for runoff soil moisture and soil temperature 2 an energy balance to solve for soil temperature and determine latent sensible and ground heat fluxes 3 snow accumulation and snowmelt physics and 4 a biochemical formulation of leaf photosynthesis barros 1995 devonec and barros 2002 garcia quijano and barros 2005 gebremichael and barros 2006 yildiz and barros 2005 2007 2009 tao and barros 2013 2014 lowman and barros 2016 here the model is implemented in 1 d column where water and energy fluxes are evaluated at individual pixels between the atmospheric boundary layer and three soil layers in the upper horizons including a superficial layer and two deeper layers in the rooting zone each column represents the land surface as a single soil texture selected based on the predominant soil type and land cover class with its own surface roughness and soil hydraulic properties 2 3 canopy biophysical properties model the dcbp model is based on the premise that meteorological and soil conditions control canopy greenness and uses gsi as the indicator of current vegetation phenologic state within the model temperature and daylength determine the seasonal cycle for the canopy biophysical outputs of fpar and lai minimum temperature t min below which photosynthesis shuts off is the dominant control on the seasonal cycle of the gsi daylength pht provides an indication of the photoperiod or the amount of time plants are exposed to solar radiation during the day and also controls the seasonal cycle of gsi as stated earlier the gsi formulation proposed by jolly et al 2005 is modified here to add soil water availability by using the soil water potential œà soil in addition to the metric of atmospheric water demand vpd this modification introduces a soil water stress constraint on canopy seasonal dynamics in addition to the meteorological water stress condition daily averages of vpd and œà soil vpd avg and œà s o i l a v g provide information about the inter seasonal impacts of meteorological and hydrological drought that may hinder and abate plant growth and impact warm season values of the gsi the specific averaging schemes for vpd avg and œà s o i l a v g that were evaluated for this study are described in detail in section 2 5 the gsi is calculated as the product of four indicator functions 1 g s i f t m i n f p h t 1 f v p d a v g f œà s o i l a v g it is a unitless index that varies between 0 and 1 with 0 indicating a period of no growth and 1 indicating a period of unconstrained growth examples of the indicator functions and gsi for the us dk2 ameriflux eddy covariance tower location demonstrate how the index functions for t min and pht govern the overall seasonality of plant growth while vpd avg and œà s o i l a v g track water availability restrictions during warm season months fig 1 the indicator functions that make up the gsi take the form of simple linear functions varying from 0 to 1 unhindered photosynthesis 2 f x 0 x x m i n x x m i n x m a x x m i n x m i n x x m a x 1 x x m a x where x is the representative daily value of the variable and x min and x max are the minimum and maximum values bracketing the range of suboptimal conditions for plant growth jolly et al 2005 the parameters for the gsi based prognostic phenology model are summarized in table 1 note that the gsi is simulated at daily timescale but vpd and œà soil are available at sub hourly intervals from the dchm v therefore the avg subscript refers to averaging at a timescale within the diurnal cycle that best captures water stress controls on gsi the indicator functions and gsi are calculated at the end of each 24 h period within the dchm v once the representative daily values for t min pht vpd avg and œà soil avg are calculated described in section 3 1 at the end of a complete diurnal cycle eq 2 is applied to determine the value of the indicator functions and eq 1 is used next to compute gsi the gsi provides the potential phenological state under current meteorological and soil conditions the prognostic phenology model builds upon the gsi by introducing a metric to describe the current phenological state p and using the difference between the potential and true phenological states to determine the rate of change of fpar the true prognostic state is defined in terms of a linear scaling of fpar st√∂ckli et al 2008 3 p f p a r f p a r m i n f p a r m a x f p a r m i n the relative growth vector Œ¥gsi is positive when the predicted potential phenological state gsi is greater than the current phenological state p and negative when the converse is true this indicates whether vegetation is growing or senescing with a relative magnitude 4 Œ¥ g s i g s i p leaf growth Œ¥ f p a r Œ¥ t depends on a growth rate term Œ≥ the growth rate vector Œ¥gsi and a logistic growth constraint p 1 p 5 Œ¥ f p a r Œ¥ t Œ≥ Œ¥ g s i p 1

including a separate integration step in the data assimilation scheme required for prognostic lai 2 4 parameter estimation for the dcbp model the gsi index functions require eight parameters defining the range of suboptimal growing conditions and three additional parameters are needed for fpar and lai calculations to describe canopy seasonal dynamics table 1 these parameters are estimated by assimilating the modis mod15a2 fpar and lai data separately at locations with different vegetation and soil characteristics the methodology consists of da with joint state i e fpar and lai and parameter estimation the joint state parameter estimation procedure was initially developed by moradkhani et al 2005 and later implemented by st√∂ckli et al 2008 in their prognostic phenology model the dual state and parameter estimator is an enkf model where a kalman gain function is applied to parameters and states separately essentially estimating the parameters based on predicted model states and then predicting and updating the model states based on the parameters when the data are available asynchronous assimilation the fpar and lai data are assimilated every 8 days native temporal resolution of the data product a full description of the da model is provided in appendix a the ensembles are initialized with a random seeding by sampling model parameters from gaussian distributions using initial values and variances informed from previous research table 1 the da model is run recursively using a single year or multiple years of input data spin up until the estimated parameters reach a steady state 3 rounds of spin up the period 2004 2006 was selected as the reference period for assimilating fpar and lai because it spans both wet 2004 and dry 2006 years providing an upper and lower bound for stressed 2006 and non stressed 2004 conditions in the southeast u s however the selection of the data assimilation window is examined to determine how the inter annual variability of wet and dry periods affects the inter annual variability of fpar and lai observations which in turn impact parameter estimates and model results in addition to 2004 2006 nine 3 year periods beginning with 2002 2004 and ending with 2010 2012 and one 11 year period from 2002 to 2012 are employed in the data assimilation model to evaluate how non stationarity impacts the overall coupled model approach 2 5 coupled model formulation and error analysis the duke coupled hydrology model with predictive vegetation dchm pv combines the dchm v and dcbp model fig 2 the model is implemented at 4 km spatial resolution for the southeast u s a time step of 30 min is used in the dchm v for this study and thus œà soil and vpd must be upscaled to representative daily values for input to the dcbp model in turn the dcbp model provides predicted fpar and lai that impact the water balance energy budget and photosynthesis rates through canopy interception and evapotranspiration in the dchm pv the predicted fpar and lai are held constant until updated by the dcbp model at the daily interval three simulation conditions are tested to determine the timescales at which parameterizations of soil water controls best capture impacts on canopy seasonal dynamics and to investigate the appropriate approach to estimate representative daily values of œà soil and vpd the weakest water limiting condition takes the daily average of vpd and œà soil as inputs for the gsi weak a more restrictive condition takes the average of vpd and œà soil over daylight hours from 11 to 23 utc approximately 7 am 7 pm lst strict finally the most stringent condition takes the average of the water limiting indices from 16 to 20 utc approximately 12 pm 4 pm lst very strict for each case a monte carlo ensemble of 2000 sets of parameter estimates were generated by sampling from gaussian distributions sharing the final means and standard deviations of the dcbp model parameters estimated from data assimilation a separate dchm pv simulation is run for each ensemble member 3 data 3 1 model forcing data the dchm pv uses atmospheric forcing from the north america land data assimilation

the nldas 2 as the dchm pv however it takes the daily minimum temperature value vpd avg and œà s o i l a v g are calculated by the dchm pv at the representative daily averages described previously

land processes distributed active archive center specifically the combined terra aqua mcd12q1 land cover product the terra mod15a2 fpar lai and mod17a2 gpp data product are used in this study next the mod15a2 data were quality controlled gap filled and smoothed with timesat using an adaptive savitzky golay filter j√∂nsson and eklundh 2004 this filter preserves higher moments in the data and reduces the resulting bias chen et al 2004 the data were subsequently interpolated in space and time to the resolution required by the dchm v lowman and barros 2016 where available half hourly gpp estimates derived from co2 flux measurements from ameriflux eddy covariance flux towers located in the southeast u s were obtained for comparison to model gpp output baldocchi 2003 baldocchi et al 2001 these sites are summarized in table 2 and a map of their locations can be found in supplementary material fig s1 4 results 4 1 hydroclimatic non stationarity and data assimilation period the results from parameter estimation reflect the water stress conditions of the period used to assimilate modis fpar and lai data fig 3 whereas the parameters for t min pht fpar min and lai max show little sensitivity to inter annual variability the indicators of water stress and the growth rate Œ≥ demonstrate strong dependence on the hydroclimatic regime in the final year of the assimilation period which is to say on soil moisture availability this implies that the upper bound of the memory of the plant soil moisture feedback in the current implementation of the model is about one year in the years preceding and following serious droughts i e 2004 through 2008 œà soilmax estimates are 5 7 5 higher in 2009 and 2010 œà soilmax is 15 and 5 lower respectively compared to the 2012 control thus even when using all available modis fpar and lai observations the parameters estimated from data assimilation exhibit strong sensitivity to soil moisture conditions the first order effect of these different parameters is on the resulting gsi that identifies the potential phenologic state fig 4 the data assimilation periods that include drought years 2004 2006 and 2008 2010 exhibit sharp decreases in gsi under water stress the 2008 2010 period begins in a severe drought and consistently has the lowest gsi the 2004 2006 period starts under wet conditions and has the highest gsi except when under water stress we find that using parameters estimated from different data assimilation periods has the effect in the dchm pv of calibrating for an adaptive plant water use strategy that conserves soil moisture the vegetation parameters are trained to uptake water transpire and assimilate carbon whenever conditions are favorable and quickly shut down at the onset of water stress models of canopy conductance and transpiration an important component of the water and energy budget for forested areas depend on lai to scale from leaf or stand to canopy level transpiration e g sellers 1985 sellers et al 1992 our results demonstrate that a key source of variability in warm season lai predictions stems from how water stress is accounted for in the data assimilation model either by how sub daily atmospheric and soil water conditions are up scaled or by incorporating drought conditions into the assimilated data this is significant because a difference of 1 m2 m2 in lai can lead to a change in canopy transpiration of 0 5 mm day in pine forests tor ngern et al 2017 4 2 estimated parameters from data assimilation the da model estimates eleven index function and canopy seasonal dynamics parameters tables 3 and 4 the parameters are successfully constrained when a reduction of the ensemble standard deviation to within 20 of the initial uncertainty is achieved st√∂ckli et al 2008 successful constraints on the climatic parameters are demonstrated by the convergence of the parameter estimates and uncertainties during the first of 3 spin up simulations each spanning the 3 year reference period figs 5 and 6 not all of the intra seasonal water limitation parameters are successfully constrained within the first round of spin up however vpd min and œà s o i l m a x which indicate the onset of plant water stress and diminished photosynthetic capacity have significant reductions in uncertainty within the first spin up period fig 6 at nearly all tower sites initial uncertainty is successfully constrained after 3 rounds of spin up for the parameters determining the onset of reduced photosynthesis e g t m i n m a x pht max v p d a v g m i n and œà s o i l a v g m a x us akn us dk1 us goo us sp1 us sp3 and us sp4 do not have successfully constrained estimates for t m i n m a x which indicated the temperature above which photosynthesis is unconstrained table 3 all tower sites have pht max constrained to within 10 of initial uncertainty except us sp4 where pht max is constrained to below 20 the data assimilation model is less successful at reducing uncertainty in the parameters that signal complete photosynthesis shut down i e t m i n m i n v p d a v g m a x and œà s o i l a v g m i n local topography impacts the diurnal cycle of cold air flow and humidity and makes it difficult to pin down phenologically relevant values for the microclimate conditions of minimum daily temperature and vpd cory et al 2017 however the dchm pv simulations account for the high uncertainty in these parameters by using a monte carlo approach thus the uncertainty stemming from the data assimilation step is fully propagated in the coupled model results the canopy biophysical parameters of fpar min and lai max are well constrained to within the first round of spin up as a result of reduced uncertainty in the analyzed states fig 7 for all tower sites fpar min is estimated to within 10 of initial uncertainty and likewise for the growth rate parameter Œ≥ is constrained to within 10 of initial uncertainty at all sites but us sp4 table 4 overall all canopy biophysical parameters are constrained to below 20 of initial uncertainty thus the data assimilation model performs well for estimating the canopy biophysical parameters these dcbp model parameter estimates by the da model hold across all three simulation types for weak strict and very strict water limiting conditions see tables s1 s4 in supplementary material 4 3 predicted fpar and lai dchm pv model results are shown at three towers with different pfts figs 8 and 9 us chr deciduous broadleaf us dk1 mixed forest and us nc2 grassland table 2 during the wet year 2004 the predicted fpar and lai values remain near the minimum fpar and maximum lai values estimated from the data assimilation step table 4 and figs 8 and 9 in the dry year 2007 results show reduced fpar and lai during the growing season compared to 2004 due to drought in the southeast u s lowman and barros 2016 brun and barros 2014 additionally the us chr and us dk1 sites which contain more deciduous vegetation types show large decreases in predicted fpar and lai after august 2007 in response to drought induced water stress the modis data exhibit a similar reduction in fpar and lai for the us dk1 site but do not reproduce it for the us chr site note the unrealistic growing season for the grassland site with green up occurring in january 2007 at us nc2 during dormant months the predicted fpar and lai values for the wet and dry years are similar to the modis data there are no time series of fpar and lai available at any of the eddy covariance tower locations for comparison in order to evaluate the strength of the enforcement of growing season water stress in the dcbp the three different upscaling approaches to integrate sub daily water demand to the daily scale were evaluated the largest differences in the time series of fpar and lai resulting from the weak red strict green and very strict blue occur in the summertime and early fall and for dry conditions e g 2007 drought with very strict mid day controls resulting in lower values 4 4 dchm pv carbon assimilation rates gpp estimates derived from eddy covariance flux tower observations are not available for many of the ameriflux sites and where available the records are incomplete and rigorous uncertainty estimates are lacking the latter require both good understanding of the uncertainties in the measurements of the geophysical observables used to estimate gpp e g papale et al 2006 and uncertainty in the gpp estimates proper raj et al 2016 therefore the objective here is to evaluate whether and how the model captures the overall behavior and range of the observations fig 10 shows two years of predicted gpp at two collocated mixed forest sites us dk2 and us dk3 within the same model grid point against modis and tower based estimates every 8 days the nominal modis resolution the uncertainties associated with the predicted fpar and lai do not create large uncertainties in model estimated gpp as indicated by the nearly imperceptible 2œÉ interval fig 10 the weak strict and very strict simulations produce nearly the same estimates of daily gpp not shown dchm pv modis and ameriflux estimates are in good agreement until early summer in either 2002 or 2004 and likewise in the fall however in the early summer of 2004 before rainfall input from hurricane activity in late august and september and especially throughout the entire summer season in 2002 the model gpp is lower than the observations though exhibiting behavior consistent with the tower estimates which is overestimated by modis this is explained in part by lower rainfall in the stageiv product at 4 km resolution compared to point scale rain gauge observations at the tower and also by the timing of rainfall that redressed soil moisture deficits at the beginning of the warm season brun and barros 2014 in addition the dchm pv in its current formulation does not include a representation of deep roots and their ability to tap into the water table and the capillary fringe which could play a significant role under severe drought conditions at certain locations there is less spread in the water limiting simulations during the wet year 2004 compared to the dry year 2002 specifically during green up in the spring in 2002 uncertainty in estimated gpp increases during green up and again in the fall the timing of the increased uncertainty in gpp appears to correspond to soil water holding capacity so called soil field capacity that is tied to soil texture compare figs s2 and s3 for ameriflux sites with silty and clayey soils against figs s4 and s5 for locations in sandy soils gpp uncertainty is higher at sites with more porous soils in the growing season months than in the green up and senescence periods on the other hand sites with low porosity soils tend to have low uncertainty during the warm months overall the dchm pv gpp estimates for all sites agree well with the ameriflux tower data figs s2 s5 where two towers are collocated fig s2 for us dk2 us dk3 and fig s5 for us sp1 us sp2 the model gpp tends to be between the two towers albeit closer to one than another which is indicative of uncertainty linked to sub grid scale spatial variability 5 discussion 5 1 canopy conductance as an integrated metric of plant water use the canopy conductance g c is the primary plant function that modulates the plant carbon uptake response to changes in the fpar and lai as discussed in section 4 1 the estimated parameters depend on the choice of data assimilation periods which directly influence the gsi fpar and lai predictions made in the dchm pv are determined based on the gsi lai directly effects the canopy resistance function r c g c 1 used in the dchm pv garcia quijano and barros 2005 9 r c r c m i n l a i j w j f s i j t 1 0 6 ln v p d 1 Œ¥ 1 where rc min is the minimum canopy resistance for nighttime maintenance j w j f s i and j t represent functional dependencies on soil moisture incoming shortwave radiation and temperature respectively and Œ¥ is a parameter describes the sensitivity of canopy conductance to vpd in the model formulation eq 13 active lai directly scales the canopy conductance meaning that higher predicted lai will produce larger canopy conductance values this scaling can account for a change of canopy conductance by 1 33 cm s for values of lai less than 6 m2 m2 granier et al 2000 discerning active and inactive lai is limited within the dchm pv to the spatial resolution at which the simulations are conducted i e 16 sq km changes in precipitation and boundary layer meteorology result in changes in evapotranspiration and soil moisture availability and consequently phenology the feedbacks among hydrometeorological variability and predicted lai are examined in figs 11 and 12 using results from the very strict dchm pv simulations under different data assimilation periods and thus different dcbp model parameters as expected higher lai corresponds to greater canopy conductance and carbon assimilation rates in the wet year the simulation with the most aggressive water stress adaptation strategy 2004 2006 has the highest daily lai values and sub daily g c and gpp estimates fig 11 in contrast the simulation with the most conservative water use strategy 2008 2010 consistently has the lowest lai canopy conductance and carbon uptake rate estimates the results are similar during the green up period april in the dry year before the onset of extreme water stress fig 12 which is indicative of memory in the coupled soil plant water system in the summer months both the most aggressive and conservative strategies produce lower lai resulting in lower canopy conductance and gpp 5 2 seasonal dynamics of fpar lai and gpp the results for the dchm pv predicted fpar lai and gpp suggest that model uncertainty follows seasonal patterns specifically the seasonal dynamics of fpar and lai map narrow trajectories even when accounting for the uncertainty across the monte carlo simulations see appendix b and videos s1 s3 in supplementary materials at the us chr site there is little gpp variability across ensemble members on individual days during wet and dry years suggesting that gpp differences among ensemble members cannot be attributed to uncertainty in fpar and lai predictions figs 13a b and 14a b during the dry year there is a clear reduction in august in gpp that occurs in conjunction with a decrease in predicted fpar and lai fig 14a b in the post drought recovery there are days in september and october where gpp varies with fpar and lai this response is appropriate for a deciduous forest that would experience some degree of defoliation in response to prolonged drought during the refoliation period we expect the carbon assimilation rates to scale according to the amount of recovered canopy structure this behavior is similar to that observed in boreal deciduous vegetation where increases in photosynthesis rates after a defoliation event caused by drought freezing or infestation depend on the severity of the defoliating event man et al 2013 welp et al 2007 similarly post drought gpp estimates at the us chr site depend on canopy response to the drought severity observed by the individual ensemble members the mixed forest example is similar to the deciduous forest described above during the wet year daily gpp estimates do not show large variations across the ensemble members in response to different fpar and lai predictions fig 13c d at the us dk1 site there is a mix of deciduous and evergreen vegetation that alters the post drought response and results in large differences the evergreen vegetation canopies tend to be less sensitive to defoliation events and the corresponding reductions in gpp tend to be less severe than for deciduous trees welp et al 2007 consequently the range of lai and fpar values during and post drought for the deciduous forest is much larger than what is observed at the mixed forest site fig 14c d the grassland site us nc2 on sandy soil demonstrates higher variability in gpp estimates with fpar and lai predictions during both wet and dry years figs 13e f and 14e f during the wet years there are clear differences in gpp estimates among ensemble members during periods of green up april through mid may and senescence september through mid october this behavior is similar during the dry year and in addition we observe differences in gpp estimates across ensemble members during the summer drought note the isolated ensemble member in figs 13e f and 14e f corresponding to extreme water stress leading to strong reductions in fpar and lai during the warm season may oct in both years the higher model uncertainty in predicted fpar and lai during leaf out and senescing periods is consistent with results from other prognostic phenology models viskari et al 2015 showed that determining the initial bud burst produces the largest uncertainty in lai predictions during the spring indeed the larger ranges of uncertainty in fpar and lai in april and may show differing trajectories across ensemble members in terms of the initial bud burst timing and resulting green up period kim et al 2015 found larger errors in phenologic stage development when there is a higher discrepancy in soil water availability similarly our results show a smaller range in uncertainty for forested vegetation during a dry year in response to water limitations that impose growing season reductions on the canopy biophysical properties 5 3 mapping recovery responses to water stress the response to water stress is evaluated by mapping annual trajectories of gpp and soil water potential for different vegetation types summarized in fig 15 see figs s6 s9 organized by pft for trajectories for all tower sites the mean trajectories over the 11 years of simulation results demonstrate similar structures in soil water stress carbon phase space the highest mid day gpp 12 4 pm occurs during green up in may and decreases to dormant levels during late august and early september during the wet year 2004 the deciduous forest site us chr follows along a similar path as the mean climatology however the mixed forest and grassland sites us dk1 and us nc2 sustain higher mid day gpp during the warm season months the highest mid day gpp occurs during green up in the dry year 2007 but quickly decreases and remains low throughout the warm season at all three sites decreases in mid day gpp that remain within the range defined by the mean climatology are related to intermittent changes in precipitation not drought the signature of drought that is persistent water stress is evident when gpp falls below the mean trajectory during the warm months in 2007 gpp and soil water potential decrease in august showing the effect of soil water limiting plant productivity at the us chr site atmospheric water limitations are evident at the us dk1 and us nc2 towers in 2007 when gpp goes below the climatological trajectory range without a change in soil water potential in this case vegetation is regulating productivity by closing the stomata both the closure of stomata and decreased carbon fixation within the mesophyll cells contribute to reductions in carbon uptake under drought conditions zhou et al 2013 the vegetation processes modeled by the dchm pv account for both stomatal and non stomatal controls of photosynthesis during drought which allow for distinguishing the effects of atmospheric limitations on canopy conductance and the impact of soil water stress on carbon fixation lowman and barros 2016 garcia quijano and barros 2005 the average phenology regime is defined by the climatological trajectory in 2004 the us dk1 and us nc2 demonstrate how certain vegetation may exceed the gpp of the average phenology regime when there are no water restrictions weather controls during the warm season reduce gpp in the short term and temporarily dry the soils in this case gpp remains within the range defined by the average phenology regime as seen at the us chr site in 2007 atmospheric and soil water limitations arise when gpp falls below the average phenology regime soil water controls are dominant when soil water potential decreases with gpp atmospheric water controls dominate when gpp decreases without a decrease in soil water potential under severe drought conditions low gpp is sustained for a range of low soil water potential values choice of data assimilation period also influences vegetation recovery responses to water stress fig s10 there is little difference in the phase space plots when using all available years for data assimilation 2002 2012 or using a period of low water stress 2010 2012 further the trajectories when using parameters estimated during a water stress period 2004 2007 are similar to the others during a wet year however decreases in gpp due to reductions in soil water potential during july and august are larger in a dry year the shaded bands in fig s10 highlight the regions of phase space with much wider trajectory and thus hysteresis in the recovery of gpp and œà soil after extended periods without rain in the warm season in 2007 in contrast with the lack of hysteresis when using the parameters inferred from climatology or 2010 2012 hysteresis reflects a water use strategy aimed at soil moisture conservation 5 4 vegetation biophysical properties and water stress overall the dchm pv reproduces the expected biophysical plant relationships waring and landsberg 2011 and responses to water stress fig s11 stomatal conductance is controlled by soil moisture atmospheric water demand temperature and incoming shortwave radiation eq 13 vpd a proxy for atmospheric water demand should be a strong predictor for stomatal conductance the dchm pv results exhibit a strongly nonlinear relationship between vpd and stomatal conductance for all of the study sites fig 16 when atmospheric demand is high i e vpd 3 kpa the stomatal conductance quickly goes to zero for all vegetation types low values of vpd have little effect on stomatal conductance evident by the large spread in stomatal conductance when vpd 2 kpa consideration of how evapotranspiration et varies with root water uptake provides an interesting means of separating plant transpiration from soil evaporation fig 17 at continental locations the relationship between root water uptake and et is nearly linear when atmospheric demand is low fig 17a interestingly a bifurcation in the relationship between et and root water uptake is found in coastal sites fig 17b and c under soil water stress sandy soils demonstrate a nearly linear relationship between et and root water uptake however when there is low soil water stress this relationship is highly nonlinear fig 17c in non sandy soils the bifurcation is attributed to atmospheric water demand under low demand a nearly linear relationship between et and root water uptake exists however when there is high atmospheric water demand this relationship is highly nonlinear fig 17b transpiration presents as the linear component of these relationships when either vpd is high or sandy soils are excessively moist evaporation from soils is dominant future work will address some limitations of the modeling approach including shallow soils and root systems that may not be adequate to capture the response of low elevation forests to drought especially in locations where access to water table is possible as well as distributed hydrology with coupled groundwater e g tao et al 2016 tao and barros 2013 2014 5 5 impact of predicted versus prescribed phenology on gpp annual gpp and et values from two 11 year continuous simulations with predicted dchm pv and prescribed phenology dchm v using modis mod15a2 fpar and lai as forcing data are compared in fig 18 see figs s12 and s13 for all ameriflux towers in general the model with predictive phenology yields higher gpp and higher et except during drought at which time water use feedbacks control plant growth at all but the us sp4 sites annual gpp estimate are higher in the dchm pv strict simulations than in the dchm v simulations as expected the woody savannah and grassland sites show the least amount of change in gpp estimates with the introduction of variable canopy seasonal dynamics us cav us goo us nc2 us sp1 us sp3 and us sp4 for the deciduous broadleaf sites annual gpp estimate from the dchm pv tend to be 100 350 g c m2 year higher during non drought years but have similar estimates to the dchm v simulations under drought conditions fig 18 us chr and us wbw the sites with mixed forest vegetation tend to have larger annual gpp estimates in the simulations with predictive lai and fpar however these increases are not as large as those for the deciduous forest sites us akn us dk1 us dk2 and us nc1 likewise simulated et is generally higher in the dchm pv up to 125 mm year except in 2007 when strategic soil water use by vegetation results in lower evaporation and slightly lower gpp as shown in fig s13 for us chr and us wbw there are no significant differences in gpp for the us sp sites but the change in et is significant fig 18 shows the annual Œ¥gpp and Œ¥et differences as a synthesis of the net impact of plant soil water use feedbacks on the coupled carbon and water budgets which can represent 5 20 of the annual values despite large inter annual hydrometeorological variability these results suggest that dynamic accounting of water carbon cycle feedbacks should result in large evapotranspiration and higher gpp under wet meteorological regimes and the opposite under drought the coupled soil vegetation atmosphere system conserves water during drought by reducing transpiration and concurrently reducing gpp 5 6 relevance for ecological models the intent of the work presented is to inform ecological modelling by bringing to light key issues in modelling canopy biophysical states constrained by water availability thus linking the carbon and water cycles two main findings are 1 canopy biophysical properties are best predicted when considering water limitation during mid day hours consistent with garcia quijano and barros 2005 and 2 estimated parameters are calibrated to wet or dry conditions based on the underlying climate regime in the data assimilation inference period which reflects plants ability to adapt first the comparison across the different aggregation approaches for sub daily water demand demonstrated that the verystrict simulations were best able to capture the effects of growing season drought on canopy development this suggests that future modelling studies that consider growing season water restrictions at daily or coarser temporal scales should use the mid day conditions as an indicator of overall plant water status data assimilation is often adapted to determine biophysically relevant parameters for ecology models because of its ability to improve model predictions and uncertainty estimates e g viskari et al 2015 luo et al 2011 nevertheless questions remain around the sources of uncertainty that drive ecological predictability dietze 2017 and how that uncertainty relates to the physical and natural systems that are modelled dietze et al 2013 the second key result from this work provides an additional consideration for data assimilation applications in ecological models the importance of recognizing the climatological regime inherent in the data driving models is demonstrated through the effects of different inference periods on modelled results for plant growing season development i e gsi fpar and lai further we find that uncertainty in the parameter estimates in the data assimilation model serve as a surrogate for vegetation adaptive capacity to water stress linking uncertainty to the physical constraints of the ecological problem this manuscript lays a framework for developing smart or adaptive ecological models that adjust plant biophysical properties and growing capacity to the current environmental conditions based on the climate regime 6 conclusions in this manuscript a predictive model for canopy biophysical properties was coupled to a land surface hydrology model an adequate timescale for enforcement of atmospheric and soil water stress constraints required for realistic canopy seasonal dynamics was evaluated and model uncertainty propagation was assessed to our knowledge the approach taken to predict the canopy biophysical properties of fpar and lai is the first to account for atmospheric and soil water availability concurrently the results demonstrate that the daily changes in fpar and lai are most sensitive to vpd and soil water potential controls during hours of peak solar forcing additionally the strength of these sensitivities depend on water stress conditions of the data assimilation period which effectively determine the water stress adaptation for the modeled vegetation results show that the leaf out period for forested vegetation encompasses the largest range of uncertainty for predicted fpar and lai in the dchm pv simulations under both wet and dry conditions during the summer there tends to be a narrow range of uncertainty when there is ample precipitation however in drought conditions the uncertainty in the dcbp model parameters amplifies uncertainty in predicted fpar and lai the seasonal variation in uncertainty also depends on vegetation type and microclimate as low canopy vegetation and areas with warmer climates show less variability phase diagrams of gpp and soil water potential provide a means of separating atmospheric and soil water limitations on carbon uptake rates that is consistent across vegetation types thus the modeling approach allows for a quantitative determination of confidence in the coupled model results independently of uncertainties in predicted fpar and lai explicitly incorporating the nonlinear dependence of these canopy biophysical properties on atmospheric and soil conditions increases annual gpp estimates by up to 350 g c m2 year concurrent with et increases up to 125 mm year during periods of low water stress and reductions in gpp and et up to 200 g c m2 year and 125 mm year respectively during drought thus the coupled water carbon cycle accelerates under favorable climate conditions and slows during drought data statement results from model simulations are available for downloading at http iphex pratt duke edu the dchm v and dchm pv

photoperiod and water availability vpd and soil water potential appendix b description of animations in supplementary material the seasonality of uncertainty in dchm pv predicted fpar and lai is demonstrated by considering the joint distributions for predicted fpar and lai from verystrict simulations at the deciduous and mixed forest sites us chr and us dk1 april exhibits the largest range of uncertainty during both wet and dry years in january the forested vegetation sites do not grow and thus inhabit a narrow range in the parameter space in both years during the summer predicted fpar and lai show more than twice as much variability during the drought year than in the wet year the senescence period october encompasses a much narrower range of uncertainty than april demonstrating higher agreement across the models in end of season than during the leaf out period the deciduous forest demonstrates bi modal variability during the green up period in 2004 further illustrating the higher uncertainty in predicting canopy biophysical scaling properties when water availability is not a limiting factor the grassland site shows a narrow range of uncertainty during the dormant month the ranges of uncertainties for the growing and senescing seasons are similar for low canopy vegetation types and occupy a comparable uncertainty space to the senescing period for the forested vegetation a range of 2 m2 m2 lai and 0 25 fpar the animations provide an additional means of visualizing how fpar and lai evolve over a wet and dry year figs 13 and 14 and to interpret the trajectories in gpp
