4495,mid and long term saltwater intrusion forecasts for estuaries are challenging due to a wide range of dynamic interactions and the limited amount of available data this study proposes a tailor made method for input determination for ensemble forecasts of monthly estuarine saltwater intrusion the proposed method is based on determining the initial set of candidates by the combined use of pearson s coefficient r and maximal information coefficient mic and afterwards reducing the dimension of the input data sets by principal component analysis pca the current study uses bayesian model averaging bma method to combine the forecasting results of random forest rf support vector machine svm and elman neural network enn models to create an integrated forecast the proposed modeling approach was tested and compared with seven alternative procedures to forecast the monthly saltwater intrusion at the pearl river delta prd the results indicated that a the monthly dynamics of saltwater intrusion are more sensitive to the long term solar activities than the local wind force b the valuable non linear signals hidden in the related time series could be identified by the combined use of r and mic c dynamic statistics related to low runoff high antecedent chlorinity strong tidal force and strong wind force are preferable over the monthly average values as model inputs and d the proposed method achieved highest forecast accuracy with nash sutcliffe coefficient nse of 0 78 this study provides insights to the input determination for data driven models of complex estuarine saltwater intrusion keywords bayesian model averaging input determination monthly forecast saltwater intrusion 1 introduction in recent decades increasing saltwater intrusion especially during the dry seasons has severely impaired the water supply at populated estuaries worldwide mai et al 2002 haddout et al 2016 klassen and allen 2017 kalisperi et al 2018 furthermore high salinity levels can have significant negative financial consequences stemming from the ongoing expenses required for treating drinking water and pumping at groundwater interception wells in addition to diminished agricultural returns kendrick 1974 therefore saltwater intrusion is not only a management issue but also a scientific problem and accurate saltwater intrusion forecasts will be of vital importance to the policy makers generally the models to predict saltwater intrusion fall into two main categories process driven models e g gong et al 2013 2018 gisen et al 2015 liu et al 2017 pappa et al 2017 ye et al 2017 and data driven models e g yoon et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 hunter et al 2018 hu et al 2019 most process driven models solve a coupled system of variable flow and solute transport equations and are numerically complicated and computationally demanding werner et al 2013 wang et al 2015 they require detailed information on the boundary and initial conditions covering freshwater tide wind effects and riverbed terrain preferably covering all possible sources of water salinity hu et al 2019 in contrast in data driven models the model structure is a function of available data data driven models main advantage includes their rapid development and implementation and can make the best use of existing data to achieve a predetermined model structure mount et al 2016 despite the merits and usefulness of these machine learning algorithms the performance of these models is dependent on the techniques used and on a large volume of data for meaningful training for example rajaee and boroumand 2015 evaluated the modelling capability of coupled discrete wavelet transform dwt with artificial neural network ann and multi linear regression mlr wann and wmlr ann mlr and genetic algorithm support vector regression ga svr models on a limited dataset by reducing the number of the samples from 240 to 60 and the result demonstrated that using less datasets could not yield accurate predictions because of inadequate training one of the significant challenges for applying machine learning techniques to saltwater intrusion forecasts at monthly temporal resolution is the lack of adequate data at complex estuaries in most cases conducting a large scale salinity field measurement is labor intensive and only a short time series is usually available liu et al 2017 also the process of saltwater intrusion at estuaries is related to multiple variables leading to considerable uncertainty in saltwater intrusion prediction one of the most important steps in the data driven model development process is determining the significant input variables bowden et al 2005 a subset of compact and informative inputs with the max relevance and min redundancy can significantly enhance the model performance and reduce the demand for training samples lyu et al 2017 the determination of a suitable set of inputs is challenging because the monthly condition of estuary chlorinity is directly or indirectly affected by various short term and long term factors on the one hand if the inputs are insufficient the model cannot reasonably reflect the dynamic estuary system on the other hand considering too many factors as inputs will complicate the model and require more training data since some factors may be correlated noisy or have no significant relationship with the output variable being modelled hence the purpose of this research is to design a well performing and easy to apply strategy of input determination for the monthly forecast of saltwater intrusion information measures are considered one of the most effective measures to capture both linear and nonlinear correlations between features and classes peng et al 2005 reshef et al 2011 proposed a novel statistical approach known as the maximal information coefficient mic an exploratory statistical analysis tool mic has been applied in many fields for its advantages of measuring a broad sense of associations however the mathematical and statistical properties of mic have still not been comprehensively studied ding and li 2013 e g its alleged ability to give equal importance to linear and nonlinear relationships as well as its relatively low power in detecting dependencies heller et al 2013 santos et al 2014 simon and tibshirani 2014 santos et al 2014 found that mic gave a worse performance than pearson s correlation coefficient r in analyzing non linear monotonic relationships in theory r only identifies linear relationships in fact associations detected by r are not exclusively linear and its performance in identifying monotonic associations such as exponential relationships is satisfactory santos et al 2014 therefore in this study we propose a combined use of r and mic instead of relying entirely on either one for correlation based input determination for further data extraction principal component analysis pca was applied to reduce the selected feature space s redundancy skill and uncertainty of different machine learning algorithms vary for an application because of their unique structures and theories zhang et al 2015 therefore a multi model ensemble strategy must exploit and integrate the diversity of skillful prediction from different models and reduce their uncertainty the bayesian model averaging bma predictive probability density function pdf is a weighted mixture of pdfs corresponding to the individual ensemble members baran et al 2019 the bma has been successfully applied in ensemble forecasts for water level baran et al 2019 the derivation of reservoir operating rules zhang et al 2015 precipitation ma et al 2018 temperature wubshetboru 2018 ground water head li and tsai 2009 and streamflow sharma et al 2019 consequently we attempt to integrate bma to combine various forecasts of the same quantity given by machine learning models for better prediction performance and stronger robustness on monthly saltwater intrusion forecast time step is another important issue of modeling which depends among others on the modeling purpose and data availability the existing studies of saltwater intrusion are mainly for daily and hourly time step forecasting of chlorinity yoon et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 suffering from a short lead time of a few days with acceptable accuracy which limited their application for the purpose of water resource management for alleviating the adverse impacts of saltwater intrusion however the saltwater intrusion severity of the next month is important for planning water transfer and reservoirs operation to meet the demand for urban domestic water the authority needs to run the water transfer project to meet emergencies stemming from the salty tide forecasting the severity of the salt tide s freshwater availability can provide instructive information for water transfer projects hence our study is motivated to fill this gap by providing a monthly forecast of the days of saltwater duration to meet water resource management s need for alleviating the adverse impacts of saltwater intrusion the present study s primary goal is to propose a tailor made input determination method for improving ensemble forecasts of monthly estuarine saltwater intrusion the main goal is achieved through 1 exploring the effect of the dynamic statistics of the saltwater intrusion process at estuaries on the prediction accuracy 2 introducing a combined use of r and mic for inputs selection and 3 assessing the ability of bma on reducing the modelling uncertainty 2 methodology 2 1 the framework of input determination for an ensemble forecast of monthly saltwater intrusion an outline of the framework of input determination for ensemble forecast of monthly saltwater intrusion in complex river systems is given in fig 1 where the proposed framework consists of 4 steps step 1 the initial set of input candidates was specified based on a priori knowledge of both local and long term factors the statistical characteristics i e mean maximum minimum and maximum minimum of these factors were all quantified and included in the initial input variables step 2 the initial set of candidates was further screened based on correlation analyses the linear and nonlinear dependencies between the input and output variables were measured by the combined use of r and mic the decision rules for selecting among the four statistical characteristics of the influencing factors were a variables with high r and high mic should be retained in the subset to supply linear or non linear monotonical signals b variables with low r but relatively high mic should be considered as additional model inputs that supply non linear non monotonical signals step 3 the retained subset of variables was first normalized into 1 1 and then extracted by pca to reduce the dimensionality and ensure that the remaining inputs were independent of each other step 4 the monthly saltwater intrusion duration was forecasted by using rf svm and enn incorporating the final extracted inputs in the previous step finally the forecasts from rf svm and enn were combined by bma 2 2 correlation analysis and extraction techniques 2 2 1 maximal information coefficient mic the mic is a relatively new measure for associations between two variables that applies mutual information to continuously distributed random variables reshef et al 2011 given two variables a a i i 1 2 n and b b i i 1 2 n the mutual information between a and b is given by 1 m i a b a a b b p a b l o g p a b p a p b where p a b is the joint probability density of variables a and b and p a and p b are the marginal probability densities of variables a and b respectively suppose we have the 2d dataset d a i b i i 1 2 n where the a values are divided into bins along x and the b values are divided into bins along y this x y partitioning creates grid g the largest amount of mutual information from a given grid g is given by 2 mi d x y m a x m i d g where m i d g is the mi of g on d and the mi is as defined in eq 1 these mutual information values are normalized as 3 m d x y mi d x y log m i n x y where m d x y is the characteristic matrix with normalized mi and the mi d x y is as defined in eq 2 the mic is given by 4 m i c d max xy b n m d x y where b is the upper bound of the grid size and is usually set to n 0 6 2 2 2 pearson s correlation coefficient r the pearson s correlation coefficient r is a statistical measure of linear correlation between paired data x and y and it is computed as 5 r xy i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 the pearson s correlation coefficient r takes values from the closed interval 1 1 positive correlation coefficient values indicate a tendency of one variable to increase or decrease together with another variable negative correlation coefficient values indicate a tendency to increase in one variable associated with decreases in the other variable and vice versa correlation coefficient values near zero indicate a low association between variables and those close to 1 or 1 indicate a strong linear association between variables kirch 2008 2 2 3 principal component analysis pca principal component analysis pca reduces the complexity of the high dimensional data with orthogonal transformations kramer 1991 it converts the original set of samples of possibly correlated variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components pcs in our study the selected data set x n f was first normalized to 1 1 with eq 6 and then decomposed into eq 7 6 y j 1 1 x j m i n x j m a x x j m i n x j 1 7 y t p t e where x j is the j th column of the original data set x y j is the j th column of the normalized data set t n f is the scores matrix p m f is the loading matrix and e n m is a matrix of residuals to minimize the residuals for the given number of factors the columns of p are the eigenvectors corresponding to the f largest eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of y 2 3 machine learning algorithms 2 3 1 support vector machine svm the svm algorithm proposed by cortes and vapnik 1995 is based on statistical learning theory and the structural risk minimization hypothesis to achieve good robustness and efficiency sujay and deka 2014 an alternative ε insensitive loss function was introduced to the svm the goal was to find a function f x that has at most an ε deviation from the targets y i in the training data and at the same time the minimum norm w 2 to ensure flatness in this study libsvm https www csie ntu edu tw cjlin libsvm was used to develop the svm models and the radial basis function rbf φ was used to create a nonlinear svm by mapping it to a high dimensional feature space many studies have used the svm for hydrological modeling and demonstrated the rbf kernel s good performance e g asefa et al 2005 dibike et al 2001 γ is another parameter of the svm model in the kernel function k x x φ x φ x e x p γ x x 2 2 and the value of it can influence the mapping process the optimization problem is to find the flattest function in the feature space rather than the input space to cope with the infeasible constraints of the optimization problem the slack variables ξ i and ξ i are introduced to allow a certain amount of error therefore the optimization problem can be written as 8 m i n i m i z e 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i 9 o y i w φ x i b ε ξ i w φ x i b y i ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 where c is the error penalty parameter which is used to reach a compromise between the empirical risk and the confidence interval w is the norm that is to be minimized φ is the radial basis function rbf ξ i and ξ i are slack variables and ε is the maximum deviation that can be tolerated 2 3 2 random forest rf rf is a non parametric statistical method proposed by breiman 2001 that uses a bootstrap approach in conjunction with random feature selection the bootstrap method is used for resampling the original training set to form new training sets for each new training set a regression tree is created using random feature selection regression trees are created based on feature space partitioning and are grown rather than pruned a single regression tree is highly unstable and that instability is further exacerbated by using only a small number of randomly selected features for node splitting the rf method uses the instability of regression trees by calculating the final output as an arithmetic mean of all individual tree predictions li et al 2014 the algorithm proceeds as follows step 1 obtain ntree bootstrap samples from the original training set step 2 grow ntree regression trees based on the data of each of the bootstrapped new training sets a at each split node independently select m try features at random out of all m predictors of the original training set input b for each split node find the best split into two subsets with the selected subset of m try according to the split rule of minimizing the mean squared error c repeat a b recursively for each split node until the tree is fully grown and no further splits are possible step 3 average the terminal results across the collection of ntree trees rf has only two parameters i e the number of predictors randomly selected as candidates for splitting at each node m try and the number of trees for random bootstrap sampling ntree rfs perform relatively well even if irrelevant descriptors are not removed before training overfitting is prevented by growing each tree using a bootstrap sampling and by selecting from a random subset of variables at each split based on this knowledge an rf should be in theory highly applicable to chlorinity prediction and be able to simulate the non linear relationships between chlorinity and its influencing factors 2 3 3 elman neural network enn the enn is a well known recurrent topology and contains an input layer a hidden layer an output layer and a context layer connected so that the network is more sensitive to historical data and can deal with dynamic information elman 1990 the input layer hidden layer and output layer are fully connected in a feed forward manner and the hidden layer has a 1 1 relationship with the context layer the context units save the previous output values from the hidden layer neurons and feed them back to connect them to the hidden layer neurons which become additional inputs to the network to form a recurrent connection the values of the feedback connection weights are fixed at 1 and all other weights are trainable the network mathematical model is given by 10 x k f w 1 x c k w 2 u k 1 11 x c k α x c k 1 x k 1 12 y k g w 3 x k where w 1 is the weight matrix from the hidden layer to the context layer w 2 is the weight matrix from the input layer to the hidden layer w 3 is the weight matrix from the hidden layer to the output layer f and g are nonlinear matrix functions consisting of the activation function in the hidden or output layer f is a sigmoid function 0 α 1 is the self connection feedback gain factor the squared error at the network output at time k is defined as 13 e k 1 2 y k y k t y k y k where y k is the output at time step k and y k is the observation at time step k the weights are modified at each time step k 2 4 bayesian model averaging bma bma is a postprocessing approach for ensemble forecasting the bma forecast is a weighted average of the individual forecasts the weights are estimated using posterior model probabilities and reflect the models forecasting performance in the training period raftery et al 2005 in the case of predicting the chlorinity y based on the training observations d x obs y obs where x obs is the training input and y obs is the training output using k models m 1 m k the posterior distribution of the bma forecast p y is as follows 14 p y k 1 k p y m k p m k d where p y m k is the forecast based on model m k alone and p m k d denotes the posterior probability of model m k being correct for the given training observations this also reflects how well the model m k fits the training observations considering that k 1 k p y m k 1 let w k p y m k therefore k 1 k w k 1 and then the bma predictive model is 15 e y k 1 k p m k d e y m k k 1 k w k f k 2 5 model training and testing criteria the model parameters are optimized to maximize the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse and modeling results are evaluated by using nse mean absolute error mae and percent bias pbias which are shown in eqs 16 18 these criteria provided a comprehensive assessment of different aspects of the model performance nse alone is not adequate in describing the performance of a model jain and sudheer 2008 the time series of saltwater intrusion condition is highly non stationary and shows a strong monthly periodicity so the i 1 n o i o 2 will be a relatively high value thus the nse gives more weight to the high values and will not be very sensitive to the small systematic errors krause et al 2005 therefore we applied mae and pbias to complement the nse mae is the average absolute differences between prediction and actual observation over the test samples where all individual differences have equal weight willmott and matsuura 2005 chai and draxler 2014 pbias measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than their observed counterparts gupta et al 1999 16 nse 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 17 mae 1 n i 1 n p i o i 18 pbias 100 p o o where pi and oi are predicted and observed values and i 1 2 n p and o are long term averages of pi and oi respectively 3 study site the pearl river estuary pre is one of the most complicated estuaries in the world it is surrounded by a region with fastest economic growth and urbanization development in china over the last 20 years xu et al 2015 the pearl river delta fig 2 is one of china s most densely populated and economically developed regions the pearl river has three main tributaries the xijiang river dongjiang river and beijiang river wang et al 2012 the modaomen channel is located downstream of the xijiang river it is the largest tributary and contributes 77 of the water discharged from the pearl river zhou et al 2006 the modaomen waterway is the main source of drinking water for the cities of jiangmen zhongshan zhuhai and macao zhou et al 2006 in recent decades severe saltwater intrusion has interfered with the region s water supply during dry seasons gong and shen 2011 likely resulting from global climate change and intense anthropogenic activities zhang et al 2012 in particular anthropogenic activities have included uncontrolled and uneven sand excavation since the 1980s which has altered the hydrology and morphology of the modaomen estuary substantially changing the flow division between the various watercourses luo et al 2007 therefore saltwater intrusion forecasts with high accuracies and long lead times would be of great assistance to water resource management and policymakers seeking to meet the urban domestic water demand of this region however the geometry and bathymetry of the modaomen estuary are complex making the construction of well performing process driven models difficult as proven at other estuaries that share similar complexities model construction requires a good knowledge of the underlying hydrological processes and a large number of measured parameters for characterization along with significant volumes of data which are rarely available especially at a monthly scale hence this study chose modaomen waterway to demonstrate the superiority of our input determination method combined with an ensemble data driven forecast framework for saltwater intrusion 4 data the saltwater intrusion events during the dry seasons from 2001 to 2009 i e 2001 11 2002 2 2002 11 2003 2 2003 11 2004 2 2004 11 2005 2 2005 11 2006 2 2006 11 2007 2 2007 11 2008 2 and 2008 11 2009 2 at pinggang station were selected to verify the model accuracy and performance the samples were split into training and testing sets at the ratio of 3 1 the records of the first six seasons 24 samples were used to train the models and the remaining records 8 samples were used to test the models the raw data collected for analysis in this paper included hourly chlorinity at pinggang station hourly tidal level at denglongshan gauging station hourly wind direction and speed at zhongshan station daily water discharge at the makou hydrological station and monthly average number of sunspots retrieved from https cmdp ncc cma net cn index htm daily averages of the hourly chlorinity tidal level and wind force were calculated to match the water discharge measurement frequency to quantify the wind effect on saltwater intrusion a polar coordinate system with the positive direction to the north northwest was used because the saltwater intrusion is reduced by downstream winds and increased by upstream winds the wind effect on the saltwater intrusion was quantified by mapping the wind vector f x in respect to the polar coordinate 19 f f cos π 8 x where f denotes the magnitude of the wind vector and π 8 x is the polar angle of the wind vector 5 results 5 1 forecasting with the proposed framework 5 1 1 initial set of candidates and data the initial input candidates should first be identified based on a comprehensive understanding of the studied system previous studies have indicated that the increase of saltwater intrusion in the estuary can be attributed to a decrease in upstream runoff an increase in tidal amplitude at the river mouth bao et al 2009 chen et al 2011 gong et al 2014 up estuary wind force and climate change yang 2007 for short term factors we considered antecedent saltwater intrusion duration chlorinity upstream inflow tidal level and wind effect for long term factors we considered sunspot numbers an indicator of solar activities existing studies indicate that the global temperature roughly follows the sunspot variations and there is a good correlation and nearly in phase response between solar activity and sea level solheim 2013 previous hydrological forecasts at monthly scales have usually used the monthly average values of the driving factors of the preceding month abdella and alfredsen 2010 chu et al 2017 lavaysse et al 2015 critical information may be masked in the process of smoothing the daily record into monthly scale therefore the statistical characteristics i e mean maximum minimum and maximum minimum of these factors should be considered when quantifying these factors in our study we choose 5 subsets of variables related to antecedent saltwater intrusion conditions runoff tidal level wind effect and sunspot numbers the initial set of candidates table 1 consisted of d tol 1 c mean 1 c max 1 c min 1 c max m i n 1 r mean 1 r max 1 r min 1 r max m i n 1 t mean 1 t max 1 t min 1 t max m i n 1 w mean 1 w max 1 w min 1 w max m i n 1 s mean 1 s mean 2 and the details of the time series are listed in tables 2 and 3 5 1 2 correlation based selection input selection was conducted based on correlation analysis between the output d tol 0 and the initial set of variable candidates for further input determination the r and mic scores were used as measurements of linear and nonlinear correlations and the results are plotted in fig 3 the linear or non linear monotonical signals relationships were first identified by r scores followed by identification of non linear non monotonical relationships by comparing mic with r scores after the feature selecting process the inputs retained in the final subset were d tol 1 c max 1 r max m i n 1 t mean 1 t max m i n 1 w mean 1 w max 1 s mean 1 and s mean 2 the initial candidates that reflected antecedent saltwater intrusion conditions were d tol 1 c mean 1 c max 1 c min 1 and c max m i n 1 we can see from the scores that d tol 1 c max 1 and c max m i n 1 gained similar r considering that c max 1 had similar r with c max m i n 1 and relatively higher mic than c max m i n 1 we retained c max 1 rather than c max m i n 1 to avoid more redundant information considering that d tol 1 also showed high r and had different physical meaning from the other four variables we retained d tol 1 to provide additional information hence d tol 1 and c max 1 were retained in the final input subset and the other three candidates were discarded among the 4 candidates related to runoff r mean 1 r max 1 r min 1 and r max m i n 1 the r min 1 series was retained because it had the highest r and mic in terms of tidal level the t max m i n 1 series was assumed to be the most informative one as it had the highest r 0 36 and highest mic 0 40 among the tide related subset t mean 1 scored similar mic with t max 1 but much lower r based on this we assumed that t mean 1 contained more additional non linear non monotonical information than t max 1 and less redundant information with t max m i n 1 hence the t mean 1 series was retained as additional nonlinear information concerning wind effect w mean 1 had the highest r 0 21 among the 4 candidates related to wind w max 1 had the highest mic 0 25 which was 0 04 higher than that of w mean 1 0 21 and similarly low r values with w min 1 and w max m i n 1 so we concluded that w max 1 would best serve as an additional non linear non monotonical signal therefore w mean 1 and w max 1 were both retained the sunspot numbers of the last two months s mean 1 and s mean 2 had similar high absolute values of r while s mean 1 had an mic that was 0 17 higher than that of s mean 2 based on these results we assumed that s mean 1 and s mean 2 both contained strong linear or non linear monotonical signals and that s mean 1 contained more non linear non monotonical signals both of these candidates were retained 5 1 2 1 extraction by pca to remove correlations among problem variables pca was applied and the eigenvalues for the correlation matrix were calculated fig 4 the selected dataset was projected into a lower dimension with 7 principal components that accounted for over 98 of the original information 5 1 2 2 forecast by machine learning models and ensemble forecasts by bma with the input variables selected the saltwater intrusion duration was forecasted using rf svm and enn and then integrated by bma the forecast by our framework was evaluated using the performance statistics tabulated in table 4 the three member models gave similar good performance on the training set however these models performed differently on the testing set the rf gave the worst performance with the lowest nse and the highest mae and absolute value of pbias the nse of the enn was 5 33 higher than that of the svm the pbias of the enn was 45 lower than that of the svm and mae of enn was 12 higher than that of svm based on these performance values on the training dataset the bma method determined the weights for the rf svm and enn models to be 0 27 0 32 and 0 41 respectively though the weights were given based on the performances on the training set the member models weight rank order is the same as that of the nse or the inverse order of the absolute value of pbias in the testing period the most accurate and reliable forecasts of saltwater intrusion were obtained by bma as it achieved the best goodness of fit with 0 78 for nse and 1 93 for pbias bma achieved a pbias significantly lower than those of the individual models similar mae with the one svm with the lowest mae among the members and higher nse than the one enn with the highest nse among the member models comparisons of observed vs forecasted values from the member models and ensemble model in our proposed framework are presented in scatter plots in the first row of fig 5 generally rf over predicted in the lower portion and under predicted on the upper portion though svm and enn generally had similar scores of assessment criteria values that were predicted well by one of them could be predicted badly by the other in some cases enn exhibited a higher accuracy in predicting high values and svm had a better ability to predict low values since bma is a weighted averaging method where large errors produced by a particular model can be smoothed by the averaging process the scattered dots from the bma model forecast results exhibited the lowest dispersion along the optimal curve 5 2 assessment of the proposed input determination framework to test the effectiveness of the proposed input determination framework we designed 7 other experiments for constructing models with different pre processing steps table 5 models in experiment a did not involve variables related to sunspot numbers in the initial set of input candidates in step 1 models in experiment b did not involve variables related to sunspot numbers or wind effects models in experiment c did not consider the antecedent saltwater conditions in step 1 models in experiment d did not undergo step 2 which further selected variables by correlation analysis models in experiment e only used monthly average values of the antecedent saltwater conditions runoff tidal level wind effect and sunspot numbers and skipped the further selection of step 2 models in experiment f only used r in the correlation based selection process of step 2 finally models in experiment g maintained the proposed steps 1 and 2 but skipped step 3 for data extraction by pca the scatter plots of the observed and forecasted d tol 0 produced by these experimental models are shown in fig 5 and the performance indicators are listed in table 4 among these experimental models the nse varied from 0 43 to 0 78 the mae varied from 1 80 to 3 22 and the absolute value of pbias varied from 3 90 to 30 82 only the model constructed with our proposed structure achieved nse higher than 0 75 while both mae and the absolute value of pbias lower than 2 comprehensive prior knowledge of the studied system when selecting the initial set of input candidates is key to the success of a model in experiment a only short term features were considered and the sunspot numbers were excluded in the input candidates the nse of the bma decreased by 8 and the pbias significantly increased from 1 93 to 12 96 compared with our proposed bma model without considering the wind effect the nse of the ensemble members in experiment b decreased by 11 15 and 24 and the mae of the ensemble members in the experiment b increased by 16 4 and 68 respectively compared with the models in experiment a the antecedent saltwater conditions are indispensable as an important feature to produce reliable forecasts in the case of experiment c with the variables related to the antecedent saltwater conditions removed from the initial set of input candidates and only runoff tidal level wind and sunspot numbers were considered the ensemble model resulted in poor accuracy with nse value of only 0 43 in the testing period and none of its member models achieved nse above 0 3 inputs of the statistical characteristics carried more information of the studied system than the time series of the monthly mean values models in experiment e only included d tol 1 c mean 1 r mean 1 t mean 1 w mean 1 s mean 1 and s mean 2 in the initial set of candidates and all further selection was skipped with the limited information provided by these inputs bma in experiment e only got the nse value of 0 64 and much higher mae and pbias values than that of our proposed model the paired use of r and mic was important for selecting informative variables from the initial set of candidates in the case of experiment f r was used as the only selecting criterion of the candidates which results in a low accuracy forecast with the nse of only 0 53 and high mae 3 05 and pbias 5 19 this showed that the additional candidates with valuable non linear information identified by mic were indispensable for a well performing model further extraction by pca was also necessary without pca the bma in experiment g obtained the nse value of 0 67 the bma combination was a critical step for improving the overall performance for most of the experimental models bma resulted in the highest nse among its ensemble members except in the case of experiment e the ability of bma to improve the overall performance was even more significant when the ensemble members did not perform well due to insufficient or inappropriate pre processing for the testing period the nse values of bma were 1 3 7 5 7 6 48 3 16 4 32 5 and 15 5 higher than the nse values of the best performing ensemble members from the proposed framework and experiments a b c d f and g respectively however bma did not always perform better than its best performing members in the case of experiment e the performances of its ensemble members showed distinctive differences the nse of rf in experiment e reached as high as 0 72 during the testing period which was even better than the performance of the rf with our proposed framework the svm however only got close to 0 for the nse and mae as high as 4 83 even with such a badly performing member the bma still produced an acceptable result with an nse of 0 67 and mae of 2 88 6 discussion in this study we presented an input determination method for ensemble forecasts of monthly estuarine saltwater intrusion the proposed method consists of 5 steps 1 identifying the initial set of the input candidates with the statistics that capture the inner dynamic signals 2 correlation based selection by the combined use of r and mic 3 data extraction by pca 4 modelling by rf svm and enn 5 and model ensemble by bma with only 24 training samples our proposed method was able to provide very good performance with 0 78 of nse 1 77 of mae and 1 93 of pbias on the testing data set the suitability and superiority of our proposed method were also assessed by the comparison with 7 alternative procedures the models constructed with our proposed framework performed better than the experimental models in terms of nse mae and pbias 6 1 the influencing factors related to saltwater intrusion the results clearly showed that identifying the appropriate initial set of candidates for further selection is the foundation of a reliable forecast result the initial set of candidates should be identified based on prior knowledge of saltwater conditions data availability and suitability in the studied area since the goal is to forecast monthly saltwater intrusion duration the strategy is to include 5 groups of factors antecedent saltwater conditions runoff tidal level wind forces and the number of sunspots and to make the utmost use of the limited available data by considering the inner dynamic statistics of the monthly samples the results have shown that the dynamics of chlorinity were highly linked to its historical levels which were consistent with previous studies qiu and wan 2013 shi et al 2008 the information related to the antecedent saltwater conditions was of significant importance to a reliable forecast the model deterioration caused by the absence of these inputs could not be mitigated by a more sophisticated preprocessing and postprocessing approach a general consensus exists that the impact of climate change will exacerbate long term trends of saltwater intrusion gong et al 2013 2014 suen and lai 2013 zhang et al 2012 however most studies that have correlated climate change with saltwater intrusion use the sea level as an indicator of the climate effect ketabchi et al 2016 werner et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 because the effect of sea level rise is relatively direct and physically better understood compared to other influential climatic factors in our study we introduced the number of sunspots as the indicator of the influence of atmospheric circulation which made our model sensitive to remote climatic signals in terms of the short term meteorological influence it has been claimed by many studies that wind patterns can dramatically impact the tidal currents in a wide range gan et al 2004 ji 2008 jia and li 2012 and the up estuary winds exacerbate saltwater intrusion gan et al 2009 zu and gan 2015 wang et al 2018 our results indicated that compared to the wind effect the number of sunspots showed a stronger correlation with the saltwater intrusion condition and improved the forecast accuracy at a monthly scale after we removed the sunspot numbers from the proposed initial set of candidates the forecast accuracy of bma in experiment a reduced by 7 7 in terms of nse compared to that of the model in our proposed framework in experiment b after the factors related to the wind effect were removed from the initial set of candidates for experiment a the nse of the member models decreased by 11 5 1 5 and 23 9 respectively however this model deterioration caused by the absence of wind was mitigated by applying bma to integrate the member models we inferred that the monthly dynamics of saltwater intrusion were more sensitive to the long term solar activity than the local wind force though there can be redundancy between the number of sunspots and other variables because solar activities can indirectly affect saltwater intrusion by influencing runoff tidal activity and weather berndtsson et al 2001 ketabchi et al 2016 okal and anderson 1975 yuan and zhu 2015 pca further reduced these redundancies our results proved that inputting the number of sunspots significantly improved model performance even when the effects of runoff tidal level and wind were already considered this means that the effects of solar activity on saltwater intrusion were not restricted to the indirect effects through affecting runoff tidal activity and wind force therefore we recommend that the number of sunspots should be used as a model input for monthly saltwater intrusion forecast as it provides information relating to numerous climatic signals without the need to include many climatic factors thereby reducing the risks of confusing the machine learning algorithms and overfitting 6 2 the monthly dynamic signals identification the proposed procedure maximized the use of the available data and captured as many signals as possible from the observations of the related factors by taking into account the inner dynamic characteristics of the monthly scaled samples antecedent chlorinity runoff tidal level and wind effect were measured as monthly mean monthly maximum monthly minimum and monthly maximum minus monthly minimum with one month lag sunspot numbers were measured as monthly mean with 1 and 2 month lags we compared the forecasts given by using these factors with those by using only monthly mean variables it was obvious that useful information was smoothed out by averaging the daily observations hence we recommend the strategy of using the statistics such as monthly maximum monthly minimum etc that can portray the inner characteristics of the monthly scaled samples for monthly forecast on highly dynamic systems the inclusion of the statistical values of the influencing factors increased the number of input variable candidates and feature redundancy when the number of features is high but the number of samples is small machine learning models become prone to overfitting since the search space is sparsely populated and the model is unable to distinguish between relevant data and noise bolón canedo et al 2013 provost 2000 we proposed a combined use of r and mic for a correlation based feature selection on the initial set of input candidates unlike the typical correlation based methods our proposed method didn t set a fixed universal threshold to decide which variables to retain and which to discard because redundant variables are likely to exhibit similar degrees of correlation bolón canedo et al 2013 we divided the candidates into 5 subsets our approach to variable selection followed the principles that one or two variables from each subset should be sufficient to characterize that set these will be selected based on r and mic correlation criteria a variable with both high r and high mic should be included if a variable has low r but high mic it should also be retained to provide additional information in our study the models constructed with inputs selected using both r and mic outperformed the ones without any selection techniques and the models constructed without any selection techniques outperformed the ones selected using only r we inferred that some valuable nonlinear signals were screened out when we only considered the linear or non linear monotonical associations retaining these valuable non linear signals identified by combined use of r and mic in the meanwhile filtering out the irrelevant information were able to make it easier for the models to learn from the training samples and significantly improve the forecast accuracy during selection the 19 initial inputs were reduced to a final subset of 9 model inputs and provided a more accurate forecast than using the sub set of monthly mean values this indicated that indicators related to low runoff high antecedent chlorinity strong tidal force and strong wind force were preferable over the monthly average values as model inputs one explanation of this could be that the extreme values were more representative of climate change than mean values senhorst and zwolsman 2005 mantua et al 2010 li et al 2013 tian et al 2013 lin et al 2019 high antecedent chlorinity low flows strong wind and strong tidal forces contained stronger climatic signals than the averages of these factors the tidal range is a commonly used indicator of tidal force in research on a daily scale it is the same for monthly scale saltwater intrusion that the range from the minimum to the maximum monthly tidal level is a better indicator than the monthly mean tidal level another explanation is the non stationary characters of the hydrological and weather systems especially in medium and long terms milly et al 2008 due to this non stationary problem there are insufficient severe saltwater intrusion samples to train a model which results in under estimation of high values for the testing set using the extreme values from a month as predictors instead of the monthly mean helps reduce the large errors when forecasting high values 6 3 the application of the bma method we relied on bayesian model averaging to address model misspecification and uncertainty even in the case of insufficient pre process and post process most models got nse higher than 0 9 on the training set but performed distinctively on the testing set the results were obvious that machine learning models showed severe tendency to overfit on small data and that there was no always best performing algorithm in our experiments we found that a machine learning model that performed worst for one set of inputs may have the best performance for another set rf svm and enn are three machine learning algorithms constructed based on different theories each with different sources of uncertainty and the uncertainty magnifies when the training samples are insufficient our experiments showed that it was almost impossible to determine the most suitable or the best performing model beforehand for a certain set of data which limits practical applications of data driven models on monthly saltwater intrusion forecasts the ability for bma postprocessor to improve the overall performance was obvious in our experiments that in most cases combining models with bma gave better performance than the best performing member models in terms of nse mae and pbias the ability for bma to improve the overall performance was especially significant when the individual ensemble members gave low performance due to insufficient or inappropriate pre processing however the experiments also showed that the advantage of bma became smaller in terms of nse with a smarter selection for model inputs also we found that bma may give similar or worse performances compared to its best performing member when the performances of its ensemble members differed greatly therefore we inferred that the degree of improvement provided by bma also depended on the distribution of the performances by its ensemble members though there is no guarantee that bma will always give the best performance than all of its constituent members we still recommend the use of bma over relying upon any one specific model this is because predicting which model would be the better predictor based on a priori knowledge of a system is prohibitively difficult one limitation of our study was that we neglected the impacts of economic and ecological factors like human intervention microbiological activity vegetation functioning etc the influence of these factors on saltwater intrusion has rarely been quantified although their confounding effects can be identified via physical modeling using available tools how to appropriately identify obtain and quantify these economic and ecological factors as inputs into data driven models remains to be resolved in our future study also small data limited our study on the non stationarity of the saltwater intrusion time series raftery et al 2005 applied a sliding window technique to obtain dynamic bma weights with longer length of salinity time series available in our future research we will study the model uncertainties in the multi model forecast under different climate scenarios by using this sliding window technique in the training period to estimate the bma weights variance and bias correction coefficients for long term forecast of saltwater intrusion 7 conclusion reliable monthly forecast of saltwater intrusion is critical in water resource management at complex estuaries however it is severely restricted by the problem of insufficient data and the dynamic character of the estuarine systems we introduced a robust input determination procedure for ensemble forecasts of monthly estuarine saltwater intrusion the proposed framework was applied to the modaomen waterway a typical riverine estuary in the pearl river delta we demonstrated its applicability and advantages by comparison with 7 alternative procedures overall our approach is considered a useful forecasting approach for application at complex estuaries with limited data the following conclusions are drawn 1 even with only 24 training samples our proposed framework still enabled to achieve effective training the model gave very good performance on both training and testing set with 0 78 of nse 1 77 of mae and 1 93 of pbias on the testing dataset 2 the dynamics of chlorinity are highly linked to their historical levels and the information related to the antecedent saltwater conditions is of significant importance to a reliable forecast the model deterioration caused by the absence of these inputs cannot be mitigated by a more sophisticated preprocessing and postprocessing approach 3 the monthly dynamics of saltwater intrusion are more sensitive to the long term solar activities than the local wind force we highly recommend that the number of sunspots should be considered in studies of mid and long term forecast of saltwater intrusion for it can provide information relating to numerous climatic signals without the need to include many climatic factors the effects of solar activity on saltwater intrusion are not restricted to the indirect effects through affecting runoff tidal activity and local weather the number of sunspots as an indicator of climate signals shows stronger correlation and better ability to improve the forecast accuracy than the local wind effect 4 low runoff high antecedent chlorinity strong tidal force and strong wind force are preferable over the monthly average values as model inputs involving the statistics that can portray the inner characteristics of the monthly scaled samples can help extract the utmost information from the limited available data useful information can be smoothed out by averaging the daily observations for the monthly forecast 5 the combined use of r and mic was applied as a correlation based feature selection on the initial set of input candidates the dynamics of saltwater intrusion are highly non linear retaining the valuable non linear signals identified by the combined use of r and mic in the meanwhile filtering out the irrelevant information is able to make it easier for the models to learn from the limited training samples and significantly improve the forecast accuracy 6 the bma ensemble approach enabled us to develop a reliable model to predict saltwater intrusion forecast the ability for bma to improve on the overall performance is especially significant when the ensemble members give low performance due to insufficient or inappropriate pre processing our method was tailored for accurate and stable forecasts of monthly saltwater intrusion duration and was able to extract the most valuable information from a limited number of available samples the proposed framework has the potential to help a wide range of forecasts related to complex natural processes which are frustrated by an imperfect physical understanding and insufficient data credit authorship contribution

4495,mid and long term saltwater intrusion forecasts for estuaries are challenging due to a wide range of dynamic interactions and the limited amount of available data this study proposes a tailor made method for input determination for ensemble forecasts of monthly estuarine saltwater intrusion the proposed method is based on determining the initial set of candidates by the combined use of pearson s coefficient r and maximal information coefficient mic and afterwards reducing the dimension of the input data sets by principal component analysis pca the current study uses bayesian model averaging bma method to combine the forecasting results of random forest rf support vector machine svm and elman neural network enn models to create an integrated forecast the proposed modeling approach was tested and compared with seven alternative procedures to forecast the monthly saltwater intrusion at the pearl river delta prd the results indicated that a the monthly dynamics of saltwater intrusion are more sensitive to the long term solar activities than the local wind force b the valuable non linear signals hidden in the related time series could be identified by the combined use of r and mic c dynamic statistics related to low runoff high antecedent chlorinity strong tidal force and strong wind force are preferable over the monthly average values as model inputs and d the proposed method achieved highest forecast accuracy with nash sutcliffe coefficient nse of 0 78 this study provides insights to the input determination for data driven models of complex estuarine saltwater intrusion keywords bayesian model averaging input determination monthly forecast saltwater intrusion 1 introduction in recent decades increasing saltwater intrusion especially during the dry seasons has severely impaired the water supply at populated estuaries worldwide mai et al 2002 haddout et al 2016 klassen and allen 2017 kalisperi et al 2018 furthermore high salinity levels can have significant negative financial consequences stemming from the ongoing expenses required for treating drinking water and pumping at groundwater interception wells in addition to diminished agricultural returns kendrick 1974 therefore saltwater intrusion is not only a management issue but also a scientific problem and accurate saltwater intrusion forecasts will be of vital importance to the policy makers generally the models to predict saltwater intrusion fall into two main categories process driven models e g gong et al 2013 2018 gisen et al 2015 liu et al 2017 pappa et al 2017 ye et al 2017 and data driven models e g yoon et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 hunter et al 2018 hu et al 2019 most process driven models solve a coupled system of variable flow and solute transport equations and are numerically complicated and computationally demanding werner et al 2013 wang et al 2015 they require detailed information on the boundary and initial conditions covering freshwater tide wind effects and riverbed terrain preferably covering all possible sources of water salinity hu et al 2019 in contrast in data driven models the model structure is a function of available data data driven models main advantage includes their rapid development and implementation and can make the best use of existing data to achieve a predetermined model structure mount et al 2016 despite the merits and usefulness of these machine learning algorithms the performance of these models is dependent on the techniques used and on a large volume of data for meaningful training for example rajaee and boroumand 2015 evaluated the modelling capability of coupled discrete wavelet transform dwt with artificial neural network ann and multi linear regression mlr wann and wmlr ann mlr and genetic algorithm support vector regression ga svr models on a limited dataset by reducing the number of the samples from 240 to 60 and the result demonstrated that using less datasets could not yield accurate predictions because of inadequate training one of the significant challenges for applying machine learning techniques to saltwater intrusion forecasts at monthly temporal resolution is the lack of adequate data at complex estuaries in most cases conducting a large scale salinity field measurement is labor intensive and only a short time series is usually available liu et al 2017 also the process of saltwater intrusion at estuaries is related to multiple variables leading to considerable uncertainty in saltwater intrusion prediction one of the most important steps in the data driven model development process is determining the significant input variables bowden et al 2005 a subset of compact and informative inputs with the max relevance and min redundancy can significantly enhance the model performance and reduce the demand for training samples lyu et al 2017 the determination of a suitable set of inputs is challenging because the monthly condition of estuary chlorinity is directly or indirectly affected by various short term and long term factors on the one hand if the inputs are insufficient the model cannot reasonably reflect the dynamic estuary system on the other hand considering too many factors as inputs will complicate the model and require more training data since some factors may be correlated noisy or have no significant relationship with the output variable being modelled hence the purpose of this research is to design a well performing and easy to apply strategy of input determination for the monthly forecast of saltwater intrusion information measures are considered one of the most effective measures to capture both linear and nonlinear correlations between features and classes peng et al 2005 reshef et al 2011 proposed a novel statistical approach known as the maximal information coefficient mic an exploratory statistical analysis tool mic has been applied in many fields for its advantages of measuring a broad sense of associations however the mathematical and statistical properties of mic have still not been comprehensively studied ding and li 2013 e g its alleged ability to give equal importance to linear and nonlinear relationships as well as its relatively low power in detecting dependencies heller et al 2013 santos et al 2014 simon and tibshirani 2014 santos et al 2014 found that mic gave a worse performance than pearson s correlation coefficient r in analyzing non linear monotonic relationships in theory r only identifies linear relationships in fact associations detected by r are not exclusively linear and its performance in identifying monotonic associations such as exponential relationships is satisfactory santos et al 2014 therefore in this study we propose a combined use of r and mic instead of relying entirely on either one for correlation based input determination for further data extraction principal component analysis pca was applied to reduce the selected feature space s redundancy skill and uncertainty of different machine learning algorithms vary for an application because of their unique structures and theories zhang et al 2015 therefore a multi model ensemble strategy must exploit and integrate the diversity of skillful prediction from different models and reduce their uncertainty the bayesian model averaging bma predictive probability density function pdf is a weighted mixture of pdfs corresponding to the individual ensemble members baran et al 2019 the bma has been successfully applied in ensemble forecasts for water level baran et al 2019 the derivation of reservoir operating rules zhang et al 2015 precipitation ma et al 2018 temperature wubshetboru 2018 ground water head li and tsai 2009 and streamflow sharma et al 2019 consequently we attempt to integrate bma to combine various forecasts of the same quantity given by machine learning models for better prediction performance and stronger robustness on monthly saltwater intrusion forecast time step is another important issue of modeling which depends among others on the modeling purpose and data availability the existing studies of saltwater intrusion are mainly for daily and hourly time step forecasting of chlorinity yoon et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 suffering from a short lead time of a few days with acceptable accuracy which limited their application for the purpose of water resource management for alleviating the adverse impacts of saltwater intrusion however the saltwater intrusion severity of the next month is important for planning water transfer and reservoirs operation to meet the demand for urban domestic water the authority needs to run the water transfer project to meet emergencies stemming from the salty tide forecasting the severity of the salt tide s freshwater availability can provide instructive information for water transfer projects hence our study is motivated to fill this gap by providing a monthly forecast of the days of saltwater duration to meet water resource management s need for alleviating the adverse impacts of saltwater intrusion the present study s primary goal is to propose a tailor made input determination method for improving ensemble forecasts of monthly estuarine saltwater intrusion the main goal is achieved through 1 exploring the effect of the dynamic statistics of the saltwater intrusion process at estuaries on the prediction accuracy 2 introducing a combined use of r and mic for inputs selection and 3 assessing the ability of bma on reducing the modelling uncertainty 2 methodology 2 1 the framework of input determination for an ensemble forecast of monthly saltwater intrusion an outline of the framework of input determination for ensemble forecast of monthly saltwater intrusion in complex river systems is given in fig 1 where the proposed framework consists of 4 steps step 1 the initial set of input candidates was specified based on a priori knowledge of both local and long term factors the statistical characteristics i e mean maximum minimum and maximum minimum of these factors were all quantified and included in the initial input variables step 2 the initial set of candidates was further screened based on correlation analyses the linear and nonlinear dependencies between the input and output variables were measured by the combined use of r and mic the decision rules for selecting among the four statistical characteristics of the influencing factors were a variables with high r and high mic should be retained in the subset to supply linear or non linear monotonical signals b variables with low r but relatively high mic should be considered as additional model inputs that supply non linear non monotonical signals step 3 the retained subset of variables was first normalized into 1 1 and then extracted by pca to reduce the dimensionality and ensure that the remaining inputs were independent of each other step 4 the monthly saltwater intrusion duration was forecasted by using rf svm and enn incorporating the final extracted inputs in the previous step finally the forecasts from rf svm and enn were combined by bma 2 2 correlation analysis and extraction techniques 2 2 1 maximal information coefficient mic the mic is a relatively new measure for associations between two variables that applies mutual information to continuously distributed random variables reshef et al 2011 given two variables a a i i 1 2 n and b b i i 1 2 n the mutual information between a and b is given by 1 m i a b a a b b p a b l o g p a b p a p b where p a b is the joint probability density of variables a and b and p a and p b are the marginal probability densities of variables a and b respectively suppose we have the 2d dataset d a i b i i 1 2 n where the a values are divided into bins along x and the b values are divided into bins along y this x y partitioning creates grid g the largest amount of mutual information from a given grid g is given by 2 mi d x y m a x m i d g where m i d g is the mi of g on d and the mi is as defined in eq 1 these mutual information values are normalized as 3 m d x y mi d x y log m i n x y where m d x y is the characteristic matrix with normalized mi and the mi d x y is as defined in eq 2 the mic is given by 4 m i c d max xy b n m d x y where b is the upper bound of the grid size and is usually set to n 0 6 2 2 2 pearson s correlation coefficient r the pearson s correlation coefficient r is a statistical measure of linear correlation between paired data x and y and it is computed as 5 r xy i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 the pearson s correlation coefficient r takes values from the closed interval 1 1 positive correlation coefficient values indicate a tendency of one variable to increase or decrease together with another variable negative correlation coefficient values indicate a tendency to increase in one variable associated with decreases in the other variable and vice versa correlation coefficient values near zero indicate a low association between variables and those close to 1 or 1 indicate a strong linear association between variables kirch 2008 2 2 3 principal component analysis pca principal component analysis pca reduces the complexity of the high dimensional data with orthogonal transformations kramer 1991 it converts the original set of samples of possibly correlated variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components pcs in our study the selected data set x n f was first normalized to 1 1 with eq 6 and then decomposed into eq 7 6 y j 1 1 x j m i n x j m a x x j m i n x j 1 7 y t p t e where x j is the j th column of the original data set x y j is the j th column of the normalized data set t n f is the scores matrix p m f is the loading matrix and e n m is a matrix of residuals to minimize the residuals for the given number of factors the columns of p are the eigenvectors corresponding to the f largest eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of y 2 3 machine learning algorithms 2 3 1 support vector machine svm the svm algorithm proposed by cortes and vapnik 1995 is based on statistical learning theory and the structural risk minimization hypothesis to achieve good robustness and efficiency sujay and deka 2014 an alternative ε insensitive loss function was introduced to the svm the goal was to find a function f x that has at most an ε deviation from the targets y i in the training data and at the same time the minimum norm w 2 to ensure flatness in this study libsvm https www csie ntu edu tw cjlin libsvm was used to develop the svm models and the radial basis function rbf φ was used to create a nonlinear svm by mapping it to a high dimensional feature space many studies have used the svm for hydrological modeling and demonstrated the rbf kernel s good performance e g asefa et al 2005 dibike et al 2001 γ is another parameter of the svm model in the kernel function k x x φ x φ x e x p γ x x 2 2 and the value of it can influence the mapping process the optimization problem is to find the flattest function in the feature space rather than the input space to cope with the infeasible constraints of the optimization problem the slack variables ξ i and ξ i are introduced to allow a certain amount of error therefore the optimization problem can be written as 8 m i n i m i z e 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i 9 o y i w φ x i b ε ξ i w φ x i b y i ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 where c is the error penalty parameter which is used to reach a compromise between the empirical risk and the confidence interval w is the norm that is to be minimized φ is the radial basis function rbf ξ i and ξ i are slack variables and ε is the maximum deviation that can be tolerated 2 3 2 random forest rf rf is a non parametric statistical method proposed by breiman 2001 that uses a bootstrap approach in conjunction with random feature selection the bootstrap method is used for resampling the original training set to form new training sets for each new training set a regression tree is created using random feature selection regression trees are created based on feature space partitioning and are grown rather than pruned a single regression tree is highly unstable and that instability is further exacerbated by using only a small number of randomly selected features for node splitting the rf method uses the instability of regression trees by calculating the final output as an arithmetic mean of all individual tree predictions li et al 2014 the algorithm proceeds as follows step 1 obtain ntree bootstrap samples from the original training set step 2 grow ntree regression trees based on the data of each of the bootstrapped new training sets a at each split node independently select m try features at random out of all m predictors of the original training set input b for each split node find the best split into two subsets with the selected subset of m try according to the split rule of minimizing the mean squared error c repeat a b recursively for each split node until the tree is fully grown and no further splits are possible step 3 average the terminal results across the collection of ntree trees rf has only two parameters i e the number of predictors randomly selected as candidates for splitting at each node m try and the number of trees for random bootstrap sampling ntree rfs perform relatively well even if irrelevant descriptors are not removed before training overfitting is prevented by growing each tree using a bootstrap sampling and by selecting from a random subset of variables at each split based on this knowledge an rf should be in theory highly applicable to chlorinity prediction and be able to simulate the non linear relationships between chlorinity and its influencing factors 2 3 3 elman neural network enn the enn is a well known recurrent topology and contains an input layer a hidden layer an output layer and a context layer connected so that the network is more sensitive to historical data and can deal with dynamic information elman 1990 the input layer hidden layer and output layer are fully connected in a feed forward manner and the hidden layer has a 1 1 relationship with the context layer the context units save the previous output values from the hidden layer neurons and feed them back to connect them to the hidden layer neurons which become additional inputs to the network to form a recurrent connection the values of the feedback connection weights are fixed at 1 and all other weights are trainable the network mathematical model is given by 10 x k f w 1 x c k w 2 u k 1 11 x c k α x c k 1 x k 1 12 y k g w 3 x k where w 1 is the weight matrix from the hidden layer to the context layer w 2 is the weight matrix from the input layer to the hidden layer w 3 is the weight matrix from the hidden layer to the output layer f and g are nonlinear matrix functions consisting of the activation function in the hidden or output layer f is a sigmoid function 0 α 1 is the self connection feedback gain factor the squared error at the network output at time k is defined as 13 e k 1 2 y k y k t y k y k where y k is the output at time step k and y k is the observation at time step k the weights are modified at each time step k 2 4 bayesian model averaging bma bma is a postprocessing approach for ensemble forecasting the bma forecast is a weighted average of the individual forecasts the weights are estimated using posterior model probabilities and reflect the models forecasting performance in the training period raftery et al 2005 in the case of predicting the chlorinity y based on the training observations d x obs y obs where x obs is the training input and y obs is the training output using k models m 1 m k the posterior distribution of the bma forecast p y is as follows 14 p y k 1 k p y m k p m k d where p y m k is the forecast based on model m k alone and p m k d denotes the posterior probability of model m k being correct for the given training observations this also reflects how well the model m k fits the training observations considering that k 1 k p y m k 1 let w k p y m k therefore k 1 k w k 1 and then the bma predictive model is 15 e y k 1 k p m k d e y m k k 1 k w k f k 2 5 model training and testing criteria the model parameters are optimized to maximize the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse and modeling results are evaluated by using nse mean absolute error mae and percent bias pbias which are shown in eqs 16 18 these criteria provided a comprehensive assessment of different aspects of the model performance nse alone is not adequate in describing the performance of a model jain and sudheer 2008 the time series of saltwater intrusion condition is highly non stationary and shows a strong monthly periodicity so the i 1 n o i o 2 will be a relatively high value thus the nse gives more weight to the high values and will not be very sensitive to the small systematic errors krause et al 2005 therefore we applied mae and pbias to complement the nse mae is the average absolute differences between prediction and actual observation over the test samples where all individual differences have equal weight willmott and matsuura 2005 chai and draxler 2014 pbias measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than their observed counterparts gupta et al 1999 16 nse 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 17 mae 1 n i 1 n p i o i 18 pbias 100 p o o where pi and oi are predicted and observed values and i 1 2 n p and o are long term averages of pi and oi respectively 3 study site the pearl river estuary pre is one of the most complicated estuaries in the world it is surrounded by a region with fastest economic growth and urbanization development in china over the last 20 years xu et al 2015 the pearl river delta fig 2 is one of china s most densely populated and economically developed regions the pearl river has three main tributaries the xijiang river dongjiang river and beijiang river wang et al 2012 the modaomen channel is located downstream of the xijiang river it is the largest tributary and contributes 77 of the water discharged from the pearl river zhou et al 2006 the modaomen waterway is the main source of drinking water for the cities of jiangmen zhongshan zhuhai and macao zhou et al 2006 in recent decades severe saltwater intrusion has interfered with the region s water supply during dry seasons gong and shen 2011 likely resulting from global climate change and intense anthropogenic activities zhang et al 2012 in particular anthropogenic activities have included uncontrolled and uneven sand excavation since the 1980s which has altered the hydrology and morphology of the modaomen estuary substantially changing the flow division between the various watercourses luo et al 2007 therefore saltwater intrusion forecasts with high accuracies and long lead times would be of great assistance to water resource management and policymakers seeking to meet the urban domestic water demand of this region however the geometry and bathymetry of the modaomen estuary are complex making the construction of well performing process driven models difficult as proven at other estuaries that share similar complexities model construction requires a good knowledge of the underlying hydrological processes and a large number of measured parameters for characterization along with significant volumes of data which are rarely available especially at a monthly scale hence this study chose modaomen waterway to demonstrate the superiority of our input determination method combined with an ensemble data driven forecast framework for saltwater intrusion 4 data the saltwater intrusion events during the dry seasons from 2001 to 2009 i e 2001 11 2002 2 2002 11 2003 2 2003 11 2004 2 2004 11 2005 2 2005 11 2006 2 2006 11 2007 2 2007 11 2008 2 and 2008 11 2009 2 at pinggang station were selected to verify the model accuracy and performance the samples were split into training and testing sets at the ratio of 3 1 the records of the first six seasons 24 samples were used to train the models and the remaining records 8 samples were used to test the models the raw data collected for analysis in this paper included hourly chlorinity at pinggang station hourly tidal level at denglongshan gauging station hourly wind direction and speed at zhongshan station daily water discharge at the makou hydrological station and monthly average number of sunspots retrieved from https cmdp ncc cma net cn index htm daily averages of the hourly chlorinity tidal level and wind force were calculated to match the water discharge measurement frequency to quantify the wind effect on saltwater intrusion a polar coordinate system with the positive direction to the north northwest was used because the saltwater intrusion is reduced by downstream winds and increased by upstream winds the wind effect on the saltwater intrusion was quantified by mapping the wind vector f x in respect to the polar coordinate 19 f f cos π 8 x where f denotes the magnitude of the wind vector and π 8 x is the polar angle of the wind vector 5 results 5 1 forecasting with the proposed framework 5 1 1 initial set of candidates and data the initial input candidates should first be identified based on a comprehensive understanding of the studied system previous studies have indicated that the increase of saltwater intrusion in the estuary can be attributed to a decrease in upstream runoff an increase in tidal amplitude at the river mouth bao et al 2009 chen et al 2011 gong et al 2014 up estuary wind force and climate change yang 2007 for short term factors we considered antecedent saltwater intrusion duration chlorinity upstream inflow tidal level and wind effect for long term factors we considered sunspot numbers an indicator of solar activities existing studies indicate that the global temperature roughly follows the sunspot variations and there is a good correlation and nearly in phase response between solar activity and sea level solheim 2013 previous hydrological forecasts at monthly scales have usually used the monthly average values of the driving factors of the preceding month abdella and alfredsen 2010 chu et al 2017 lavaysse et al 2015 critical information may be masked in the process of smoothing the daily record into monthly scale therefore the statistical characteristics i e mean maximum minimum and maximum minimum of these factors should be considered when quantifying these factors in our study we choose 5 subsets of variables related to antecedent saltwater intrusion conditions runoff tidal level wind effect and sunspot numbers the initial set of candidates table 1 consisted of d tol 1 c mean 1 c max 1 c min 1 c max m i n 1 r mean 1 r max 1 r min 1 r max m i n 1 t mean 1 t max 1 t min 1 t max m i n 1 w mean 1 w max 1 w min 1 w max m i n 1 s mean 1 s mean 2 and the details of the time series are listed in tables 2 and 3 5 1 2 correlation based selection input selection was conducted based on correlation analysis between the output d tol 0 and the initial set of variable candidates for further input determination the r and mic scores were used as measurements of linear and nonlinear correlations and the results are plotted in fig 3 the linear or non linear monotonical signals relationships were first identified by r scores followed by identification of non linear non monotonical relationships by comparing mic with r scores after the feature selecting process the inputs retained in the final subset were d tol 1 c max 1 r max m i n 1 t mean 1 t max m i n 1 w mean 1 w max 1 s mean 1 and s mean 2 the initial candidates that reflected antecedent saltwater intrusion conditions were d tol 1 c mean 1 c max 1 c min 1 and c max m i n 1 we can see from the scores that d tol 1 c max 1 and c max m i n 1 gained similar r considering that c max 1 had similar r with c max m i n 1 and relatively higher mic than c max m i n 1 we retained c max 1 rather than c max m i n 1 to avoid more redundant information considering that d tol 1 also showed high r and had different physical meaning from the other four variables we retained d tol 1 to provide additional information hence d tol 1 and c max 1 were retained in the final input subset and the other three candidates were discarded among the 4 candidates related to runoff r mean 1 r max 1 r min 1 and r max m i n 1 the r min 1 series was retained because it had the highest r and mic in terms of tidal level the t max m i n 1 series was assumed to be the most informative one as it had the highest r 0 36 and highest mic 0 40 among the tide related subset t mean 1 scored similar mic with t max 1 but much lower r based on this we assumed that t mean 1 contained more additional non linear non monotonical information than t max 1 and less redundant information with t max m i n 1 hence the t mean 1 series was retained as additional nonlinear information concerning wind effect w mean 1 had the highest r 0 21 among the 4 candidates related to wind w max 1 had the highest mic 0 25 which was 0 04 higher than that of w mean 1 0 21 and similarly low r values with w min 1 and w max m i n 1 so we concluded that w max 1 would best serve as an additional non linear non monotonical signal therefore w mean 1 and w max 1 were both retained the sunspot numbers of the last two months s mean 1 and s mean 2 had similar high absolute values of r while s mean 1 had an mic that was 0 17 higher than that of s mean 2 based on these results we assumed that s mean 1 and s mean 2 both contained strong linear or non linear monotonical signals and that s mean 1 contained more non linear non monotonical signals both of these candidates were retained 5 1 2 1 extraction by pca to remove correlations among problem variables pca was applied and the eigenvalues for the correlation matrix were calculated fig 4 the selected dataset was projected into a lower dimension with 7 principal components that accounted for over 98 of the original information 5 1 2 2 forecast by machine learning models and ensemble forecasts by bma with the input variables selected the saltwater intrusion duration was forecasted using rf svm and enn and then integrated by bma the forecast by our framework was evaluated using the performance statistics tabulated in table 4 the three member models gave similar good performance on the training set however these models performed differently on the testing set the rf gave the worst performance with the lowest nse and the highest mae and absolute value of pbias the nse of the enn was 5 33 higher than that of the svm the pbias of the enn was 45 lower than that of the svm and mae of enn was 12 higher than that of svm based on these performance values on the training dataset the bma method determined the weights for the rf svm and enn models to be 0 27 0 32 and 0 41 respectively though the weights were given based on the performances on the training set the member models weight rank order is the same as that of the nse or the inverse order of the absolute value of pbias in the testing period the most accurate and reliable forecasts of saltwater intrusion were obtained by bma as it achieved the best goodness of fit with 0 78 for nse and 1 93 for pbias bma achieved a pbias significantly lower than those of the individual models similar mae with the one svm with the lowest mae among the members and higher nse than the one enn with the highest nse among the member models comparisons of observed vs forecasted values from the member models and ensemble model in our proposed framework are presented in scatter plots in the first row of fig 5 generally rf over predicted in the lower portion and under predicted on the upper portion though svm and enn generally had similar scores of assessment criteria values that were predicted well by one of them could be predicted badly by the other in some cases enn exhibited a higher accuracy in predicting high values and svm had a better ability to predict low values since bma is a weighted averaging method where large errors produced by a particular model can be smoothed by the averaging process the scattered dots from the bma model forecast results exhibited the lowest dispersion along the optimal curve 5 2 assessment of the proposed input determination framework to test the effectiveness of the proposed input determination framework we designed 7 other experiments for constructing models with different pre processing steps table 5 models in experiment a did not involve variables related to sunspot numbers in the initial set of input candidates in step 1 models in experiment b did not involve variables related to sunspot numbers or wind effects models in experiment c did not consider the antecedent saltwater conditions in step 1 models in experiment d did not undergo step 2 which further selected variables by correlation analysis models in experiment e only used monthly average values of the antecedent saltwater conditions runoff tidal level wind effect and sunspot numbers and skipped the further selection of step 2 models in experiment f only used r in the correlation based selection process of step 2 finally models in experiment g maintained the proposed steps 1 and 2 but skipped step 3 for data extraction by pca the scatter plots of the observed and forecasted d tol 0 produced by these experimental models are shown in fig 5 and the performance indicators are listed in table 4 among these experimental models the nse varied from 0 43 to 0 78 the mae varied from 1 80 to 3 22 and the absolute value of pbias varied from 3 90 to 30 82 only the model constructed with our proposed structure achieved nse higher than 0 75 while both mae and the absolute value of pbias lower than 2 comprehensive prior knowledge of the studied system when selecting the initial set of input candidates is key to the success of a model in experiment a only short term features were considered and the sunspot numbers were excluded in the input candidates the nse of the bma decreased by 8 and the pbias significantly increased from 1 93 to 12 96 compared with our proposed bma model without considering the wind effect the nse of the ensemble members in experiment b decreased by 11 15 and 24 and the mae of the ensemble members in the experiment b increased by 16 4 and 68 respectively compared with the models in experiment a the antecedent saltwater conditions are indispensable as an important feature to produce reliable forecasts in the case of experiment c with the variables related to the antecedent saltwater conditions removed from the initial set of input candidates and only runoff tidal level wind and sunspot numbers were considered the ensemble model resulted in poor accuracy with nse value of only 0 43 in the testing period and none of its member models achieved nse above 0 3 inputs of the statistical characteristics carried more information of the studied system than the time series of the monthly mean values models in experiment e only included d tol 1 c mean 1 r mean 1 t mean 1 w mean 1 s mean 1 and s mean 2 in the initial set of candidates and all further selection was skipped with the limited information provided by these inputs bma in experiment e only got the nse value of 0 64 and much higher mae and pbias values than that of our proposed model the paired use of r and mic was important for selecting informative variables from the initial set of candidates in the case of experiment f r was used as the only selecting criterion of the candidates which results in a low accuracy forecast with the nse of only 0 53 and high mae 3 05 and pbias 5 19 this showed that the additional candidates with valuable non linear information identified by mic were indispensable for a well performing model further extraction by pca was also necessary without pca the bma in experiment g obtained the nse value of 0 67 the bma combination was a critical step for improving the overall performance for most of the experimental models bma resulted in the highest nse among its ensemble members except in the case of experiment e the ability of bma to improve the overall performance was even more significant when the ensemble members did not perform well due to insufficient or inappropriate pre processing for the testing period the nse values of bma were 1 3 7 5 7 6 48 3 16 4 32 5 and 15 5 higher than the nse values of the best performing ensemble members from the proposed framework and experiments a b c d f and g respectively however bma did not always perform better than its best performing members in the case of experiment e the performances of its ensemble members showed distinctive differences the nse of rf in experiment e reached as high as 0 72 during the testing period which was even better than the performance of the rf with our proposed framework the svm however only got close to 0 for the nse and mae as high as 4 83 even with such a badly performing member the bma still produced an acceptable result with an nse of 0 67 and mae of 2 88 6 discussion in this study we presented an input determination method for ensemble forecasts of monthly estuarine saltwater intrusion the proposed method consists of 5 steps 1 identifying the initial set of the input candidates with the statistics that capture the inner dynamic signals 2 correlation based selection by the combined use of r and mic 3 data extraction by pca 4 modelling by rf svm and enn 5 and model ensemble by bma with only 24 training samples our proposed method was able to provide very good performance with 0 78 of nse 1 77 of mae and 1 93 of pbias on the testing data set the suitability and superiority of our proposed method were also assessed by the comparison with 7 alternative procedures the models constructed with our proposed framework performed better than the experimental models in terms of nse mae and pbias 6 1 the influencing factors related to saltwater intrusion the results clearly showed that identifying the appropriate initial set of candidates for further selection is the foundation of a reliable forecast result the initial set of candidates should be identified based on prior knowledge of saltwater conditions data availability and suitability in the studied area since the goal is to forecast monthly saltwater intrusion duration the strategy is to include 5 groups of factors antecedent saltwater conditions runoff tidal level wind forces and the number of sunspots and to make the utmost use of the limited available data by considering the inner dynamic statistics of the monthly samples the results have shown that the dynamics of chlorinity were highly linked to its historical levels which were consistent with previous studies qiu and wan 2013 shi et al 2008 the information related to the antecedent saltwater conditions was of significant importance to a reliable forecast the model deterioration caused by the absence of these inputs could not be mitigated by a more sophisticated preprocessing and postprocessing approach a general consensus exists that the impact of climate change will exacerbate long term trends of saltwater intrusion gong et al 2013 2014 suen and lai 2013 zhang et al 2012 however most studies that have correlated climate change with saltwater intrusion use the sea level as an indicator of the climate effect ketabchi et al 2016 werner et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 because the effect of sea level rise is relatively direct and physically better understood compared to other influential climatic factors in our study we introduced the number of sunspots as the indicator of the influence of atmospheric circulation which made our model sensitive to remote climatic signals in terms of the short term meteorological influence it has been claimed by many studies that wind patterns can dramatically impact the tidal currents in a wide range gan et al 2004 ji 2008 jia and li 2012 and the up estuary winds exacerbate saltwater intrusion gan et al 2009 zu and gan 2015 wang et al 2018 our results indicated that compared to the wind effect the number of sunspots showed a stronger correlation with the saltwater intrusion condition and improved the forecast accuracy at a monthly scale after we removed the sunspot numbers from the proposed initial set of candidates the forecast accuracy of bma in experiment a reduced by 7 7 in terms of nse compared to that of the model in our proposed framework in experiment b after the factors related to the wind effect were removed from the initial set of candidates for experiment a the nse of the member models decreased by 11 5 1 5 and 23 9 respectively however this model deterioration caused by the absence of wind was mitigated by applying bma to integrate the member models we inferred that the monthly dynamics of saltwater intrusion were more sensitive to the long term solar activity than the local wind force though there can be redundancy between the number of sunspots and other variables because solar activities can indirectly affect saltwater intrusion by influencing runoff tidal activity and weather berndtsson et al 2001 ketabchi et al 2016 okal and anderson 1975 yuan and zhu 2015 pca further reduced these redundancies our results proved that inputting the number of sunspots significantly improved model performance even when the effects of runoff tidal level and wind were already considered this means that the effects of solar activity on saltwater intrusion were not restricted to the indirect effects through affecting runoff tidal activity and wind force therefore we recommend that the number of sunspots should be used as a model input for monthly saltwater intrusion forecast as it provides information relating to numerous climatic signals without the need to include many climatic factors thereby reducing the risks of confusing the machine learning algorithms and overfitting 6 2 the monthly dynamic signals identification the proposed procedure maximized the use of the available data and captured as many signals as possible from the observations of the related factors by taking into account the inner dynamic characteristics of the monthly scaled samples antecedent chlorinity runoff tidal level and wind effect were measured as monthly mean monthly maximum monthly minimum and monthly maximum minus monthly minimum with one month lag sunspot numbers were measured as monthly mean with 1 and 2 month lags we compared the forecasts given by using these factors with those by using only monthly mean variables it was obvious that useful information was smoothed out by averaging the daily observations hence we recommend the strategy of using the statistics such as monthly maximum monthly minimum etc that can portray the inner characteristics of the monthly scaled samples for monthly forecast on highly dynamic systems the inclusion of the statistical values of the influencing factors increased the number of input variable candidates and feature redundancy when the number of features is high but the number of samples is small machine learning models become prone to overfitting since the search space is sparsely populated and the model is unable to distinguish between relevant data and noise bolón canedo et al 2013 provost 2000 we proposed a combined use of r and mic for a correlation based feature selection on the initial set of input candidates unlike the typical correlation based methods our proposed method didn t set a fixed universal threshold to decide which variables to retain and which to discard because redundant variables are likely to exhibit similar degrees of correlation bolón canedo et al 2013 we divided the candidates into 5 subsets our approach to variable selection followed the principles that one or two variables from each subset should be sufficient to characterize that set these will be selected based on r and mic correlation criteria a variable with both high r and high mic should be included if a variable has low r but high mic it should also be retained to provide additional information in our study the models constructed with inputs selected using both r and mic outperformed the ones without any selection techniques and the models constructed without any selection techniques outperformed the ones selected using only r we inferred that some valuable nonlinear signals were screened out when we only considered the linear or non linear monotonical associations retaining these valuable non linear signals identified by combined use of r and mic in the meanwhile filtering out the irrelevant information were able to make it easier for the models to learn from the training samples and significantly improve the forecast accuracy during selection the 19 initial inputs were reduced to a final subset of 9 model inputs and provided a more accurate forecast than using the sub set of monthly mean values this indicated that indicators related to low runoff high antecedent chlorinity strong tidal force and strong wind force were preferable over the monthly average values as model inputs one explanation of this could be that the extreme values were more representative of climate change than mean values senhorst and zwolsman 2005 mantua et al 2010 li et al 2013 tian et al 2013 lin et al 2019 high antecedent chlorinity low flows strong wind and strong tidal forces contained stronger climatic signals than the averages of these factors the tidal range is a commonly used indicator of tidal force in research on a daily scale it is the same for monthly scale saltwater intrusion that the range from the minimum to the maximum monthly tidal level is a better indicator than the monthly mean tidal level another explanation is the non stationary characters of the hydrological and weather systems especially in medium and long terms milly et al 2008 due to this non stationary problem there are insufficient severe saltwater intrusion samples to train a model which results in under estimation of high values for the testing set using the extreme values from a month as predictors instead of the monthly mean helps reduce the large errors when forecasting high values 6 3 the application of the bma method we relied on bayesian model averaging to address model misspecification and uncertainty even in the case of insufficient pre process and post process most models got nse higher than 0 9 on the training set but performed distinctively on the testing set the results were obvious that machine learning models showed severe tendency to overfit on small data and that there was no always best performing algorithm in our experiments we found that a machine learning model that performed worst for one set of inputs may have the best performance for another set rf svm and enn are three machine learning algorithms constructed based on different theories each with different sources of uncertainty and the uncertainty magnifies when the training samples are insufficient our experiments showed that it was almost impossible to determine the most suitable or the best performing model beforehand for a certain set of data which limits practical applications of data driven models on monthly saltwater intrusion forecasts the ability for bma postprocessor to improve the overall performance was obvious in our experiments that in most cases combining models with bma gave better performance than the best performing member models in terms of nse mae and pbias the ability for bma to improve the overall performance was especially significant when the individual ensemble members gave low performance due to insufficient or inappropriate pre processing however the experiments also showed that the advantage of bma became smaller in terms of nse with a smarter selection for model inputs also we found that bma may give similar or worse performances compared to its best performing member when the performances of its ensemble members differed greatly therefore we inferred that the degree of improvement provided by bma also depended on the distribution of the performances by its ensemble members though there is no guarantee that bma will always give the best performance than all of its constituent members we still recommend the use of bma over relying upon any one specific model this is because predicting which model would be the better predictor based on a priori knowledge of a system is prohibitively difficult one limitation of our study was that we neglected the impacts of economic and ecological factors like human intervention microbiological activity vegetation functioning etc the influence of these factors on saltwater intrusion has rarely been quantified although their confounding effects can be identified via physical modeling using available tools how to appropriately identify obtain and quantify these economic and ecological factors as inputs into data driven models remains to be resolved in our future study also small data limited our study on the non stationarity of the saltwater intrusion time series raftery et al 2005 applied a sliding window technique to obtain dynamic bma weights with longer length of salinity time series available in our future research we will study the model uncertainties in the multi model forecast under different climate scenarios by using this sliding window technique in the training period to estimate the bma weights variance and bias correction coefficients for long term forecast of saltwater intrusion 7 conclusion reliable monthly forecast of saltwater intrusion is critical in water resource management at complex estuaries however it is severely restricted by the problem of insufficient data and the dynamic character of the estuarine systems we introduced a robust input determination procedure for ensemble forecasts of monthly estuarine saltwater intrusion the proposed framework was applied to the modaomen waterway a typical riverine estuary in the pearl river delta we demonstrated its applicability and advantages by comparison with 7 alternative procedures overall our approach is considered a useful forecasting approach for application at complex estuaries with limited data the following conclusions are drawn 1 even with only 24 training samples our proposed framework still enabled to achieve effective training the model gave very good performance on both training and testing set with 0 78 of nse 1 77 of mae and 1 93 of pbias on the testing dataset 2 the dynamics of chlorinity are highly linked to their historical levels and the information related to the antecedent saltwater conditions is of significant importance to a reliable forecast the model deterioration caused by the absence of these inputs cannot be mitigated by a more sophisticated preprocessing and postprocessing approach 3 the monthly dynamics of saltwater intrusion are more sensitive to the long term solar activities than the local wind force we highly recommend that the number of sunspots should be considered in studies of mid and long term forecast of saltwater intrusion for it can provide information relating to numerous climatic signals without the need to include many climatic factors the effects of solar activity on saltwater intrusion are not restricted to the indirect effects through affecting runoff tidal activity and local weather the number of sunspots as an indicator of climate signals shows stronger correlation and better ability to improve the forecast accuracy than the local wind effect 4 low runoff high antecedent chlorinity strong tidal force and strong wind force are preferable over the monthly average values as model inputs involving the statistics that can portray the inner characteristics of the monthly scaled samples can help extract the utmost information from the limited available data useful information can be smoothed out by averaging the daily observations for the monthly forecast 5 the combined use of r and mic was applied as a correlation based feature selection on the initial set of input candidates the dynamics of saltwater intrusion are highly non linear retaining the valuable non linear signals identified by the combined use of r and mic in the meanwhile filtering out the irrelevant information is able to make it easier for the models to learn from the limited training samples and significantly improve the forecast accuracy 6 the bma ensemble approach enabled us to develop a reliable model to predict saltwater intrusion forecast the ability for bma to improve on the overall performance is especially significant when the ensemble members give low performance due to insufficient or inappropriate pre processing our method was tailored for accurate and stable forecasts of monthly saltwater intrusion duration and was able to extract the most valuable information from a limited number of available samples the proposed framework has the potential to help a wide range of forecasts related to complex natural processes which are frustrated by an imperfect physical understanding and insufficient data credit authorship contribution

hyper arid climate of hot dry summers and cold winters with occasional showers prevail the study area ema 1996 the mean annual rainfall is less than 50 mm and the potential annual evaporation often exceeds 2 500 mm abu zeid 1995 hassan 2013 2 2 geological setting the quaternary sediments have a great surface extension and unconformably overlie the eocene to pliocene units fig 1b holocene sediments consist of alluvium deposits nile silt fine sand and clay along the course of the ismailia canal with less than 5 m thick klitszch et al 1987 pleistocene sediments which have a maximum thickness of 250 m include two units early and late pleistocene with discontinuous clay and or sandy clay layers of variable thicknesses in between el shazly et al 1975 fig 1c the early pleistocene unit is composed of old deltaic deposits including sand and gravel with occasional clay lenses while the late pleistocene unit consists of fine to medium sands of fluvial and or fluviomarine origin el shazly et al 1975 the pliocene sediments along cairo ismailia and cairo suez roads consist of cross bedded sand and gravel with clay intercalations indicating fresh water estuarine and partly very shallow marine environments said 1990 the miocene strata are made up of sandy limestones and sandy marls of shallow marine origin with variable intercalations of clays sands and sandstones el shazly et al 1975 and are distributed in the southern and southwestern high slopes the oligocene rocks expose along cairo suez road and are distinguished into the gebel ahmer formation of medium to coarse grained well sorted unstratified sands with intercalations of sandstone beds and the overlying basaltic sheets said 1962 the eocene rocks of the mokattam group which consist of dense limestone with chert bands expose in the southernmost section of the study area and represent the oldest rock exposures fig 1b 2 3 hydrological setting 2 3 1 surface hydrology the ismailia canal the main surface water feature in the study area was constructed in 1862 for the water supply in the area between cairo and ismailia fig 1b much of the canal s course was dug through sandy strata without bottom and sides lining or sealing to keep the water seepage or leaking at a minimum consequently the unsealed sandy bottom and sides have contributed to the relatively high water table in the adjacent land abu zeid 1983 attempts to increase the canal s water discharge from 135 m3 s to 440 m3 s were completed through three stages to serve the irrigation expansion projects in newly irrigated areas african water facility 2007 stahl and ramadan 2008 total seepage rate increased from 17 0 m3 s to 22 4 m3 s after the completion of the second stage expansion abu zeid 1983 lately a number of lined branches e g el shabab and el mullak canals were diverted from the ismailia canal the excess of water discharge over the capacity of water purification stations resulted in the formation of unlined freshwater ponds that were mostly used for agricultural practices khalil et al 2015 treated and untreated wastewater from domestic and industrial activities were disposed into unlined ponds and ditched to the east of the tenth of ramadan city for storing and evaporating the excess water fig 2 2 3 2 groundwater system the pleistocene alluvium deposits host the main aquifer in the study area namely the quaternary aquifer the aquifer is considered as an unconfined extension of the nile aquifer system and consists of two hydraulically connected water bearing units fig 1c el shazly et al 1975 the total saturated thickness of the quaternary aquifer increases from south to north and northwest i e toward the ismailia canal and attains 250 m thick in the north el shazly et al 1975 in the vicinity of the ismailia canal the aquifer is directly connected with the nile water and the depth to the water level is less than 7 m near the canal while increases southward up to 73 m and 67 5 m at the east and north of the tenth of ramadan city respectively el shahat et al 2014 el sayed 2018 thus the main recharge to the quaternary aquifer occurs through seepage from the ismailia canal occasional rainstorms along the southern parts of the study area in addition to percolation of excess irrigation water abd el samie et al 2002 khalil et al 2015 el sayed 2018 depending on pumping tests data porosities of the quaternary aquifer in the study area and its surroundings ranges from 29 to 41 with an average effective porosity of 0 15 el arabi 1997 while the hydraulic conductivity of the quaternary aquifer ranged from 1 9 to 92 5 m day attwa et al 2014a el sayed 2018 with an average of 40 m day abd el samie et al 2002 abstraction of groundwater from the well field northwest of the tenth of ramadan city for public and industrial use has reached 60 000 m3 day in 2004 shedid 2005 in addition many private water supply wells have been drilled primarily for irrigation purposes in the eastern and western parts of the study area the quaternary aquifer is bounded from the bottom south and southwest by the miocene aquifer the miocene aquifer is either unconfined or semi confined depending on the occurrence of clay intercalations gomaa et al 2003 the depth to water varies from 160 m to 240 m along the cairo ismailia desert road the miocene aquifer is characterized by brackish water with tds values range from 2034 to 5934 al gamal et al 2011 from the pumping tests data the average effective porosity was 11 and the hydraulic conductivity ranged from 0 072 to 1 63 m day al gamal et al 2011 attwa et al 2014a the sources of recharge to the miocene aquifer include precipitation during the past wet periods occasional storm events under current conditions and to a lesser extent from current irrigation activities el shazly et al 1975 gomaa et al 2003 regional groundwater flow in the quaternary aquifer is from northwest to southeast along the ismailia canal as well as from south to north while groundwater in this the miocene aquifer flows from south and southwest to north and northwest fig 2 al gamal et al 2011 el sayed 2018 3 methodology 3 1 remote sensing and landcover land use maps

areas scale 1 500 000 klitszch et al 1987 were assembled in a single mosaic covering the study area then the created mosaic was digitized to determine the lithological units in the study area 3 land use map of the study area provided by the tenth of ramadan government office which were digitized and then used to identify the different land use activities 4 four land cover lc maps representing the

volume of precipitation and transmission losses a snap pour point for each catchment was delineated that represents the outlet of the basin before it debouches into the wide plain adjacent to the nile delta depression and adjacent to the sampling locations the upstream contributing area to each snap pour point was estimated using flow accumulation algorithms tarboton 1997 the total volume of precipitation over the two catchments was estimated using the following equation 1 v m 3 a m 2 p m where a is the upslope contributing area and p is the average annual precipitation the soil and water assessment tool swat model outputs of transmission losses values of the eastern desert of egypt catchments milewski et al 2009 which were also adopted in this study were evaluated through applying sensitivity analysis and were calibrated against measured runoff values from wadi girafi watershed in sinai milewski et al 2009 3 3 city water balance estimation the water budget for the tenth of ramadan city fig 3 was estimated based on the 2007 census data gopp and jica 2008 and other data geirnaert and laeven 1992 cadsac unpublished data 1994 abd el samie et al 2002 shedid 2005 water supply is mainly secured from the ismailia canal providing the city with roughly 184 4 million cubic meters per year mcm y gopp and jica 2008 about 67 of this input is directed to residential and industrial premises where about 20 is estimated to be consumed gopp and jica 2008 however other studies reported much higher loses 40 to 50 from water mains and sewers due to poor maintenance and rehabilitation attia 1999 our estimations only considered the updated 20 losses after gopp and jica 2008 moreover the water loss by evaporation was estimated based on the isotope data of inflow and outflow of water to the oxidation ponds abd el samie et al 2002 3 4 sampling and analytical techniques to identify potential end members of water in the quaternary aquifer groundwater samples were selected to represent the aquifer s extension i e from extreme south contact with the groundwater in the miocene aquifer to the north boundary with the surface water from the ismailia canal fig 1b 2 as well as sampling from different land use units fig 2 information on the well depths table 1 was acquired through available well logs at the well field area and by personal communication with the well owners in locations where records on the well depth were lacking comparing such information confirmed that samples were collected from the same aquifer unit the total number of collected water samples is 80 including 69 samples from the quaternary aquifer five samples from the miocene aquifer three samples from wastewater ponds and one sample from the ismailia canal fig 2 table 1 groundwater samples were collected from active municipal and private water supply boreholes after purging the wells for 15 to 20 min electrical conductivity ec ph and temperature t were measured using portable horiba probes d 55 and d 54 models sampling was initiated once measured values mentioned above were stabilized sampled waters were filtered through 0 45 µm membrane filters and collected in two 50 ml washed polyethylene bottles for major ion analyses samples for cation analysis were preserved with a few drops of hno3 immediately after sampling unfiltered samples were stored in 50 ml polyethylene bottles with poly seal caps for stable isotope 18o and 2h analysis alkalinity was determined in the field by titration with h2so4 using a hach digital titrator model 16900 spectrophotometric analyses were performed in the field for measuring nh4 and no3 using a hach dr 890 spectrophotometer the precision was determined by replicating the analysis for six samples and calculating the relative standard deviation 2 7 major cations ca2 mg2 na and k and anions cl and so4 2 were analyzed according to the usepa method 300 1 us environmental protection agency 1997 using a dionex ion chromatograph model dx 120 at the environmental science center the university of tokyo japan the calculated charge balance errors in all analyses were within 10 which are within the accepted error range hem 1989 hounslow 1995 δ2h and δ18o were measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry thermo fisher scientific delta v advantage using equilibration method with co2 for δ18o epstein and mayeda 1953 and h2 in the presence of platinum pt catalyst for δ2h ohsumi and fujino 1986 horita et al 1989 at the kumamoto university japan analytical errors were estimated to be better than 0 05 and 0 5 for δ18o and δ2h

according to cloutier et al 2008 helsel 2010 and doe 2012 samples with missing data values i e nos 6 7 23 29 and 33 were also not included in the multivariate analysis finally the dataset used in this approach constitutes a data matrix of 79 sampling points by nine variables including ec ca2 mg2 na cl so4 2 hco3 δ18o and δ2h the common kaiser meyer olkin kmo test 0 76 and bartlett s test significance level 0 05 confirmed that pca can be applied on the dataset the raw data were used for pca because the correlation matrix has the effect of standardizing the data doe 2012 while it was standardized for hca the standardized data are obtained by subtracting the mean of the distribution and dividing by the standard deviation of the distribution davis 1986 for pca an estimation technique based on the spearman rank based correlation matrix was used because it is less sensitive to extreme values outliers than the more commonly applied pearson correlation matrix doe 2012 a common criterion kaiser normalization for determining the number of principal components called pcs to consider for further analysis is those having an eigenvalue greater than one kaiser 1960 the varimax rotation was also applied for reducing the overlap between original variables and maximize the variance in each principal component davis 1986 the ward linkage method and squared euclidean distance measurement were considered for the hca as they are effective in cluster determination in water studies güler et al 2002 pca and hca were conducted using xlstat version 2015 4 01 20780 4 results and discussions 4 1 land cover land use changes the visual inspection of the multi temporal satellite data e g landsat mss 1972 and landsat 8 2018 fig 5 a b indicates that the area has been subjected to intensive land cover changes except for a narrow vegetated belt along the ismailia canal the area in 1972 was almost entirely covered by bare lands heavily dissected by tributaries of wadi alluvium as indicated by the high albedo tracks on the landsat mss fig 5a in 2018 the land cover has dramatically changed with significant expansion of agricultural and urban activities on the expense of bare lands fig 5b quantitative estimates of the land cover changes in the study area 1053 km2 indicates that the bare areas covered 970 km2 92 of the total area in 1972 compared to 582 km2 55 2 of the total area in 2018 the agricultural area increased from 78 km2 7 4 in 1972 to 440 km2 41 7 in 2018 while the urban areas increased from 6 km2 0 5 in 1972 to 30 5 km2 2 87 in 2018 the period between 1972 and 2018 witnessed a continuous expansion in agricultural and urban areas on bare lands with a significant bound of urban area between 2012 and 2018 which increased from 1 8 to 2 87 of the total area in a short period i e 6 years fig 5c the land use map fig 5d shows that the agricultural development is dependent on both surface and groundwater resources through establishing a network of irrigation canals that receive nile water from the ismailia canal as well as drilling groundwater wells tapping the quaternary and the miocene aquifers the urban activities are associated with the development of numerous industrial zones and wastewater treatment plants fig 5d these significant changes in the land cover of the study area are expected to affect the groundwater quality and probably flow mixing dynamics particularly under such unconfined conditions and shallow groundwater table 4 2 surface hydrology and rainfall estimates analysis of the srtm derived dem and its derivatives e g shaded relief and drainage networks indicates that the tenth of ramadan city and the surrounding agricultural zones are located within the lower reach of two major catchment areas namely the wadi el gafra and the wadi el watan basins fig 6 these basins drain the eastern desert carbonate plateau in the south and debouch northward towards the nile delta depression superimposing the geological structures e g faults and anticlines from previous studies el diary 1980 henaish 2018 demonstrates a significant structural control on the two catchment areas where nw se faulted ridges delineate the water divide between the two catchments fig 6 in addition to the nw se trend faults which form a low angle with the general water flow in the two basins the two other fault trends e g nww see and nee sww occur at right angle to the regional water flow fault orientation in respect to the regional gradient is known to control the groundwater dynamics tóth 2009 mohamed et al 2015 where low angle faults facilitate the groundwater flow through high conductive channels along the fault direction while high angle faults may impede the groundwater flow giving rise to a groundwater damming upstream from the fault mohamed et al 2015 abdelmohsen et al 2019 abotalib et al 2019a the gpm data over the two basins fig 7 indicate that the average annual precipitation between 2014 and 2018 ranged between 34 9 and 80 6 mm yr with a significant orographic effect on the precipitation amount where more precipitation occur in higher portion of the catchments in order to estimate the total volume of precipitation and the approximate recharge amount to the aquifer basin scale hydrological parameters are adopted from previous studies on the eastern desert plateau catchments e g el tarfa and el assuiti catchments gheith and sultan 2002 milewski et al 2009 fig 1a where annual transmission losses ranged between 17 8 and 21 8 of the annual precipitations given the similarities in geological climatological and topographic settings between the wadi el gafra and the wadi el watan catchments in one hand and the wadi el tarfa and the wadi el assuiti catchments in the other hand it is plausible to adopt the transmission losses values in the later to provide a quantitative approximation of transmission losses in the former catchments the estimated total volume of precipitation to the selected snap pour points figs 6 7 attains 62 106 m2 and 28 8 106 m2 for the wadi el gafra and the wadi el watan catchments respectively consequently the annual transmission losses can be estimated to range between 11 and 13 5 106 m2 in the wadi el gafra catchment and 5 1 6 2 106 m2 in the wadi el watan catchment these values represent a first order approximation of the annual recharge to the aquifers from precipitation over the two catchments therefore the quaternary and miocene aquifers receive a considerable recharge from rainstorms over the north eastern desert and thus it is necessary to investigate the contribution of modern precipitation to these aquifers from a hydrochemical overview in order to quantify the respective roles of modern precipitation the nile water and anthropogenic induced recharge i e irrigation return water and wastewater from treatment plants within these shallow aquifers and to understand the response of these aquifers to changes in the lclu 4 3 city water balance water balance estimation for the tenth of ramadan city fig 3 shows that the total output of wastewater is about 99 2 mcm y within which about 21 is estimated to be efficiently treated considering the pond s capacity and average wastewater residence time within the oxidation pond system required to ascertain sufficient water treatment i e 28 days this means that 59 of the wastewater exceeds the capacity of the treatment system and hence it is either discharged directly to the alluvium covered rural lands or inefficiently treated by critically decreasing the residence time in the oxidation ponds 4 4 water chemistry as shown in table 1 the water from the ismailia canal and the old nile waters matthess 1982 awad et al 1994 sadek and abd el samie 2001 khalil and hanaa 1984 are generally fresh ec 1 000 µs cm and are enriched with hco3 and ca2 compared to the groundwater from the quaternary aquifer table 1 fig 8 groundwater in the quaternary aquifer showed different water types including 1 ca2 hco3 type samples 29 and 33 fig 8 plotted closer to the old and recent nile waters 2 ca2 na hco3 type samples 27 28 and 58 located within 1 5 km from the ismailia canal fig 2 3 ca2 mg2 cl type samples 8 9 and 12 occur within 4 km from the ismailia canal fig 2 and 4 na cl type which comprises the majority of the samples that are distributed throughout the study area and varied in ec from 1 000 µs cm at the well field area to 6 000 µs cm in the el shabab agricultural area fig 2 higher ec cl and na with depleted hco3 concentrations characterize the groundwater in the miocene aquifer table 1 fig 8 which can be described as a brackish water aquifer conversely wastewater samples are enriched in hco3 compared with the samples from the ismailia canal and groundwater of the miocene and quaternary aquifers the ec ranged from 1 600 µs cm for mixed domestic and industrial wastewater pond 2 to 3 440 µs cm for industrial wastewater pond 3 table 1 dissolved concentrations of nitrogen compounds as no3 and nh4 are shown in table 1 overall the main form of nitrogen compounds present in the groundwater in the miocene and quaternary aquifers was nitrate while ammonia up to 60 mg l was dominant in wastewater the nitrate concentrations of groundwater in the quaternary aquifer varied from less than 1 mg l at the well field area to about 50 mg l at the el shabab agricultural area 4 5 isotope data the relationships between δ2h and δ18o are shown in fig 9 a for groundwater samples collected from the quaternary and miocene aquifers surface water from the ismailia canal and wastewater from the ponds along with the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 and long term weighted mean isotopic composition of modern rainfall 6 33 and 38 75 for δ18o and δ2h respectively based on precipitation data 1987 2003 from cairo station 50 km southwest from the study area fig 1b iaea wmo 2019 for comparison purposes isotope data from previous studies representing the water in the ismailia canal hamza et al 1987 abd el samie et al 2002 freshwater ponds khalil et al 2015 wastewater abd el samie et al 2002 khalil et al 2015 groundwater in the miocene aquifer abd el samie et al 2002 irrigation return water δ18o 5 3 δ2h 39 1 hamza et al 1998 drain water from main drains in the nile delta floodplain ahmed et al 2013 and the old nile water δ18o 0 6 δ2h 4 3 awad et al 1994 are also shown in fig 9a a wide range from 2 41 to 2 71 for δ18o and from 18 to 24 4 for δ2h was observed for groundwater in the quaternary aquifer fig 9a the isotopically heaviest water was located north of the study area nearby the ismailia canal while the isotopically lightest water was found in the southern section near the outlet of the wadi el gafra and the wadi el watan catchments figs 6 7 assuming that samples of the same source sources would be clustered together on the δ2h δ18o plot the grouping of the samples based solely on their position on the plot and accordingly six groups are identified it is worth mentioning that under such conditions of anthropogenic contribution to aquifer recharge and complex mixing of groundwater from different sources the classification of samples based solely on their isotopic composition could be misleading yet can be used for preliminary examination of sample clusters group i represents the groundwater samples from the miocene aquifer which shows depleted isotopic signature less than 4 05 and 29 9 for δ18o and δ2h respectively compared with the groundwater in the quaternary aquifer and reflects the recharge from precipitation over the wadi el gafra and the wadi el watan catchments during both previous wet periods and modern dry periods abotalib et al 2016 artesian upward recharge of the miocene aquifer from the deep nubian aquifer which was recharged during the quaternary pluvial episodes over north africa and is characterized by depleted isotopic composition 10 and 83 for δ18o and δ2h abotalib et al 2019b could also contributed to the depleted isotopic composition of the groundwater in the miocene aquifer however the lack of deep wells and the occurrence of the nubian strata at significant depths in the nile delta fringes 2 km thorweihe 1990 make a thorough examination of this hypothesis out of reach group ii δ18o 2 41 to 2 11 δ2h 18 to 13 1 includes groundwater samples from the quaternary aquifer located south of the tenth of ramadan city near the outlet of the wadi el gafra and the wadi el watan catchments group iii δ18o 1 02 to 0 72 δ2h 9 3 to 2 represents groundwater samples from the quaternary aquifer located in the el shabab agricultural area and near the main stream of the wadi el watan catchment groups ii and iii likely reflect recharge from current rainstorms over the wadi el gafra and the wadi el watan catchments this is evident by the proximity of their isotopic composition to that of the weighted average composition of the modern precipitation fig 9a as well as their occurrence near the outlets i e snap pour point of the wadi el gafra and the wadi el watan catchments figs 6 7 the deviation from the gmwl indicates evaporation before recharge and or mixing with irrigation return water and or wastewater ponds these two groups may also receive contribution from the nile water with different proportions group iv δ18o 1 76 to 0 81 δ2h 6 8 to 0 3 are plotted along the gmwl and represents a mixing trend between modern precipitation and old nile water before the construction of the aswan high dam in 1970 abotalib et al 2016 this group is mainly located in the middle of the study area near the so called well field northwest the tenth of ramadan city fig 2 group v δ18o 0 87 to 0 45 δ2h 1 to 4 represents the groundwater in the quaternary aquifer that chiefly receive recharge from old nile water through the unlined ismailia canal especially before 1970 group vi δ18o 0 04 to 2 71 δ2h 6 4 to 24 4 represents the widest range among all isotopic composition of the analyzed groundwater reflecting a strong evaporation trend and recharge from recent nile waters which are subjected to evaporation in lake nasser after the construction of the aswan high dam as well as recharge from irrigation return water this group also involves water from the ismailia canal and wastewater ponds fig 9a the δ2h δ18o plot also shows two distinctive local evaporation lines lel the first lel 1 δ2h 7 1 δ18o 0 24 extends from the long term weighted mean of modern precipitation through groups i ii and iii towards the drain water in group vi the second lel 2 δ2h 6 5 δ18o 6 4 extends from the old nile water group v towards enriched modern nile water in group vi these lels indicate continuous mixing between original groundwater endmembers e g old nile water and modern precipitation and anthropogenically induced water composition i e mainly through evaporative enrichment through irrigation wastewater treatment and water storage in open lakes and ponds this is also demonstrated by the correlation between the δ18o and d excess values of the analyzed samples fig 9b which indicates widespread values of d excess ranging between 2 06 and 9 81 samples with negative or close to zero d excess values indicate evaporative enrichment either naturally before recharge to the aquifer a phenomenon that is commonly reported in alluvium aquifers in arid hyper arid regions clark 1987 or anthropogenically induced evaporation during storage in lakes ponds and evaporation through soil profile during irrigation three mixing lines can be observed on the d excess δ18o plot fig 9b two mixing lines ml1 and ml2 represent mixing between modern precipitation and evaporative waters ml1 aligns with highly evaporated irrigation return waters while ml2 points to moderately evaporated wastewater the third mixing line represents groundwater mixing between old nile waters and modern evaporated nile water as well as evaporated irrigation return waters the mixing between different groundwaters in the quaternary aquifer which can be seen on the δ2h δ18o and d excess δ18o plots fig 9 a b as well as on the piper graph fig 8 complicate the characterization of groundwater endmembers solely based on their isotopic composition and hence necessitate the application of more sophisticated methods to identify groundwater sources in the aquifer in the next section we integrate the chemical and isotopic characteristics of the groundwater in the quaternary aquifer in multivariate analysis to examine whether it is possible to gain more insights on the mixing process 4 6 multivariate analysis 4 6 1 hierarchical cluster analysis hca four major clusters were identified from hca more than half 59 of the samples were classified to cluster 1 which was further subdivided into four subclusters as presented in fig 10 a generally clusters 1 and 2 were represented by low ec low dissolved solute concentrations and enriched stable isotopic composition compared with clusters 3 and 4 table 2 however some subclusters i e subclusters 1 3 and 1 4 show quite depleted isotopic composition but also are characterized with low concentrations of major ions table 2 locations of all the sampling sites according to their corresponding clusters are shown in fig 10b the clusters 1 and 2 are mainly found in the northern part of the study area while clusters 3 and 4 are mostly distributed in the southern part and in the el shabab area respectively fig 10b 4 6 2 principal component analysis pca two pcs with eigenvalues larger than one accounted for 82 2 of the total variance in the data as shown in table 3 the pc1 represents the largest proportion 56 4 of the total variance within the dataset it is associated with strong positive weightings of ec na so4 2 cl ca2 and mg2 and negative weightings of hco3 the pc2 which explains 25 8 of the total variance within the dataset exhibits strong positive weightings of δ18o and δ2h moderate positive weighting of hco3 and negative weightings for cl fig 11 shows the scores of the groundwater samples from the quaternary aquifer and other water groups on pca space pc1 vs pc2 the four clusters of the groundwater in the quaternary aquifer occupy different areas in the pca space fig 11 most of the samples assigned to clusters 1 and 2 showed negative pc1 scores and were plotted nearby the water samples from the ismailia canal and the old nile water in pca space fig 11 with respect to the pc2 cluster 1 samples were close to zero while cluster 2 samples and the ismailia canal water showed positive values fig 11 on the other hand samples in clusters 3 and 4 are characterized by positive pc1 and pc2 scores 4 7 groundwater sources and mixing processes the positions of the four clusters in hca and pca diagrams figs 10a 11 demonstrate that the groundwater in the quaternary aquifer are mainly attributed to three major groups 1 the modern precipitation group in the southern portion of the study area as represented by miocene groundwater and cluster 3 11 13 5 106 m2 yr in the wadi el gafra catchment 2 the old nile water which are represented by subcluster 1 1 and 3 modern nile water from the ismailia canal which is represented by cluster 2 the remaining clusters likely represent mixing between one or more of the abovementioned water groups with the newly introduced sources of water in the area e g irrigation return water and wastewater samples from subcluster 1 3 are more depleted in δ18o and δ2h values fig 9a table 2 and show most negative scores on pc1 and rather negative scores on pc2 among the cluster 1 samples occupying the lower left edge of the distribution of the plots in pca space fig 11 subcluster 1 3 samples are also plotted at the apex of the data distribution in δ18o δ2h diagram fig 9a and occupy the well field area northwest the tenth of ramdan city fig 10b an intermediate area between the southern domain predominated by modern precipitation waters and the northern zone predominated by old nile waters these aspects suggest that subcluster 1 3 is a mixture between old nile waters subcluster 1 1 and modern precipitation water cluster 3 cluster 4 samples are shifted to the heavier δ18o in δ18o δ2h diagram fig 9a and to higher positive pc2 scores fig 11 because the cluster 4 samples showed the highest concentration in no3 up to 50 mg l tables 1 2 it appears to be influenced by water from anthropogenic activities such as returned irrigation water and or wastewater nitrate polluted groundwater in cluster 4 e g sample nos 39 40 and 43 are located in the vicinity of the unlined wastewater ponds fig 2 which show high values of ammonia concentration 60 mg l at pond 3 table 1 considering that the volume of wastewater discharge exceeds the operational capacity of unlined wastewater ponds fig 3 and the occurrence of overflow of the final effluent it is likely that wastewater is infiltrated into the subsurface and recharge the aquifer in el shabab area fig 2 10b the possibility of downward infiltration of the wastewater to the aquifer is further revealed by the discontinuous nature of clay layers in the subsurface as inferred from the geoelectric surveys attwa et al 2014b massoud et al 2016 therefore samples in cluster 4 represents a mixing between modern precipitation water over the wadi el watan catchment 5 1 6 2 106 m2 yr irrigation return water and wastewater considering the average hydraulic conductivity 40 m day abd el samie et al 2002 effective porosity 0 15 el arabi 1997 and hydraulic gradient 0 004 abd el samie et al 2002 in the quaternary aquifer the estimated average flow velocity is estimated as 1 07 m day therefore the wastewater can roughly reach a radial distance of 16 km from the oxidation ponds since the pond s construction in 1980 chemical characteristics of subcluster 1 2 and 1 4 samples table 2 and their position in the pca space fig 11 suggest that these subclusters are mixed groundwater between more than two endmembers unlike the other clusters subclusters 1 2 and 1 4 show a sparse spatial distribution in the study area fig 10b and hence it is difficult to relate these subclusters to specific groundwater endmembers however one would lump the two subclusters to one group affected by three endmembers namely the old nile water the modern nile water and the modern precipitation given that subcluster 1 2 is closer to the old nile water endmember subcluster 1 1 on the pca plot fig 11 this might indicate that the old nile water contribution to the clusters is greater than the contribution of the other two endmembers it is worthy to mention that due to the absence of baseline chemical and isotopic data for the quaternary aquifer before the anthropogenic recharge a clear definition of thethe certainty of the estimatingchemical facies and isotopic end members can be problematic the construction of a contaminant transport model e g pb can provide a useful tool to address the uncertainty of determining chemical facies and isotopic endmembers the application of multivariate analysis in an integrated way with remote sensing spatial analysis chemical and isotopic data provides more insight in the assessment of water sources and mixing processes in such area affected by significant lclu changes under arid hyper arid conditions the better understanding of the water sources and mixing patterns could help to assess water contamination sources in the study area and in similar areas occupied by shallow alluvial aquifers in arid hyper arid environments which are particularly vulnerable to contamination additionally the mixing dynamics induced by anthropogenic activities in the quaternary aquifer such as the upconing of high salinity miocene water by overexploitation and the infiltration of wastewater and irrigation return would impact the soil moisture and salinity in the root zone resulting in severe degradation in soil fertility and crop production with the current and forecasted increase in aquifers depletion across many countries in the mena region mazzoni et al 2018 our results here in suggest that effective water resources management plans need to be considered to avoid irreversible degradation of soil quality and that will result in a reduction of the crop production radar sensing observations using polarimetric l band synthetic aperture radar methods should be able to map the above described changes in soil moisture and salinity at the fine scale of the observed changes in the lclu zones kim et al 2017 such correlation between soil properties and groundwater mixing can provide an ultimate tool to map these changes in aquifers properties on large scale and monitor their evolution 5 conclusions an integrated remote sensing spatial analysis water chemistry environmental isotope data and msa approach was applied to resolve the impact of lclu changes on groundwater mixing in alluvial aquifers under arid hyper arid conditions the case study included the shallow alluvial aquifer southeast of the nile delta an area that witnesses dynamic lclu changes lclu analysis indicated that agricultural and urban areas increased from 84 km2 to 470 5 km2 between 1972 and 2018 on the expense of bare lands basin scale hydrological analyses showed that the quaternary alluvial aquifer receives an annual recharge of 11 13 5 106 m2 and 5 1 6 2 106 m2 in the wadi el gafra and wadi el watan catchments respectively three original water sources and three groups of mixed waters were defined the original water sources include 1 the modern precipitation water as represented by miocene groundwater and cluster 3 2 the old nile water represented by subcluster 1 1 and 3 modern nile water from the ismailia canal which is represented by cluster 2 the three mixing groups include 1 a mixture of modern precipitation wastewater and irrigation return cluster 4 2 a mixture of old nile waters and modern precipitation subcluster 1 3 and 3 a mixture of more than two sources subclusters 1 2 and 1 4 the better understanding of water sources and their mixing patterns especially in shallow alluvial aquifers under arid hyper arid conditions could help to assess soil and water contamination sources and accordingly provide useful information for the effective water resources management soil

4496,the impact of land cover land use lclu changes on surface runoff and groundwater contamination have been widely investigated yet their impact on groundwater mixing is still poorly understood the stress on resources in the nile delta triggered a vast migration of urban agricultural and industrial activities to its desert fringes exposing the quaternary alluvial aquifers to contamination and introducing new sources of recharge here we integrated remote sensing chemical and isotopic data with multivariate statistical analysis to identify groundwater sources and the mixing dynamics in response to lclu changes lclu analysis indicated an increase of agricultural and urban areas from 84 km2 to 470 5 km2 between 1972 and 2018 these changes introduced new recharge sources including wastewater and irrigation return three major water sources were defined including 1 modern precipitation cluster 3 and miocene aquifer δ18o 4 59 to 0 47 and δ2h 34 4 to 3 1 with an estimated annual recharge of 11 13 5 106 m2 and 5 1 6 2 106 m2 for el gafra and el watan catchments respectively 2 old nile water subcluster 1 1 δ18o 0 87 to 0 53 and δ2h 1 to 3 7 and 3 modern nile water cluster 2 δ18o 0 49 to 2 71 and δ2h 10 5 to 24 4 moreover three mixed groups were defined including 1 a mixture of modern precipitation wastewater and irrigation return cluster 4 δ18o 1 02 to 0 37 and δ2h 9 3 to 6 4 2 a mixture of old nile waters and modern precipitation subcluster 1 3 δ18o 1 74 to 1 38 and δ2h 6 8 to 2 3 and 3 a mixture of more than two sources with wide ranges of isotopic and chemical compositions subclusters 1 2 and 1 4 these findings provide a good basis for further studies of groundwater mixing and assessment of contamination sources in shallow aquifers stressed by lclu changes

recharge 2 site description 2 1 geographical setting the study area is located at the desert fringe of the southeast nile delta northeast of cairo fig 1 a b it covers an area of about 1000 km2 the topography varies from relatively steep slopes of 600 m above mean sea level amsl in the south and southwest to almost flat land of less than 8 m amsl near the ismailia canal fig 1c the study area includes the tenth of ramadan city 100 km2 in area with numerous industrial and urban settlements as well as intensive agricultural projects i e el adlia el mullak ramsis and el shabab fig 2 arid to hyper arid climate of hot dry summers and cold winters with occasional showers prevail the study area ema 1996 the mean annual rainfall is less than 50 mm and the potential annual evaporation often exceeds 2 500 mm abu zeid 1995 hassan 2013 2 2 geological setting the quaternary sediments have a great surface extension and unconformably overlie the eocene to pliocene units fig 1b holocene sediments consist of alluvium deposits nile silt fine sand and clay along the course of the ismailia canal with less than 5 m thick klitszch et al 1987 pleistocene sediments which have a maximum thickness of 250 m include two units early and late pleistocene with discontinuous clay and or sandy clay layers of variable thicknesses in between el shazly et al 1975 fig 1c the early pleistocene unit is composed of old deltaic deposits including sand and gravel with occasional clay lenses while the late pleistocene unit consists of fine to medium sands of fluvial and or fluviomarine origin el shazly et al 1975 the pliocene sediments along cairo ismailia and cairo suez roads consist of cross bedded sand and gravel with clay intercalations indicating fresh water estuarine and partly very shallow marine environments said 1990 the miocene strata are made up of sandy limestones and sandy marls of shallow marine origin with variable intercalations of clays sands and sandstones el shazly et al 1975 and are distributed in the southern and southwestern high slopes the oligocene rocks expose along cairo suez road and are distinguished into the gebel ahmer formation of medium to coarse grained well sorted unstratified sands with intercalations of sandstone beds and the overlying basaltic sheets said 1962 the eocene rocks of the mokattam group which consist of dense limestone with chert bands expose in the southernmost section of the study area and represent the oldest rock exposures fig 1b 2 3 hydrological setting 2 3 1 surface hydrology the ismailia canal the main surface water feature in the study area was constructed in 1862 for the water supply in the area between cairo and ismailia fig 1b much of the canal s course was dug through sandy strata without bottom and sides lining or sealing to keep the water seepage or leaking at a minimum consequently the unsealed sandy bottom and sides have contributed to the relatively high water table in the adjacent land abu zeid 1983 attempts to increase the canal s water discharge from 135 m3 s to 440 m3 s were completed through three stages to serve the irrigation expansion projects in newly irrigated areas african water facility 2007 stahl and ramadan 2008 total seepage rate increased from 17 0 m3 s to 22 4 m3 s after the completion of the second stage expansion abu zeid 1983 lately a number of lined branches e g el shabab and el mullak canals were diverted from the ismailia canal the excess of water discharge over the capacity of water purification stations resulted in the formation of unlined freshwater ponds that were mostly used for agricultural practices khalil et al 2015 treated and untreated wastewater from domestic and industrial activities were disposed into unlined ponds and ditched to the east of the tenth of ramadan city for storing and evaporating the excess water fig 2 2 3 2 groundwater system the pleistocene alluvium deposits host the main aquifer in the study area namely the quaternary aquifer the aquifer is considered as an unconfined extension of the nile aquifer system and consists of two hydraulically connected water bearing units fig 1c el shazly et al 1975 the total saturated thickness of the quaternary aquifer increases from south to north and northwest i e toward the ismailia canal and attains 250 m thick in the north el shazly et al 1975 in the vicinity of the ismailia canal the aquifer is directly connected with the nile water and the depth to the water level is less than 7 m near the canal while increases southward up to 73 m and 67 5 m at the east and north of the tenth of ramadan city respectively el shahat et al 2014 el sayed 2018 thus the main recharge to the quaternary aquifer occurs through seepage from the ismailia canal occasional rainstorms along the southern parts of the study area in addition to percolation of excess irrigation water abd el samie et al 2002 khalil et al 2015 el sayed 2018 depending on pumping tests data porosities of the quaternary aquifer in the study area and its surroundings ranges from 29 to 41 with an average effective porosity of 0 15 el arabi 1997 while the hydraulic conductivity of the quaternary aquifer ranged from 1 9 to 92 5 m day attwa et al 2014a el sayed 2018 with an average of 40 m day abd el samie et al 2002 abstraction of groundwater from the well field northwest of the tenth of ramadan city for public and industrial use has reached 60 000 m3 day in 2004 shedid 2005 in addition many private water supply wells have been drilled primarily for irrigation purposes in the eastern and western parts of the study area the quaternary aquifer is bounded from the bottom south and southwest by the miocene aquifer the miocene aquifer is either unconfined or semi confined depending on the occurrence of clay intercalations gomaa et al 2003 the depth to water varies from 160 m to 240 m along the cairo ismailia desert road the miocene aquifer is characterized by brackish water with tds values range from 2034 to 5934 al gamal et al 2011 from the pumping tests data the average effective porosity was 11 and the hydraulic conductivity ranged from 0 072 to 1 63 m day al gamal et al 2011 attwa et al 2014a the sources of recharge to the miocene aquifer include precipitation during the past wet periods occasional storm events under current conditions and to a lesser extent from current irrigation activities el shazly et al 1975 gomaa et al 2003 regional groundwater flow in the quaternary aquifer is from northwest to southeast along the ismailia canal as well as from south to north while groundwater in this the miocene aquifer flows from south and southwest to north and northwest fig 2 al gamal et al 2011 el sayed 2018 3 methodology 3 1 remote sensing and landcover land use maps

areas scale 1 500 000 klitszch et al 1987 were assembled in a single mosaic covering the study area then the created mosaic was digitized to determine the lithological units in the study area 3 land use map of the study area provided by the tenth of ramadan government office which were digitized and then used to identify the different land use activities 4 four land cover lc maps representing the

1992 and 2018 these datasets are available from the european space agency climate change initiative esa cci website3 with a 300 spatial resolution the esa cci maps show 37 different land cover classes on a global scale hegazy et al 2020 these maps were validated by ground trothing and visual comparison to predecessor land cover datasets e g globcover 2009 ucl geomatics 2017 3 2 estimation of total volume of precipitation and transmission losses a snap pour point for each catchment was delineated that represents the outlet of the basin before it debouches into the wide plain adjacent to the nile delta depression and adjacent to the sampling locations the upstream contributing area to each snap pour point was estimated using flow accumulation algorithms tarboton 1997 the total volume of precipitation over the two catchments was estimated using the following equation 1 v m 3 a m 2 p m where a is the upslope contributing area and p is the average annual precipitation the soil and water assessment tool swat model outputs of transmission losses values of the eastern desert of egypt catchments milewski et al 2009 which were also adopted in this study were evaluated through applying sensitivity analysis and were calibrated against measured runoff values from wadi girafi watershed in sinai milewski et al 2009 3 3 city water balance estimation the water budget for the tenth of ramadan city fig 3 was estimated based on the 2007 census data gopp and jica 2008 and other data geirnaert and laeven 1992 cadsac unpublished data 1994 abd el samie et al 2002 shedid 2005 water supply is mainly secured from the ismailia canal providing the city with roughly 184 4 million cubic meters per year mcm y gopp and jica 2008 about 67 of this input is directed to residential and industrial premises where about 20 is estimated to be consumed gopp and jica 2008 however other studies reported much higher loses 40 to 50 from water mains and sewers due to poor maintenance and rehabilitation attia 1999 our estimations only considered the updated 20 losses after gopp and jica 2008 moreover the water loss by evaporation was estimated based on the isotope data of inflow and outflow of water to the oxidation ponds abd el samie et al 2002 3 4 sampling and analytical techniques to identify potential end members of water in the quaternary aquifer groundwater samples were selected to represent the aquifer s extension i e from extreme south contact with the groundwater in the miocene aquifer to the north boundary with the surface water from the ismailia canal fig 1b 2 as well as sampling from different land use units fig 2 information on the well depths table 1 was acquired through available well logs at the well field area and by personal communication with the well owners in locations where records on the well depth were lacking comparing such information confirmed that samples were collected from the same aquifer unit the total number of collected water samples is 80 including 69 samples from the quaternary aquifer five samples from the miocene aquifer three samples from wastewater ponds and one sample from the ismailia canal fig 2 table 1 groundwater samples were collected from active municipal and private water supply boreholes after purging the wells for 15 to 20 min electrical conductivity ec ph and temperature t were measured using portable horiba probes d 55 and d 54 models sampling was initiated once measured values mentioned above were stabilized sampled waters were filtered through 0 45 µm membrane filters and collected in two 50 ml washed polyethylene bottles for major ion analyses samples for cation analysis were preserved with a few drops of hno3 immediately after sampling unfiltered samples were stored in 50 ml polyethylene bottles with poly seal caps for stable isotope 18o and 2h analysis alkalinity was determined in the field by titration with h2so4 using a hach digital titrator model 16900 spectrophotometric analyses were performed in the field for measuring nh4 and no3 using a hach dr 890 spectrophotometer the precision was determined by replicating the analysis for six samples and calculating the relative standard deviation 2 7 major cations ca2 mg2 na and k and anions cl and so4 2 were analyzed according to the usepa method 300 1 us environmental protection agency 1997 using a dionex ion chromatograph model dx

according to cloutier et al 2008 helsel 2010 and doe 2012 samples with missing data values i e nos 6 7 23 29 and 33 were also not included in the multivariate analysis finally the dataset used in this approach constitutes a data matrix of 79 sampling points by nine variables including ec ca2 mg2 na cl so4 2 hco3 δ18o and δ2h the common kaiser meyer olkin kmo test 0 76 and bartlett s test significance level 0 05 confirmed that pca can be applied on the dataset the raw data were used for pca because the correlation matrix has the effect of standardizing the data doe 2012 while it was standardized for hca the standardized data are obtained by subtracting the mean of the distribution and dividing by the standard deviation of the distribution davis 1986 for pca an estimation technique based on the spearman rank based correlation matrix was used because it is less sensitive to extreme values outliers than the more commonly applied pearson correlation matrix doe 2012 a common criterion kaiser normalization for determining the number of principal components called pcs to consider for further analysis is those having an eigenvalue greater than one kaiser 1960 the varimax rotation was also applied for reducing the overlap between original variables and maximize the variance in each principal component davis 1986 the ward linkage method and squared euclidean distance measurement were considered for the hca as they are effective in cluster determination in water studies güler et al 2002 pca and hca were conducted using xlstat version 2015 4 01 20780 4 results and discussions 4 1 land cover land use changes the visual inspection of the multi temporal satellite data e g landsat mss 1972 and landsat 8 2018 fig 5 a b indicates that the area has been subjected to intensive land cover changes except for a narrow vegetated belt along the ismailia canal the area in 1972 was almost entirely covered by bare lands heavily dissected by tributaries of wadi alluvium as indicated by the high albedo tracks on the landsat mss fig 5a in 2018 the land cover has dramatically changed with significant expansion of agricultural and urban activities on the expense of bare lands fig 5b quantitative estimates of the land cover changes in the study area 1053 km2 indicates that the bare areas covered 970 km2 92 of the total area in 1972 compared to 582 km2 55 2 of the total area in 2018 the agricultural area increased from 78 km2 7 4 in 1972 to 440 km2 41 7 in 2018 while the urban areas increased from 6 km2 0 5 in 1972 to 30 5 km2 2 87 in 2018 the period between 1972 and 2018 witnessed a continuous expansion in agricultural and urban areas on bare lands with a significant bound of urban area between 2012 and 2018 which increased from 1 8 to 2 87 of the total area in a short period i e 6 years fig 5c the land use map fig 5d shows that the agricultural development is dependent on both surface and groundwater resources through establishing a network of irrigation canals that receive nile water from the ismailia canal as well as drilling groundwater wells tapping the quaternary and the miocene aquifers the urban activities are associated with the development of numerous industrial zones and wastewater treatment plants fig 5d these significant changes in the land cover of the study area are expected to affect the groundwater quality and probably flow mixing dynamics particularly under such unconfined conditions and shallow groundwater table 4 2 surface hydrology and rainfall estimates analysis of the srtm derived dem and its derivatives e g shaded relief and drainage networks indicates that the tenth of ramadan city and the surrounding agricultural zones are located within the lower reach of two major catchment areas namely the wadi el gafra and the wadi el watan basins fig 6 these basins drain the eastern desert carbonate plateau in the south and debouch northward towards the nile delta depression superimposing the geological structures e g faults and anticlines from previous studies el diary 1980 henaish 2018 demonstrates a significant structural control on the two catchment areas where nw se faulted ridges delineate the water divide between the two catchments fig 6 in addition to the nw se trend faults which form a low angle with the general water flow in the two basins the two other fault trends e g nww see and nee sww occur at right angle to the regional water flow fault orientation in respect to the regional gradient is known to control the groundwater dynamics tóth 2009 mohamed et al 2015 where low angle faults facilitate the groundwater flow through high conductive channels along the fault direction while high angle faults may impede the groundwater flow giving rise to a groundwater damming upstream from the fault mohamed et al 2015 abdelmohsen et al 2019 abotalib et al 2019a the gpm data over the two basins fig 7 indicate that the average annual precipitation between 2014 and 2018 ranged between 34 9 and 80 6 mm yr with a significant orographic effect on the precipitation amount where more precipitation occur in higher portion of the catchments in order to estimate the total volume of precipitation and the approximate recharge amount to the aquifer basin scale hydrological parameters are adopted from previous studies on the eastern desert plateau catchments e g el tarfa and el assuiti catchments gheith and sultan 2002 milewski et al 2009 fig 1a where annual transmission losses ranged between 17 8 and 21 8 of the annual precipitations given the similarities in geological climatological and topographic settings between the wadi el gafra and the wadi el watan catchments in one hand and the wadi el tarfa and the wadi el assuiti catchments in the other hand it is plausible to adopt the transmission losses values in the later to provide a quantitative approximation of transmission losses in the former catchments the estimated total volume of precipitation to the selected snap pour points figs 6 7 attains 62 106 m2 and 28 8 106 m2 for the wadi el gafra and the wadi el watan catchments respectively consequently the annual transmission losses can be estimated to range between 11 and 13 5 106 m2 in the wadi el gafra catchment and 5 1 6 2 106 m2 in the wadi el watan catchment these values represent a first order approximation of the annual recharge to the aquifers from precipitation over the two catchments therefore the quaternary and miocene aquifers receive a considerable recharge from rainstorms over the north eastern desert and thus it is necessary to investigate the contribution of modern precipitation to these aquifers from a hydrochemical overview in order to quantify the respective roles of modern precipitation the nile water and anthropogenic induced recharge i e irrigation return water and wastewater from treatment plants within these shallow aquifers and to understand the response of these aquifers to changes in the lclu 4 3 city water balance water balance estimation for the tenth of ramadan city fig 3 shows that the total output of wastewater is about 99 2 mcm y within which about 21 is estimated to be efficiently treated considering the pond s capacity and average wastewater residence time within the oxidation pond system required to ascertain sufficient water treatment i e 28 days this means that 59 of the wastewater exceeds the capacity of the treatment system and hence it is either discharged directly to the alluvium covered rural lands or inefficiently treated by critically decreasing the residence time in the oxidation ponds 4 4 water chemistry as shown in table 1 the water from the ismailia canal and the old nile waters matthess 1982 awad et al 1994 sadek and abd el samie 2001 khalil and hanaa 1984 are generally fresh ec 1 000 µs cm and are enriched with hco3 and ca2 compared to the groundwater from the quaternary aquifer table 1 fig 8 groundwater in the quaternary aquifer showed different water types including 1 ca2 hco3 type samples 29 and 33 fig 8 plotted closer to the old and recent nile waters 2 ca2 na hco3 type samples 27 28 and 58 located within 1 5 km from the ismailia canal fig 2 3 ca2 mg2 cl type samples 8 9 and 12 occur within 4 km from the ismailia canal fig 2 and 4 na cl type which comprises the majority of the samples that are distributed throughout the study area and varied in ec from 1 000 µs cm at the well field area to 6 000 µs cm in the el shabab agricultural area fig 2 higher ec cl and na with depleted hco3 concentrations characterize the groundwater in the miocene aquifer table 1 fig 8 which can be described as a brackish water aquifer conversely wastewater samples are enriched in hco3 compared with the samples from the ismailia canal and groundwater of the miocene and quaternary aquifers the ec ranged from 1 600 µs cm for mixed domestic and industrial wastewater pond 2 to 3 440 µs cm for industrial wastewater pond 3 table 1 dissolved concentrations of nitrogen compounds as no3 and nh4 are shown in table 1 overall the main form of nitrogen compounds present in the groundwater in the miocene and quaternary aquifers was nitrate while ammonia up to 60 mg l was dominant in wastewater the nitrate concentrations of groundwater in the quaternary aquifer varied from less than 1 mg l at the well field area to about 50 mg l at the el shabab agricultural area 4 5 isotope data the relationships between δ2h and δ18o are shown in fig 9 a for groundwater samples collected from the quaternary and miocene aquifers surface water from the ismailia canal and wastewater from the ponds along with the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 and long term weighted mean isotopic composition of modern rainfall 6 33 and 38 75 for δ18o and δ2h respectively based on precipitation data 1987 2003 from cairo station 50 km southwest from the study area fig 1b iaea wmo 2019 for comparison purposes isotope data from previous studies representing the water in the ismailia canal hamza et al 1987 abd el samie et al 2002 freshwater ponds khalil et al 2015 wastewater abd el samie et al 2002 khalil et al 2015 groundwater in the miocene aquifer abd el samie et al 2002 irrigation return water δ18o 5 3 δ2h 39 1 hamza et al 1998 drain water from main drains in the nile delta floodplain ahmed et al 2013 and the old nile water δ18o 0 6 δ2h 4 3 awad et al 1994 are also shown in fig 9a a wide range from 2 41 to 2 71 for δ18o and from 18 to 24 4 for δ2h was observed for groundwater in the quaternary aquifer fig 9a the isotopically heaviest water was located north of the study area nearby the ismailia canal while the isotopically lightest water was found in the southern section near the outlet of the wadi el gafra and the wadi el watan catchments figs 6 7 assuming that samples of the same source sources would be clustered together on the δ2h δ18o plot the grouping of the samples based solely on their position on the plot and accordingly six groups are identified it is worth mentioning that under such conditions of anthropogenic contribution to aquifer recharge and complex mixing of groundwater from different sources the classification of samples based solely on their isotopic composition could be misleading yet can be used for preliminary examination of sample clusters group i represents the groundwater samples from the miocene aquifer which shows depleted isotopic signature less than 4 05 and 29 9 for δ18o and δ2h respectively compared with the groundwater in the quaternary aquifer and reflects the recharge from precipitation over the wadi el gafra and the wadi el watan catchments during both previous wet periods and modern dry periods abotalib et al 2016 artesian upward recharge of the miocene aquifer from the deep nubian aquifer which was recharged during the quaternary pluvial episodes over north africa and is characterized by depleted isotopic composition 10 and 83 for δ18o and δ2h abotalib et al 2019b could also contributed to the depleted isotopic composition of the groundwater in the miocene aquifer however the lack of deep wells and the occurrence of the nubian strata at significant depths in the nile delta fringes 2 km thorweihe 1990 make a thorough examination of this hypothesis out of reach group ii δ18o 2 41 to 2 11 δ2h 18 to 13 1 includes groundwater samples from the quaternary aquifer located south of the tenth of ramadan city near the outlet of the wadi el gafra and the wadi el watan catchments group iii δ18o 1 02 to 0 72 δ2h 9 3 to 2 represents groundwater samples from the quaternary aquifer located in the el shabab agricultural area and near the main stream of the wadi el watan catchment groups ii and iii likely reflect recharge from current rainstorms over the wadi el gafra and the wadi el watan catchments this is evident by the proximity of their isotopic composition to that of the weighted average composition of the modern precipitation fig 9a as well as their occurrence near the outlets i e snap pour point of the wadi el gafra and the wadi el watan catchments figs 6 7 the deviation from the gmwl indicates evaporation before recharge and or mixing with irrigation return water and or wastewater ponds these two groups may also receive contribution from the nile water with different proportions group iv δ18o 1 76 to 0 81 δ2h 6 8 to 0 3 are plotted along the gmwl and represents a mixing trend between modern precipitation and old nile water before the construction of the aswan high dam in 1970 abotalib et al 2016 this group is mainly located in the middle of the study area near the so called well field northwest the tenth of ramadan city fig 2 group v δ18o 0 87 to 0 45 δ2h 1 to 4 represents the groundwater in the quaternary aquifer that chiefly receive recharge from old nile water through the unlined ismailia canal especially before 1970 group vi δ18o 0 04 to 2 71 δ2h 6 4 to 24 4 represents the widest range among all isotopic composition of the analyzed groundwater reflecting a strong evaporation trend and recharge from recent nile waters which are subjected to evaporation in lake nasser after the construction of the aswan high dam as well as recharge from irrigation return water this group also involves water from the ismailia canal and wastewater ponds fig 9a the δ2h δ18o plot also shows two distinctive local evaporation lines lel the first lel 1 δ2h 7 1 δ18o 0 24 extends from the long term weighted mean of modern precipitation through groups i ii and iii towards the drain water in group vi the second lel 2 δ2h 6 5 δ18o 6 4 extends from the old nile water group v towards enriched modern nile water in group vi these lels indicate continuous mixing between original groundwater endmembers e g old nile water and modern precipitation and anthropogenically induced water composition i e mainly through evaporative enrichment through irrigation wastewater treatment and water storage in open lakes and ponds this is also demonstrated by the correlation between the δ18o and d excess values of the analyzed samples fig 9b which indicates widespread values of d excess ranging between 2 06 and 9 81 samples with negative or close to zero d excess values indicate evaporative enrichment either naturally before recharge to the aquifer a phenomenon that is commonly reported in alluvium aquifers in arid hyper arid regions clark 1987 or anthropogenically induced evaporation during storage in lakes ponds and evaporation through soil profile during irrigation three mixing lines can be observed on the d excess δ18o plot fig 9b two mixing lines ml1 and ml2 represent mixing between modern precipitation and evaporative waters ml1 aligns with highly evaporated irrigation return waters while ml2 points to moderately evaporated wastewater the third mixing line represents groundwater mixing between old nile waters and modern evaporated nile water as well as evaporated irrigation return waters the mixing between different groundwaters in the quaternary aquifer which can be seen on the δ2h δ18o and d excess δ18o plots fig 9 a b as well as on the piper graph fig 8 complicate the characterization of groundwater endmembers solely based on their isotopic composition and hence necessitate the application of more sophisticated methods to identify groundwater sources in the aquifer in the next section we integrate the chemical and isotopic characteristics of the groundwater in the quaternary aquifer in multivariate analysis to examine whether it is possible to gain more insights on the mixing process 4 6 multivariate analysis 4 6 1 hierarchical cluster analysis hca four major clusters were identified from hca more than half 59 of the samples were classified to cluster 1 which was further subdivided into four subclusters as presented in fig 10 a generally clusters 1 and 2 were represented by low ec low dissolved solute concentrations and enriched stable isotopic composition compared with clusters 3 and 4 table 2 however some subclusters i e subclusters 1 3 and 1 4 show quite depleted isotopic composition but also are characterized with low concentrations of major ions table 2 locations of all the sampling sites according to their corresponding clusters are shown in fig 10b the clusters 1 and 2 are mainly found in the northern part of the study area while clusters 3 and 4 are mostly distributed in the southern part and in the el shabab area respectively fig 10b 4 6 2 principal component analysis pca two pcs with eigenvalues larger than one accounted for 82 2 of the total variance in the data as shown in table 3 the pc1 represents the largest proportion 56 4 of the total variance within the dataset it is associated with strong positive weightings of ec na so4 2 cl ca2 and mg2 and negative weightings of hco3 the pc2 which explains 25 8 of the total variance within the dataset exhibits strong positive weightings of δ18o and δ2h moderate positive weighting of hco3 and negative weightings for cl fig 11 shows the scores of the groundwater samples from the quaternary aquifer and other water groups on pca space pc1 vs pc2 the four clusters of the groundwater in the quaternary aquifer occupy different areas in the pca space fig 11 most of the samples assigned to clusters 1 and 2 showed negative pc1 scores and were plotted nearby the water samples from the ismailia canal and the old nile water in pca space fig 11 with respect to the pc2 cluster 1 samples were close to zero while cluster 2 samples and the ismailia canal water showed positive values fig 11 on the other hand samples in clusters 3 and 4 are characterized by positive pc1 and pc2 scores 4 7 groundwater sources and mixing processes the positions of the four clusters in hca and pca diagrams figs 10a 11 demonstrate that the groundwater in the quaternary aquifer are mainly attributed to three major groups 1 the modern precipitation group in the southern portion of the study area as represented by miocene groundwater and cluster 3 11 13 5 106 m2 yr in the wadi el gafra catchment 2 the old nile water which are represented by subcluster 1 1 and 3 modern nile water from the ismailia canal which is represented by cluster 2 the remaining clusters likely represent mixing between one or more of the abovementioned water groups with the newly introduced sources of water in the area e g irrigation return water and wastewater samples from subcluster 1 3 are more depleted in δ18o and δ2h values fig 9a table 2 and show most negative scores on pc1 and rather negative scores on pc2 among the cluster 1 samples occupying the lower left edge of the distribution of the plots in pca space fig 11 subcluster 1 3 samples are also plotted at the apex of the data distribution in δ18o δ2h diagram fig 9a and occupy the well field area northwest the tenth of ramdan city fig 10b an intermediate area between the southern domain predominated by modern precipitation waters and the northern zone predominated by old nile waters these aspects suggest that subcluster 1 3 is a mixture between old nile waters subcluster 1 1 and modern precipitation water cluster 3 cluster 4 samples are shifted to the heavier δ18o in δ18o δ2h diagram fig 9a and to higher positive pc2 scores fig 11 because the cluster 4 samples showed the highest concentration in no3 up to 50 mg l tables 1 2 it appears to be influenced by water from anthropogenic activities such as returned irrigation water and or wastewater nitrate polluted groundwater in cluster 4 e g sample nos 39 40 and 43 are located in the vicinity of the unlined wastewater ponds fig 2 which show high values of ammonia concentration 60 mg l at pond 3 table 1 considering that the volume of wastewater discharge exceeds the operational capacity of unlined wastewater ponds fig 3 and the occurrence of overflow of the final effluent it is likely that wastewater is infiltrated into the subsurface and recharge the aquifer in el shabab area fig 2 10b the possibility of downward infiltration of the wastewater to the aquifer is further revealed by the discontinuous nature of clay layers in the subsurface as inferred from the geoelectric surveys attwa et al 2014b massoud et al 2016 therefore samples in cluster 4 represents a mixing between modern precipitation water over the wadi el watan catchment 5 1 6 2 106 m2 yr irrigation return water and wastewater considering the average hydraulic conductivity 40 m day abd el samie et al 2002 effective porosity 0 15 el arabi 1997 and hydraulic gradient 0 004 abd el samie et al 2002 in the quaternary aquifer the estimated average flow velocity is estimated as 1 07 m day therefore the wastewater can roughly reach a radial distance of 16 km from the oxidation ponds since the pond s construction in 1980 chemical characteristics of subcluster 1 2 and 1 4 samples table 2 and their position in the pca space fig 11 suggest that these subclusters are mixed groundwater between more than two endmembers unlike the other clusters subclusters 1 2 and 1 4 show a sparse spatial distribution in the study area fig 10b and hence it is difficult to relate these subclusters to specific groundwater endmembers however one would lump the two subclusters to one group affected by three endmembers namely the old nile water the modern nile water and the modern precipitation given that subcluster 1 2 is closer to the old nile water endmember subcluster 1 1 on the pca plot fig 11 this might indicate that the old nile water contribution to the clusters is greater than the contribution of the other two endmembers it is worthy to mention that due to the absence of baseline chemical and isotopic data for the quaternary aquifer before the anthropogenic recharge a clear definition of thethe certainty of the estimatingchemical facies and isotopic end members can be problematic the construction of a contaminant transport model e g pb can provide a useful tool to address the uncertainty of determining chemical facies and isotopic endmembers the application of multivariate analysis in an integrated way with remote sensing spatial analysis chemical and isotopic data provides more insight in the assessment of water sources and mixing processes in such area affected by significant lclu changes under arid hyper arid conditions the better understanding of the water sources and mixing patterns could help to assess water contamination sources in the study area and in similar areas occupied by shallow alluvial aquifers in arid hyper arid environments which are particularly vulnerable to contamination additionally the mixing dynamics induced by anthropogenic activities in the quaternary aquifer such as the upconing of high salinity miocene water by overexploitation and the infiltration of wastewater and irrigation return would impact the soil moisture and salinity in the root zone resulting in severe degradation in soil fertility and crop production with the current and forecasted increase in aquifers depletion across many countries in the mena region mazzoni et al 2018 our results here in suggest that effective water resources management plans need to be considered to avoid irreversible degradation of soil quality and that will result in a reduction of the crop production radar sensing observations using polarimetric l band synthetic aperture radar methods should be able to map the above described changes in soil moisture and salinity at the fine scale of the observed changes in the lclu zones kim et al 2017 such correlation between soil properties and groundwater mixing can provide an ultimate tool to map these changes in aquifers properties on large scale and monitor their evolution 5 conclusions an integrated remote sensing spatial analysis water chemistry environmental isotope data and msa approach was applied to resolve the impact of lclu changes on groundwater mixing in alluvial aquifers under arid hyper arid conditions the case study included the shallow alluvial aquifer southeast of the nile delta an area that witnesses dynamic lclu changes lclu analysis indicated that agricultural and urban areas increased from 84 km2 to 470 5 km2 between 1972 and 2018 on the expense of bare lands basin scale hydrological analyses showed that the quaternary alluvial aquifer receives an annual recharge of 11 13 5 106 m2 and 5 1 6 2 106 m2 in the wadi el gafra and wadi el watan catchments respectively three original water sources and three groups of mixed waters were defined the original water sources include 1 the modern precipitation water as represented by miocene groundwater and cluster 3 2 the old nile water represented by subcluster 1 1 and 3 modern nile water from the ismailia canal which is represented by cluster 2 the three mixing groups include 1 a mixture of modern precipitation wastewater and irrigation return cluster 4 2 a mixture of old nile waters and modern precipitation subcluster 1 3 and 3 a mixture of more than two sources subclusters 1 2 and 1 4 the better understanding of water sources and their mixing patterns especially in shallow alluvial aquifers under arid hyper arid conditions could help to assess soil and water contamination sources and accordingly provide useful information for the effective water resources management soil

4497,it is well documented that land use and land cover changes lucc have profoundly affected global water cycles however the unclear relationship between hydrological effects and various lucc characteristics and lack of observed continuous land cover data limit the accurate quantification of lucc on global evapotranspiration et here lucc induced et changes were derived from continuously observed land cover maps during 1982 2016 using a budyko type method zhang curve which suggests that woodland cover change is the key and most sensitive property of lucc affecting water yield a woodland reclassification scheme was proposed for applying the zhang curve separated global woodland coverage agreed well with observed data at the country level around the world the zhang curve estimated global mean annual land et as 540 8 mm yr 1 excluding antarctica we show that global lucc increased et 0 052 mm yr 2 during the study period contributing approximately 11 1 to the global et increase estimated by brutsaert 2017 about 0 47 mm yr 2 the results suggest that human induced increase in global woodland coverage during the past three decades has led to a notable positive increase in global land et which is contrary to previous findings based on potential land cover maps keywords woodland cover change lucc terrestrial evapotranspiration zhang curve 1 introduction land use and land cover changes lucc induced et changes have attracted special attention over the past several decades observation based or modelling studies have showed that forest restoration can lead to increase in et in many places around the world including the loess plateau china jin et al 2017 south african grasslands gibson et al 2018 and forest cut off can result in decrease in et in the tropical amazonia forest hahmann and dickinson 1997 although there is general consensus that increased forest cover will lead to increased et due to the fact that forests have deeper roots and can extract and use more soil moisture zhang et al 2001 adane et al 2018 sheil 2018 lucc induced et at continental and global scales remains uncertain due to two aspects one is lack of long term continuous and consistent historical lucc observations and the other is limited understanding about the different hydrological effects of various lucc indices and characteristics especially in terms of their impact on water yield pitman et al 2009 peel et al 2010 pielke et al 2011 goldewijk and verburg 2012 cornelissen et al 2013 lawrence et al 2016 prestele et al 2017 sheil 2018 with rapid accumulation of remotely sensed vegetation cover data during the past few decades e g song et al 2018 quantifying the impacts of land cover changes on global et using continuous and consistent observed data becomes achievable but such studies have been rarely been conducted at the global scale most of the impacts of historical lucc on global et have been derived from historical scenarios of land use change based on constructed and non continuous land cover maps gordon et al 2005 verburg et al 2011 de noblet ducoudré et al 2012 sterling et al 2013 significant biases have been reported in these constructed potential anthropogenic land cover maps these biases can originate from discrete land cover change periods inconsistencies between land use and land cover definitions and the different models used to generate the land use and cover changes goldewijk and verburg 2012 lawrence et al 2016 basically land use based land cover maps were often reconstructed at decadal time intervals verburg et al 2011 as a result the impacts of lucc on et were quantified discontinuously in time gordon et al 2005 piao et al 2007 sterling et al 2013 discontinuous land use change can lead to large uncertainty in land use due to artificial integration between historical and future land use data resulting in bias in the estimated impacts on water cycles prestele et al 2017 moreover large inconsistencies in land use and land cover changes can also lead to uncertainties in the estimated impacts on water cycles pielke et al 2011 usually land use based changes only include major anthropogenic land cover changes e g cropland conversion grazing land extension lucc can also be driven by natural processes such as climate shifts or natural disturbances e g fire deforested lands that are abandoned leading to changes in biogeographic vegetation distribution balzter et al 2007 kuemmerle et al 2015 considering only one or two human dominated land cover changes will only partially reflect actual lucc and can lead to underestimation of lucc impacts on et sterling et al 2013 a general consensus on how to prescribe land use change is still lacking such as transition from abandoned cropland to natural re growth or tree plantations this issue leads to different implementation of anthropogenic land cover maps among different groups pitman et al 2009 therefore reliable estimation of the impact of historical lucc on the hydrological cycle should to be made based on long term continuous and consistent observations at present it is also a challenging task to identify which indices and characteristics of lucc are important for quantifying hydrological impacts there are many indices and characteristics of lucc including vegetation type vegetation coverage stand age transition matrix etc peel et al 2010 reported that differences in et between temperate evergreen and deciduous forested catchments were not significant some trees species may have marginal age dependent differences in water use and thus no significant transpiration difference can be found between old growth and regrowth trees vertessy et al 2001 basically vegetation coverage has been widely used to characterize lucc ramankutty and foley 1999 goldewijk 2001 sterling and ducharne 2008 song et al 2018 and to assess the impact of lucc on water yield brown et al 2005 gordon et al 2005 zhou et al 2015 jaramillo et al 2018 catchment hydrological observations have demonstrated that woodland cover change is the most important characteristic accounting for the impact of land cover changes on long term water yield since the actual et rates for woodland were significantly greater than for grassland however at present global continuous woodland observations are still lacking typically two methods have been widely used to quantify the magnitude of lucc induced changes in et across various spatial and temporal scales i e bottom up methods e g hydrological models land surface models and top down methods e g budyko type method brown et al 2005 li et al 2009 yang et al 2009 cornelissen et al 2013 boisier et al 2014 lei et al 2014 jaramillo et al 2018 bottom up methods have large uncertainties as these process based models usually have a large number of unconstrained parameters and complex modelling structures e g different implementation of lucc which limits our capacity to identify the sensitivity of the annual water budget to vegetation changes pitman et al 2009 de noblet ducoudré et al 2012 cornelissen et al 2013 the major advantages of the top down method include low data requirements low model complexity and transparent propagation of error the budyko type method is a top down method that is widely used as an analytical parameterization of the water balance approach at long time scales and large spatial scales e g mean annual time scale and watershed scale baw puh 1981 zhang et al 2001 2019 2020 yang et al 2008 it only requires two meteorological inputs i e precipitation and potential evapotranspiration with an additional parameter w representing the integrated effects of vegetation and catchment characteristics e g soil types topography many studies have proved that the vegetation characteristics e g ndvi had a good correlation with w and thus expressed w with a function of the vegetation characteristics yang et al 2009 donohue et al 2010 li et al 2013 it has been shown that forest coverage is the key and most sensitive factor of vegetation characteristics for quantifying the impact of lucc on water yield zhang et al 2001 brown et al 2005 yang et al 2009 cheng et al 2011 2017a zhou et al 2015 jaramillo et al 2018 ning et al 2020 the advantage of using the budyko framework lies in its ability to analytically separate the impacts of mean climate conditions and vegetation changes on hydrological partitioning with low data requirement and simple model structure zhang et al 2018 thus these budyko type methods are quite effective tools for studying the impact of lucc on et at continental and global scales to better understand the impacts of lucc on terrestrial et a series of observed annual land cover maps 1982 2016 generated by song et al 2018 hereafter denoted as s18 and one of the budyko type methods i e zhang curve zhang 1999 zhang et al 2001 were adopted in this study to quantify the impact of lucc on global terrestrial et fig 1 the s18 dataset was used because it is the longest continuously observed high resolution dataset that is currently available more importantly it uses fractional cover to represent the ratio of land cover types which is more accurate than vegetation indices in characterizing land surface changes the zhang curve is a robust budyko type method for calculating et with only precipitation and fraction of deep rooted vegetation i e woodland coverage although only two input data are required to apply zhang curve its high predictability of the hydrological impacts of lucc has been demonstrated with observations globally zhang et al 2001 2011 sun et al 2005 2006 more importantly zhang curve directly and clearly correlates land cover with et which help us identify the response of et to lucc thus zhang curve has been widely used to simulate the impacts of et under changing land cover sun et al 2005 mcvicar et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 the primary objectives of the present study were to 1 reclassify s18 and derive changes in global woodland cover 2 estimate the impacts of global lucc on terrestrial et using the zhang curve 3 characterize global lucc induced et changes during the past few decades 2 data and methodology 2 1 zhang curve for estimation of mean annual et zhang et al 2001 reviewed previous studies describing the effects of vegetation changes on et and concluded that et differences of vegetated land were largely determined by rooting depth and vegetation coverage zhang et al 2001 proposed that average annual changes in regional et could be simulated as a function of area weighted woodland coverage according to zhang et al 2001 the mean annual evapotranspiration mae is estimated as 1 et f wl et wl 1 f wl et gl where et is the mean annual total evapotranspiration f wl is the fraction of woodland cover et wl is the mean annual evapotranspiration of woodland and et gl is the mean annual evapotranspiration of grassland woodland mean annual et i e et wl is estimated as 2 et wl p 1 w 1 e 0 p 1 w 1 e 0 p p e 0 where p is the mean annual precipitation w 1 is an empirical parameter representing plant water availability of woody plants e 0 is the mean annual potential evapotranspiration of the woodland grassland mean annual et i e et gl is estimated as 3 et gl p 1 w 2 e 0 p 1 w 2 e 0 p p e 0 where w 2 is another empirical parameter representing plant water availability of grass plants e 0 is the mean annual potential evapotranspiration of grass covered area precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in eqs 1 3 are typically reported as water depth in millimeters an empirical relationship between et and rainfall of woodland and grass covered areas was constructed by zhang et al 2001 and is referred to as a zhang curve supplementary fig s1 it is based on observations from forested and grassed catchments worldwide by fitting eqs 2 and 3 to woodland catchments and grass covered catchments respectively e 0 e 0 and w 1 w 2 were determined as 1410 1100 mm and 2 0 0 5 respectively zhang 1999 zhang et al 2001 therefore in practice eq 1 can be expressed as 4 et p f wl 1 2 1410 p 1 2 1410 p p 1410 1 f wl 1 0 5 1100 p 1 0 5 1100 p p 1100 and et can be estimated from mean annual precipitation p and the fraction of woodland cover f wl the variable p was taken from the cru ncep dataset version 7 with a spatial resolution of 0 5 new et al 1999 similar classic studies schreiber 1904 budyko 1974 yang et al 2009 formulated e 0 as functions of solar radiation and temperature the woodland grassland component of zhang curve assumes e 0 is a constant which was determined as 1410 1100 mm by regressing the data recorded at woodland grassland sites across a wide range of climatic zones 2 2 global land cover dataset and separation of woodland cover annual vegetation continuous fields vcf products generated by song et al 2018 based on the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr observations avhrr vcf product were used in this study these are the longest global lucc products that are currently available the s18 dataset consists of three vegetation types i e tree canopy tc short vegetation sv and bare ground bg with a spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 tc is defined as vegetation with a height of 5 m or more sv represents the land covered by vegetation other than trees such as shrubs herbaceous vegetation and mosses bg refers to land that is not covered by any vegetation changes in these three land covers are caused by anthropogenic or natural factors song et al 2018 for each land pixel land coverage is expressed as the percentage or fraction of the three different types that totaled to 100 i e f tc f sv f bg 100 noted that the definitions of woodland and grassland in zhang curve are different from those of igbp international geosphere biosphere programme woodland land cover type is not defined in the igbp land cover use types which is typically classified by three characteristics i e vegetation species which were determined by leaf type and leaf longevity vegetation height and minimum canopy cover friedl et al 2002 zhang 1999 defined deep rooted vegetation and shallow rooted vegetation as woodland and grassland respectively following the deep rooted vegetation types listed in the appendix of zhang 1999 the land cover types of forest sparse forest and shrublands including rainforest scrub forest eucalyptus forest pine forest bamboo oak woodland were aggregated to a woody vegetation class as deep rooted vegetation with higher water consumptions than grasses as the woodland cover defined by fao food and agriculture organization of the united nations includes bamboo and palms shrubs bushes and other woody plants fao 2012 it generally consistent with woody vegetation class used by zhang 1999 thus the field survey of woodland data sets provided by the fao was used to calibrate the reclassified method vegetation land classifications used in song et al 2018 i e s18 were reclassified into woodland wl and grassland gl to apply the zhang curve i e eq 4 at the global scale according to the land cover type classification scheme of song et al 2018 and vegetation types defined by zhang et al 2001 gl in eq 4 should consist of bg and part of sv which represents the land covered by vegetation with a height 5 m and wl should consist of tc and part of sv the part of sv that is reclassified into wl is denoted as sw namely the fraction of wl in a pixel f wl can be expressed as 5 f wl f tc f sw a key variable r wl t c s v is proposed to obtain f wl and it is the ratio of f wl to vegetated proportion i e f tc f sv thus eq 5 can be expressed as 6 f wl r wl t c s v f tc f sv the fraction and distribution of the three original vegetation types f tc f sv f bg in a grid cell follow some ecological principles and thus f tc f tc f sv has a close relationship with r wl t c s v a general form of this relationship is proposed as follows 7 r wl tc s v f f tc f tc f sv the relationship is constructed based on two assumptions one assumption is that since 0 f tc f wl f tc f sv and r wl t c s v f wl f tc f sv then 8 0 f tc f tc f sv r wl tc s v 1 the other assumption is that the following relationships must hold under extreme conditions 9 f tc 0 r wl tc s v r min 0 r min 1 w h e n f tc f tc f sv 0 10 f tc 1 r wl tc s v 1 w h e n f tc f tc f sv 1 and 11 d r wl tc s v d f tc f tc f sv w h e n f tc f tc f sv 0 12 d r wl tc s v d f tc f tc f sv a 0 a 1 w h e n f tc f tc f sv 1 where r min refers to the lower bound of the zero order condition of eq 7 and a refers to the upper bound of the first order condition of eq 7 therefore f tc f tc f sv and r wl tc s v are positively related and the growth rate of r wl tc s v decreases as f tc f tc f sv increases considering the zero and first order boundary conditions of eq 7 a function is proposed to depict the r wl tc s v f tc f tc f sv as follows 13 r wl tc s v 1 r min 1 ab r min ln f tc f tc f sv 1 b r min b 0 where rmin a and b are fitting parameters which are calibrated by a global woodland survey dataset of 29 countries in 2015 both r wl tc s v and f tc f tc f sv are dimensionless and thus rmin a and b are dimensionless quantities as well the woodland data of the global forest resources assessment 2015 fra 2015 macdicken et al 2015 provided by the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations was taken as observed woodland to calibrate the three parameters of eq 13 only the woodland area of the top 30 countries in fra 2015 was used and the total woodland area of these countries accounts for over 90 of global total woodland coverage the woodland cover data for these 30 countries in 2005 2010 and 2015 obtained from fra 2015 is provided in supplementary table s1 the australia record of woodland coverage was not used for the calibration because according to the fao report the definitions of forest and other woodland used in australia are not consistent with the fra 2015 definitions in both height and crown cover density thresholds and the spatial information for vegetation types in the australia data in fra 2015 is not up to date three criteria including nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 r2 and percentage bias pbias gupta et al 1999 were used to quantify model performance we note that nse is overly sensitive to extreme values legates and mccabe 1999 and the woodland areas km2 of the 29 countries have large variances see supplementary table s1 to reduce the effect of extreme values on nse nse was estimated based on woodland coverage expressed as percentage while both r2 and pbias were estimated based on woodland area km2 the three model performance criteria are defined as 14 pbias i 1 n wl sim i km 2 i 1 n wl obs i km 2 i 1 n wl obs i km 2 100 15 r 2 i 1 n wl sim i km 2 wl sim km 2 wl obs i km 2 wl obs km 2 i 1 n wl sim i km 2 wl sim km 2 2 i 1 n wl obs i km 2 wl obs km 2 2 2 16 nse 1 i 1 n wl obs i wl sim i 2 i 1 n wl obs i wl obs 2 where wl sim i km 2 wl obs i km 2 and wl sim i wl obs i are the simulated observed woodland areas km2 and woodland percentages respectively in the i th country wl sim km 2 wl obs km 2 are the average simulated observed woodland areas of all 29 countries and wl sim wl obs are the average simulated observed woodland percentages of all 29 countries this study used percentage bias to measure model error for all countries n 29 r2 represents the linear coefficient of determination between simulated and observed wl the closer that r2 approaches 1 0 the better the proposed model performs nse 1 0 indicates perfect agreement between the modelled and observed woodland coverage moriasi 2007 2 3 independent global et products seven mean annual et products see supplementary table s2 were collected to evaluate simulated mae using eq 4 the et product that is denoted as etmte was estimated using global observed et fluxes at eddy flux sites in the model tree ensemble method mte jung et al 2010 2011 the et product that is denoted as etwb mte was estimated global et through coupling a water balance wb model with the model tree ensemble mte and using river discharge at the basin level zeng et al 2014 the et product that is denoted as etgleam was estimated global et through the global land surface evaporation the amsterdam methodology gleam miralles et al 2011 the et product that is denoted as etpml was estimated global et by applying the observation driven penman monteith leuning pml model zhang et al 2016 the et products that are denoted as etmerraa and etmerras were reanalysis products produced by nasa s modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra reichle et al 2011 rienecker et al 2011 the et product that is denoted as etera was the reanalysis data of the era interim product dee et al 2011 the comparison was performed only on vegetated land cells that are defined with a mean annual normalized difference vegetation index ndvi greater than 0 1 since some et products have excluded the bare ground the mean annual ndvi data were derived from the gimms ndvi3g dataset generated by zhu et al 2013 2 4 estimation of lucc induced et change in this study changes in et induced by lucc were estimated globally grid by grid only two input data are required to apply eq 4 one is the p and the other one is the woodland fraction i e f wl p is not allowed to vary and is set as the 35 year average at each grid point to exclude the impact of climate variability on et the 35 year woodland series was divided into seven 5 year intervals i e 1982 1986 1987 1991 1992 1996 1997 2001 2002 2006 2007 2011 and 2012 2016 to continuously estimate changes in et induced by lucc the 5 year intervals were considered for two reasons one reason was to guarantee the validity of eq 4 because budyko type equations like eq 4 are usually applied at a mean annual time scale mcvicar et al 2007 jaramillo et al 2018 the other reason was to reduce the influence of uncertainties in woodland coverage data by using the multi year average values instead the first 5 year period 1982 1986 was considered as the baseline period and the estimated et from this period was used to calculate changes in et that occurred over the other periods the et changes are closely related to the changes of land cover types of s18 the changes in bg are accompanied by the changes in the vegetated coverage tc sv which can induce changes in vegetation transpiration and interception all spatial data used in this study were gridded to a spatial resolution of 0 5 with a bilinear interpolation technique total and averaged global results in this study were calculated based on the global terrestrial area excluding antarctica 3 results 3 1 separated global woodland cover and its changes fig 2 shows the calibrated relationship between f tc f tc f sv and r wl t c s v the relationship has an upward sloping concave relationship the three calibrated parameters for eq 13 were determined to be rmin 0 011 a 0 685 and b 1 35 fig 3 shows the comparison between observed and simulated woodland cover in 29 countries in the calibration year 2015 performance statistics for the woodland reclassification model in both the calibration year 2015 and the two validation years 2005 and 2010 are shown in the table 1 the proposed method for estimating woodland cover in the calibration year showed good agreement between simulated and observed woodland cover at the country level simulated woodland cover was slightly overestimated by about 6 6 in the 29 countries the statistical performance measures between observed and simulated woodland cover in all 29 countries indicated good model performance nse 0 75 and r2 0 994 for the two validation years the proposed method also separated the woodland cover effectively in the 29 countries the pbias r2 and nse values were 6 9 and 5 3 0 991 and 0 992 and 0 70 and 0 68 for 2005 and 2010 respectively when using tree cover data f tc from s18 dataset as woodland cover directly woodland cover for these 29 countries was underestimated with pbias r2 and nse values of 35 4 0 95 0 21 respectively therefore the proposed method worked well to separate woodland cover in these 29 countries from the s18 dataset and the model can be applied globally to obtain global annual woodland cover fig 4 a shows the spatial pattern of mean annual estimated woodland cover fraction at the global scale during the period of 1982 2016 fig 4b shows regions with significant changes p 0 01 in annual average woodland cover during the study period both significant increases and decreases over time can be found in several regions around the world decreases were observed for the tropical forest region increasing vegetation cover generally occurred in eastern europe and china overall the area with significant increasing woodland cover about 3 14 107 km2 was larger than the area with significant decreasing woodland cover about 1 24 107 km2 over the past 35 years fig 5 shows the estimated global annual woodland cover and its linear trends during the past 35 years global woodland coverage increased linearly at a rate of 0 03 yr 1 p 0 01 over the entire study period however when the 35 yr study period is divided into two distinct periods visually it is apparent that woodland cover increased in both sub periods woodland increased insignificantly p 0 37 at a rate of 0 074 yr 1 from 1982 to 1993 but it increased significantly p 0 01 at a rate of 0 09 yr 1from 1995 to 2016 fig 5 note that data for 1994 and 2000 is missing as they are not provided in s18 3 2 estimated global mean annual et using the zhang curve the global distribution of estimated mean annual et by mean annual fractional woodland f wl and precipitation p is shown in fig 6 the 1982 2016 mean et across the global land surface is 72 51 103 km3 yr 1 about 540 8 mm yr 1 which is very close to the estimated value of 519 mm yr 1 reported by brutsaert et al 2020 and also falls within the range of 58 103 to 85 103 km3 yr 1 reported by the global soil wetness project 2 based on the global land surface models dirmeyer et al 2006 the et varies among regions and latitudes it was high 1000 1500 mm yr 1 over the tropical rainforests and subtropical forest regions such as brazil and the coastal region of southeastern china it was low 100 400 mm yr 1 over high mountain arid and polar regions in addition to the comparison of global averages our estimated et was compared with a few independent estimates in terms of mean latitudinal patterns fig 7 shows the latitudinal comparisons of estimated global mae solid line with the other seven independent mae datasets dashed lines et pml et era et gleam et merraa et merras et mte et wb mte the zonal median estimated et solid red line in panel b shows similar patterns as produced by the seven independent products with et values around 1200 mm yr 1 in the tropics 800 mm yr 1 in northern mid latitudes at 20on and 400 mm yr 1 in northern high latitudes 50on and very low rates in polar regions according to the global distribution of seven independent mae datasets supplementary fig s2 our estimated et pattern is consistent with those of seven et products overall our methods for estimating mean annual et at a global scale with separated woodland cover and the zhang curve can adequately capture the global spatial variability of land surface et 3 3 impact of lucc on global et our modelling results show that lucc induced et changes can be observed in all continents the significant mae trend p 0 05 n 7 over the seven 5 year intervals are illustrated in fig 8 a the area with significant increasing et is about 1 98 107 km2 which was about two times larger than the area with significant decreasing et about 1 01 107 km2 the area with increased et induced by lucc expanded faster than the area with decreased et caused by lucc in the past few decades the areas with increased et are distributed mainly in china america eastern europe and central africa and expand continuously from 1982 to 1986 to 2012 2016 large regional reductions in annual et mainly occurred in forest rich tropical areas including south america and southern africa and the woodland areas decreased over time fig 8 also shows the spatial distribution of estimated global mae during the baseline period fig 8b and the estimated global mae changes induced by woodland cover changes in other six consecutive 5 year intervals fig 8c h the maximum increase in lucc induced average et was 72 4 mm yr 1 observed in the southern thailand during 2007 2011 the maximum decrease of lucc induced average et was about 107 4 mm yr 1 occurring in central brazil during 2012 2016 the relative changes of global woodland cover and mean annual et compared with the baseline period 1982 1986 are summarized in fig 9 it shows that both the woodland cover and mean annual et have shifted from a net loss to a net gain around 2000 estimated mean annual et during 2012 2016 was 164 1 km3 yr 1 1 22 mm yr 1 larger than that of 1982 1986 global lucc induced et changes had a significantly linear increase over time of 0 052 mm yr 2 from 1982 to 2016 r2 0 73 p 0 001 not shown in picture 4 discussion 4 1 lucc induced changes in et at the global scale lucc induced et changes during 1982 2016 were calculated under average climate conditions fig 8 it is evident that more and more regions show increased et induced by lucc from 1982 to 2016 the changing pattern of et were consistent with previous studies that attributed et changes to anthropogenic land cover changes roy et al 2007 liu et al 2008 knox et al 2015 our results show that reforestation and afforestation programs in china have induced large scale et increase particularly in the qinling daba mountains piao et al 2015 fang et al 2018 lu et al 2018 chen et al 2019 in boreal area lucc induced et increase have been found only in european russia and carpathian montane forests this region has undergone natural afforestation on abandoned agricultural land after collapse of the soviet union potapov et al 2015 the et increase can also be found in the southeastern united states where forests are recovering due to forest carbon management birdsey et al 2006 large scale et decrease can be found in the southeastern border of the amazon especially in cerrado mato grosso and sub saharan africa gibbs et al 2010 spera et al 2016 reported that the clearing of natural forest for agricultural expansion conducted in the cerrado and mato grosso in past three decades lucc induced et decrease in these regions have been well documented by spera et al 2016 in sub saharan africa ordway et al 2017 indicated that tree cover loss was also extensive across woodland area due to commodity crop expansion in accordance with the above results our results indicate that the changes in lucc induced et during past three decades closely related to anthropogenic activities et changes are driven not only by lucc but also by climatic factors e g precipitation temperature piao et al 2007 shi et al 2011 the rate of change in terrestrial evaporation is estimated to be about 0 47 mm yr 2 by brutsaert 2017 based on the clausius clapeyron scaling method this rate is also consistent with the ensemble average 0 37 0 80 mm yr 2 of global reanalysis and diagnosed et products cheng et al 2017b the results of our study suggest that global lucc produced a positive and notable contribution 0 052 mm yr 2 11 1 to the terrestrial global et trend as estimated by brutsaert 2017 unfortunately current climate change impact studies to predict future water availability are based only on various climate change scenarios without consideration of land cover or land use changes which may result in either underestimation or overestimation of changes in global evapotranspiration it is widely recognized that the total et of woodland typically surpasses that of grassland under similar climate conditions because of the larger leaf area and deeper roots of woodland vegetation sheil 2018 deep rooted plants are able to maintain relatively constant evapotranspiration rate over time even during the dry periods when soil moisture in the upper layer of the soil is limited hence forest have higher average annual et than that of grassland zhang et al 2001 yang et al 2016 it implies a positive correlation between changes in forest coverage and et that is to say increase in forest area can lead to higher et generally results in fig 9 are consistent with this expectation the correlation between changes in et and woodland cover change is 0 93 however changes in et and woodland cover were in opposite directions during 1987 1991 and 1992 1996 referring to the baseline period fig 9 the wl area during these two periods was slightly larger than wl area during the baseline period but the et is smaller than that of baseline period this is resulted from the spatial mismatch of the magnitudes of net changes in wl and the magnitude of et it can be explained by fig 10 that shows tropical regions have a wider range of lucc induced et changes which suggests rate of et change is also dependent of the location the net increase in wl was largely the result of greater wl increases in the boreal regions compared with the decreases in wl in the tropical regions during these two periods boreal forests have lower et than tropical forests bonan 2008 the lucc induced decrease of mean annual et in tropical regions is greater than the lucc induced increase in boreal regions therefore et in the periods of 1987 1991 and 1992 1996 was lower than the baseline period et although wl was slightly larger our study indicates that magnitude of lucc induced et at the global scale is determined not only by the magnitude of lucc but also by where the lucc occurred 4 2 comparison of lucc induced et changes at the global scale the simulated lucc induced et changes were inconsistent with direction changes reported in previous studies gordon et al 2005 pointed out that global land use changes i e deforestation irrigation decreased terrestrial et by 400 km3 yr 1 by comparing potential vegetation distribution without human disturbances and present vegetation distribution sterling et al 2013 estimated global annual mean et decreased 3500 km3 yr 1 based on potential anthropogenic land cover maps and et observations for different land covers boisier et al 2014 reported land use changes between 1870 and 1992 reduced et by 760 720 km3 yr 1 and 1260 850 km3 yr 1 as simulated by six land surface models and an empirical et model respectively estimated lucc induced et changes in this study were in the opposite direction to those reported in these three studies there may be two possible reasons for the difference different study periods and different types of land cover changes the three studies referenced above computed past et with potential and present vegetation maps the potential vegetation map represented vegetation that would most likely have existed in the absence of human activities the present vegetation map represents land cover in the 1990s when the world had undergone large scale deforestation fearnside 1986 rudel and roper 1997 lepers et al 2005 their prescribed land cover change between the potential and present roughly represent maximum woodland loss moreover the three studies mentioned above had different types of land cover changes from the one adopted in this study their land cover changes considered only human driven loss of woodland e g removal of natural forest land for crops or grazing in contrast lucc in this study considered woodland change caused by both anthropogenic and natural factors which was not considered in the other three studies and could have led to biased estimation of lucc impacts on et in those three studies this study estimated the gradual changes in lucc induced et thereby reflecting more detailed and useful information about the impact of land use changes on et than the previous studies that estimated discontinuous lucc induced et changes for example our estimations showed lucc induced et changed from net loss to net gain compared with the baseline period 1982 1986 fig 9 and lucc contributed about 11 1 to the global et change over time this change was mainly related to variations in woodland cover the factors mainly driving woodland cover change were human activities related to food and fuel production and economic and social development since industrialization the estimated emissions from land used change mainly deforestation have contributed a quarter of the cumulative carbon emissions le quéré et al 2016 thus biospheric carbon management and trading water for carbon are proposed and afforestation is considered as an effective and available climate change mitigation option jackson 2005 canadell and schulze 2014 a more ambitious afforestation plan is contained within the paris agreement which pursues efforts to limit the global average temperature increase to 1 5 c above pre industrial levels schleussner et al 2016 because afforestation and reforestation induced that global woodland shift from net loss to net gain the carbon sink has increased in many areas such as europe and china bellassen et al 2011 lu et al 2018 however there are risks to implement afforestation as some tree plantations are likely to be located in regions with fragile ecosystems tree plantations can have considerable effects on runoff evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge including reduced stream flow and decreased soil ph and soil moisture that will endanger the sustainability of fragile ecosystems sahin and hall 1996 jackson 2005 shao et al 2019 partly due to such complexity it will be necessary to assess the hydrological impacts of lucc comprehensively and continuously when promoting land use changes for purposes of mitigating likely effects of climate 4 3 principles for separation of woodland from short vegetation the distribution and proportion of vegetation types in the avhrr vcf products reflect geographical variations of vegetation that are determined by spatial variation of climatic forcing and interactions or competition among different plant function types and species eq 13 fig 2 for separating deep rooted vegetation from sv was proposed mainly based on two ecological principles the first principle is that plant distribution is largely determined by human activities and climate conditions woodward et al 2004 morton et al 2006 forests occupy the most favorable environments where moisture is adequate for growth and survival of tall dense vegetation dominated by trees bare ground areas are found where moisture is very limiting or where temperature is so low that a continuous permanent vegetation cover cannot be maintained grassland including cropland and pasture can be considered as a transitional stage along the environmental gradient from forests to bare ground in natural or human disturbed areas therefore sv can be regarded as a transitional zone between tc and bg this classification is supported by comparison among the values of the three vegetation types in the s18 dataset supplementary fig s3 the gradual spatial variation of vegetation distribution for separating wl from tc sv is diagrammed in fig 11 this diagram provides the basic rules and assumptions to formulate eqs 5 12 the second principle is that vegetation coverage reflects the characteristics of plant abundance and is shaped by interactions among species welden and slauson 1986 goldberg and barton 1992 niu et al 2007 trees have long been viewed as competitors with grasses and there is often a strong negative correlation between tree coverage and grass coverage the coverage of tc indicates the competitiveness of this life form the higher the value of f tc f tc f sv in a mixed vegetation pixel the more competitive will be the deep rooted vegetation i e wl this means that deep rooted vegetation is the dominant life form and thus r wl tc s v is higher suggesting that f tc f tc f sv and r wl tc s v are positively related eq 8 and fig 11d b f c a larger f tc f tc f sv value means that the deep rooted vegetation is more competitive than the herbaceous plants in a given region and vice versa when f tc f tc f sv approaches 1 and 0 r wl tc s v should approach 1 and rmin respectively as shown in fig 11b c e note that the calibrated rmin 0 011 was not 0 but was very close to 0 suggesting that on average a very small fraction of sv still needs to be classified into wl even when f tc is 0 fig 11e this situation can exist where shrubs or trees appear sparsely or sporadically in a grass dominated area in order to prove the rationale for simulated f wl the modis land cover product friedl and sulla menashe 2015 was aggregated to 10 classes see detailed information in supplementary fig s4 to verify the relationship between simulated wl and 10 land cover classes the distribution of simulated f wl for these 10 land cover classes fig 12 and supplementary fig s4 shows that the highest values are observed for forests and the lowest values for barren regions a result that is consistent with our general expectation savannas and shrubland occur where trees and grasses mix and their landscape usually consists of many patches in different states of transition between grass dominated and tree dominated areas their complex states can be captured in our simulated wl because as seen in fig 12 the simulated wl of closed shrubland is higher than the simulated wl of open shrublands and the simulated wl of woody savanna is higher than the simulated wl of non woody savannas 4 4 changes in global annual woodland cover on different continents derived spatial patterns of changes in wl fig 4b were consistent with previous studies gibbs et al 2010 kuemmerle et al 2015 potapov et al 2015 spera et al 2016 brandt et al 2017 chen et al 2019 the tropical forest regions experienced significant decreases in wl the spatial patterns agree very well with the deforestation that has occurred in the cerrado region of central and southeastern brazil and east africa due to agricultural expansion gibbs et al 2010 spera et al 2016 the total area with significantly increased wl is larger than the total area with significantly decreased wl fig 4b the areas with significant increases in wl are mainly found in china eastern europe and central africa changes in china and eastern europe have largely resulted from human activities as reported by chen et al 2019 and lu et al 2018 china s greening is evidenced by long term remotely sensed vegetation data and is a result of local afforestation the wl increase in eastern europe possibly resulted from natural woodland regrowth in abandoned agricultural lands after the collapse of the soviet union kuemmerle et al 2015 potapov et al 2015 in water limited savannas of central africa such as the sahel woody plant expansion is probably driven by climate change rather than human activity where woody plant encroachment has been observed due to increases in precipitation and atmospheric carbon dioxide eamus and palmer 2007 kulmatiski and beard 2013 brandt et al 2017 the entire study period is divided into two sub periods i e period 1 1982 1993 and period 2 1995 2016 although global woodland area has a significant upward trend over entire study period during period 1 annual woodland area shows marked fluctuations with an insignificant increasing trend fig 5 0 074 yr 1 p 0 37 that is mainly because woodland area varies differently in several continents in different years asia africa and oceania see supplementary fig s5 some continents showed negative changes in woodland area with 2 1 105 km2 decrease in europe 3 1 104 km2 decrease in asia and 1 4 104 km2 decrease in north america in 1982 1993 while some continents showed positive woodland area changes with 7 8 105 km2 increase in africa 5 2 105 km2 in oceania and 1 4 104 km2 increase in south america the magnitude of reduction in woodland area is almost the same as that of increased area supplementary fig s5b the reduction in woodland area is possibly caused by the expansion of agricultural land for soybean production and grazing in southeastern brazil gibbs et al 2010 and central argentina zak et al 2008 decreased wl also existed in north america eastern europe and the siberian plain possibly driven by wild fires and or human activities tian et al 1995 spichtinger et al 2003 balzter et al 2007 increased wl in southern africa and oceania is possibly driven by climate changes and restoration after bushfires cheney 1995 eamus and palmer 2007 during the period 2 1995 2016 global woodland area increased significantly with a rate of 0 09 yr 1 fig 5 the wl increase mainly occurred in the northern hemisphere supplementary fig s5c driven by natural restoration and afforestation kuemmerle et al 2015 liu et al 2015 fang et al 2018 the increases in woodland area in asia north america europe south america oceania and africa were about 9 0 105 km2 6 0 105 km2 5 5 105 km2 4 1 105 km2 1 7 105 km2 and 1 2 105 km2 respectively 5 conclusions a large number of studies have previously examined the hydrological impacts of lucc using constructed historical land cover maps and those studies proposed that lucc reduced et in contrast the results of our analysis found that global woodland coverage changes resulted in increasing global et over time at a rate of 0 052 mm yr 2 this rate accounts for about 11 1 of the global et trend during the past several decades as estimated by brutsaert 2017 in contrast with some previous studies we found that lucc was responsible for a positive contribution to the global et trend the difference between our results and those previously published regarding changes in global et over time may be due to the fact that previously constructed lucc maps are inconsistent with our lucc maps in research time periods and types of land cover changes represented our estimation of the gradual changes in lucc induced et showed that et changes have switched from a net loss to a net gain compared with the et during the baseline period 1982 1986 these results suggest that lucc induced et changes are mainly related to anthropogenic activity reflecting the potential of human activities to alter the global water cycle this study provides a simple way to examine and quantify the effect of continuous land cover changes on global et the method is based on and constrained by observations and reduces uncertainty in quantifying the influences of lucc on the water cycle at the global scale use of the method can improve our knowledge of the net effect of the latest lucc on terrestrial water flow declaration of competing interest the authors

4497,it is well documented that land use and land cover changes lucc have profoundly affected global water cycles however the unclear relationship between hydrological effects and various lucc characteristics and lack of observed continuous land cover data limit the accurate quantification of lucc on global evapotranspiration et here lucc induced et changes were derived from continuously observed land cover maps during 1982 2016 using a budyko type method zhang curve which suggests that woodland cover change is the key and most sensitive property of lucc affecting water yield a woodland reclassification scheme was proposed for applying the zhang curve separated global woodland coverage agreed well with observed data at the country level around the world the zhang curve estimated global mean annual land et as 540 8 mm yr 1 excluding antarctica we show that global lucc increased et 0 052 mm yr 2 during the study period contributing approximately 11 1 to the global et increase estimated by brutsaert 2017 about 0 47 mm yr 2 the results suggest that human induced increase in global woodland coverage during the past three decades has led to a notable positive increase in global land et which is contrary to previous findings based on potential land cover maps keywords woodland cover change lucc terrestrial evapotranspiration zhang curve 1 introduction land use and land cover changes lucc induced et changes have attracted special attention over the past several decades observation based or modelling studies have showed that forest restoration can lead to increase in et in many places around the world including the loess plateau china jin et al 2017 south african grasslands gibson et al 2018 and forest cut off can result in decrease in et in the tropical amazonia forest hahmann and dickinson 1997 although there is general consensus that increased forest cover will lead to increased et due to the fact that forests have deeper roots and can extract and use more soil moisture zhang et al 2001 adane et al 2018 sheil 2018 lucc induced et at continental and global scales remains uncertain due to two aspects one is lack of long term continuous and consistent historical lucc observations and the other is limited understanding about the different hydrological effects of various lucc indices and characteristics especially in terms of their impact on water yield pitman et al 2009 peel et al 2010 pielke et al 2011 goldewijk and verburg 2012 cornelissen et al 2013 lawrence et al 2016 prestele et al 2017 sheil 2018 with rapid accumulation of remotely sensed vegetation cover data during the past few decades e g song et al 2018 quantifying the impacts of land cover changes on global et using continuous and consistent observed data becomes achievable but such studies have been rarely been conducted at the global scale most of the impacts of historical lucc on global et have been derived from historical scenarios of land use change based on constructed and non continuous land cover maps gordon et al 2005 verburg et al 2011 de noblet ducoudré et al 2012 sterling et al 2013 significant biases have been reported in these constructed potential anthropogenic land cover maps these biases can originate from discrete land cover change periods inconsistencies between land use and land cover definitions and the different models used to generate the land use and cover changes goldewijk and verburg 2012 lawrence et al 2016 basically land use based land cover maps were often reconstructed at decadal time intervals verburg et al 2011 as a result the impacts of lucc on et were quantified discontinuously in time gordon et al 2005 piao et al 2007 sterling et al 2013 discontinuous land use change can lead to large uncertainty in land use due to artificial integration between historical and future land use data resulting in bias in the estimated impacts on water cycles prestele et al 2017 moreover large inconsistencies in land use and land cover changes can also lead to uncertainties in the estimated impacts on water cycles pielke et al 2011 usually land use based changes only include major anthropogenic land cover changes e g cropland conversion grazing land extension lucc can also be driven by natural processes such as climate shifts or natural disturbances e g fire deforested lands that are abandoned leading to changes in biogeographic vegetation distribution balzter et al 2007 kuemmerle et al 2015 considering only one or two human dominated land cover changes will only partially reflect actual lucc and can lead to underestimation of lucc impacts on et sterling et al 2013 a general consensus on how to prescribe land use change is still lacking such as transition from abandoned cropland to natural re growth or tree plantations this issue leads to different implementation of anthropogenic land cover maps among different groups pitman et al 2009 therefore reliable estimation of the impact of historical lucc on the hydrological cycle should to be made based on long term continuous and consistent observations at present it is also a challenging task to identify which indices and characteristics of lucc are important for quantifying hydrological impacts there are many indices and characteristics of lucc including vegetation type vegetation coverage stand age transition matrix etc peel et al 2010 reported that differences in et between temperate evergreen and deciduous forested catchments were not significant some trees species may have marginal age dependent differences in water use and thus no significant transpiration difference can be found between old growth and regrowth trees vertessy et al 2001 basically vegetation coverage has been widely used to characterize lucc ramankutty and foley 1999 goldewijk 2001 sterling and ducharne 2008 song et al 2018 and to assess the impact of lucc on water yield brown et al 2005 gordon et al 2005 zhou et al 2015 jaramillo et al 2018 catchment hydrological observations have demonstrated that woodland cover change is the most important characteristic accounting for the impact of land cover changes on long term water yield since the actual et rates for woodland were significantly greater than for grassland however at present global continuous woodland observations are still lacking typically two methods have been widely used to quantify the magnitude of lucc induced changes in et across various spatial and temporal scales i e bottom up methods e g hydrological models land surface models and top down methods e g budyko type method brown et al 2005 li et al 2009 yang et al 2009 cornelissen et al 2013 boisier et al 2014 lei et al 2014 jaramillo et al 2018 bottom up methods have large uncertainties as these process based models usually have a large number of unconstrained parameters and complex modelling structures e g different implementation of lucc which limits our capacity to identify the sensitivity of the annual water budget to vegetation changes pitman et al 2009 de noblet ducoudré et al 2012 cornelissen et al 2013 the major advantages of the top down method include low data requirements low model complexity and transparent propagation of error the budyko type method is a top down method that is widely used as an analytical parameterization of the water balance approach at long time scales and large spatial scales e g mean annual time scale and watershed scale baw puh 1981 zhang et al 2001 2019 2020 yang et al 2008 it only requires two meteorological inputs i e precipitation and potential evapotranspiration with an additional parameter w representing the integrated effects of vegetation and catchment characteristics e g soil types topography many studies have proved that the vegetation characteristics e g ndvi had a good correlation with w and thus expressed w with a function of the vegetation characteristics yang et al 2009 donohue et al 2010 li et al 2013 it has been shown that forest coverage is the key and most sensitive factor of vegetation characteristics for quantifying the impact of lucc on water yield zhang et al 2001 brown et al 2005 yang et al 2009 cheng et al 2011 2017a zhou et al 2015 jaramillo et al 2018 ning et al 2020 the advantage of using the budyko framework lies in its ability to analytically separate the impacts of mean climate conditions and vegetation changes on hydrological partitioning with low data requirement and simple model structure zhang et al 2018 thus these budyko type methods are quite effective tools for studying the impact of lucc on et at continental and global scales to better understand the impacts of lucc on terrestrial et a series of observed annual land cover maps 1982 2016 generated by song et al 2018 hereafter denoted as s18 and one of the budyko type methods i e zhang curve zhang 1999 zhang et al 2001 were adopted in this study to quantify the impact of lucc on global terrestrial et fig 1 the s18 dataset was used because it is the longest continuously observed high resolution dataset that is currently available more importantly it uses fractional cover to represent the ratio of land cover types which is more accurate than vegetation indices in characterizing land surface changes the zhang curve is a robust budyko type method for calculating et with only precipitation and fraction of deep rooted vegetation i e woodland coverage although only two input data are required to apply zhang curve its high predictability of the hydrological impacts of lucc has been demonstrated with observations globally zhang et al 2001 2011 sun et al 2005 2006 more importantly zhang curve directly and clearly correlates land cover with et which help us identify the response of et to lucc thus zhang curve has been widely used to simulate the impacts of et under changing land cover sun et al 2005 mcvicar et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 the primary objectives of the present study were to 1 reclassify s18 and derive changes in global woodland cover 2 estimate the impacts of global lucc on terrestrial et using the zhang curve 3 characterize global lucc induced et changes during the past few decades 2 data and methodology 2 1 zhang curve for estimation of mean annual et zhang et al 2001 reviewed previous studies describing the effects of vegetation changes on et and concluded that et differences of vegetated land were largely determined by rooting depth and vegetation coverage zhang et al 2001 proposed that average annual changes in regional et could be simulated as a function of area weighted woodland coverage according to zhang et al 2001 the mean annual evapotranspiration mae is estimated as 1 et f wl et wl 1 f wl et gl where et is the mean annual total evapotranspiration f wl is the fraction of woodland cover et wl is the mean annual evapotranspiration of woodland and et gl is the mean annual evapotranspiration of grassland woodland mean annual et i e et wl is estimated as 2 et wl p 1 w 1 e 0 p 1 w 1 e 0 p p e 0 where p is the mean annual precipitation w 1 is an empirical parameter representing plant water availability of woody plants e 0 is the mean annual potential evapotranspiration of the woodland grassland mean annual et i e et gl is estimated as 3 et gl p 1 w 2 e 0 p 1 w 2 e 0 p p e 0 where w 2 is another empirical parameter representing plant water availability of grass plants e 0 is the mean annual potential evapotranspiration of grass covered area precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in eqs 1 3 are typically reported as water depth in millimeters an empirical relationship between et and rainfall of woodland and grass covered areas was constructed by zhang et al 2001 and is referred to as a zhang curve supplementary fig s1 it is based on observations from forested and grassed catchments worldwide by fitting eqs 2 and 3 to woodland catchments and grass covered catchments respectively e 0 e 0 and w 1 w 2 were determined as 1410 1100 mm and 2 0 0 5 respectively zhang 1999 zhang et al 2001 therefore in practice eq 1 can be expressed as 4 et p f wl 1 2 1410 p 1 2 1410 p p 1410 1 f wl 1 0 5 1100 p 1 0 5 1100 p p 1100 and et can be estimated from mean annual precipitation p and the fraction of woodland cover f wl the variable p was taken from the cru ncep dataset version 7 with a spatial resolution of 0 5 new et al 1999 similar classic studies schreiber 1904 budyko 1974 yang et al 2009 formulated e 0 as functions of solar radiation and temperature the woodland grassland component of zhang curve assumes e 0 is a constant which was determined as 1410 1100 mm by regressing the data recorded at woodland grassland sites across a wide range of climatic zones 2 2 global land cover dataset and separation of woodland cover annual vegetation continuous fields vcf products generated by song et al 2018 based on the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr observations avhrr vcf product were used in this study these are the longest global lucc products that are currently available the s18 dataset consists of three vegetation types i e tree canopy tc short vegetation sv and bare ground bg with a spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 tc is defined as vegetation with a height of 5 m or more sv represents the land covered by vegetation other than trees such as shrubs herbaceous vegetation and mosses bg refers to land that is not covered by any vegetation changes in these three land covers are caused by anthropogenic or natural factors song et al 2018 for each land pixel land coverage is expressed as the percentage or fraction of the three different types that totaled to 100 i e f tc f sv f bg 100 noted that the definitions of woodland and grassland in zhang curve are different from those of igbp international geosphere biosphere programme woodland land cover type is not defined in the igbp land cover use types which is typically classified by three characteristics i e vegetation species which were determined by leaf type and leaf longevity vegetation height and minimum canopy cover friedl et al 2002 zhang 1999 defined deep rooted vegetation and shallow rooted vegetation as woodland and grassland respectively following the deep rooted vegetation types listed in the appendix of zhang 1999 the land cover types of forest sparse forest and shrublands including rainforest scrub forest eucalyptus forest pine forest bamboo oak woodland were aggregated to a woody vegetation class as deep rooted vegetation with higher water consumptions than grasses as the woodland cover defined by fao food and agriculture organization of the united nations includes bamboo and palms shrubs bushes and other woody plants fao 2012 it generally consistent with woody vegetation class used by zhang 1999 thus the field survey of woodland data sets provided by the fao was used to calibrate the reclassified method vegetation land classifications used in song et al 2018 i e s18 were reclassified into woodland wl and grassland gl to apply the zhang curve i e eq 4 at the global scale according to the land cover type classification scheme of song et al 2018 and vegetation types defined by zhang et al 2001 gl in eq 4 should consist of bg and part of sv which represents the land covered by vegetation with a height 5 m and wl should consist of tc and part of sv the part of sv that is reclassified into wl is denoted as sw namely the fraction of wl in a pixel f wl can be expressed as 5 f wl f tc f sw a key variable r wl t c s v is proposed to obtain f wl and it is the ratio of f wl to vegetated proportion i e f tc f sv thus eq 5 can be expressed as 6 f wl r wl t c s v f tc f sv the fraction and distribution of the three original vegetation types f tc f sv f bg in a grid cell follow some ecological principles and thus f tc f tc f sv has a close relationship with r wl t c s v a general form of this relationship is proposed as follows 7 r wl tc s v f f tc f tc f sv the relationship is constructed based on two assumptions one assumption is that since 0 f tc f wl f tc f sv and r wl t c s v f wl f tc f sv then 8 0 f tc f tc f sv r wl tc s v 1 the other assumption is that the following relationships must hold under extreme conditions 9 f tc 0 r wl tc s v r min 0 r min 1 w h e n f tc f tc f sv 0 10 f tc 1 r wl tc s v 1 w h e n f tc f tc f sv 1 and 11 d r wl tc s v d f tc f tc f sv w h e n f tc f tc f sv 0 12 d r wl tc s v d f tc f tc f sv a 0 a 1 w h e n f tc f tc f sv 1 where r min refers to the lower bound of the zero order condition of eq 7 and a refers to the upper bound of the first order condition of eq 7 therefore f tc f tc f sv and r wl tc s v are positively related and the growth rate of r wl tc s v decreases as f tc f tc f sv increases considering the zero and first order boundary conditions of eq 7 a function is proposed to depict the r wl tc s v f tc f tc f sv as follows 13 r wl tc s v 1 r min 1 ab r min ln f tc f tc f sv 1 b r min b 0 where rmin a and b are fitting parameters which are calibrated by a global woodland survey dataset of 29 countries in 2015 both r wl tc s v and f tc f tc f sv are dimensionless and thus rmin a and b are dimensionless quantities as well the woodland data of the global forest resources assessment 2015 fra 2015 macdicken et al 2015 provided by the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations was taken as observed woodland to calibrate the three parameters of eq 13 only the woodland area of the top 30 countries in fra 2015 was used and the total woodland area of these countries accounts for over 90 of global total woodland coverage the woodland cover data for these 30 countries in 2005 2010 and 2015 obtained from fra 2015 is provided in supplementary table s1 the australia record of woodland coverage was not used for the calibration because according to the fao report the definitions of forest and other woodland used in australia are not consistent with the fra 2015 definitions in both height and crown cover density thresholds and the spatial information for vegetation types in the australia data in fra 2015 is not up to date three criteria including nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 r2 and percentage bias pbias gupta et al 1999 were used to quantify model performance we note that nse is overly sensitive to extreme values legates and mccabe 1999 and the woodland areas km2 of the 29 countries have large variances see supplementary table s1 to reduce the effect of extreme values on nse nse was estimated based on woodland coverage expressed as percentage while both r2 and pbias were estimated based on woodland area km2 the three model performance criteria are defined as 14 pbias i 1 n wl sim i km 2 i 1 n wl obs i km 2 i 1 n wl obs i km 2 100 15 r 2 i 1 n wl sim i km 2 wl sim km 2 wl obs i km 2 wl obs km 2 i 1 n wl sim i km 2 wl sim km 2 2 i 1 n wl obs i km 2 wl obs km 2 2 2 16 nse 1 i 1 n wl obs i wl sim i 2 i 1 n wl obs i wl obs 2 where wl sim i km 2 wl obs i km 2 and wl sim i wl obs i are the simulated observed woodland areas km2 and woodland percentages respectively in the i th country wl sim km 2 wl obs km 2 are the average simulated observed woodland areas of all 29 countries and wl sim wl obs are the average simulated observed woodland percentages of all 29 countries this study used percentage bias to measure model error for all countries n 29 r2 represents the linear coefficient of determination between simulated and observed wl the closer that r2 approaches 1 0 the better the proposed model performs nse 1 0 indicates perfect agreement between the modelled and observed woodland coverage moriasi 2007 2 3 independent global et products seven mean annual et products see supplementary table s2 were collected to evaluate simulated mae using eq 4 the et product that is denoted as etmte was estimated using global observed et fluxes at eddy flux sites in the model tree ensemble method mte jung et al 2010 2011 the et product that is denoted as etwb mte was estimated global et through coupling a water balance wb model with the model tree ensemble mte and using river discharge at the basin level zeng et al 2014 the et product that is denoted as etgleam was estimated global et through the global land surface evaporation the amsterdam methodology gleam miralles et al 2011 the et product that is denoted as etpml was estimated global et by applying the observation driven penman monteith leuning pml model zhang et al 2016 the et products that are denoted as etmerraa and etmerras were reanalysis products produced by nasa s modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra reichle et al 2011 rienecker et al 2011 the et product that is denoted as etera was the reanalysis data of the era interim product dee et al 2011 the comparison was performed only on vegetated land cells that are defined with a mean annual normalized difference vegetation index ndvi greater than 0 1 since some et products have excluded the bare ground the mean annual ndvi data were derived from the gimms ndvi3g dataset generated by zhu et al 2013 2 4 estimation of lucc induced et change in this study changes in et induced by lucc were estimated globally grid by grid only two input data are required to apply eq 4 one is the p and the other one is the woodland fraction i e f wl p is not allowed to vary and is set as the 35 year average at each grid point to exclude the impact of climate variability on et the 35 year woodland series was divided into seven 5 year intervals i e 1982 1986 1987 1991 1992 1996 1997 2001 2002 2006 2007 2011 and 2012 2016 to continuously estimate changes in et induced by lucc the 5 year intervals were considered for two reasons one reason was to guarantee the validity of eq 4 because budyko type equations like eq 4 are usually applied at a mean annual time scale mcvicar et al 2007 jaramillo et al 2018 the other reason was to reduce the influence of uncertainties in woodland coverage data by using the multi year average values instead the first 5 year period 1982 1986 was considered as the baseline period and the estimated et from this period was used to calculate changes in et that occurred over the other periods the et changes are closely related to the changes of land cover types of s18 the changes in bg are accompanied by the changes in the vegetated coverage tc sv which can induce changes in vegetation transpiration and interception all spatial data used in this study were gridded to a spatial resolution of 0 5 with a bilinear interpolation technique total and averaged global results in this study were calculated based on the global terrestrial area excluding antarctica 3 results 3 1 separated global woodland cover and its changes fig 2 shows the calibrated relationship between f tc f tc f sv and r wl t c s v the relationship has an upward sloping concave relationship the three calibrated parameters for eq 13 were determined to be rmin 0 011 a 0 685 and b 1 35 fig 3 shows the comparison between observed and simulated woodland cover in 29 countries in the calibration year 2015 performance statistics for the woodland reclassification model in both the calibration year 2015 and the two validation years 2005 and 2010 are shown in the table 1 the proposed method for estimating woodland cover in the calibration year showed good agreement between simulated and observed woodland cover at the country level simulated woodland cover was slightly overestimated by about 6 6 in the 29 countries the statistical performance measures between observed and simulated woodland cover in all 29 countries indicated good model performance nse 0 75 and r2 0 994 for the two validation years the proposed method also separated the woodland cover effectively in the 29 countries the pbias r2 and nse values were 6 9 and 5 3 0 991 and 0 992 and 0 70 and 0 68 for 2005 and 2010 respectively when using tree cover data f tc from s18 dataset as woodland cover directly woodland cover for these 29 countries was underestimated with pbias r2 and nse values of 35 4 0 95 0 21 respectively therefore the proposed method worked well to separate woodland cover in these 29 countries from the s18 dataset and the model can be applied globally to obtain global annual woodland cover fig 4 a shows the spatial pattern of mean annual estimated woodland cover fraction at the global scale during the period of 1982 2016 fig 4b shows regions with significant changes p 0 01 in annual average woodland cover during the study period both significant increases and decreases over time can be found in several regions around the world decreases were observed for the tropical forest region increasing vegetation cover generally occurred in eastern europe and china overall the area with significant increasing woodland cover about 3 14 107 km2 was larger than the area with significant decreasing woodland cover about 1 24 107 km2 over the past 35 years fig 5 shows the estimated global annual woodland cover and its linear trends during the past 35 years global woodland coverage increased linearly at a rate of 0 03 yr 1 p 0 01 over the entire study period however when the 35 yr study period is divided into two distinct periods visually it is apparent that woodland cover increased in both sub periods woodland increased insignificantly p 0 37 at a rate of 0 074 yr 1 from 1982 to 1993 but it increased significantly p 0 01 at a rate of 0 09 yr 1from 1995 to 2016 fig 5 note that data for 1994 and 2000 is missing as they are not provided in s18 3 2 estimated global mean annual et using the zhang curve the global distribution of estimated mean annual et by mean annual fractional woodland f wl and precipitation p is shown in fig 6 the 1982 2016 mean et across the global land surface is 72 51 103 km3 yr 1 about 540 8 mm yr 1 which is very close to the estimated value of 519 mm yr 1 reported by brutsaert et al 2020 and also falls within the range of 58 103 to 85 103 km3 yr 1 reported by the global soil wetness project 2 based on the global land surface models dirmeyer et al 2006 the et varies among regions and latitudes it was high 1000 1500 mm yr 1 over the tropical rainforests and subtropical forest regions such as brazil and the coastal region of southeastern china it was low 100 400 mm yr 1 over high mountain arid and polar regions in addition to the comparison of global averages our estimated et was compared with a few independent estimates in terms of mean latitudinal patterns fig 7 shows the latitudinal comparisons of estimated global mae solid line with the other seven independent mae datasets dashed lines et pml et era et gleam et merraa et merras et mte et wb mte the zonal median estimated et solid red line in panel b shows similar patterns as produced by the seven independent products with et values around 1200 mm yr 1 in the tropics 800 mm yr 1 in northern mid latitudes at 20on and 400 mm yr 1 in northern high latitudes 50on and very low rates in polar regions according to the global distribution of seven independent mae datasets supplementary fig s2 our estimated et pattern is consistent with those of seven et products overall our methods for estimating mean annual et at a global scale with separated woodland cover and the zhang curve can adequately capture the global spatial variability of land surface et 3 3 impact of lucc on global et our modelling results show that lucc induced et changes can be observed in all continents the significant mae trend p 0 05 n 7 over the seven 5 year intervals are illustrated in fig 8 a the area with significant increasing et is about 1 98 107 km2 which was about two times larger than the area with significant decreasing et about 1 01 107 km2 the area with increased et induced by lucc expanded faster than the area with decreased et caused by lucc in the past few decades the areas with increased et are distributed mainly in china america eastern europe and central africa and expand continuously from 1982 to 1986 to 2012 2016 large regional reductions in annual et mainly occurred in forest rich tropical areas including south america and southern africa and the woodland areas decreased over time fig 8 also shows the spatial distribution of estimated global mae during the baseline period fig 8b and the estimated global mae changes induced by woodland cover changes in other six consecutive 5 year intervals fig 8c h the maximum increase in lucc induced average et was 72 4 mm yr 1 observed in the southern thailand during 2007 2011 the maximum decrease of lucc induced average et was about 107 4 mm yr 1 occurring in central brazil during 2012 2016 the relative changes of global woodland cover and mean annual et compared with the baseline period 1982 1986 are summarized in fig 9 it shows that both the woodland cover and mean annual et have shifted from a net loss to a net gain around 2000 estimated mean annual et during 2012 2016 was 164 1 km3 yr 1 1 22 mm yr 1 larger than that of 1982 1986 global lucc induced et changes had a significantly linear increase over time of 0 052 mm yr 2 from 1982 to 2016 r2 0 73 p 0 001 not shown in picture 4 discussion 4 1 lucc induced changes in et at the global scale lucc induced et changes during 1982 2016 were calculated under average climate conditions fig 8 it is evident that more and more regions show increased et induced by lucc from 1982 to 2016 the changing pattern of et were consistent with previous studies that attributed et changes to anthropogenic land cover changes roy et al 2007 liu et al 2008 knox et al 2015 our results show that reforestation and afforestation programs in china have induced large scale et increase particularly in the qinling daba mountains piao et al 2015 fang et al 2018 lu et al 2018 chen et al 2019 in boreal area lucc induced et increase have been found only in european russia and carpathian montane forests this region has undergone natural afforestation on abandoned agricultural land after collapse of the soviet union potapov et al 2015 the et increase can also be found in the southeastern united states where forests are recovering due to forest carbon management birdsey et al 2006 large scale et decrease can be found in the southeastern border of the amazon especially in cerrado mato grosso and sub saharan africa gibbs et al 2010 spera et al 2016 reported that the clearing of natural forest for agricultural expansion conducted in the cerrado and mato grosso in past three decades lucc induced et decrease in these regions have been well documented by spera et al 2016 in sub saharan africa ordway et al 2017 indicated that tree cover loss was also extensive across woodland area due to commodity crop expansion in accordance with the above results our results indicate that the changes in lucc induced et during past three decades closely related to anthropogenic activities et changes are driven not only by lucc but also by climatic factors e g precipitation temperature piao et al 2007 shi et al 2011 the rate of change in terrestrial evaporation is estimated to be about 0 47 mm yr 2 by brutsaert 2017 based on the clausius clapeyron scaling method this rate is also consistent with the ensemble average 0 37 0 80 mm yr 2 of global reanalysis and diagnosed et products cheng et al 2017b the results of our study suggest that global lucc produced a positive and notable contribution 0 052 mm yr 2 11 1 to the terrestrial global et trend as estimated by brutsaert 2017 unfortunately current climate change impact studies to predict future water availability are based only on various climate change scenarios without consideration of land cover or land use changes which may result in either underestimation or overestimation of changes in global evapotranspiration it is widely recognized that the total et of woodland typically surpasses that of grassland under similar climate conditions because of the larger leaf area and deeper roots of woodland vegetation sheil 2018 deep rooted plants are able to maintain relatively constant evapotranspiration rate over time even during the dry periods when soil moisture in the upper layer of the soil is limited hence forest have higher average annual et than that of grassland zhang et al 2001 yang et al 2016 it implies a positive correlation between changes in forest coverage and et that is to say increase in forest area can lead to higher et generally results in fig 9 are consistent with this expectation the correlation between changes in et and woodland cover change is 0 93 however changes in et and woodland cover were in opposite directions during 1987 1991 and 1992 1996 referring to the baseline period fig 9 the wl area during these two periods was slightly larger than wl area during the baseline period but the et is smaller than that of baseline period this is resulted from the spatial mismatch of the magnitudes of net changes in wl and the magnitude of et it can be explained by fig 10 that shows tropical regions have a wider range of lucc induced et changes which suggests rate of et change is also dependent of the location the net increase in wl was largely the result of greater wl increases in the boreal regions compared with the decreases in wl in the tropical regions during these two periods boreal forests have lower et than tropical forests bonan 2008 the lucc induced decrease of mean annual et in tropical regions is greater than the lucc induced increase in boreal regions therefore et in the periods of 1987 1991 and 1992 1996 was lower than the baseline period et although wl was slightly larger our study indicates that magnitude of lucc induced et at the global scale is determined not only by the magnitude of lucc but also by where the lucc occurred 4 2 comparison of lucc induced et changes at the global scale the simulated lucc induced et changes were inconsistent with direction changes reported in previous studies gordon et al 2005 pointed out that global land use changes i e deforestation irrigation decreased terrestrial et by 400 km3 yr 1 by comparing potential vegetation distribution without human disturbances and present vegetation distribution sterling et al 2013 estimated global annual mean et decreased 3500 km3 yr 1 based on potential anthropogenic land cover maps and et observations for different land covers boisier et al 2014 reported land use changes between 1870 and 1992 reduced et by 760 720 km3 yr 1 and 1260 850 km3 yr 1 as simulated by six land surface models and an empirical et model respectively estimated lucc induced et changes in this study were in the opposite direction to those reported in these three studies there may be two possible reasons for the difference different study periods and different types of land cover changes the three studies referenced above computed past et with potential and present vegetation maps the potential vegetation map represented vegetation that would most likely have existed in the absence of human activities the present vegetation map represents land cover in the 1990s when the world had undergone large scale deforestation fearnside 1986 rudel and roper 1997 lepers et al 2005 their prescribed land cover change between the potential and present roughly represent maximum woodland loss moreover the three studies mentioned above had different types of land cover changes from the one adopted in this study their land cover changes considered only human driven loss of woodland e g removal of natural forest land for crops or grazing in contrast lucc in this study considered woodland change caused by both anthropogenic and natural factors which was not considered in the other three studies and could have led to biased estimation of lucc impacts on et in those three studies this study estimated the gradual changes in lucc induced et thereby reflecting more detailed and useful information about the impact of land use changes on et than the previous studies that estimated discontinuous lucc induced et changes for example our estimations showed lucc induced et changed from net loss to net gain compared with the baseline period 1982 1986 fig 9 and lucc contributed about 11 1 to the global et change over time this change was mainly related to variations in woodland cover the factors mainly driving woodland cover change were human activities related to food and fuel production and economic and social development since industrialization the estimated emissions from land used change mainly deforestation have contributed a quarter of the cumulative carbon emissions le quéré et al 2016 thus biospheric carbon management and trading water for carbon are proposed and afforestation is considered as an effective and available climate change mitigation option jackson 2005 canadell and schulze 2014 a more ambitious afforestation plan is contained within the paris agreement which pursues efforts to limit the global average temperature increase to 1 5 c above pre industrial levels schleussner et al 2016 because afforestation and reforestation induced that global woodland shift from net loss to net gain the carbon sink has increased in many areas such as europe and china bellassen et al 2011 lu et al 2018 however there are risks to implement afforestation as some tree plantations are likely to be located in regions with fragile ecosystems tree plantations can have considerable effects on runoff evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge including reduced stream flow and decreased soil ph and soil moisture that will endanger the sustainability of fragile ecosystems sahin and hall 1996 jackson 2005 shao et al 2019 partly due to such complexity it will be necessary to assess the hydrological impacts of lucc comprehensively and continuously when promoting land use changes for purposes of mitigating likely effects of climate 4 3 principles for separation of woodland from short vegetation the distribution and proportion of vegetation types in the avhrr vcf products reflect geographical variations of vegetation that are determined by spatial variation of climatic forcing and interactions or competition among different plant function types and species eq 13 fig 2 for separating deep rooted vegetation from sv was proposed mainly based on two ecological principles the first principle is that plant distribution is largely determined by human activities and climate conditions woodward et al 2004 morton et al 2006 forests occupy the most favorable environments where moisture is adequate for growth and survival of tall dense vegetation dominated by trees bare ground areas are found where moisture is very limiting or where temperature is so low that a continuous permanent vegetation cover cannot be maintained grassland including cropland and pasture can be considered as a transitional stage along the environmental gradient from forests to bare ground in natural or human disturbed areas therefore sv can be regarded as a transitional zone between tc and bg this classification is supported by comparison among the values of the three vegetation types in the s18 dataset supplementary fig s3 the gradual spatial variation of vegetation distribution for separating wl from tc sv is diagrammed in fig 11 this diagram provides the basic rules and assumptions to formulate eqs 5 12 the second principle is that vegetation coverage reflects the characteristics of plant abundance and is shaped by interactions among species welden and slauson 1986 goldberg and barton 1992 niu et al 2007 trees have long been viewed as competitors with grasses and there is often a strong negative correlation between tree coverage and grass coverage the coverage of tc indicates the competitiveness of this life form the higher the value of f tc f tc f sv in a mixed vegetation pixel the more competitive will be the deep rooted vegetation i e wl this means that deep rooted vegetation is the dominant life form and thus r wl tc s v is higher suggesting that f tc f tc f sv and r wl tc s v are positively related eq 8 and fig 11d b f c a larger f tc f tc f sv value means that the deep rooted vegetation is more competitive than the herbaceous plants in a given region and vice versa when f tc f tc f sv approaches 1 and 0 r wl tc s v should approach 1 and rmin respectively as shown in fig 11b c e note that the calibrated rmin 0 011 was not 0 but was very close to 0 suggesting that on average a very small fraction of sv still needs to be classified into wl even when f tc is 0 fig 11e this situation can exist where shrubs or trees appear sparsely or sporadically in a grass dominated area in order to prove the rationale for simulated f wl the modis land cover product friedl and sulla menashe 2015 was aggregated to 10 classes see detailed information in supplementary fig s4 to verify the relationship between simulated wl and 10 land cover classes the distribution of simulated f wl for these 10 land cover classes fig 12 and supplementary fig s4 shows that the highest values are observed for forests and the lowest values for barren regions a result that is consistent with our general expectation savannas and shrubland occur where trees and grasses mix and their landscape usually consists of many patches in different states of transition between grass dominated and tree dominated areas their complex states can be captured in our simulated wl because as seen in fig 12 the simulated wl of closed shrubland is higher than the simulated wl of open shrublands and the simulated wl of woody savanna is higher than the simulated wl of non woody savannas 4 4 changes in global annual woodland cover on different continents derived spatial patterns of changes in wl fig 4b were consistent with previous studies gibbs et al 2010 kuemmerle et al 2015 potapov et al 2015 spera et al 2016 brandt et al 2017 chen et al 2019 the tropical forest regions experienced significant decreases in wl the spatial patterns agree very well with the deforestation that has occurred in the cerrado region of central and southeastern brazil and east africa due to agricultural expansion gibbs et al 2010 spera et al 2016 the total area with significantly increased wl is larger than the total area with significantly decreased wl fig 4b the areas with significant increases in wl are mainly found in china eastern europe and central africa changes in china and eastern europe have largely resulted from human activities as reported by chen et al 2019 and lu et al 2018 china s greening is evidenced by long term remotely sensed vegetation data and is a result of local afforestation the wl increase in eastern europe possibly resulted from natural woodland regrowth in abandoned agricultural lands after the collapse of the soviet union kuemmerle et al 2015 potapov et al 2015 in water limited savannas of central africa such as the sahel woody plant expansion is probably driven by climate change rather than human activity where woody plant encroachment has been observed due to increases in precipitation and atmospheric carbon dioxide eamus and palmer 2007 kulmatiski and beard 2013 brandt et al 2017 the entire study period is divided into two sub periods i e period 1 1982 1993 and period 2 1995 2016 although global woodland area has a significant upward trend over entire study period during period 1 annual woodland area shows marked fluctuations with an insignificant increasing trend fig 5 0 074 yr 1 p 0 37 that is mainly because woodland area varies differently in several continents in different years asia africa and oceania see supplementary fig s5 some continents showed negative changes in woodland area with 2 1 105 km2 decrease in europe 3 1 104 km2 decrease in asia and 1 4 104 km2 decrease in north america in 1982 1993 while some continents showed positive woodland area changes with 7 8 105 km2 increase in africa 5 2 105 km2 in oceania and 1 4 104 km2 increase in south america the magnitude of reduction in woodland area is almost the same as that of increased area supplementary fig s5b the reduction in woodland area is possibly caused by the expansion of agricultural land for soybean production and grazing in southeastern brazil gibbs et al 2010 and central argentina zak et al 2008 decreased wl also existed in north america eastern europe and the siberian plain possibly driven by wild fires and or human activities tian et al 1995 spichtinger et al 2003 balzter et al 2007 increased wl in southern africa and oceania is possibly driven by climate changes and restoration after bushfires cheney 1995 eamus and palmer 2007 during the period 2 1995 2016 global woodland area increased significantly with a rate of 0 09 yr 1 fig 5 the wl increase mainly occurred in the northern hemisphere supplementary fig s5c driven by natural restoration and afforestation kuemmerle et al 2015 liu et al 2015 fang et al 2018 the increases in woodland area in asia north america europe south america oceania and africa were about 9 0 105 km2 6 0 105 km2 5 5 105 km2 4 1 105 km2 1 7 105 km2 and 1 2 105 km2 respectively 5 conclusions a large number of studies have previously examined the hydrological impacts of lucc using constructed historical land cover maps and those studies proposed that lucc reduced et in contrast the results of our analysis found that global woodland coverage changes resulted in increasing global et over time at a rate of 0 052 mm yr 2 this rate accounts for about 11 1 of the global et trend during the past several decades as estimated by brutsaert 2017 in contrast with some previous studies we found that lucc was responsible for a positive contribution to the global et trend the difference between our results and those previously published regarding changes in global et over time may be due to the fact that previously constructed lucc maps are inconsistent with our lucc maps in research time periods and types of land cover changes represented our estimation of the gradual changes in lucc induced et showed that et changes have switched from a net loss to a net gain compared with the et during the baseline period 1982 1986 these results suggest that lucc induced et changes are mainly related to anthropogenic activity reflecting the potential of human activities to alter the global water cycle this study provides a simple way to examine and quantify the effect of continuous land cover changes on global et the method is based on and constrained by observations and reduces uncertainty in quantifying the influences of lucc on the water cycle at the global scale use of the method can improve our knowledge of the net effect of the latest lucc on terrestrial water flow declaration of competing interest the authors

4498,agricultural drought has become a serious threat to the world food security and sustainable development although various characteristics have been investigated for agricultural drought assessment and early warning the propagation of meteorological drought to agricultural drought is less than clear this study investigated the spatiotemporal variations of characteristics of the propagation from meteorological drought to agricultural drought over china during the period of 1953 2012 the standardized precipitation index spi and the standardized soil moisture index ssi were used to characterize meteorological drought and agricultural drought respectively the ssi 1 and spi m 1 12 were chosen as drought propagation series by correlation analysis to evaluate the correlation and propagation time between these two droughts the probability of propagation in different regions of china was quantified using copula based models results indicated that the strongest and the weakest correlations between meteorological drought and agricultural drought were found in summer 0 8 0 9 and in winter 0 5 0 8 respectively while the propagation time increased from 1 to 2 months in summer to 2 7 months in the next spring spatially correlation and propagation sensitivity between meteorological drought and agricultural drought were greater in humid areas than in other climatic zones further the probability of agricultural drought occurrence was found to synchronously increase with the severity of meteorological drought this study will help improve drought warning and forecasting systems keywords drought propagation time copula analysis propagation probability drought vulnerable region 1 introduction drought is one of the most devastating natural hazards dai 2011 it can happen anywhere at both regional or territorial scales with severe environmental impacts such as reduction in food production and damage from forest fires allen et al 2010 for example droughts and extreme heat have reduced national cereal production by 9 10 in the last 50 years lesk et al 2016 which has led to 29 billion in losses to the agricultural market of the developing world between 2005 and 2015 fao 2018 therefore drought monitoring and early warning are critical to mitigate disasters and achieve sustainable development there are four typical types of drought wilhite 2005 including meteorological drought md agricultural drought ad hydrological drought hd and socioeconomic drought sd which respectively represent the deficit of precipitation total soil moisture streamflow and social development water the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 standardized runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 standardized soil moisture index ssi hao and aghakouchak 2013 and other drought indicators have been commonly used for detecting drought at different time scales heim 2002 liu et al 2017 in general different types of droughts are closely linked by hydrometeorological conditions mishra and singh 2010 to comprehensively illustrate the characteristics of drought application of multiple variables indices for drought assessment rather than a single variable or indicator has recently been proposed farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 hao and singh 2015 md is commonly the trigger of other types of drought and the onset of ad is usually initiated by an md event zhang et al 2019 with growing demand for water supply by the energy and industrial sectors as well as global climate change the shortage of agricultural irrigation water may increase the threat of agricultural drought dai 2013 a variety of studies have been conducted to monitor and predict ad based on empirical probabilities and statistical functions to analyze seasonal characteristics at different temporal and spatial scales sánchez et al 2018 pei et al 2016 due to the difficulty in agricultural drought monitoring some researchers have built multivariate time series models to detect ad either based on soil moisture simulated from hydrological models or other types of drought related variables including precipitation sun et al 2018 hao et al 2014 and vegetation sepulcre canto et al 2012 the relationship between different droughts especially the propagation characteristics has received significant attention in recent years guo et al 2020 ma et al 2019 van loon et al 2014 drought propagation refers to the transmission process from one type of drought to the other where a spatiotemporal lag between two droughts has been widely detected eltahir and yeh 1999 most droughts in hydrological agricultural groundwater and socioeconomic environments originate from meteorological drought barker et al 2016 xu et al 2019 han et al 2019 guo et al 2019 mo 2011 analyzed the onset and recovery of droughts in the united states and argued that the onset of meteorological drought occurred a few months earlier than did the agricultural drought during the same drought event the methods for detecting drought propagation are not only applied to the transmission time but also the intensity and duration of drought propagation and even the spatial migration bloomfield and marchant 2013 zhang and zhang 2019 grillakis 2019 studies have shown a close relationship between propagation features of different kinds of droughts apurv et al 2017 keyantash and dracup 2004 drought propagation characteristics including propagation duration intensity and probability in a specific region would largely be affected by soil characteristics vegetative types and meteorological conditions gevaert et al 2018 for example previous studies have detected that the average propagation probability of extreme state of meteorological drought resulting in moderate and severe conditions of hydrological drought increased by 13 and 2 in korea jehanzaib and kim 2020 jehanzaib et al 2020 due to monsoon climate agricultural drought in china has occurred occasionally during the last decade but has caused tremendous socioeconomic losses wang et al 2019 although much of the focus in drought propagation in china has been on regional scales huang et al 2015b the assessment of drought propagation in mainland china is lacking this study aimed to quantify the correlation and propagation characteristics between meteorological drought and agricultural drought in mainland china by regionalizing the country into four climatic zones based on rainfall isolines the spi and ssi were introduced to indicate meteorological drought and agricultural drought respectively then the spearman correlation coefficient and copula based probability method were applied to analyze the drought features between md and ad including the correlation propagation time and conditional probability distribution the objectives therefore were to 1 evaluate the relationship between md by the spi and ad by the ssi in mainland china by correlation analysis 2 estimate the propagation time from md to ad and 3 use the copula based conditional probability distribution method to estimate the propagation probabilities of ad under different severities of md mild moderate and severe this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area data and methods for characterizing drought propagation characteristics and dependence structure the results and discussion are presented in section 3 followed by conclusions in section 4 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and data mainland china was selected as the study area which is mostly located in the east asian monsoon climatic zone the precipitation exhibits distinct spatial and temporal distribution characteristics and has obvious seasonal divisions fig 1 the highly variable climatic features have formed significant precipitation and temperature gradients from south to north the annual precipitation and temperature range from 0 5 mm to 3266 5 mm and 22 c to 27 c respectively in line with the annual rainfall isolines of 200 mm 400 mm and 800 mm in china fig 1 the study area is further divided into four climatic zones including humid semi humid semi arid and arid areas yang et al 2020 the precipitation and soil moisture datasets were captured from the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research cas http hydro igsnrr ac cn public vic outputs html monthly soil moisture data 0 25 spatial resolution from 1953 to 2012 were simulated by a well established vic variable infiltration capacity model which has been widely used in the monitoring index construction and assessment of agricultural drought zhang et al 2017 huang et al 2019 the meteorological forcing data were obtained from the china meteorological administration cma and were interpolated to 0 25 for driving the vic model more detailed information referring to this vic model calibration and validation is available in zhang et al 2014 2 2 drought index the spi mckee et al 1993 is widely used as an md monitoring and analysis indicator which is calculated by precipitation data over a user defined accumulation period the spi is dimensionless and computed based on the probability distribution of precipitation the spi has been accepted as a standard drought monitoring index by the world meteorological organization wmo hayes et al 2011 for quantifying and predicting drought worldwide literatures show that the gamma distribution fits the monthly precipitation data well with a long time series mckee et al 1993 kao and govindaraju 2010 similar to the spi the ssi was introduced as an indicator of ad and can also be derived using the gamma distribution specifically a two parameter gamma probability density function was adopted to describe the frequency distribution of precipitation and soil moisture eq 1 1 g x 1 β γ α x α 1 e x β where γ α is the gamma function x denotes precipitation accumulation and α and β are the shape and scale parameters of the gamma distribution respectively which can be estimated by the maximum likelihood estimation method in this study the spi n and ssi n were introduced to analyze the md and ad during 1953 2012 where n ranges from 1 to 12 months each spi n series has been classified by drought severity such as mild drought 0 5 spi n 1 moderate drought 1 5 spi n 1 severe drought 2 spi n 1 5 and extreme drought spi n 2 ionita et al 2016 2 3 drought propagation 2 3 1 drought propagation time propagation time can be defined as the time length from the onset of the md to the beginning of ad which can be simplified into a mathematical linkage between the spi and the ssi in different accumulation periods to clearly identify short term ad the ssi 1 has been recognized as the indicator to characterize the short time scale drought condition in soil moisture furthermore using the variations in the spi with different time scales other than the single scale s spi to establish the relationship with the ssi 1 can better represent the actual environmental conditions where the spi n can indicate the accumulated precipitation deficiency during the previous n months to induce the soil moisture shortage the spearman correlation coefficient was chosen to determine the relationship between the two kinds of drought xu et al 2019 among the 12 time scales the spi n series that achieves the closest spearman correlation with the ssi 1 is identified as drought propagation series spi m where the monthly soil moisture shortage is mostly affected by the accumulated precipitation deficiency during the previous m months huang et al 2017 the time scale for ad is one month while the time scale for md is dependent on the propagation time m in each pixel the spearman correlation coefficient between the spi m and ssi 1 best in this region represents the connection between md and ad while the accumulation period m is defined as the drought propagation time it is worth noting that the drought propagation time m discussed here does not mean that ad is affected by the md event that occurred m months ago but by the accumulated md event from the previous m months following previous studies huang et al 2015b apurv et al 2017 gevaert et al 2018 we divide the propagation time based on monthly ssi 1 series and spi m series into 4 seasons spring march april and may summer june july and august autumn september october and november winter december january and february therefore we took the seasonal division of agricultural drought as the criterion of our seasonality study and focused on the accumulation time of meteorological drought which propagated to the seasonal agricultural drought the seasonal drought propagation time was obtained by averaging the propagation time over three months of each season take the drought condition in 116 125 e 39 625 n as an example the spi 3 shows the best correlation with ssi 1 in january leading to m 3 this implies that agricultural droughts in january in winter corresponds to the precipitation deficiency during the last 3 months from autumn to winter 2 3 2 conditional probabilities of ad under different md conditions a multi index model was constructed by the joint distribution function of ad and md to further quantify the propagation features between md and ad similar to several existing multi index drought assessment models such as the multivariate standardized drought index msdi hao and aghakouchak 2013 and nonparametric multivariate standardized drought index nmsdi huang et al 2019 the joint distribution can also be used to evaluate the synthetic drought characteristics chen et al 2019 instead of building the joint distribution using the fixed scale our study discussed the joint distribution pattern by using the spi with various time scale m the m is different in each month and pixel for each month the spi m which was chosen from the monthly spi n n 1 2 12 series has the highest correlation coefficient with ssi 1 among spi n series the copula method has been proven to be efficient in connecting the marginal distributions to the joint distribution for bivariate random variables mathematically given two random variables x and y with marginal distributions f x x and f y y respectively on the interval 0 1 their joint probability distribution f xy x y can be summarized as a copula function c in eq 2 as follows nelsen 2006 2 p x x y y f xy x y c f x x f y y where f x x and f y y are cumulative distribution functions cdfs for bivariate variables x and y specifically the major copula families for analyzing bivariate joint dependence structures are the elliptical copula gaussian and student s t copula and the archimedean copula clayton gumbel and frank in our study the gaussian copula was employed to model the joint distribution of spi and ssi the bivariate gaussian copula c u v function is listed in eq 3 3 c u v φ ρ φ 1 u φ 1 v where φ ρ is the bivariate gaussian distribution and ρ is the correlation coefficient according to the joint distribution formulated by the copula method we can further test the conditional probability between ad and md to estimate the probabilities of ad occurrences under different severities of md this study classified the md into four patterns mild drought moderate drought severe drought and extreme drought moreover an ssi 1 less than 0 5 was determined to be the signal for ad and the detailed negative effect on crops for different ssi values should be further discussed the occurrence probability of ad under the four given drought conditions can be formulated as follows 4 m i l d d r o u g h t p y 0 5 1 x 0 5 f xy 0 5 0 5 f xy 1 0 5 f x 0 5 f x 1 5 m o d e r a t e d r o u g h t p y 0 5 1 5 x 1 f xy 1 0 5 f xy 1 5 0 5 f x 1 f x 1 5 6 s e v e r e d r o u g h t p y 0 5 x 1 5 f xy 1 5 0 5 f x y 2 0 5 f x 1 5 f x 2 7 extreme drought p y 0 5 x 2 f xy 2 0 5 f x 2 where x and y denote the spi and ssi respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 correlation between md and ad fig 2 shows the maximum spearman correlation coefficient between the ssi 1 and spi m at the monthly time scale which implies the most likely cumulative months of meteorological drought to agricultural drought eighty percent of the study area was found to show a strong relationship between ssi 1 and spi m with spearman correlation coefficients 0 8 in spring summer and autumn spatially the correlation between meteorological drought and agricultural drought gradually weakened from south to north which may be due to the seasonal temperature and precipitation variation the seasonal correlation coefficients from 1953 to 2012 are shown in fig 3 specifically the correlation coefficients in spring summer autumn and winter range from 0 65 to 0 85 0 8 0 9 0 7 0 85 and 0 5 0 8 respectively the seasonal variation shows that climatic factors including precipitation and temperature significantly affect the relationship between md and ad the linkage between md and ad in china was closer in summer than in other seasons during june august higher temperatures caused higher evapotranspiration from soil and vegetation which tightly linked rainfall and soil moisture variations fang et al 2019 in spring and autumn the relatively low evaporation rate driven by temperature would retard the speed of the hydrometeorological cycle and reduce the correlation coefficient between md and ad the correlation between md and ad reached the weakest level in winter the moisture in the atmosphere and soil would be frozen in winter especially in northern china which would result in a lower transformation rate as well as a weaker interconnection frequency between the atmosphere and soil fu et al 2018 results in fig 3 show that the correlation coefficients between the spi m and the ssi 1 varied in different climatic zones since climatic conditions play an important role in propagation features in humid areas in southern china where there is sufficient rainfall and warm temperature md and ad have stronger correlation than that in other climatic zones in spring autumn and winter however in summer the correlation coefficient in humid areas is lower than that in other regions which may be mainly caused by intensive precipitation leading to soil saturation specifically after the soil is oversaturated the excessive precipitation will directly convert into surface runoff leading to the variation in the rainfall infiltration runoff yield relation that may also change the relationship between md and ad han et al 2019 similar average correlation coefficients were identified in semi humid and semi arid regions which reached the highest in summer 0 85 and 0 77 and the lowest in winter 0 6 and 0 55 different with plenty of rainfall during the whole year in southern china northern china where precipitation mainly occurs in summer would strengthen the linkage between md and ad gong et al 2004 furthermore a large deviation in the correlation coefficients was found in semi humid areas especially in spring and winter most of china s plains are located in semi humid regions where agriculture is more prosperous crop planting and irrigation activities may cause changes between different kinds of drought in contrast to semi humid areas pasture husbandry is the major agricultural activity in semi arid areas where soil moisture saturation mostly relies on precipitation therefore the relationship between md and ad is relatively stable which is directly affected by rainfall deficiency dracup et al 1980 yurekli and kurunc 2006 in arid areas the correlation coefficients between the spi m and ssi 1 varied greatly in the four seasons the arid area in china has been recognized to have low vegetation coverage and four distinct seasons zhao et al 2011 without the protection of vegetation climate factors increase the speed of soil weathering which results in the lower water conservation ability wu et al 2009 therefore the dynamic and random climate cause the diverse characteristics of correlation between md and ad in different seasons in winter the coefficients ranged from 0 5 to 0 7 which were the lowest correlation coefficients around china heavy snowfall in winter would be the major cause for this phenomenon as snow does not infiltrate into the soil as fast as rainfall does the correlation coefficient reached its highest value 0 8 to 0 9 in summer it was also the largest coefficient compared to that of the other climatic zones which is partly because most of the precipitation has been used to replenish the lack of soil moisture in arid areas 3 2 drought propagation time from md to ad the distribution of propagation time in china is shown in fig 4 the propagation time from md to ad in china gradually increased from south to north specifically in humid areas drought propagated much faster than in other climatic zones and displayed less than 3 months from md to ad the propagation time in arid and semi arid areas ranged from 1 to 8 months which was 1 2 months longer than that in semi humid areas this finding was consistent with studies of huang et al 2015b which showed that drought propagation time were 3 8 months in the wei river basin which is a typical semi humid and semi arid area moreover the drought propagation time in arid areas varied greatly in different regions other factors could affect the soil moisture availability including wind radiation and altitude which impact the soil moisture by influencing evapotranspiration and runoff van den hoof and lambert 2016 for example the propagation time on the tibetan plateau was relatively higher than that in the loess plateau area in humid areas the propagation time was constantly short this could indicate that drought had relatively fast response to precipitation fluctuations caused by warming weather and the intensification of the water cycle han et al 2019 the propagation time in arid semi arid and semi humid areas showed an obvious seasonal gradient regional differences in drought propagation time were most pronounced in spring fig 5 when the propagation time also reached the maximum in various regions during the year the difference was that the drought propagation time gradually reached the maximum in may 6 months april 7 months april 6 months and march 2 months from arid areas to humid areas respectively zhou et al 2021 confirmed that the propagation time from meteorological drought to agricultural drought tends to be longer in winter and spring than that in summer in main land china due to the longer drought duration in winter and spring precipitation in the form of snow during late autumn and winter would not replenish soil moisture in a timely manner until the temperatures increased sufficiently to melt snow and the soil would start to thaw therefore the soil moisture deficiency in the early spring was more related to the lack of precipitation before summer precipitation in the form of snow in late autumn and winter will not infiltrate into soil instantaneously therefore the soil moisture deficiency in the early spring could be partly caused by deficient of precipitation several months ahead e g last fall this phenomenon will last until the sufficient increase of temperatures for snowmelt when the rising temperature in spring continued to melt the snow and frozen soil the snow accumulated from late autumn and winter started to replenish the soil moisture this process can drastically shorten the propagation time by 1 2 quarters which decreases the propagation time to less than four months in may in most parts of the study area as the temperature rose above 0 earlier in the semi humid and humid region the propagation time also became shortened in summer the drought propagation time was quickly shortened to 1 2 months from may to july in most of china in a few regions such as the tibetan plateau the drought propagation time was more than 2 months which was caused by special climatic conditions in high altitude areas owing to the relatively high altitude the temperature atmospheric pressure and partial pressure of co2 would be lower which reduce the organic synthesis rate and limit the vegetative growth loehle 1998 the vegetation under this typical climatic may not need large amounts of water to boost growth which alleviates the deficiency of soil water content and therefore extends the propagation time ma et al 2017 the temperature in summer rises sharply and with abundant rainfall the soil water evaporation rate also presents an ascending trend milly 1992 when precipitation is deficient water shortages in the soil will appear immediately since summer is the growing season for vegetation plants need enough water from the soil to maintain growth qian et al 2016 agricultural drought will be more likely triggered by the lack of precipitation and the fast biochemical process rate of plants in autumn the propagation time gradually increased in september and october notably 1 3 month rise was detected in november in winter the propagation time extended further and the propagation times of december january and february were 2 4 3 5 and 4 6 months respectively 3 3 propagation of drought severity this study used the copula based method for bivariate probability analysis to quantify monthly drought propagation risk from md to ad at the pixel scale a joint distribution between md and ad based on the propagation time was modelled using the monthly ssi 1 series and its most relevant spi m series this section compares the risks of ad under four severities of md conditions fig 6 shows the empirical cumulative distribution function cdf for the ad probability which revealed the variable regional ad risk under different md severities with the development of md severity the cdf curve had moved from the left side to the right side of the panel peculiarly the probability of ad had been quantified as approximately 0 50 0 60 0 65 0 83 0 80 0 95 and 0 90 0 98 when mild md moderate md severe md and extreme md occurred respectively this feature indicated that the probability of ad occurring had synchronously increased with the severity of md the shape of the cdf curve in the arid areas was different from that in the other three climatic zones the cdf curve exhibited a relatively wide range of changes in the x axis ad probability especially in spring and autumn when moisture was critical for crop sprouting and maturity richardson et al 2010 this was mainly due to the lack of precipitation in arid areas which enlarged the effect of geographical location altitude atmospheric circulation and other factors on the ad probability wang et al 2009 likewise the vulnerability of ecosystems in arid areas would intensify the difficulties for arid areas to resist the negative effect of climate change and human activities on hydrometeorological processes which would not be conducive to the early warning of agricultural drought liu et al 2016 as a result of these features in arid areas the prediction of ad should be further discussed and should receive more attention in the future for the other three climatic zones with similar shapes of cdf curves the upper tail of the cdf shifted to the right along with the increase in precipitation this phenomenon indicated that the md occurred in southern china where under humid climate it was more likely to propagate to ad this might be due to the precipitation shortage in humid areas having larger impacts on soil moisture losses than that in the other climatic zones particularly in semi arid and semi humid areas the soil moisture may stem from not only precipitation infiltration but also melting glaciers groundwater recharge and human water regulation measures huang et al 2015a at the seasonal scale the propagation probability from mild md to ad showed a consistent feature throughout the year while moderate md and severe md had indicated that the most likely propagation from md to ad would occur in summer and autumn in particular the moderate md and severe md during august were identified to have 0 82 and 0 95 probability respectively to propagate to ad caused by the frequent soil moisture temperature interaction in summer the warm temperature and corresponding high evaporation may lead to the co occurrence of md and ad with greater probability meanwhile the agricultural drought would be expected to be more severe due to low rainfall and high temperatures hao et al 2018 these results indicate that the method for predicting ad by detecting the propagation time is more reliable in predicting the ad in summer 4 conclusions this study mainly investigated the spatiotemporal variations in propagation characteristics from md to ad including the correlation propagation time and propagation probability in china from 1953 to 2012 we calculated the seasonal propagation time in four regions through correlation analysis and the copula based method was used for bivariate probability evaluation the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 compared to the correlation coefficient in different seasons the correlation between md and ad is higher in summer 0 8 0 9 and autumn 0 7 0 85 but lower in spring 0 65 0 85 and winter 0 5 0 8 the correlation between md and ad is stronger in humid areas than in other regions 2 the propagation time from meteorological drought to agricultural drought gradually increases from southern to northern china in addition droughts propagate quickly in summer only 1 or 2 months and increase to the longest propagation time in may 6 months april 7 months april 6 months and march 2 months in arid semi arid semi humid and humid areas respectively 3 the probability of ad occurrence synchronously increases with the severity of md md is more likely to propagate to ad in summer the arid areas have wider ad probability scope especially in spring and autumn than that in other climatic zones we mainly focused on the drought propagation characteristics by statistical analysis detailed analysis of the physical mechanism of the variations in drought propagation e g propagation

4498,agricultural drought has become a serious threat to the world food security and sustainable development although various characteristics have been investigated for agricultural drought assessment and early warning the propagation of meteorological drought to agricultural drought is less than clear this study investigated the spatiotemporal variations of characteristics of the propagation from meteorological drought to agricultural drought over china during the period of 1953 2012 the standardized precipitation index spi and the standardized soil moisture index ssi were used to characterize meteorological drought and agricultural drought respectively the ssi 1 and spi m 1 12 were chosen as drought propagation series by correlation analysis to evaluate the correlation and propagation time between these two droughts the probability of propagation in different regions of china was quantified using copula based models results indicated that the strongest and the weakest correlations between meteorological drought and agricultural drought were found in summer 0 8 0 9 and in winter 0 5 0 8 respectively while the propagation time increased from 1 to 2 months in summer to 2 7 months in the next spring spatially correlation and propagation sensitivity between meteorological drought and agricultural drought were greater in humid areas than in other climatic zones further the probability of agricultural drought occurrence was found to synchronously increase with the severity of meteorological drought this study will help improve drought warning and forecasting systems keywords drought propagation time copula analysis propagation probability drought vulnerable region 1 introduction drought is one of the most devastating natural hazards dai 2011 it can happen anywhere at both regional or territorial scales with severe environmental impacts such as reduction in food production and damage from forest fires allen et al 2010 for example droughts and extreme heat have reduced national cereal production by 9 10 in the last 50 years lesk et al 2016 which has led to 29 billion in losses to the agricultural market of the developing world between 2005 and 2015 fao 2018 therefore drought monitoring and early warning are critical to mitigate disasters and achieve sustainable development there are four typical types of drought wilhite 2005 including meteorological drought md agricultural drought ad hydrological drought hd and socioeconomic drought sd which respectively represent the deficit of precipitation total soil moisture streamflow and social development water the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 standardized runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 standardized soil moisture index ssi hao and aghakouchak 2013 and other drought indicators have been commonly used for detecting drought at different time scales heim 2002 liu et al 2017 in general different types of droughts are closely linked by hydrometeorological conditions mishra and singh 2010 to comprehensively illustrate the characteristics of drought application of multiple variables indices for drought assessment rather than a single variable or indicator has recently been proposed farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 hao and singh 2015 md is commonly the trigger of other types of drought and the onset of ad is usually initiated by an md event zhang et al 2019 with growing demand for water supply by the energy and industrial sectors as well as global climate change the shortage of agricultural irrigation water may increase the threat of agricultural drought dai 2013 a variety of studies have been conducted to monitor and predict ad based on empirical probabilities and statistical functions to analyze seasonal characteristics at different temporal and spatial scales sánchez et al 2018 pei et al 2016 due to the difficulty in agricultural drought monitoring some researchers have built multivariate time series models to detect ad either based on soil moisture simulated from hydrological models or other types of drought related variables including precipitation sun et al 2018 hao et al 2014 and vegetation sepulcre canto et al 2012 the relationship between different droughts especially the propagation characteristics has received significant attention in recent years guo et al 2020 ma et al 2019 van loon et al 2014 drought propagation refers to the transmission process from one type of drought to the other where a spatiotemporal lag between two droughts has been widely detected eltahir and yeh 1999 most droughts in hydrological agricultural groundwater and socioeconomic environments originate from meteorological drought barker et al 2016 xu et al 2019 han et al 2019 guo et al 2019 mo 2011 analyzed the onset and recovery of droughts in the united states and argued that the onset of meteorological drought occurred a few months earlier than did the agricultural drought during the same drought event the methods for detecting drought propagation are not only applied to the transmission time but also the intensity and duration of drought propagation and even the spatial migration bloomfield and marchant 2013 zhang and zhang 2019 grillakis 2019 studies have shown a close relationship between propagation features of different kinds of droughts apurv et al 2017 keyantash and dracup 2004 drought propagation characteristics including propagation duration intensity and probability in a specific region would largely be affected by soil characteristics vegetative types and meteorological conditions gevaert et al 2018 for example previous studies have detected that the average propagation probability of extreme state of meteorological drought resulting in moderate and severe conditions of hydrological drought increased by 13 and 2 in korea jehanzaib and kim 2020 jehanzaib et al 2020 due to monsoon climate agricultural drought in china has occurred occasionally during the last decade but has caused tremendous socioeconomic losses wang et al 2019 although much of the focus in drought propagation in china has been on regional scales huang et al 2015b the assessment of drought propagation in mainland china is lacking this study aimed to quantify the correlation and propagation characteristics between meteorological drought and agricultural drought in mainland china by regionalizing the country into four climatic zones based on rainfall isolines the spi and ssi were introduced to indicate meteorological drought and agricultural drought respectively then the spearman correlation coefficient and copula based probability method were applied to analyze the drought features between md and ad including the correlation propagation time and conditional probability distribution the objectives therefore were to 1 evaluate the relationship between md by the spi and ad by the ssi in mainland china by correlation analysis 2 estimate the propagation time from md to ad and 3 use the copula based conditional probability distribution method to estimate the propagation probabilities of ad under different severities of md mild moderate and severe this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area data and methods for characterizing drought propagation characteristics and dependence structure the results and discussion are presented in section 3 followed by conclusions in section 4 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and data mainland china was selected as the study area which is mostly located in the east asian monsoon climatic zone the precipitation exhibits distinct spatial and temporal distribution characteristics and has obvious seasonal divisions fig 1 the highly variable climatic features have formed significant precipitation and temperature gradients from south to north the annual precipitation and temperature range from 0 5 mm to 3266 5 mm and 22 c to 27 c respectively in line with the annual rainfall isolines of 200 mm 400 mm and 800 mm in china fig 1 the study area is further divided into four climatic zones including humid semi humid semi arid and arid areas yang et al 2020 the precipitation and soil moisture datasets were captured from the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research cas http hydro igsnrr ac cn public vic outputs html monthly soil moisture data 0 25 spatial resolution from 1953 to 2012 were simulated by a well established vic variable infiltration capacity model which has been widely used in the monitoring index construction and assessment of agricultural drought zhang et al 2017 huang et al 2019 the meteorological forcing data were obtained from the china meteorological administration cma and were interpolated to 0 25 for driving the vic model more detailed information referring to this vic model calibration and validation is available in zhang et al 2014 2 2 drought index the spi mckee et al 1993 is widely used as an md monitoring and analysis indicator which is calculated by precipitation data over a user defined accumulation period the spi is dimensionless and computed based on the probability distribution of precipitation the spi has been accepted as a standard drought monitoring index by the world meteorological organization wmo hayes et al 2011 for quantifying and predicting drought worldwide literatures show that the gamma distribution fits the monthly precipitation data well with a long time series mckee et al 1993 kao and govindaraju 2010 similar to the spi the ssi was introduced as an indicator of ad and can also be derived using the gamma distribution specifically a two parameter gamma probability density function was adopted to describe the frequency distribution of precipitation and soil moisture eq 1 1 g x 1 β γ α x α 1 e x β where γ α is the gamma function x denotes precipitation accumulation and α and β are the shape and scale parameters of the gamma distribution respectively which can be estimated by the maximum likelihood estimation method in this study the spi n and ssi n were introduced to analyze the md and ad during 1953 2012 where n ranges from 1 to 12 months each spi n series has been classified by drought severity such as mild drought 0 5 spi n 1 moderate drought 1 5 spi n 1 severe drought 2 spi n 1 5 and extreme drought spi n 2 ionita et al 2016 2 3 drought propagation 2 3 1 drought propagation time propagation time can be defined as the time length from the onset of the md to the beginning of ad which can be simplified into a mathematical linkage between the spi and the ssi in different accumulation periods to clearly identify short term ad the ssi 1 has been recognized as the indicator to characterize the short time scale drought condition in soil moisture furthermore using the variations in the spi with different time scales other than the single scale s spi to establish the relationship with the ssi 1 can better represent the actual environmental conditions where the spi n can indicate the accumulated precipitation deficiency during the previous n months to induce the soil moisture shortage the spearman correlation coefficient was chosen to determine the relationship between the two kinds of drought xu et al 2019 among the 12 time scales the spi n series that achieves the closest spearman correlation with the ssi 1 is identified as drought propagation series spi m where the monthly soil moisture shortage is mostly affected by the accumulated precipitation deficiency during the previous m months huang et al 2017 the time scale for ad is one month while the time scale for md is dependent on the propagation time m in each pixel the spearman correlation coefficient between the spi m and ssi 1 best in this region represents the connection between md and ad while the accumulation period m is defined as the drought propagation time it is worth noting that the drought propagation time m discussed here does not mean that ad is affected by the md event that occurred m months ago but by the accumulated md event from the previous m months following previous studies huang et al 2015b apurv et al 2017 gevaert et al 2018 we divide the propagation time based on monthly ssi 1 series and spi m series into 4 seasons spring march april and may summer june july and august autumn september october and november winter december january and february therefore we took the seasonal division of agricultural drought as the criterion of our seasonality study and focused on the accumulation time of meteorological drought which propagated to the seasonal agricultural drought the seasonal drought propagation time was obtained by averaging the propagation time over three months of each season take the drought condition in 116 125 e 39 625 n as an example the spi 3 shows the best correlation with ssi 1 in january leading to m 3 this implies that agricultural droughts in january in winter corresponds to the precipitation deficiency during the last 3 months from autumn to winter 2 3 2 conditional probabilities of ad under different md conditions a multi index model was constructed by the joint distribution function of ad and md to further quantify the propagation features between md and ad similar to several existing multi index drought assessment models such as the multivariate standardized drought index msdi hao and aghakouchak 2013 and nonparametric multivariate standardized drought index nmsdi huang et al 2019 the joint distribution can also be used to evaluate the synthetic drought characteristics chen et al 2019 instead of building the joint distribution using the fixed scale our study discussed the joint distribution pattern by using the spi with various time scale m the m is different in each month and pixel for each month the spi m which was chosen from the monthly spi n n 1 2 12 series has the highest correlation coefficient with ssi 1 among spi n series the copula method has been proven to be efficient in connecting the marginal distributions to the joint distribution for bivariate random variables mathematically given two random variables x and y with marginal distributions f x x and f y y respectively on the interval 0 1 their joint probability distribution f xy x y can be summarized as a copula function c in eq 2 as follows nelsen 2006 2 p x x y y f xy x y c f x x f y y where f x x and f y y are cumulative distribution functions cdfs for bivariate variables x and y specifically the major copula families for analyzing bivariate joint dependence structures are the elliptical copula gaussian and student s t copula and the archimedean copula clayton gumbel and frank in our study the gaussian copula was employed to model the joint distribution of spi and ssi the bivariate gaussian copula c u v function is listed in eq 3 3 c u v φ ρ φ 1 u φ 1 v where φ ρ is the bivariate gaussian distribution and ρ is the correlation coefficient according to the joint distribution formulated by the copula method we can further test the conditional probability between ad and md to estimate the probabilities of ad occurrences under different severities of md this study classified the md into four patterns mild drought moderate drought severe drought and extreme drought moreover an ssi 1 less than 0 5 was determined to be the signal for ad and the detailed negative effect on crops for different ssi values should be further discussed the occurrence probability of ad under the four given drought conditions can be formulated as follows 4 m i l d d r o u g h t p y 0 5 1 x 0 5 f xy 0 5 0 5 f xy 1 0 5 f x 0 5 f x 1 5 m o d e r a t e d r o u g h t p y 0 5 1 5 x 1 f xy 1 0 5 f xy 1 5 0 5 f x 1 f x 1 5 6 s e v e r e d r o u g h t p y 0 5 x 1 5 f xy 1 5 0 5 f x y 2 0 5 f x 1 5 f x 2 7 extreme drought p y 0 5 x 2 f xy 2 0 5 f x 2 where x and y denote the spi and ssi respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 correlation between md and ad fig 2 shows the maximum spearman correlation coefficient between the ssi 1 and spi m at the monthly time scale which implies the most likely cumulative months of meteorological drought to agricultural drought eighty percent of the study area was found to show a strong relationship between ssi 1 and spi m with spearman correlation coefficients 0 8 in spring summer and autumn spatially the correlation between meteorological drought and agricultural drought gradually weakened from south to north which may be due to the seasonal temperature and precipitation variation the seasonal correlation coefficients from 1953 to 2012 are shown in fig 3 specifically the correlation coefficients in spring summer autumn and winter range from 0 65 to 0 85 0 8 0 9 0 7 0 85 and 0 5 0 8 respectively the seasonal variation shows that climatic factors including precipitation and temperature significantly affect the relationship between md and ad the linkage between md and ad in china was closer in summer than in other seasons during june august higher temperatures caused higher evapotranspiration from soil and vegetation which tightly linked rainfall and soil moisture variations fang et al 2019 in spring and autumn the relatively low evaporation rate driven by temperature would retard the speed of the hydrometeorological cycle and reduce the correlation coefficient between md and ad the correlation between md and ad reached the weakest level in winter the moisture in the atmosphere and soil would be frozen in winter especially in northern china which would result in a lower transformation rate as well as a weaker interconnection frequency between the atmosphere and soil fu et al 2018 results in fig 3 show that the correlation coefficients between the spi m and the ssi 1 varied in different climatic zones since climatic conditions play an important role in propagation features in humid areas in southern china where there is sufficient rainfall and warm temperature md and ad have stronger correlation than that in other climatic zones in spring autumn and winter however in summer the correlation coefficient in humid areas is lower than that in other regions which may be mainly caused by intensive precipitation leading to soil saturation specifically after the soil is oversaturated the excessive precipitation will directly convert into surface runoff leading to the variation in the rainfall infiltration runoff yield relation that may also change the relationship between md and ad han et al 2019 similar average correlation coefficients were identified in semi humid and semi arid regions which reached the highest in summer 0 85 and 0 77 and the lowest in winter 0 6 and 0 55 different with plenty of rainfall during the whole year in southern china northern china where precipitation mainly occurs in summer would strengthen the linkage between md and ad gong et al 2004 furthermore a large deviation in the correlation coefficients was found in semi humid areas especially in spring and winter most of china s plains are located in semi humid regions where agriculture is more prosperous crop planting and irrigation activities may cause changes between different kinds of drought in contrast to semi humid areas pasture husbandry is the major agricultural activity in semi arid areas where soil moisture saturation mostly relies on precipitation therefore the relationship between md and ad is relatively stable which is directly affected by rainfall deficiency dracup et al 1980 yurekli and kurunc 2006 in arid areas the correlation coefficients between the spi m and ssi 1 varied greatly in the four seasons the arid area in china has been recognized to have low vegetation coverage and four distinct seasons zhao et al 2011 without the protection of vegetation climate factors increase the speed of soil weathering which results in the lower water conservation ability wu et al 2009 therefore the dynamic and random climate cause the diverse characteristics of correlation between md and ad in different seasons in winter the coefficients ranged from 0 5 to 0 7 which were the lowest correlation coefficients around china heavy snowfall in winter would be the major cause for this phenomenon as snow does not infiltrate into the soil as fast as rainfall does the correlation coefficient reached its highest value 0 8 to 0 9 in summer it was also the largest coefficient compared to that of the other climatic zones which is partly because most of the precipitation has been used to replenish the lack of soil moisture in arid areas 3 2 drought propagation time from md to ad the distribution of propagation time in china is shown in fig 4 the propagation time from md to ad in china gradually increased from south to north specifically in humid areas drought propagated much faster than in other climatic zones and displayed less than 3 months from md to ad the propagation time in arid and semi arid areas ranged from 1 to 8 months which was 1 2 months longer than that in semi humid areas this finding was consistent with studies of huang et al 2015b which showed that drought propagation time were 3 8 months in the wei river basin which is a typical semi humid and semi arid area moreover the drought propagation time in arid areas varied greatly in different regions other factors could affect the soil moisture availability including wind radiation and altitude which impact the soil moisture by influencing evapotranspiration and runoff van den hoof and lambert 2016 for example the propagation time on the tibetan plateau was relatively higher than that in the loess plateau area in humid areas the propagation time was constantly short this could indicate that drought had relatively fast response to precipitation fluctuations caused by warming weather and the intensification of the water cycle han et al 2019 the propagation time in arid semi arid and semi humid areas showed an obvious seasonal gradient regional differences in drought propagation time were most pronounced in spring fig 5 when the propagation time also reached the maximum in various regions during the year the difference was that the drought propagation time gradually reached the maximum in may 6 months april 7 months april 6 months and march 2 months from arid areas to humid areas respectively zhou et al 2021 confirmed that the propagation time from meteorological drought to agricultural drought tends to be longer in winter and spring than that in summer in main land china due to the longer drought duration in winter and spring precipitation in the form of snow during late autumn and winter would not replenish soil moisture in a timely manner until the temperatures increased sufficiently to melt snow and the soil would start to thaw therefore the soil moisture deficiency in the early spring was more related to the lack of precipitation before summer precipitation in the form of snow in late autumn and winter will not infiltrate into soil instantaneously therefore the soil moisture deficiency in the early spring could be partly caused by deficient of precipitation several months ahead e g last fall this phenomenon will last until the sufficient increase of temperatures for snowmelt when the rising temperature in spring continued to melt the snow and frozen soil the snow accumulated from late autumn and winter started to replenish the soil moisture this process can drastically shorten the propagation time by 1 2 quarters which decreases the propagation time to less than four months in may in most parts of the study area as the temperature rose above 0 earlier in the semi humid and humid region the propagation time also became shortened in summer the drought propagation time was quickly shortened to 1 2 months from may to july in most of china in a few regions such as the tibetan plateau the drought propagation time was more than 2 months which was caused by special climatic conditions in high altitude areas owing to the relatively high altitude the temperature atmospheric pressure and partial pressure of co2 would be lower which reduce the organic synthesis rate and limit the vegetative growth loehle 1998 the vegetation under this typical climatic may not need large amounts of water to boost growth which alleviates the deficiency of soil water content and therefore extends the propagation time ma et al 2017 the temperature in summer rises sharply and with abundant rainfall the soil water evaporation rate also presents an ascending trend milly 1992 when precipitation is deficient water shortages in the soil will appear immediately since summer is the growing season for vegetation plants need enough water from the soil to maintain growth qian et al 2016 agricultural drought will be more likely triggered by the lack of precipitation and the fast biochemical process rate of plants in autumn the propagation time gradually increased in september and october notably 1 3 month rise was detected in november in winter the propagation time extended further and the propagation times of december january and february were 2 4 3 5 and 4 6 months respectively 3 3 propagation of drought severity this study used the copula based method for bivariate probability analysis to quantify monthly drought propagation risk from md to ad at the pixel scale a joint distribution between md and ad based on the propagation time was modelled using the monthly ssi 1 series and its most relevant spi m series this section compares the risks of ad under four severities of md conditions fig 6 shows the empirical cumulative distribution function cdf for the ad probability which revealed the variable regional ad risk under different md severities with

md the shape of the cdf curve in the arid areas was different from that in the other three climatic zones the cdf curve exhibited a relatively wide range of changes in the x axis ad probability especially in spring and autumn when moisture was critical for crop sprouting and maturity richardson et al 2010 this was mainly due to the lack of precipitation in arid areas which enlarged the effect of geographical location altitude atmospheric circulation and other factors on the ad probability wang et al 2009 likewise the vulnerability of ecosystems in arid areas would intensify the difficulties for arid areas to resist the negative effect of climate change and human activities on hydrometeorological processes which would not be conducive to the early warning of agricultural drought liu et al 2016 as a result of these features in arid areas the prediction of ad should be further discussed and should receive more attention in the future for the other three climatic zones with similar shapes of cdf curves the upper tail of the cdf shifted to the right along with the increase in precipitation this phenomenon indicated that the md occurred in southern china where under humid climate it was more likely to propagate to ad this might be due to the precipitation shortage in humid areas having larger impacts on soil moisture losses than that in the other climatic zones particularly in semi arid and semi humid areas the soil moisture may stem from not only precipitation infiltration but also melting glaciers groundwater recharge and human water regulation measures huang et al 2015a at the seasonal scale the propagation probability from mild md to ad showed a consistent feature throughout the year while moderate md and severe md had indicated that the most

meanwhile the agricultural drought would be expected to be more severe due to low rainfall and high temperatures hao et al 2018 these results indicate that the method for predicting ad by detecting

based models accordingly the bc modwt cnn lstm model can be viewed as a potentially useful approach to increase the accuracy of lake wl forecasts keywords forecasting wavelet transform deep learning machine learning water level great lakes 1 introduction providing strong support for global biodiversity lakes harbor important ecosystems amongst the most important lacustrine physical parameters water level wl has significant socio economic and environmental implications molinos et al 2015 a basin s natural and uncontrolled water inputs may cause an extreme rise in lakes wl necessitating the implementation of controls in advance likewise declining wls due to natural and anthropogenic factors e g climate change can also adversely affect lacustrine ecosystems forecasting lacustrine wl fluctuations with sufficient accuracy is an important element in watershed scale water budget maintenance hydraulic structure design and construction protection of critical infrastructure lake navigation management of drainage canals water quality monitoring flood control shoreline planning and more generally sustainable water resources management coulibaly 2010 developing a lake wl forecasting model that is computationally efficient reliable and accurate is therefore important several methodologies have been applied to modelling lakes wl i e for predictive and forecasting purposes employing a water balance approach and drawing upon variables influencing lake wl e g inlet and outlet discharges precipitation air temperature groundwater exchange between the aquifer and lake evaporation from the lake surface wind speed humidity etc bengtsson and malm 1997 developed an early lake wl forecasting model however besides being inefficient in terms of computational time this approach required several variables some or all of which could suffer from measurement or calculation errors later statistical and stochastic models e g arima improved lake wl model accuracy but also made restrictive assumptions such as wl time series being the result of an underlying linear process whereas hydrological time series are often nonlinear and even non stationary tokar and johnson 1999 privalsky 1988 developed a physically based stochastic dynamic model for long term lake wl modelling however it required significant computing time and a large quantity of information the latter not readily available in all cases barzegar et al 2019 zounemat kermani et al 2020 since achieving accurate lake wl simulations using these modelling approaches can be challenging researchers have increasingly explored alternative modelling approaches e g machine learning models over recent decades several machine learning ml models e g support vector regression svr genetic programming gp artificial neural networks anns have been successfully used in lake wl modelling besides their ability to handle large and complex process environments these models remove the need to mimic the complex underlying physical and hydrological processes depending rather on statistical associations between input and output variables however employing single or too many hidden layers in anns can lead to overfitting falling into local minima and gradient disappearance zhang et al 2019 moreover some ml models may be incapable of completely extracting a dataset s features wang et al 2019 accordingly in recent years deep learning dl models a new subfield of artificial intelligence ai models which address these drawbacks have been introduced as a state of the art machine learning method that draws out higher level features from raw data goodfellow et al 2016 dl has garnered a great deal of interest regarding its potential use in the field of hydrology the automatic learning features of dl models allow them to learn and map complex functional relationships between explanatory and response variables directly from data without calling upon human crafted explanatory frameworks kuremoto et al 2014 were among the first to apply a dl model to time series forecasting several studies have shown dl models to more accurately forecast hydrological variables e g water quality runoff flood and reservoir inflow than other ml methods li et al 2016 barzegar et al 2020 kao et al 2020 gao et al 2020 cheng et al 2020 forecasting models with deep structures have been shown to provide improvement in forecasting performance yang and chen 2019 common and widely used dl methods applied to time series modelling include convolutional neural networks cnn and recurrent e g long short term memory lstm neural networks rnns kim and cho 2019 wang et al 2018 barzegar et al 2020 in this study we used a hybrid cnn lstm model for lake wl forecasting as noise or measurement errors can corrupt hydrological time series time series denoising can improve forecasting accuracy barzegar et al 2018 although time series nonlinearity is addressed by ml and dl models the series nonstationary characteristics should also be addressed to achieve an accurate forecasting model evaluating commonly used wavelet transform wt time series denoising methods quilty and adamowski 2018 suggested some wt methods to be inappropriate for real world hydrological time series forecasting as i they employs future data when future data was not yet available ii wavelet filter length and decomposition levels could be chosen improperly and iii an appropriate division of calibration and validation data might not be achieved to overcome these drawbacks they suggested using a boundary corrected bc wavelet transform as outlined in quilty and adamowski 2018 in employing dl models for time series forecasting most researchers have used standalone lstm and cnn models however hybrid cnn lstm models can achieve greater forecasting accuracy kim and cho 2019 huang and kuo 2018 barzegar et al 2020 in a cnn lstm model features are extracted using cnn and then serve as inputs to the lstm architecture for regression purposes several studies huang and kuo 2018 barzegar et al 2020 have found hybrid cnn lstm models to outperform standalone cnn and lstm models hybrid cnn lstm models have been successfully employed in prediction and or forecasting applications wang et al 2018 huang and kuo 2018 barzegar et al 2020 livieris et al 2020 bogaerts et al 2020 the principal contributions of the present research are to i explore and compare the capacity of single ml e g svr or rf and hybrid cnn lstm dl models for multi step ahead wl forecasting in lakes ontario and michigan and ii develop bc modwt svr bc modwt rf and bc modwt cnn lstm forecasting models to improve the performance of standalone models i e svr rf and cnn lstm to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first study that combines bc modwt and dl models for real world hydrological forecasting purposes and the first to use dl models for lake wl forecasting the remainder of this paper is structured as follows in section 2 the methodology for the proposed models including ml i e svr rf dl i e cnn lstm and preprocessing methods i e modwt is introduced the recorded wl data and an introduction to the case studies are also presented in section 2 in section 3 the results are analyzed and a comprehensive discussion of the models performance is provided finally section 4 provides the conclusions of this study 2 methodologies in this section the methods used in this study are introduced the svr and rf models are described briefly since these two approaches are very widely used in hydrology however the cnn lstm dl model is described in greater detail as its application is new to hydrology 2 1 support vector regression svr in 1995 vapnik introduced a supervised learning model designed to overcome dimensionality issues the svr transforms nonlinear features into linear features and also increases dimensionality by way of kernel functions huang et al 2019 generally svr follows the theory of structural risk minimization srm instead of the empirical risk minimization erm employed by most traditional anns srm attempts to decrease the upper limit of generalization error whereas erm seeks to decrease the training error accordingly an svr model achieves an optimum network structure lin et al 2006 kalteh 2013 and avoids overfitting the theory and mathematical equations for svr models are provided in detail in numerous papers and books vapnik 1995 cortes and vapnik 1995 suykens and vandewalle 1999 huang et al 2005 heddam and kisi 2018 2 2 random forest rf an ensemble ml algorithm first introduced by breiman 2001 rf employs classification or regression trees for simulation purposes in this algorithm rules are built according to the response variable in the training step such that observations are partitioned so long as the resulting predictions achieve a minimum sum of squared deviations between simulated and measured values this is termed the node impurity sadler et al 2018 because regression trees can be prone to overfitting during the training process rf was introduced to overcome this drawback by using randomly chosen input and output variables in rf training until a specified number of trees is met accordingly the predicted value arrived at by rf is a mean of the predictions produced by each single regression tree mathematical equations and details on the rf model can be found in breiman 2001 svetnik et al 2003 and biau and scornet 2016 2 3 hybrid cnn lstm model the integration of cnn and lstm as a hybrid cnn lstm dl neural network designed for time series forecasting allows the cnn portion of the model to extract local trend features as well as common features which recur in the time series at different intervals lin et al 2017 tian et al 2018 the lstm then captures short and long term dependencies and learns the sequential relationships zhou et al 2015 fang et al 2020 first introduced for object recognition in image processing lecun et al 2015 cnn has a structure composed of several convolution layers pooling layers and one or more fully connected layers the cnn architecture s primary building block the convolution layer applies a convolution filter a k a kernel to input data to generate a feature map using different filters many convolutions are performed to create different feature maps these are eventually combined to produce the convolution layer s final output after the convolution layer in the pooling layer each feature map s dimension is reduced through down sampling thereby mitigating overfitting issues and reducing training time the fully connected layer achieved at the end of the cnn process is linked to the lstm barzegar et al 2020 first introduced by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 then enhanced by graves 2013 in an effort to overcome gradient disappearance issues the lstm is a variation on rnns memory blocks composed of memory cells that are coupled through layers rather than neurons as seen in anns an lstm block is composed of input forget and output gates the input gate determines which information will update the present cell state and which new candidate inputs will be included in it whereas the forget gate controls what information is entered or discarded the output gate decides what outputs to generate conditionally based on the memory of the input and block wu and lin 2019 in general an lstm block is made up of the sigmoid σ and hyperbolic tangent tanh layers and two operations including pointwise summation and multiplication operations accordingly given that x x 1 x 2 x t 1 x t are the inputs from the cnn lstm model s cnn phase the output variables y y 1 y 2 y t 1 y t can then be predicted in the lstm phase by updating the gates from time t 1 to t t mathematically these processes can be written as wu and lin 2019 input gate i t i t σ w i x t r i h t 1 b i forget gate f t f t σ w f x t r f h t 1 b f output gate y t y t σ w y x t r y h t 1 b y cell c t c t f t c t 1 i t c t c t σ w c x t r c h t 1 b c output vector h t h t y t σ c t where b i b f b y denote the input forget and output gate bias vectors respectively c t 1 and h t 1 are the previous cell and its output vector h t is the output vector x t denotes the input vector w i w f and w y are the matrix of weights from the input forget and output gates to the input respectively and r i r f and r y define the matrix of weights from the input forget and output gates to the input respectively 2 4 boundary corrected maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform bc modwt a modwt a time shift invariant redundant and non orthogonal transform approach served to decompose the two lake wl time series into wavelet and scaling coefficients introduced by percival and walden 2000 several further studies zhu et al 2014 quilty and adamowski 2018 have highlighted modwt s benefits over the discrete wavelet transform dwt despite the benefits of the modwt the dwt has been widely and often incorrectly used in forecasting details on the incorrect usage of the dwt for time series forecasting can be found in quilty and adamowski 2018 the application of modwt overcomes the dwt s need for a series with a dyadic length as n 2 j where j is a positive integer time series data rarely meet this condition in addition as modwt can eliminate data reduction by half down sampling there are n wavelet and scaling coefficients in each level of modwt decomposition percival and walden 2000 zhu et al 2014 quilty and adamowski 2018 mathematically if we suppose h j l and g j l to be the wavelet and scaling filters the modwt can be represented as percival and walden 2000 rahman et al 2020 7 h j l h j l 2 j 2 8 g j l g j l 2 j 2 where l is the length of the filter j 1 2 j is the jth scale and j is the level of decomposition the modwt wavelet w j t and scaling v j t coefficients for a given time series x x i i 0 1 n 1 are given by percival and walden 2000 rahman et al 2020 9 w j t i 0 l j 1 h j l x i l mod n 10 v j t i 0 l j 1 g j l x i l mod n where l j 2 j 1 l 1 1 additional information on the modwt approach can be found in the literature e g percival and walden 2000 quilty and adamowski 2018 mouatadid et al 2019 3 case studies and available data the two wl time series employed in the present study were those of two north american great lakes lake ontario and lake michigan fig 1 extending over an area of roughly 19 103 km2 lake ontario is bordered by the canadian province of ontario to the north and the u s state of new york to the south its canadian shores are highly populated coulibaly 2010 with an area of roughly 58 103 km2 lake michigan is the fifth largest lake in the world and is shared from west to east by the states of wisconsin illinois indiana and michigan in the usa it is joined with lake huron via the narrow open water straits of mackinac and the combined body of water is sometimes termed michigan huron mainly supplied from lake superior through st mary s river it discharges into lake erie through the st clair river scavia et al 2020 the lakes wl data were drawn from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s noaa national ocean services database the selected monthly wl measurements ranged from january 1918 to december 2018 for each lake statistical parameters for the available wl data including minimum mean maximum standard deviation skewness and kurtosis are provided in table 1 the monthly measured lake ontario wl ranged from 73 74 to 75 81 m with mean and standard deviation values of 74 76 m and 0 34 m for lake michigan the monthly wls varied between 175 57 m and 177 50 m with a mean and standard deviation of 176 42 m and 0 39 m 4 proposed model implementation several meteorological variables e g evaporation and air temperature may affect lake wl fluctuations however in this study we used wl information from the past to forecast wls in the future developing an accurate wl forecasting model using limited information is a matter of particular interest in regions where meteorological data might be unavailable defective i e missing values or of poor quality given the periodicity of wl data the lag times of the wl related to one year 12 months were chosen as the potential input of the dl models monthly wl information of up to 12 lags i e previous 12 months of wls served as potential model variables in cnn lstm based forecasting of wl t 1 wl t 2 and wl t 3 for lakes ontario and michigan therefore the cnn layer was employed to extract related features i e important wl information among 12 months lag of wl automatically and then lstm was adopted to make the forecast to develop the ml models i e rf svr and their hybrid counterparts coupled with bc modwt an input variable selection procedure was necessary to train the models using relevant inputs to obtain accurate results in this study hybrid correlation based feature selection cfs particle swarm optimization pso search was applied in the waikato environment for knowledge analysis weka software garner 1995 to choose appropriate wl lag times among wl lag times of up to 12 months to serve as inputs to ml models for multi step ahead wl forecasting the cfs a filter based approach was used as a subset evaluator using 10 fold cross validation as an evaluation mode it assists in deciding the subset of attributes by considering the single predictive ability of each feature along with the level of redundancy between them kumar et al 2016 a heuristic method motivated by the sequence of moves of a bird flock kennedy and eberhart 1995 pso uses a global search mechanism whereby every particle is supposed to catch the whole population as its topological neighbours and each particle is initialized randomly for both velocity and position in a d dimensional search space the fitness function assesses the best solution for each particle next the best previous position of a particle is recognized as the personal best pbest and the best position achieved by the swarm so far is called the global best gbest weerasinghe et al 2016 if the fitness value is superior to the pbest in memory then its position will be maintained to substitute and or update the pbest if the fitness of each pbest in the population is superior to that of gbest the gbest will be substituted by that pbest the position and velocity values of each particle are iteratively renewed to achieve the best fitness function for the problem until a predefined stopping criterion i e the maximum number of iterations or a satisfactory fitness value is satisfied the pso process for feature selection is illustrated in fig 2 more information on the cfc pso technique and its attendant equations can be found in madhu et al 2014 and singh and singh 2018 the parameters used in the present pso application are listed in table 2 the inputs selected through the pso method for developing t 1 t 2 t 3 one two and three months step ahead forecasting models are presented in table 3 different step ahead horizons need different wt lag times to accurately forecast wl for the bc modwt based models i e bc modwt ml and bc modwt dl the wl time series were decomposed using the bc modwt and then decomposition and approximation components with lag times of up to 12 months were considered as candidate variables for the ml and dl models by using the bc condition the first l j l j 2 j 1 l 1 1 wavelet and scaling coefficients affected by boundary conditions because of the chosen wavelet filter length l and decomposition level j at the commencement of the decomposed time series were eliminated in this study we considered j 1 2 7 and l 1 2 12 for different mother wavelets the proper choice of j and l is essential to guarantee an adequate number of data for model calibration and validation rahman et al 2020 for example considering a wl time series in lake michigan with a length of 1187 measurements the haar wavelet with a filter length of two l 2 and decomposition level of six j 6 led to the elimination of 64 wl measurements from the beginning of the time series fig 4 to correct the boundary of the decomposed time series when different values of l and j are considered it results in a difference in the length of the time series in no bc modwt and bc modwt models therefore the same number of boundary conditions that affect both wavelet and scaling coefficients from the commencement of both input and output variables in non bc modwt models should also be eliminated quilty and adamowski 2018 rahman et al 2020 to establish ml and dl models the dataset for all developed bc modwt and non bc modwt based ml and dl models was scaled and normalized between 0 1 to accelerate model calibration and achieve convergence in this step to develop standalone ml and dl models the dataset was portioned into calibration 70 from january 1918 to february 1988 and validation 30 from march 1988 to december 2018 subsets while dataset partitioning targeted at establishing prediction forecasting models has no set rules previous studies palani et al 2008 barzegar et al 2016 generally agree that the validation subset must employ data never used in the calibration phase and that these data should represent approximately 10 40 of the size of the calibration set after selecting the best input variables using the pso procedure these were supplied to the ml models and the models were calibrated the ml codes for the rf and svr models were developed using the open source python package scikit learn pedregosa et al 2011 while for dl the keras library also in python was employed the optimization of each model developed consisted of finding the hyper parameters yielding the lowest error in the calibration set with the expectation that these results can be generalized and applied to the validation set bengio 2000 accordingly the ml estimators were optimized using gridsearchcv a grid search tool provided by scikit learn over a list of parameter settings tables 4 and 5 to check a model s generalization ability we used a 10 fold cross validation procedure to assess the predictive performance of a model by iteratively partitioning the original dataset into calibration and validation subsets noori et al 2009 2011 the svr models were built by employing an epsilon svr kernel type equation whereby various kernel function types e g linear radial basis function rbf sigmoid and polynomial were searched using different values of the regulation factor c epsilon ε and gamma γ hyper parameters the selected optimum values of the developed standalone svr model parameters using 10 fold cross validation and grid search are listed in tables 4 and 5 for different wl forecasting models for both lakes ontario and michigan in the rf models the number of decision trees the maximum depth of the tree the minimum number of samples in each internal node the maximum number of features in each split the minimum number of samples at each leaf and the maximum number of features in each split were tuned using a grid search method the selected optimum values of these parameters for standalone rf models are given in tables 4 and 5 as a type of hierarchical feature learning dl performs automatic feature extraction from raw data without depending completely on human crafted features whereas machine learning models e g svr require an input variable selection stage before model construction therefore the input variable selection procedure was only used in building ml models here we used a cnn layer in the structure of the cnn lstm model for feature extraction in developing wavelet and non wavelet based dl models input wl variables of up to 12 months in lag time t t 1 t 2 t 12 were considered the topology of dl networks normally relies on the field of application and there is no specific universal guideline in determining the number of hidden layers navares and aznarte 2020 the proposed cnn lstm model consisted of a convolutional layer conv1d with a given filter size followed by a pooling layer an lstm layer and finally a fully connected or dense layer applied to the output layer fig 4 dropout layers were also used between the layers to overcome overfitting issues the model was compiled with an mse loss function and an optimizer the learning was stopped using the early stopping principle when the lowest mse was met in the training step the loss plots for the developed cnn lstm models are shown in fig 5 the optimum number of model parameters including optimizer activation kernel size pool size number of neurons filter size padding and dropout size were selected using a bayesian optimization bo technique in this technique the bayes theorem is used to govern the search to find the maximum or minimum of an objective function lindauer et al 2019 the bo procedure for optimization of dl model parameters followed these steps feurer and hutter 2019 ma et al 2020 1 pick a parameter set through optimizing the acquisition function 2 assess the efficiency of the parameter set by employing the dl model as an objective function 3 renew the surrogate function according to the inputs and outputs from the dl 4 repeat steps 1 to 3 or terminate the procedure if the pre set targets are encountered 5 the selected optimum values of these parameters are given in tables 4 and 5 as several previous studies e g jun and cheng 2017 ma et al 2020 have indicated selecting optimal model parameter values can improve model performance by 5 to 20 as such this step is critical in developing accurate ml and dl models 5 model performance evaluation the statistical metrics of correlation coefficient r root mean squared error rmse mean absolute error mae nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse and willmott s

results and discussion the outcomes of the developed standalone and bc modwt based ml and dl models for multi step i e one two and three months ahead wl forecasting for lakes michigan and ontario were evaluated using the previously mentioned statistical metrics as well as graphical approaches i e taylor plot and box swarm plot generally the performance of the models for both calibration and validation periods showed a good trade off indicating the good generalization capacity of the dl and ml models developed in forecasting wls while calibration and validation phase model performances are mentioned the comparison of the model accuracies is based on their validation period performance tables 6 and 7 provide accuracy statistics for the standalone cnn lstm svr and rf models in terms of r nse and wi metrics the cnn lstm models showed greater accuracy than svr or rf models for all steps ahead and both lakes wl forecasts in contrast the lowest rmse and mae based errors were achieved by cnn lstm models followed by svr and rf models therefore standalone cnn lstm dl models outperformed the svr and rf models in forecasting one month ahead wl for lake michigan the cnn lstm model r 0 992 rmse 0 042 m mae 0 034 m nse 0 985 wi 0 996 showed the best performance among the developed standalone models while the rf model r 0 979 rmse 0 069 m mae 0 054 m nse 0 959 wi 0 990 showed the poorest similarly in the case of lake ontario the cnn lstm model s t 1 forecast r 0 950 rmse 0 088 m mae 0 069 m nse 0 899 wi 0 975 showed the greatest accuracy while the rf model r 0 934 rmse 0 099 m mae 0 077 m nse 0 872 wi 0 966 showed the poorest for all standalone ml and dl models developed for lake michigan the nse ranged between 0 789 and 0 985 indicating excellent performance although the standalone models developed for t 1 forecasts of lake ontario monthly wl showed excellent performance the performances of the standalone models for t 2 and t 3 wl forecasting were different for t 2 forecasting of lake ontario wl the cnn lstm model nse 0 661 had a good performance while both the svr and rf models nse 0 461 showed an acceptable performance in contrast for t 3 wl forecasting the cnn lstm model nse 0 520 showed an acceptable performance whereas the svr nse 0 328 and rf models nse 0 295 showed a less than acceptable performance as was the case in the present study several prior studies have reported the superiority of the svr model over the rf model in forecasting lacustrine wls this was attributed to the svr s greater learning ability rajaee et al 2019 rahman et al 2020 similarly to standalone models model accuracy statistics for multi step wl forecasting for lakes michigan and ontario tables 6 and 7 respectively showed that across all time horizons the best performing hybrid model i e bc modwt coupled with ml or dl models e g bc modwt svr bc modwt rf and bc modwt cnn lstm was the bc modwt based cnn lstm model followed by the bc modwt based svr and rf models for lake michigan the bc modwt cnn lstm model s t 1 forecast r 0 994 wi 0 996 rmse 0 04 m mae 0 03 m outperformed all other models developed in contrast the bc modwt cnn lstm model s t 1 forecast of lake ontario wl showed a slightly poorer performance r 0 956 wi 0 978 rmse 0 082 m mae 0 064 m the nse of the standalone and bc modwt based hybrid ml and dl wl forecasting models for lake michigan over all time horizons indicated an excellent performance 0 789 nse 0 986 although the performance of bc modwt based models in forecasting t 1 lake ontario wl was excellent 0 865 nse 0 911 their performance was only good 0 654 nse 0 738 for t 2 forecasting based on the nse metric the performance of the bc modwt rf for t 3 wl forecasts for lake ontario was satisfactory whereas that of the bc modwt svr and bc modwt cnn lstm models was only good fig 6 shows the percentage error in terms of rmspe and mape of the developed models in lakes michigan and ontario the bc modwt approach not only decreases the cnn lstm dl models error but also their rmspe and mape are smaller than those of the bc modwt based ml models although several wavelet families including haar daubechies db symlets sym fejer korovkin fk and coiflets coif were applied to decompose the time series that served as inputs to the ml and dl models only the haar wavelet successfully improved the performance of the standalone models surprisingly most of the hybrid bc modwt ml and dl models even with different mother wavelets filter lengths l and decomposition levels j were not able to improve the performance of the standalone models this finding concurs with rahman et al 2020 who indicated that bc modwt based models are not guaranteed to outperform standalone models although an l 1 j 4 haar wavelet performed best in forecasting t 1 wl for lake michigan the haar wavelet that most improved the standalone cnn lstm model had an l 2 j 2 configuration for lake ontario the bc modwt cnn lstm model using an l 12 j 1 haar wavelet achieved the greatest forecast accuracy across all time horizons overall different l and j values achieved the best performance for the ml based models indicating that no particular filter length or decomposition level universally led to improved performance of hybrid models over the standalone models for lake wl forecasting previous studies e g quilty and adamowski 2018 2020 rahman et al 2020 have also found similar outcomes in forecasting other hydrological variables e g groundwater level urban water demand and streamflow scatter plots of the observed vs forecasted wls for lakes michigan and ontario figs 7 and 8 respectively allow for the visualization of the linear relationship between the forecasted y and observed x wl values along with the statistical metrics provided in tables 6 and 7 the scatter plots show that the model outputs were in good agreement with observed wl values for all time steps and both lakes wl values forecasted by the cnn lstm models show less scatter than other standalone models and hence provide forecasts much closer to the observed values coupling the bc modwt with the ml and dl models resulted in lower scatter in forecasted vs observed wls indicating an improvement over standalone models temporal line graphs of observed vs forecasted wls for lakes michigan and ontario figs 9 and 10 show that among the developed models the bc modwt cnn lstm forecasted wls most closely to the observed values whereas rf forecasted wls showed significant divergence from the observed wls moreover these plots show that the hybrid cnn lstm models are best at capturing the minimum and maximum wls reliant on the correlation coefficient with respect to standard deviations taylor diagrams portray a more tangible and convincing statistical relationship between forecasted and observed wls based on taylor s diagrams fig 11 bc modwt cnn lstm models showed the strongest correlation and lowest standard deviation among the standalone developed models while rf models showed the poorest correlation and largest standard deviation indicating it to be the worst model in wl forecasting for either lake the diagrams demonstrate that bc modwt based models improve the performance of the corresponding standalone models the location of the points representing the models performance is dispersed by increasing the time horizons i e location of the t 1 models points are accumulated while the location of the t 3 models points are distributed indicating that with a greater time horizon one can expect a greater difference in models performances moreover the location of the models performance points becomes more distant from the observed point with an increasing time horizon indicating that the models are accurate in forecasting smaller time horizons which concurs with the findings of barzegar et al 2017 the high accuracy of the forecasting at a shorter time horizon i e t 1 is due to the high time dependency of the shorter time steps compared to the longer time steps the box swarm plots of the observed and forecasted lake michigan and lake ontario wl values showed that for lake michigan although all developed standalone and hybrid ml and dl models except the rf models could accurately forecast the median wls q50 the cnn lstm and its corresponding bc modwt based model were able to capture the first q25 and third q75 quartiles of the wls much better than the other models fig 12 for lake ontario the bc modwt improvement of standalone models forecasts was significant and bc modwt based models were the most accurate models in terms of forecasting the q25 q50 and q75 of the wls accurately forecasting the extreme wl values i e minimum and maximum values of wl can be valuable in modeling indeed the bc modwt based models were most accurate in capturing the extreme wls indicating the forecasting power of the bc modwt based models this research demonstrates that the proposed bc modwt cnn lstm model is a promising tool in lake wl forecasting however some effort is required in finding a suitable wavelet family filter length and decomposition level as not all wavelets are successful in achieving an accurate model moreover in addition to it being an accurate wl forecasting model using the cnn lstm model avoided the time consuming step of input variable selection different feature selection methodologies may have led to different results however the cnn layer in the proposed model performs the input variable selection automatically in this study a bo technique was used to tune the optimum parameters of the dl model structure the current research is one of the rare studies in the field of time series forecasting using a tuned dl model based on the results of this study using a tuned model allows one to obtain more accurate results and avoid overfitting issues hydrological series include seasonality patterns at multiple frequencies such as annual quarterly monthly weekly and daily the lstm model is a powerful tool at modeling seasonality due to the autocorrelation feature in lstm given suitable time series data with an appropriate length lstm is able to learn and capture the seasonality and trend components instead of extracting these features a priori muzaffar and afshari 2019 for example wang et al 2020 concluded that compared to traditional forecasting methods e g autoregressive moving average model arma autoregressive fractional integrated moving average model arfima and back propagation neural network bpnn lstm models are better able to capture the periodicity in energy consumption forecasting applications although there are limited studies in the literature regarding the use of dl models in lake water level forecasting zhu et al 2020 having investigated the capability of lstm and ann models in wl forecasting for sixty nine temperate lakes in poland concluded that lstm models can successfully forecast wls in small lakes therefore it can be concluded that dl models are able to model wls not only in large lakes e g lakes ontario and michigan but also in small lakes that are more responsive to changing volume and vertical exchange than large lakes here we have compared the performance of models developed in the current study with models used in the literature for both lakes wl forecasting in a study by irvine and eberhardt 1992 they used seasonal arima to forecast wls in lake ontario at up to 6 months lead times their models obtained maes of 0 058 m 0 95 m and 120 m for one two and three month step ahead forecasts however the present study s results for both for ml and dl and their bc modwt counterpart models outperformed the seasonal arima in terms of the mae metric in another study altunkaynak 2014 developed standalone fuzzy logic fl and multilayer perceptron mlp models along with their respective wavelet based hybrid models to forecast michigan lake wl for lead times of up to 12 months ahead i e t 3 t 6 t 9 and t 12 time steps in terms of rmse the t 3 wl forecasting models had rmse values of 0 494 m for both standalone fl and mlp and rmse values of 0 139 m and 0 136 m for wavelet fl and wavelet mlp models compared to the results of the current study the developed ml and dl models performances were superior future studies could consider applying the proposed methodology to the forecasting of other hydrological time series moreover other dl models e g stacked auto encoder restricted boltzmann machine deep reinforcement learning and generative adversarial network could also be evaluated in comparison with the cnn lstm model to test the capability of the earlier mentioned dl models coupled with the wavelet method we also recommend applying different methods e g evolutionary algorithms including genetic algorithm pso etc to tune the dl model s structure it is further suggested that other suitable preprocessing methods be applied and the performance of the resulting bc modwt dl models tested although this study shows the capability of the proposed model in multistep monthly wls it is also recommended to develop the standalone and wavelet based cnn lstm models for wl forecasting with different time resolutions e g daily weekly monthly in different lakes with various sizes in future work 7 conclusions in this study standalone ml i e svr and rf and dl cnn lstm models and their corresponding hybrid bc modwt based models i e bc modwt rf bc modwt svr and bc modwt cnn lstm were proposed to generate multi step i e up to three months ahead wl forecasts for lakes michigan and ontario in north america wl time series up to lag 12 were considered as potential model inputs with the hybrid correlation based feature selection cfs particle swarm optimization pso search method being used for input variable selection while the cnn model in the structure of the cnn lstm model performed automatic input variable selection for the cnn lstm dl models after calibration 70 of the dataset and validation 30 of the rest of the dataset results were evaluated using statistical criteria and visual methods i e time series comparative plot scatter plot taylor diagram and box swarm plot the proposed standalone cnn lstm dl model outperformed the ml models moreover the svr models provided greater accuracy than rf models when using the bc modwt generated denoised time series the accuracy of the developed hybrid bc modwt based models was much better than that of the non bc modwt based models among the mother wavelets employed i e haar daubechies symlets fejer korovkin and coiflets only the haar mother wavelet operating with different filter lengths and decomposition levels was capable of improving the accuracy of the standalone models moreover most of the hybrid bc modwt ml and bc modwt dl models with different mother wavelets lengths of filter and level of decomposition were unable to improve the performance of the standalone models which concurs with the findings of the few studies published in the field of hydrological time series forecasting this research introduces the bc modwt cnn lstm model as a promising tool in multi step lake wl forecasting however it should be noted that some effort is required in finding a suitable wavelet family filter length and decomposition level because not all wavelets lead to accurate results credit authorship contribution statement rahim

december 2018 serving for validation in both standalone and wavelet machine learning models a hybrid correlation based feature selection cfs particle swarm optimization pso search method served to select input variables among candidate wl lags of up to twelve months whereas for the cnn lstm dl models input variable selection was carried out automatically by the cnn structure for the modwt based ml and dl models input time series were decomposed using a bc modwt approach scaling coefficients were developed through several mother wavelet approaches i e haar daubechies symlets fejer korovkin and coiflets with different filter lengths up to twelve and decomposition levels up to seven model performance was evaluated using several visual and statistical metrics including the correlation coefficient r the root mean standard error rmse and willmot s index wi the cnn lstm dl model outperformed the standalone svr and rf models for all time horizons coupled modwt based cnn lstm models outperformed standalone and hybrid models in wl forecasting not all wavelet family filter length decomposition combinations improved standalone models however the proposed bc modwt cnn lstm model implementing the haar mother wavelet for lake michigan one month ahead r 0 994 rmse 0 04 m wi 0 996 two months ahead r 0 979 rmse 0 07 m wi 0 989 three months ahead r 0 957 rmse 0 102 m wi 0 976 for

based models accordingly the bc modwt cnn lstm model can be viewed as a potentially useful approach to increase the accuracy of lake wl forecasts keywords forecasting wavelet transform deep learning machine learning water level great lakes 1 introduction providing strong support for global biodiversity lakes harbor important ecosystems amongst the most important lacustrine physical parameters water level wl has significant socio economic and environmental implications molinos et al 2015 a basin s natural and uncontrolled water inputs may cause an extreme rise in lakes wl necessitating the implementation of controls in advance likewise declining wls due to natural and anthropogenic factors e g climate change can also adversely affect lacustrine ecosystems forecasting lacustrine wl fluctuations with sufficient accuracy is an important element in watershed scale water budget maintenance hydraulic structure design and construction protection of critical infrastructure lake navigation management of drainage canals water quality monitoring flood control shoreline planning and more generally sustainable water resources management coulibaly 2010 developing a lake wl forecasting model that is computationally efficient reliable and accurate is therefore important several methodologies have been applied to modelling lakes wl i e for predictive and forecasting purposes employing a water balance approach and drawing upon variables influencing lake wl e g inlet and outlet discharges precipitation air temperature groundwater exchange between the aquifer and lake evaporation from the lake surface wind speed humidity etc bengtsson and malm 1997 developed an early lake wl forecasting model however besides being inefficient in terms of computational time this approach required several variables some or all of which could suffer from measurement or calculation errors later statistical and stochastic models e g arima improved lake wl model accuracy but also made restrictive assumptions such as wl time series being the result of an underlying linear process whereas hydrological time series are often nonlinear and even non stationary tokar and johnson 1999 privalsky 1988 developed a physically based stochastic dynamic model for long term lake wl modelling however it required significant computing time and a large quantity of information the latter not readily available in all cases barzegar et al 2019 zounemat kermani et al 2020 since achieving accurate lake wl simulations using these modelling approaches can be challenging researchers have increasingly explored alternative modelling approaches e g machine learning models over recent decades several machine learning ml models e g support vector regression svr genetic programming gp artificial neural networks anns have been successfully used in lake wl modelling besides their ability to handle large and complex process environments these models remove the need to mimic the complex underlying physical and hydrological processes depending rather on statistical associations between input and output variables however employing single or too many hidden layers in anns can lead to overfitting falling into local minima and gradient disappearance zhang et al 2019 moreover some ml models may be incapable of completely extracting a dataset s features wang et al 2019 accordingly in recent years deep learning dl models a new subfield of artificial intelligence ai models which address these drawbacks have been introduced as a state of the art machine learning method that draws out higher level features from raw data goodfellow et al 2016 dl has garnered a great deal of interest regarding its potential use in the field of hydrology the automatic learning features of dl models allow them to learn and map complex functional relationships between explanatory and response variables directly from data without calling upon human crafted explanatory frameworks kuremoto et al 2014 were among the first to apply a dl model to time series forecasting several studies have shown dl models to more accurately forecast hydrological variables e g water quality runoff flood and reservoir inflow than other ml methods li et al 2016 barzegar et al 2020 kao et al 2020 gao et al 2020 cheng et al 2020 forecasting models with deep structures have been shown to provide improvement in forecasting performance yang and chen 2019 common and widely used dl methods applied to time series modelling include convolutional neural networks cnn and recurrent e g long short term memory lstm neural networks rnns kim and cho 2019 wang et al 2018 barzegar et al 2020 in this study we used a hybrid cnn lstm model for lake wl forecasting as noise or measurement errors can corrupt hydrological time series time series denoising can improve forecasting accuracy barzegar et al 2018 although time series nonlinearity is addressed by ml and dl models the series nonstationary characteristics should also be addressed to achieve an accurate forecasting model evaluating commonly used wavelet transform wt time series denoising methods quilty and adamowski 2018 suggested some wt methods to be inappropriate for real world hydrological time series forecasting as i they employs future data when future data was not yet available ii wavelet filter length and decomposition levels could be chosen improperly and iii an appropriate division of calibration and validation data might not be achieved to overcome these drawbacks they suggested using a boundary corrected bc wavelet transform as outlined in quilty and adamowski 2018 in employing dl models for time series forecasting most researchers have used standalone lstm and cnn models however hybrid cnn lstm models can achieve greater forecasting accuracy kim and cho 2019 huang and kuo 2018 barzegar et al 2020 in a cnn lstm model features are extracted using cnn and then serve as inputs to the lstm architecture for regression purposes several studies huang and kuo 2018 barzegar et al 2020 have found hybrid cnn lstm models to outperform standalone cnn and lstm models hybrid cnn lstm models have been successfully employed in prediction and or forecasting applications wang et al 2018 huang and kuo 2018 barzegar et al 2020 livieris et al 2020 bogaerts et al 2020 the principal contributions of the present research are to i explore and compare the capacity of single ml e g svr or rf and hybrid cnn lstm dl models for multi step ahead wl forecasting in lakes ontario and michigan and ii develop bc modwt svr bc modwt rf and bc modwt cnn lstm forecasting models to improve the performance of standalone models i e svr rf and cnn lstm to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first study that combines bc modwt and dl models for real world hydrological forecasting purposes and the first to use dl models for lake wl forecasting the remainder of this paper is structured as follows in section 2 the methodology for the proposed models including ml i e svr rf dl i e cnn lstm and preprocessing methods i e modwt is introduced the recorded wl data and an introduction to the case studies are also presented in section 2 in section 3 the results are analyzed and a comprehensive discussion of the models performance is provided finally section 4 provides the conclusions of this study 2 methodologies in this section the methods used in this study are introduced the svr and rf models are described briefly since these two approaches are very widely used in hydrology however the cnn lstm dl model is described in greater detail as its application is new to hydrology 2 1 support vector regression svr in 1995 vapnik introduced a supervised learning model designed to overcome dimensionality issues the svr transforms nonlinear features into linear features and also increases dimensionality by way of kernel functions huang et al 2019 generally svr follows the theory of structural risk minimization srm instead of the empirical risk minimization erm employed by most traditional anns srm attempts to decrease the upper limit of generalization error whereas erm seeks to decrease the training error accordingly an svr model achieves an optimum network structure lin et al 2006 kalteh 2013 and avoids overfitting the theory and mathematical equations for svr models are provided in detail in numerous papers and books vapnik 1995 cortes and vapnik 1995 suykens and vandewalle 1999 huang et al 2005 heddam and kisi 2018 2 2 random forest rf an ensemble ml algorithm first introduced by breiman 2001 rf employs classification or regression trees for simulation purposes in this algorithm rules are built according to the response variable in the training step such that observations are partitioned so long as the resulting predictions achieve a minimum sum of squared deviations between simulated and measured values this is termed the node impurity sadler et al 2018 because regression trees can be prone to overfitting during the training process rf was introduced to overcome this drawback by using randomly chosen input and output variables in rf training until a specified number of trees is met accordingly the predicted value arrived at by rf is a mean of the predictions produced by each single regression tree mathematical equations and details on the rf model can be found in breiman 2001 svetnik et al 2003 and biau and scornet 2016 2 3 hybrid cnn lstm model the integration of cnn and lstm as a hybrid cnn lstm dl neural network designed for time series forecasting allows the cnn portion of the model to extract local trend features as well as common features which recur in the time series at different intervals lin et al 2017 tian et al 2018 the lstm then captures short and long term dependencies and learns the sequential relationships zhou et al 2015 fang et al 2020 first introduced for object recognition in image processing lecun et al 2015 cnn has a structure composed of several convolution layers pooling layers and one or more fully connected layers the cnn architecture s primary building block the convolution layer applies a convolution filter a k a kernel to input data to generate a feature map using different filters many convolutions are performed to create different feature maps these are eventually combined to produce the convolution layer s final output after the convolution layer in the pooling layer each feature map s dimension is reduced through down sampling thereby mitigating overfitting issues and reducing training time the fully connected layer achieved at the end of the cnn process is linked to the lstm barzegar et al 2020 first introduced by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 then enhanced by graves 2013 in an effort to overcome gradient disappearance issues the lstm is a variation on rnns memory blocks composed of memory cells that are coupled through layers rather than neurons as seen in anns an lstm block is composed of input forget and output gates the input gate determines which information will update the present cell state and which new candidate inputs will be included in it whereas the forget gate controls what information is entered or discarded the output gate decides what outputs to generate conditionally based on the memory of the input and block wu and lin 2019 in general an lstm block is made up of the sigmoid σ and hyperbolic tangent tanh layers and two operations including pointwise summation and multiplication operations accordingly given that x x 1 x 2 x t 1 x t are the inputs from the cnn lstm model s cnn phase the output variables y y 1 y 2 y t 1 y t can then be predicted in the lstm phase by updating the gates from time t 1 to t t mathematically these processes can be written as wu and lin 2019 input gate i t i t σ w i x t r i h t 1 b i forget gate f t f t σ w f x t r f h t 1 b f output gate y t y t σ w y x t r y h t 1 b y cell c t c t f t c t 1 i t c t c t σ w c x t r c h t 1 b c output vector h t h t y t σ c t where b i b f b y denote the input forget and output gate bias vectors respectively c t 1 and h t 1 are the previous cell and its output vector h t is the output vector x t denotes the input vector w i w f and w y are the matrix of weights from the input forget and output gates to the input respectively and r i r f and r y define the matrix of weights from the input forget and output gates to the input respectively 2 4 boundary corrected maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform bc modwt a modwt a time shift invariant redundant and non orthogonal transform approach served to decompose the two lake wl time series into wavelet and scaling coefficients introduced by percival and walden 2000 several further studies zhu et al 2014 quilty and adamowski 2018 have highlighted modwt s benefits over the discrete wavelet transform dwt despite the benefits of the modwt the dwt has been widely and often incorrectly used in forecasting details on the incorrect usage of the dwt for time series forecasting can be found in quilty and adamowski 2018 the application of modwt overcomes the dwt s need for a series with a dyadic length as n 2 j where j is a positive integer time series data rarely meet this condition in addition as modwt can eliminate data reduction by half down sampling there are n wavelet and scaling coefficients in each level of modwt decomposition percival and walden 2000 zhu et al 2014 quilty and adamowski 2018 mathematically if we suppose h j l and g j l to be the wavelet and scaling filters the modwt can be represented as percival and walden 2000 rahman et al 2020 7 h j l h j l 2 j 2 8 g j l g j l 2 j 2 where l is the length of the filter j 1 2 j is the jth scale and j is the level of decomposition the modwt wavelet w j t and scaling v j t coefficients for a given time series x x i i 0 1 n 1 are given by percival and walden 2000 rahman et al 2020 9 w j t i 0 l j 1 h j l x i l mod n 10 v j t i 0 l j 1 g j l x i l mod n where l j 2 j 1 l 1 1 additional information on the modwt approach can be found in the literature e g percival and walden 2000 quilty and adamowski 2018 mouatadid et al 2019 3 case studies and available data the two wl time series employed in the present study were those of two north american great lakes lake ontario and lake michigan fig 1 extending over an area of roughly 19 103 km2 lake ontario is bordered by the canadian province of ontario to the north and the u s state of new york to the south its canadian shores are highly populated coulibaly 2010 with an area of roughly 58 103 km2 lake michigan is the fifth largest lake in the world and is shared from west to east by the states of wisconsin illinois indiana and michigan in the usa it is joined with lake huron via the narrow open water straits of mackinac and the combined body of water is sometimes termed michigan huron mainly supplied from lake superior through st mary s river it discharges into lake erie through the st clair river scavia et al 2020 the lakes wl data were drawn from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s noaa national ocean services database the selected monthly wl measurements ranged from january 1918 to december 2018 for each lake statistical parameters for the available wl data including minimum mean maximum standard deviation skewness and kurtosis are provided in table 1 the monthly measured lake ontario wl ranged from 73 74 to 75 81 m with mean and standard deviation values of 74 76 m and 0 34 m for lake michigan the monthly wls varied between 175 57 m and 177 50 m with a mean and standard deviation of 176 42 m and 0 39 m 4 proposed model implementation several meteorological variables e g evaporation and air temperature may affect lake wl fluctuations however in this study we used wl information from the past to forecast wls in the future developing an accurate wl forecasting model using limited information is a matter of particular interest in regions where meteorological data might be unavailable defective i e missing values or of poor quality given the periodicity of wl data the lag times of the wl related to one year 12 months were chosen as the potential input of the dl models monthly wl information of up to 12 lags i e previous 12 months of wls served as potential model variables in cnn lstm based forecasting of wl t 1 wl t 2 and wl t 3 for lakes ontario and michigan therefore the cnn layer was employed to extract related features i e important wl information among 12 months lag of wl automatically and then lstm was adopted to make the forecast to develop the ml models i e rf svr and their hybrid counterparts coupled with bc modwt an input variable selection procedure was necessary to train the models using relevant inputs to obtain accurate results in this study hybrid correlation based feature selection cfs particle swarm optimization pso search was applied in the waikato environment for knowledge analysis weka software garner 1995 to choose appropriate wl lag times among wl lag times of up to 12 months to serve as inputs to ml models for multi step ahead wl forecasting the cfs a filter based approach was used as a subset evaluator using 10 fold cross validation as an evaluation mode it assists in deciding the subset of attributes by considering the single predictive ability of each feature along with the level of redundancy between them kumar et al 2016 a heuristic method motivated by the sequence of moves of a bird flock kennedy and eberhart 1995 pso uses a global search mechanism whereby every particle is supposed to catch the whole population as its topological neighbours and each particle is initialized randomly for both velocity and position in a d dimensional search space the fitness function assesses the best solution for each particle next the best previous position of a particle is recognized as the personal best pbest and the best position achieved by the swarm so far is called the global best gbest weerasinghe et al 2016 if the fitness value is superior to the pbest in memory then its position will be maintained to substitute and or update the pbest if the fitness of each pbest in the population is superior to that of gbest the gbest will be substituted by that pbest the position and velocity values of each particle are iteratively renewed to achieve the best fitness function for the problem until a predefined stopping criterion i e the maximum number of iterations or a satisfactory fitness value is satisfied the pso process for feature selection is illustrated in fig 2 more information on the cfc pso technique and its attendant equations can be found in madhu et al 2014 and singh and singh 2018 the parameters used in the present pso application are listed in table 2 the inputs selected through the pso method for developing t 1 t 2 t 3 one two and three months step ahead forecasting models are presented in table 3 different step ahead horizons need different wt lag times to accurately forecast wl for the bc modwt based models i e bc modwt ml and bc modwt dl the wl time series were decomposed using the bc modwt and then decomposition and approximation components with lag times of up to 12 months were considered as candidate variables for the ml and dl models by using the bc condition the first l j l j 2 j 1 l 1 1 wavelet and scaling coefficients affected by boundary conditions because of the chosen wavelet filter length l and decomposition level j at the commencement of the decomposed time series were eliminated in this study we considered j 1 2 7 and l 1 2 12 for different mother wavelets the proper choice of j and l is essential to guarantee an adequate number of data for model calibration and validation rahman et al 2020 for example considering a wl time series in lake michigan with a length of 1187 measurements the haar wavelet with a filter length of two l 2 and decomposition level of six j 6 led to the elimination of 64 wl measurements from the beginning of the time series fig 4 to correct the boundary of the decomposed time series when different values of l and j are considered it results in a difference in the length of the time series in no bc modwt and bc modwt models therefore the same number of boundary conditions that affect both wavelet and scaling coefficients from the commencement of both input and output variables in non bc modwt models should also be eliminated quilty and adamowski 2018 rahman et al 2020 to establish ml and dl models the dataset for all developed bc modwt and non bc modwt based ml and dl models was scaled and normalized between 0 1 to accelerate model calibration and achieve convergence in this step to develop standalone ml and dl models the dataset was portioned into calibration 70 from january 1918 to february 1988 and validation 30 from march 1988 to december 2018 subsets while dataset partitioning targeted at establishing prediction forecasting models has no set rules previous studies palani et al 2008 barzegar et al 2016 generally agree that the validation subset must employ data never used in the calibration phase and that these data should represent approximately 10 40 of the size of the calibration set after selecting the best input variables using the pso procedure these were supplied to the ml models and the models were calibrated the ml codes for the rf and svr models were developed using the open source python package scikit learn pedregosa et al 2011 while for dl the keras library also in python was employed the optimization of each model developed consisted of finding the hyper parameters yielding the lowest error in the calibration set with the expectation that these results can be generalized and applied to the validation set bengio 2000 accordingly the ml estimators were optimized using gridsearchcv a grid search tool provided by scikit learn over a list of parameter settings tables 4 and 5 to check a model s generalization ability we used a 10 fold cross validation procedure to assess the predictive performance of a model by iteratively partitioning the original dataset into calibration and validation subsets noori et al 2009 2011 the svr models were built by employing an epsilon svr kernel type equation whereby various kernel function types e g linear radial basis function rbf sigmoid and polynomial were searched using different values of the regulation factor c epsilon ε and gamma γ hyper parameters the selected optimum values of the developed standalone svr model parameters using 10 fold cross validation and grid search are listed in tables 4 and 5 for different wl forecasting models for both lakes ontario and michigan in the rf models the number of decision trees the maximum depth of the tree the minimum number of samples in each internal node the maximum number of features in each split the minimum number of samples at each leaf and the maximum number of features in each split were tuned using a grid search method the selected optimum values of these parameters for standalone rf models are given in tables 4 and 5 as a type of hierarchical feature learning dl performs automatic feature extraction from raw data without depending completely on human crafted features whereas machine learning models e g svr require an input variable selection stage before model construction therefore the input variable selection procedure was only used in building ml models here we used a cnn layer in the structure of the cnn lstm model for feature extraction in developing wavelet and non wavelet based dl models input wl variables of up to 12 months in lag time t t 1 t 2 t 12 were considered the topology of dl networks normally relies on the field of application and there is no specific universal guideline in determining the number of hidden layers navares and aznarte 2020 the proposed cnn lstm model consisted of a convolutional layer conv1d with a given filter size followed by a pooling layer an lstm layer and finally a fully connected or dense layer applied to the output layer fig 4 dropout layers were also used between the layers to overcome overfitting issues the model was compiled with an mse loss function and an optimizer the learning was stopped using the early stopping principle when the lowest mse was met in the training step the loss plots for the developed cnn lstm models are shown in fig 5 the optimum number of model parameters including optimizer activation kernel size pool size number of neurons filter size padding and dropout size were selected using a bayesian optimization bo technique in this technique the bayes theorem is used to govern the search to find the maximum or minimum of an objective function lindauer et al 2019 the bo procedure for optimization of dl model parameters followed these steps feurer and hutter 2019 ma et al 2020 1 pick a parameter set through optimizing the acquisition function 2 assess the efficiency of the parameter set by employing the dl model as an objective function 3 renew the surrogate function according to the inputs and outputs from the dl 4 repeat steps 1 to 3 or terminate the procedure if the pre set targets are encountered 5 the selected optimum values of these parameters are given in tables 4 and 5 as several previous studies e g jun and cheng 2017 ma et al 2020 have indicated selecting optimal model parameter values can improve model performance by 5 to 20 as such this step is critical in developing accurate ml and dl models 5 model performance evaluation the statistical metrics of correlation coefficient r root mean squared error rmse mean absolute error mae nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse and willmott s

and between 0 and respectively and have an ideal value of 0 ahmadisharaf et al 2019 model to model performance comparisons employ the nse nse 1 which has an ideal value of 1 when nse 0 it indicates that model performance is no better than using the mean measured wl value while an nse 0 indicates that the forecasted values diverge substantially model performance is classified as excellent 0 75

results and discussion the outcomes of the developed standalone and bc modwt based ml and dl models for multi step i e one two and three months ahead wl forecasting for lakes michigan and ontario were evaluated using the previously mentioned statistical metrics as well as graphical approaches i e taylor plot and box swarm plot generally the performance of the models for both calibration and validation periods showed a good trade off indicating the good generalization capacity of the dl and ml models developed in forecasting wls while calibration and validation phase model performances are mentioned the comparison of the model accuracies is based on their validation period performance tables 6 and 7 provide accuracy statistics for the standalone cnn lstm svr and rf models in terms of r nse and wi metrics the cnn lstm models showed greater accuracy than svr or rf models for all steps ahead and both lakes wl forecasts in contrast the lowest rmse and mae based errors were achieved by cnn lstm models followed by svr and rf models therefore standalone cnn lstm dl models outperformed the svr and rf models in forecasting one month ahead wl for lake michigan the cnn lstm model r 0 992 rmse 0 042 m mae 0 034 m nse 0 985 wi 0 996 showed the best performance among the developed standalone models while the rf model r 0 979 rmse 0 069 m mae 0 054 m nse 0 959 wi 0 990 showed the poorest similarly in the case of lake ontario the cnn lstm model s t 1 forecast r 0 950 rmse 0 088 m mae 0 069 m nse 0 899 wi 0 975 showed the greatest accuracy while the rf model r 0 934 rmse 0 099 m mae 0 077 m nse 0 872 wi 0 966 showed the poorest for all standalone ml and dl models developed for lake michigan the nse ranged between 0 789 and 0 985 indicating excellent performance although the standalone models developed for t 1 forecasts of lake ontario monthly wl showed excellent performance the performances of the standalone models for t 2 and t 3 wl forecasting were different for t 2 forecasting of lake ontario wl the cnn lstm model nse 0 661 had a good performance while both the svr and rf models nse 0 461 showed an acceptable performance in contrast for t 3 wl forecasting the cnn lstm model nse 0 520 showed an acceptable performance whereas the svr nse 0 328 and rf models nse 0 295 showed a less than acceptable performance as was the case in the present study several prior studies have reported the superiority of the svr model over the rf model in forecasting lacustrine wls this was attributed to the svr s greater learning ability rajaee et al 2019 rahman et al 2020 similarly to standalone models model accuracy statistics for multi step wl forecasting for lakes michigan and ontario tables 6 and 7 respectively showed that across all time horizons the best performing hybrid model i e bc modwt coupled with ml or dl models e g bc modwt svr bc modwt rf and bc modwt cnn lstm was the bc modwt based cnn lstm model followed by the bc modwt based svr and rf models for lake michigan the bc modwt cnn lstm model s t 1 forecast r 0 994 wi 0 996 rmse 0 04 m mae 0 03 m outperformed all other models developed in contrast the bc modwt cnn lstm model s t 1 forecast of lake ontario wl showed a slightly poorer performance r 0 956 wi 0 978 rmse 0 082 m mae 0 064 m the nse of the standalone and bc modwt based hybrid ml and dl wl forecasting models for lake michigan over all time horizons indicated an excellent performance 0 789 nse 0 986 although the performance of bc modwt based models in forecasting t 1 lake ontario wl was excellent 0 865 nse 0 911 their performance was only good 0 654 nse 0 738 for t 2 forecasting based on the nse metric the performance of the bc modwt rf for t 3 wl forecasts for lake ontario was satisfactory whereas that of the bc modwt svr and bc modwt cnn lstm models was only good fig 6 shows the percentage error in terms of rmspe and mape of the developed models in lakes michigan and ontario the bc modwt approach not only decreases the cnn lstm dl models error but also their rmspe and mape are smaller than those of the bc modwt based ml models although several wavelet families including haar daubechies db symlets sym fejer korovkin fk and coiflets coif were applied to decompose the time series that served as inputs to the ml and dl models only the haar wavelet successfully improved the performance of the standalone models surprisingly most of the hybrid bc modwt ml and dl models even with different mother wavelets filter lengths l and decomposition levels j were not able to improve the performance of the standalone models this finding concurs with rahman et al 2020 who indicated that bc modwt based models are not guaranteed to outperform standalone models although an l 1 j 4 haar wavelet performed best in forecasting t 1 wl for lake michigan the haar wavelet that most improved the standalone cnn lstm model had an l 2 j 2 configuration for lake ontario the bc modwt cnn lstm model using an l 12 j 1 haar wavelet achieved the greatest forecast accuracy across all time horizons overall different l and j values achieved the best performance for the ml based models indicating that no particular filter length or decomposition level universally led to improved performance of hybrid models over the standalone models for lake wl forecasting previous studies e g quilty and adamowski 2018 2020 rahman et al 2020 have also found similar outcomes in forecasting other hydrological variables e g groundwater level urban water demand and streamflow scatter plots of the observed vs forecasted wls for lakes michigan and ontario figs 7 and 8 respectively allow for the visualization of the linear relationship between the forecasted y and observed x wl values along with the statistical metrics provided in tables 6 and 7 the scatter plots show that the model outputs were in good agreement with observed wl values for all time steps and both lakes wl values forecasted by the cnn lstm models show less scatter than other standalone models and hence provide forecasts much closer to the observed values coupling the bc modwt with the ml and dl models resulted in lower scatter in forecasted vs observed wls indicating an improvement over standalone models temporal line graphs of observed vs forecasted wls for lakes michigan and ontario figs 9 and 10 show that among the developed models the bc modwt cnn lstm forecasted wls most closely to the observed values whereas rf forecasted wls showed significant divergence from the observed wls moreover these plots show that the hybrid cnn lstm models are best at capturing the minimum and maximum wls reliant on the correlation coefficient with respect to standard deviations taylor diagrams portray a more tangible and convincing statistical relationship between forecasted and observed wls based on taylor s diagrams fig 11 bc modwt cnn lstm models showed the strongest correlation and lowest standard deviation among the standalone developed models while rf models showed the poorest correlation and largest standard deviation indicating it to be the worst model in wl forecasting for either lake the diagrams demonstrate that bc modwt based models improve the performance of the corresponding standalone models the location of the points representing the models performance is dispersed by increasing the time horizons i e location of the t 1 models points are accumulated while the location of the t 3 models points are distributed indicating that with a greater time horizon one can expect a greater difference in models performances moreover the location of the models performance points becomes more distant from the observed point with an increasing time horizon indicating that the models are accurate in forecasting smaller time horizons which concurs with the findings of barzegar et al 2017 the high accuracy of the forecasting at a shorter time horizon i e t 1 is due to the high time dependency of the shorter time steps compared to the longer time steps the box swarm plots of the observed and forecasted lake michigan and lake ontario wl values showed that for lake michigan although all developed standalone and hybrid ml and dl models except the rf models could accurately forecast the median wls q50 the cnn lstm and its corresponding bc modwt based model were able to capture the first q25 and third q75 quartiles of the wls much better than the other models fig 12 for lake ontario the bc modwt improvement of standalone models forecasts was significant and bc modwt based models were the most accurate models in terms of forecasting the q25 q50 and q75 of the wls accurately forecasting the extreme wl values i e minimum and maximum values of wl can be valuable in modeling indeed the bc modwt based models were most accurate in capturing the extreme wls indicating the forecasting power of the bc modwt based models this research demonstrates that the proposed bc modwt cnn lstm model is a promising tool in lake wl forecasting however some effort is required in finding a suitable wavelet family filter length and decomposition level as not all wavelets are successful in achieving an accurate model moreover in addition to it being an accurate wl forecasting model using the cnn lstm model avoided the time consuming step of input variable selection different feature selection methodologies may have led to different results however the cnn layer in the proposed model performs the input variable selection automatically in this study a bo technique was used to tune the optimum parameters of the dl model structure the current research is one of the rare studies in the field of time series forecasting using a tuned dl model based on the results of this study using a tuned model allows one to obtain more accurate results and avoid overfitting issues hydrological series include seasonality patterns at multiple frequencies such as annual quarterly monthly weekly and daily the lstm model is a powerful tool at modeling seasonality due to the autocorrelation feature in lstm given suitable time series data with an appropriate length lstm is able to learn and capture the seasonality and trend components instead of extracting these features a priori muzaffar and afshari 2019 for example wang et al 2020 concluded that compared to traditional forecasting methods e g autoregressive moving average model arma autoregressive fractional integrated moving average model arfima and back propagation neural network bpnn lstm models are better able to capture the periodicity in energy consumption forecasting applications although there are limited studies in the literature regarding the use of dl models in lake water level forecasting zhu et al 2020 having investigated the capability of lstm and ann models in wl forecasting for sixty nine temperate lakes in poland concluded that lstm models can successfully forecast wls in small lakes therefore it can be concluded that dl models are able to model wls not only in large lakes e g lakes ontario and michigan but also in small lakes that are more responsive to changing volume and vertical exchange than large lakes here we have compared the performance of models developed in the current study with models used in the literature for both lakes wl forecasting in a study by irvine and eberhardt 1992 they used seasonal arima to forecast wls in lake ontario at up to 6 months lead times their models obtained maes of 0 058 m 0 95 m and 120 m for one two and three month step ahead forecasts however the present study s results for both for ml and dl and their bc modwt counterpart models outperformed the seasonal arima in terms of the mae metric in another study altunkaynak 2014 developed standalone fuzzy logic fl and multilayer perceptron mlp models along with their respective wavelet based hybrid models to forecast michigan lake wl for lead times of up to 12 months ahead i e t 3 t 6 t 9 and t 12 time steps in terms of rmse the t 3 wl forecasting models had rmse values of 0 494 m for both standalone fl and mlp and rmse values of 0 139 m and 0 136 m for wavelet fl and wavelet mlp models compared to the results of the current study the developed ml and dl models performances were superior future studies could consider applying the proposed methodology to the forecasting of other hydrological time series moreover other dl models e g stacked auto encoder restricted boltzmann machine deep reinforcement learning and generative adversarial network could also be evaluated in comparison with the cnn lstm model to test the capability of the earlier mentioned dl models coupled with the wavelet method we also recommend applying different methods e g evolutionary algorithms including genetic algorithm pso etc to tune the dl model s structure it is further suggested that other suitable preprocessing methods be applied and the performance of the resulting bc modwt dl models tested although this study shows the capability of the proposed model in multistep monthly wls it is also recommended to develop the standalone and wavelet based cnn lstm models for wl forecasting with different time resolutions e g daily weekly monthly in different lakes with various sizes in future work 7 conclusions in this study standalone ml i e svr and rf and dl cnn lstm models and their corresponding hybrid bc modwt based models i e bc modwt rf bc modwt svr and bc modwt cnn lstm were proposed to generate multi step i e up to three months ahead wl forecasts for lakes michigan and ontario in north america wl time series up to lag 12 were considered as potential model inputs with the hybrid correlation based feature selection cfs particle swarm optimization pso search method being used for input variable selection while the cnn model in the structure of the cnn lstm model performed automatic input variable selection for the cnn lstm dl models after calibration 70 of the dataset and validation 30 of the rest of the dataset results were evaluated using statistical criteria and visual methods i e time series comparative plot scatter plot taylor diagram and box swarm plot the proposed standalone cnn lstm dl model outperformed the ml models moreover the svr models provided greater accuracy than rf models when using the bc modwt generated denoised time series the accuracy of the developed hybrid bc modwt based models was much better than that of the non bc modwt based models among the mother wavelets employed i e haar daubechies symlets fejer korovkin and coiflets only the haar mother wavelet operating with different filter lengths and decomposition levels was capable of improving the accuracy of the standalone models moreover most of the hybrid bc modwt ml and bc modwt dl models with different mother wavelets lengths of filter and level of decomposition were unable to improve the performance of the standalone models which concurs with the findings of the few studies published in the field of hydrological time series forecasting this research introduces the bc modwt cnn lstm model as a promising tool in multi step lake wl forecasting however it should be noted that some effort is required in finding a suitable wavelet family filter length and decomposition level because not all wavelets lead to accurate results credit authorship contribution statement rahim
