24840,process based models of plant productivity provide a means of yield prediction that can inform best practices in agriculture and land management however current biophysical models fail in capturing both genotypic and phenotypic variation under changing environmental conditions physiological traits affecting final yield and ecosystem productivity are the result of gene expression protein translation and metabolite formation which are controlled by specific alleles acting alone and in response to time and environmental cues biophysical interactions take place simultaneously across several scales of time and space giving rise to high levels of complexity and limiting the predictive capacity of existing analytical approaches while statistical methods can partially quantify genotype by environment connections biophysical process models miss exploring genotypic diversity and they cannot currently be implemented with omics data i e the entire collection of entities such as gene transcripts metabolites and proteins here we present a novel framework that utilizes bayesian networks to provide probabilities that link gene expression levels to trait occurrence we propose the use of these gained probabilities to inform parameters of existing biophysical models merging transcriptomic information into process based models allows for greater integration of empirical data and

markedly improved agricultural practices and management of ecosystem services power 2010 baldocchi et al 2001 however to correctly simulate ecosystem processes it is necessary to define relevant pathways and the direct or indirect connections among all components of the system affecting the overall system s organization and complexity as well as relationships with other systems moreover energy and information streams across scales in both time and space have to be acknowledged to obtain an integrated and predictive understanding of the continuously occurring matter and energy flows in each system current biophysical models are often incapable of capturing plant response to changes in interactions between novel genotype and unexpected environment such as regular circadian oscillations or sporadic external fluctuations wallach and thorburn 2017 confalonieri et al 2016 pogson et al 2012 this is partly because predictions are built on plant traits measured at the organ level and often based on data that do not span multiple time points and conditions existing process models using biophysical principles to predict crop and ecosystem response to climate change are also unable to incorporate the impact of evolutionary responses on relevant traits fitzpatrick and keller 2015 weinig et al 2014 lately computational system biology with multi level and hybrid models has helped to better characterize the behavior of multi cellular systems but often the information comes from different scientific domains with relative formalisms leading to uncertain whole plant predictions chang et al 2019 bardini et al 2017 mele et al 2015 this lack of predictive capacity at the whole plant level is exacerbated by the existing knowledge gap regarding processes that modulate the relationship between genome the full complement of genetic material in an organism and phenome the complete sets of observable traits expressed by an organism interacting with the environment märtens et al 2016 nevo 2001 indeed phenotypic variation of quantitative traits i e varying on a continuous scale requires changes in alleles alternative forms of a gene at many loci with small effect wallace et al 2014 the identification of causal loci of small phenotypic effect is limited by statistical power rockman 2012 and the phenotypic effects of many loci are environment specific meaning that these loci contribute to phenotypic variance in only some settings as a consequence of the complex relationship between genome and phenome the genetic architecture i e the complexity of the underlying genetic basis of composite physiological traits and their impact on plant productivity has remained unclear progress has been slow in deciphering the fundamental processes linking genes and quantitative traits due to the functional complexity of biological systems kohl et al 2010 noble 2012 2008 genome and phenome are associated by non linear multivariate associations spanning various

organisms exchange mass and energy with the environment and each other marshall colon et al 2017 jarvis 1995 the directionality of causation in the chain of events from genome to phenome includes also many feedback mechanisms such as the impact of metabolites on gene control do amaral and souza 2017 noble 2008 this whole biological complexity leads to high plasticity in phenotype a single genotype

prediction modeling framework have been undertaken technow et al 2015 despite this progress the full potential of leveraging genomic information for process based models is yet to be realized because of knowledge gaps related to connecting genomic variation with intermediate transcriptomic variation overall the current approaches to clarify genome phenome associations are sitting on opposite ends

this globally cultivated crop is an excellent study system to connect organ level measures both down to the level of transcriptomics and up to final growth and yield the genus brassica shows a pronounced range of phenotypic variation making it an excellent candidate to test biophysical models predictions edwards et al 2012 ashraf and mehmood 1990 biophysical trait observations and tissue collection for rna sequencing analysis were performed every four hours over a period of 48 h while short this time period represents an excellent test case to illustrate transcriptome to phenome

stomatal conductance chlorophyll a fluorescence were used to build the bayesian network we focus our attention on traits highly relevant to the whole plant carbon assimilation barbagallo et al 2003 frank et al 2014 measurements were conducted on the youngest fully expanded leaves of 16 day old plants photosynthetic rate a and stomatal conductance gs were measured according to the protocol

directional acyclic graph represents relationships between variables koller and friedman 2009 pearl 1988 fig 2 a these relationships are represented by arrows indicating the directionality for the information flow from a parent node to a child node the strength of the relationships is quantifiable through conditional probability distributions where the probability of a node is conditionally independent of all other nodes given its parents this property allows a large network to be decomposed into smaller local distributions easing the interpretation and computation of a large multivariate model fig 2b bayesian networks have been previously demonstrated to be reliable in integrating phenotypic and genetic information into a concise probabilistic model moharil et al 2016 such a model using prior knowledge and learning algorithms is helpful to phenomenologically constrain variables based on empirical information and it can also dictate the most probable structure of the graphical output given the data gerber and brookshire 2014 koller and friedman 2009 scutari 2010 tsamardinos et al 2006 2 3 terrestrial regional ecosystem exchange simulator trees the terrestrial regional ecosystem exchange simulator trees is a process based model that simulates carbon and water dynamics from biophysical first principles e g energy and mass transfer along the soil plant atmosphere continuum from organs to ecosystems and from minutes to years wang et al 2019 johnson et al 2018 tai et al 2018 tai et al 2017 millar et al 2017 mcdowell et al 2016 mackay et al 2015 mcdowell et al 2013 mackay et al 2012 loranty et al 2010 ewers et al 2008 samanta et al 2008 samanta et al 2007 trees runs on half hourly time steps and takes in meterological data e g wind speed radiation temperature and parameters that describe the plant environment system e g rooting architecture hydraulic vulnerability in thirty minutes time steps the model outputs a suite of plant traits such as stomatal conductance photosynthetic rate leaf water potential and carbon allocation across organs while this model has been applied primarily to woody slow growing perennial species it has been recently updated to simulate rapid growing small herbaceous plants via a new canopy growth sub model wang et al 2019 the current study utilizes this most recent version of the biophysical model details on the trees version and all files for input parameters drivers and outputs can be found at https github com crguadagno baynetworkimplementedtrees for baseline simulations trees was run for a 17 d period using the b rapa r500 parameter set from wang et al 2019 all outputs are shown for the last 5 days of the simulation fig 3 for the bayesian network informed simulations we allowed trees input parameters gsref and φj to vary based on probabilities derived from the network for low medium and high gene expression fig 6 gsref refers to the value of stomatal conductance gs in the absence of water or photosynthetic limitation at a vapor pressure deficit d of 1 kpa while the parameter φj indicates the efficiency of the electron transport mackay et al 2012 loranty et al 2010 samanta et al 2008 samanta et al 2007 specifically gsref values were derived from stomatal conductance probabilities from the network this was done following the relationship oren et al 1999 g s r e f g s m l n d where gs is the weighted mean for each expression level of the gene module of choice from the network d is the average vapor pressure deficit from the utilized dataset from which the transcriptomic data were derived greenham et al 2017 and the coefficient m equals 0 54 from the brassica updated version of trees wang et al 2019 input values for the informed model for φj were derived from fv fm probabilities from the network using the following relationship φ j f v f m p α where fv fm is the weighted mean for each expression level of the gene module of choice from the network probabilities p refers to the partitioning of electrons between psi and psii and assumed to be 0 5 and α is the leaf absorbance and equals 0 85 yin et al 2004 manter 2004 genty et al 1989 in all simulations baseline and network informed we allowed the driving photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd to span between 0 and 2000 μmol m 2 s 1 to simulate outdoor radiation conditions relevant to ecosystem scale modeling nightly precipitation inputs were used to maintain a state of zero soil water stress throughout each simulation period while all other model input parameters were fixed using representative values for b rapa wang et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 baseline simulations using a process based model using the brassica rapa oilseed cultivar r500 we ran trees simulations under natural outdoor conditions outputs for gas exchange variables fig 3 are shown as time series peaks at the end of each light period are reported for g s fig 3 bottom panel corresponding to more minor increases in an fig 3 top panel as expected when g s is the most limiting factor sperry et al 2017 biophysical models such as trees give us the opportunity to gain knowledge by inference on the dynamics of traits relevant to plant productivity over time including traits that may not readily be measured but can be constrained by first principles of mass and energy budgets such as root system architecture mackay et al 2015 johnson et al 2018 however while genes play fundamental roles in controlling ecosystem scale processes as well as crop yield such as the cycling of water carbon and nitrogen the incorporation of omic data into ecosystem models is still in its infancy coles et al 2017 empirical observations directly collected via field and or laboratory experiments or indirectly from literature values have been essential to estimate pertinent and accurate physiological parameters for biophysical plant models millar et al 2017 mackay et al 2015 oren et al 1999 current approaches would require enormous and prohibitive sample sizes to fully explore and quantify how genomic variation leads to variation in gene expression as the environment changes here we use a bayesian network approach to show how transcriptomic frequencies affect traits occurrence and ultimately plant growth predictions in order to mechanistically advance the relation between genes and biophysically relevant traits 3 2 bayesian network development using transcriptomic and physiological data from greenham et al 2017 we built a bayesian network to capture direct and indirect relationships in b rapa r500 plants over a two day period the resulting full network shows each observed physiological trait e g an g s etc represented as its own node fig 2b we pooled genes exhibiting similar expression levels over time into equally weighted gene module nodes since highly correlated variables can inflate the number of false positives we mainly investigated the direct relationships involving biophysical traits useful to clarify mass and energy flows fig 2b specifically g s shows a relationship with photosynthetic efficiency measured here in terms of both carbon assimilation an and efficiency in light utilization fv fm fig 2b green nodes this chlorophyll a fluorescence parameter is strictly correlated to the trees output j rate of the electron transport between photosystem ii and photosystem i as previously thoroughly described yin et al 2009 baker et al 2007 yin et al 2004 manter 2004 genty et al 1989 the physiological traits of interest exhibit direct connections to several gene modules m nodes purple an being the parent node of module 44 m44 fv fm of m23 and g s of m54 respectively fig 2b the gene trait relationships highlighted by the network can be investigated using gene ontology go annotations to clarify the function of specific genes mi et al 2017 for our network gene functions for each module showed plausible involvement in the biophysical pathway for the traits of interest for instance m23 contains genes with recognized roles in abiotic stress response and in the hormonal signaling for plant defense which have been both previously showed to influence the dynamics of fv fm berens et al 2017 hazen et al 2003 the utility of bayesian networks extends far beyond its topology and the straightforward probabilistic connections between transcripts and physiological traits for instance we can produce discrete conditional probability distributions associated with each node an is conditionally independent from the rest of the network given its parents fv fm and g s fig 4 b as a consequence if we empirically observe i e measure fv fm and g s we do not need to look any further than its associated conditional probability table to estimate the probability of observing a certain value for an fig 4a we can plot the probability of observing an within a particular interval given all possible combinations of fv fm rows and g s columns when fv fm is 0 00 night time and g s is in the range of 0 27 0 67 credibility is allocated equally amongst all intervals since these values were never observed together in the data the network reflects the uncertainty as a flat distribution low predictive capabilities once the network structure has been established the network can be used to answer queries about the variables within the network using the network itself as a model koller and friedman 2009 evidence either actualized or hypothesized from a section of the network can be propagated generating updated probabilities and quantifying network wide effects of observed variables koller and friedman 2009 therefore if we have no evidence of fv fm and g s when querying the network information from indirect relationships can be utilized to predict an the ultimate trait of interest for final growth prediction fig 1d fig 5 shows explicitly how we can use backpropagation through the network to quantify probable transcript trait relationships when parent nodes are not observed specifically we see how gene expression frequency for m23 can be used to predict fv fm fig 5a and g s fig 5b when the expression of m23 is high there is 87 chance that fluorescence will be high fig 5a propagating the information from m23 back one step further we see that when m23 expression is high g s is most likely 44 chance to be within 0 27 0 41 mmol h2o m 2 s 1 fig 5b we can see how inference can be propagated throughout the network from a single variable extending this to include multiple gene modules will be an easy implementation within the bayesian network framework despite the need to augment our knowledge regarding process based connections there is no standard protocol for connecting transcripts to relevant biophysical traits moreover current bayesian networks need broader validation across more time intensive datasets as the structure of the network is highly contingent upon the choice of algorithm and the nature of the data set tsamardinos et al 2006 husmeier 2003 our framework allows us to develop quantifiable hypotheses needham 2009 between frequencies of gene expression and traits which can be tested iteratively in biophysical models such as trees 3 3 implementation of trees via bayesian network analyses our framework suggests the possible use of two separate approaches working in concert compensating for the other s weaknesses while bayesian networks excel in capturing the uncertainty of the plant system and our measurements of it they do not mechanistically explain the relationships between biophysical traits and transcripts they currently only hint at the processes leading to this uncertainty ay and arnosti 2011 additionally bayesian networks acyclic by definition cannot capture the frequent feedback loops occurring in biology mosconi et al 2008 although dynamic bayesian networks can incorporate cycles the number of spurious edges increases with the small sample size typical of biological experiments e g 30 time points husmeier 2003 in contrast process based models can incorporate cycles and feedback loops with mechanistic detail leading to emergent properties therefore we can model dynamics through process based models filling the gaps in bayesian network modeling our framework explicitly associates changes in biophysical traits to the expression frequency of a gene module using the relationships from the bayesian network fig 5 by breaking down an integrated mass and energy based outcome such as yield or productivity into smaller scale biophysically relevant processes it is possible to predict phenomic outcomes and testing them with relevant biophysical traits increases tardieu et al 2017 we implemented trees with the trait variability gained from the network we informed the model input parameters gsref and φj in trees using probabilities of g s and fv fm gained using the bayesian network fig 5a five day trees simulations are shown using values of gsref and φj expected for low red solid line medium blue dashed line and high purple dotted line expression levels of module 23 fig 6 values of 0 35 0 25 and 0 37 were used for gsref for low medium and high expression levels respectively while values of 0 23 0 16 and 0 28 were used for φj for low medium and high expression levels respectively all other input parameters were maintained as in the baseline simulations fig 2 the updated variability in an and g s indeed provides large scale insight from small scale transcriptomic information thus the final uncertainty is based on the changing probability of g s and fv fm with gene expression as derived from the bayesian network interestingly the transcriptomic informed simulations show an overall higher rate of assimilation rate and intriguing variations in stomatal conductance at night time fig 6 with potential mechanisms associated with circadian clocks nutrient uptake and drought response greenham et al 2017 previous work has used bayesian posterior updates to test how one set of relevant biophysical traits may predict others mackay et al 2012 and our framework here extends this to include a network approach using transcriptomics information we suggest that probabilistically implemented biophysical models will result in an increased prognostic power leading to more realistic predictions of plant growth and ecosystem processes 4 conclusions currently predictions on changes in energy balance and mass flow at the crop productivity and ecosystem scale are often misleading missing the processes of genetic control and response in the system we presented a novel framework that utilizes bayesian networks to provide conditional probabilities between gene expression levels and relevant physiological traits we used the gained probabilities to implement the biophysical model trees the results from the trees simulations fig 6 highlight the impact of trait variability on biophysical model outputs we anticipate that probabilistic implemented simulations and their uncertainty bounds will refine predictions of water use and biomass increase for similar first principles biophysical process models our framework will likely improve models that make predictions of crop yields and carbon sequestration at the ecosystem scale using genetic information wymore et al 2011 by lowering the amount of empirical physiological data required for parametrization to be collected shortening the times to provide meaningful predictions of phenotypes relevant to crop yield and ecosystem productivity ultimately increasing models predictive power conditional probabilities from the network may also point to areas of biophysical models in need of modification or additional complexity achieving probabilistic connections between gene expression and physiological traits represents an important step in predicting the genome to phenome of complex quantitative biophysical traits and may provide

been recently updated to simulate rapid growing small herbaceous plants via a new canopy growth sub model wang et al 2019 the current study utilizes this most recent version of the biophysical model details on the trees version and all files for input parameters drivers and outputs can be found at https github com crguadagno baynetworkimplementedtrees for baseline simulations trees was run for a 17 d period using the b rapa r500 parameter set from wang et al 2019 all outputs are shown for the last 5 days of the simulation fig 3 for the bayesian network informed simulations we allowed trees input parameters gsref and φj to vary based on probabilities derived from the network for low medium and high gene expression fig 6 gsref refers to the value of stomatal conductance gs in the absence of water or photosynthetic limitation at a vapor pressure deficit d of 1 kpa while the parameter φj indicates the efficiency of the electron transport mackay et al 2012 loranty et al 2010 samanta et al 2008 samanta et al 2007 specifically gsref values were derived from stomatal conductance probabilities from the network this was done following the relationship oren et al 1999 g s r e f g s m l n d where gs is the weighted mean for each expression level of the gene module of choice from the network d is the average vapor pressure deficit from the utilized dataset from which the transcriptomic data were derived greenham et al 2017 and the coefficient m equals 0 54 from the brassica updated version of trees wang et al 2019 input values for the informed model for φj were derived from fv fm probabilities from the network using the following relationship φ j f v f m p α where fv fm is the weighted mean for each expression level of the gene module of choice from the network probabilities p refers to the partitioning of electrons between psi and psii and assumed to be 0 5 and α is the leaf absorbance and equals 0 85 yin et al 2004 manter 2004 genty et al 1989 in all simulations baseline and network informed we allowed the driving photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd to span between 0 and 2000 μmol m 2 s 1 to simulate outdoor radiation conditions relevant to ecosystem scale

values for b rapa wang et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 baseline simulations using a process based model using the brassica rapa oilseed cultivar r500 we ran trees simulations under natural outdoor conditions outputs for gas exchange variables fig 3 are shown as time series peaks at the end of each light period are reported for g s fig 3 bottom panel corresponding to more minor increases in an fig 3 top panel as expected when g s is the most limiting factor sperry et al 2017 biophysical models such as trees give us the opportunity to gain knowledge by inference on the dynamics of traits relevant to plant productivity over time including traits that may not readily be measured but can be constrained by first principles of mass and energy budgets such as root system architecture mackay et al 2015 johnson et al 2018 however while genes play fundamental roles in controlling ecosystem scale processes as well as crop yield such as the cycling of water carbon and nitrogen the incorporation of omic data into ecosystem models is still in its infancy coles et al 2017 empirical observations directly collected via field and or laboratory experiments or indirectly from literature values have been essential to estimate pertinent and accurate physiological parameters for biophysical plant models millar et al 2017 mackay et al 2015 oren et al 1999 current approaches would require enormous and prohibitive sample sizes to fully explore and quantify how genomic variation leads to variation in gene expression as the environment changes here we use a bayesian network approach to show how transcriptomic frequencies affect traits occurrence and ultimately plant growth predictions in order to mechanistically advance the relation between genes and biophysically relevant traits 3 2 bayesian network development using transcriptomic and physiological data from greenham et al 2017 we built a bayesian network to capture direct and indirect relationships in b rapa r500 plants over a two day period the resulting full network shows each observed physiological trait e g an g s etc represented as its own node fig 2b we pooled genes exhibiting similar expression levels over time into equally weighted gene module nodes since highly correlated variables can inflate the number of false positives we mainly investigated the direct relationships involving biophysical traits useful to clarify mass and energy flows fig 2b specifically g s shows a relationship with photosynthetic efficiency measured here in terms of both carbon assimilation an and efficiency in light utilization fv fm fig 2b green nodes this chlorophyll a fluorescence parameter is strictly correlated to the trees output j rate of the electron transport between photosystem ii and photosystem i as previously thoroughly described yin et al 2009 baker et al 2007 yin et al 2004 manter 2004 genty et al 1989 the physiological traits of interest exhibit direct connections to several gene modules m nodes purple an being the parent node of module 44 m44 fv fm of m23 and g s of m54 respectively fig 2b the gene trait relationships highlighted by the network can be investigated using gene ontology go annotations to clarify the function of specific genes mi et al 2017 for our network gene functions for each module showed plausible involvement in the biophysical pathway for the traits of interest for instance m23 contains genes with recognized roles in abiotic stress response and in the hormonal signaling for plant defense which have been both previously showed to influence the dynamics of fv fm berens et al 2017 hazen et al 2003 the utility of bayesian networks extends far beyond its topology and the straightforward probabilistic connections between transcripts and physiological traits for instance we can produce discrete conditional probability distributions associated with each node an is conditionally independent from the rest of the network given its parents fv fm and g s fig 4 b as a consequence if we empirically observe i e measure fv fm and g s we do not need to look any further than its associated conditional probability table to estimate the probability of observing a certain value for an fig 4a we can plot the probability of observing an within a particular interval given all possible combinations of fv fm rows and g s columns when fv fm is 0 00 night time and g s is in the range of 0 27 0 67 credibility is allocated equally amongst all intervals since these values were never observed together in the data the network reflects the uncertainty as a flat distribution low predictive capabilities once the network structure has been established the network can be used to answer queries about the variables within the network using the network itself as a model koller and friedman 2009 evidence either actualized or hypothesized from a section of the network can be propagated generating updated probabilities and quantifying network wide effects of observed variables koller and friedman 2009 therefore if we have no evidence of fv fm and g s when querying the network information from indirect relationships can be utilized to predict an the ultimate trait of interest for final growth prediction fig 1d fig 5 shows explicitly how we can use backpropagation through the network to quantify probable transcript trait relationships when parent nodes are not observed specifically we see how gene expression frequency for m23 can be used to predict fv fm fig 5a and g s fig 5b when the expression of m23 is high there is 87 chance that fluorescence will be high fig 5a propagating the information from m23 back one step further we see that when m23 expression is high g s is most likely 44 chance to be within 0 27 0 41 mmol h2o m 2 s 1 fig 5b we can see how inference can be propagated throughout the network from a single variable extending this to include multiple gene modules will be an easy implementation within the bayesian network framework despite the need to augment our knowledge regarding process based connections there is no standard protocol for connecting transcripts to relevant biophysical traits moreover current bayesian networks need broader validation across more time intensive datasets as the structure of the network is highly contingent upon the choice of algorithm and the nature of the data set tsamardinos et al 2006 husmeier 2003 our framework allows us to develop quantifiable hypotheses needham 2009 between frequencies of gene expression and traits which can be tested iteratively in biophysical models such as trees 3 3 implementation of trees via bayesian network analyses our framework suggests the possible use of two separate approaches working in concert compensating for the other s weaknesses while bayesian networks excel in capturing the uncertainty of the plant system and our measurements of it they do not mechanistically explain the relationships between biophysical traits and transcripts they currently only hint at the processes leading to this uncertainty ay and arnosti 2011 additionally bayesian networks acyclic by definition cannot capture the frequent feedback loops occurring in biology mosconi et al 2008 although dynamic bayesian networks can incorporate cycles the number of spurious edges increases with the small sample size typical of biological experiments e g 30 time points husmeier 2003 in contrast process based models can incorporate cycles and feedback loops with mechanistic detail leading to emergent properties therefore we can model dynamics through process based models filling the gaps in bayesian network modeling our framework explicitly associates changes in biophysical traits to the expression frequency of a gene module using the relationships from the bayesian network fig 5 by breaking down an integrated mass and energy based outcome such as yield or productivity into smaller scale biophysically relevant processes it is possible to predict phenomic outcomes and testing them with relevant biophysical traits increases tardieu et al 2017 we implemented trees with the trait variability gained from the network we informed the model input parameters gsref and φj in trees using probabilities of g s and fv fm gained using the bayesian network fig 5a five day trees simulations are shown using values of gsref and φj expected for low red solid line medium blue dashed line and high purple dotted line expression levels of module 23 fig 6 values of 0 35 0 25 and 0 37 were used for gsref for low medium and high expression levels respectively while values of 0 23 0 16 and 0 28 were used for φj for low medium and high expression levels respectively all other input parameters were maintained as in the baseline simulations fig 2 the updated variability in an and g s indeed provides large scale insight from small scale transcriptomic information thus the final uncertainty is based on the changing probability of g s and fv fm with gene expression as derived from the bayesian network interestingly the transcriptomic informed simulations show an overall higher rate of assimilation rate and intriguing variations in stomatal conductance at night time fig 6 with potential mechanisms associated with circadian clocks nutrient uptake and drought response greenham et al 2017 previous work has used bayesian posterior updates to test how one set of relevant biophysical traits may predict others mackay et al 2012 and our framework here extends this to include a network approach using transcriptomics information we suggest that probabilistically implemented biophysical models will result in an increased prognostic power leading to more realistic predictions of plant growth and ecosystem processes 4 conclusions currently predictions on changes in energy balance and mass flow at the crop productivity and ecosystem scale are often misleading missing the processes of genetic control and response in the system we presented a novel framework that utilizes bayesian networks to provide conditional probabilities between gene expression levels and relevant physiological traits we used the gained probabilities to implement the biophysical model trees the results from the trees simulations fig 6 highlight the impact of trait variability on biophysical model outputs we anticipate that probabilistic implemented simulations and their uncertainty bounds will refine predictions of water use and biomass increase for similar first principles biophysical process models our framework will likely improve models that make predictions of crop yields and carbon sequestration at the ecosystem scale using genetic information wymore et al 2011 by lowering the amount of empirical physiological data required for parametrization to be collected shortening the times to provide meaningful predictions of phenotypes relevant to crop yield and ecosystem productivity ultimately increasing models predictive power conditional probabilities from the network may also point to areas of biophysical models in need of modification or additional complexity achieving probabilistic connections between gene expression and physiological traits represents an important step in predicting the genome to phenome of complex quantitative biophysical traits and may provide

24841,identifying the drivers of species richness is a crucial for biodiversity conservation and community ecology in this paper the maximum utilization efficiency of water resources available to community is determined as the assembly law in an ecologically stable community with limited water resources a plant community diversity model that incorporates water potential impedance is established and the optimization model of community biodiversity structure was obtained based on water niche is also derived it is shown that this optimization model can theoretically derive a species area function similar to the traditional island biogeography curve and it can also verify the predicted values of the species area relationship experimentally and validated by long term observations of plant diversity survey data according to the model analyses the total number of individuals n and the number of species s are determined by the combination of the water resources factors the total quantity of available water resources in the growth season the individual biological factors the water consumption per unit mass of species in unit time the complementary factors of inter and intra species water niche the difference in water potential depending on the water use efficiency of the community and plant community function factors the total productivity of plant community and as the area of plant communities increases the heterogeneity of the water environment has increased by adaptation and coevolution more species are able to go through environmental and biological filtration becoming community species that can utilize more available water resources at different spatial scales changes in water resources resulted in the community maximizing the utilization efficiency of water resources by adjusting the number and abundance of species the main driving force for the increasing number of species is the full utilization of available water resources keywords community assembly diversity theory water limited ecosystems water potential impedance model water niche model 1 introduction the community ecology has been developing rapidly with many theories attempting to explain the patterns of species diversity and abundance the neutral theory metapopulation and metacommunity theories generalized fraction poisson distribution and entropy theory and so on have been developed in the past 20 years hubbell 2005 volkov et al 2005 mcgill 2010 violle et al 2012 harte and newman 2014 these theories start with radically different assumptions and the theories seem extremely different from each other to form a model with reasonable hypothesis verifiable and convincible predictions further research is still needed in essence the distribution of plant diversity is mainly related to the niches of different species obviously the establishment of a biodiversity niche model from the perspective of resource competition is of great significance to the in depth analysis of the mechanisms which is the foundation of the formation and maintenance of biodiversity as well as the improvement of prediction accuracy the most important and basic resource for plant communities is water tilman 1982 jobbágy et al 2011 silvertown et al 2015 especially in arid areas where water resources are scarce water determines the global distribution pattern vegetation and the vegetation types within a region jirka et al 2009 jobbágy et al 2011 at the local scale water also affects carbon dioxide capture soil nutrient availability plant growth and development microbial activity and interspecific interactions although the hydrological niche of plant communities has been verified by experiments in many studies silvertown et al 2015 garcía baquero et al 2016 letten et al 2015 the current theoretical research literature is insufficient at present niche theory based on resource competition fails to explain the diversity of tropical rain forest hubbell 2005 in water limited terrestrial ecosystem with environmental filtration and biological filtration intra and inter specific interactions plant community species can maximize utilization efficiency of community water resource at the individual level of the plant there is a trade off between relative growth rate rgr and water use efficiency wue in different species of a community huxman and venable 2013 at the population level each species has its own niche and there is niche differentiation even for the same resource li et al 2000 nmcgill 2010 niche differentiation is conducive to avoid competition and achieve species coexistence from the perspective of water resource utilization this niche differentiation ensures that more available water resources are fully utilized at the same time different species also have niche overlapped because of the overlap of their functional traits violle et al 2012 when the niche overlaps the competition for available water resources within the community is the most intense which stands for the most efficient use of available water resources at the community level available water resources have spatiotemporal changes and their distribution is fractal distribution bird et al 2000 in order to make full use of available water resources based on species interactions the community is surely to obtain characteristics related to fractal characteristics harte and newman 2014 although a community cannot evolve directly through genetic change as species communities evolve by improving the capacity of the entire community to exist verboef and morin 2010 therefore the community eventually realizes the utilization efficiency of available water resources to the maximum extent to attain the status of an ecologically stable community and to match the living environment trautz et al 2017 in this paper in water limited terrestrial ecosystem plant community species can maximize water resource utilization efficiency to the community including water resource utilization characteristics at the individual and population level all of which are used as the basis for our model construction on the other hand in the development of plant diversity theory the central unanswered question is what determines the total number of individuals n and the number of species s mcgill 2010 s and n are always inputs in existing diversity theory what drives these despite mcgill calling the unified theory a theory of biodiversity in every case the species richness s and number of individuals n are inputs to the model rather than predictions mutshinda et al 2009 mcgill 2010 violle et al 2012 to date the greatest success in the study of these factors has been empirical i e looking for correlations with environmental variables where factors like productivity climate and altitude seem important this paper attempts to answer this question based on the theory of the water niche the main context is shown in fig 1 based on interspecific and intraspecific interactions in water niche and the maximum utilization efficiency of available water resources in an ecologically stable community a water niche theoretical model of plant diversity is established and also validated using published survey data this model we intend to answer in what determine s the number of species and n the total number of individuals as well as what is the driver of the species area relationship 2 methods 2 1 establishment of the plant diversity model based on water niche the formation of plant community diversity involves environmental filtration and biological filtration in water limited plant communities biological filtration of interspecific and intraspecific interactions is based on the trade offs between the utilization efficiency of water resources and the relative growth rate huxman and venable 2013 stable communities are established when water resource utilization is maximized zuppinger dingley et al 2014 trautz et al 2017 this ecologically stable community is similar to the dynamic equilibrium of island biogeographic communities macarthur and wilson 1967 the functional traits of plants have globally consistent effects on competition and trade offs between high growth rate and competitive tolerance stabilize species coexistence huxman and venable 2013 using experimental observations huxman et al have suggested that there is a trade off between relative growth rate rgr and water use efficiency wue in different species of a community although two individuals may consume the same amount of water resources they may be intraspecific and interspecific differences in the temporality of individual growth barabãs and d andrea 2016 this is also the main reason for species coexistence within a water niche in an ecologically stable community the evolutionary stability theorem stearns 1992 entails that the amount of water needed to produce unit mass of ith species and the amount of biomass produced by other species in a community are equal to the amount of biomass produced by ith species and the amount of water needed to produce unit mass of other species in the community odum 1969 let w 0 i water consumption per unit mass of ith species in unit time in an ecologically stable community w 0 i w was constant see supporting material s1 let i i be the average water consumption of ith species over unit time m i be the total biomass production of the ith species ci be the average water consumption of one individual member of the ith species which also is water consumption per unit of growth of mass or birth of i species r i be the water potential impedance at individual level n i be the number of i species individual and p i be the mass production power of the ith species i 1 2 s s being the number of species we can then set up the equality p i m i t i u i i i where i i c i t i u i m i c i c i m i t i w 0 i in the system of resource cycling the average water potential impedance of the ith species is r i at the individual level r i is defined as r i u i 2 p i therefore u i i i r i according to the rule of competitive exclusion organisms of the same species have similar niches the use of water resources is similar to a circuit and different individuals of the same species form a parallel relationship therefore the water potential impedance of the population level r i can be seen as follows r i r i n i for the hydrological niches among multiple species there is niche differentiation and overlap jobbágy et al 2009 silvertown et al 2015 garcía baquero et al 2016 letten et al 2015 fort 2015 herein the water potential impedance function at the plant community level is referred to as ohm s law of the plant community when water niches overlap the utilization efficiency of water resources should be maximized see fig 2 the significance of the plant community maximizing water resource is that water resources are fully utilized when the hydrological niches are completely separated when the water niche overlaps the water resistance reaches the minimum jirka et al 2009 the aim of the community evolution is to make full use of water resources if water is the limiting resource in a stable community barkaoui et al 2017 trautz et al 2017 the utilization efficiency of water resources is maximized with the constant potential difference of a local community u therefore the optimization model of community biodiversity structure was obtained see fig 3 which can be expressed as follows y 0 m a x u 2 u 1 2 n 1 p 1 u 2 2 n 2 p 2 u s 2 n s p s s t i 1 s n i c i c i 1 2 3 s where s is the number of species of a local community in area a and c is the total quantity of available water resources in the growth season because of soils with a fractal pore size distribution bird et al 2000 it is assumed that the available water resources follow the fractal distribution in area a of the community li 2002 the relationship is described as follows c a a z where a is a constant and z is the fractal distribution constant a is a constant related to water supply such as the amount of water resources per unit area such as multi year average z was related to the distribution of water resources available determined by the soils and the extent of their reuse in the community for example the z value of grassland should be less than the z value of forest see table 1 we know that there was relationship among length l volume v and area a i e l 3 v l 2 a in general z is between 1 and 1 5 y0 is the maximum power production capacity of the plant community such as total productivity and u is the difference of water potential at the community level in the niche overlapping period water use efficiency of the community it is particularly noteworthy that the optimization model of community biodiversity structure is consistent with our published formula in terms of evolutionary stable community results han and liu 2019 3 results 3 1 species richness and the number of individuals in plant communities based on a water niche model the above model has a unique solution and the optimal structure of the community can be determined from the above results we know that the number of individuals s and the relationship between the species richness s and the maximum power of the plant community y 0 are as follows for additional details please see supporting material s1 1 s u c w y 0 2 n i 1 s n i c c w where c s i 1 s 1 c i 3 n i n 1 c i i 1 s 1 c i where y 0 is the maximum power of the plant community c is the total quantity of available water resources in the growth season w is the water consumption per unit mass per unit time s is the species richness n is the number of individuals of community c i is the average water consumption of one individual of ith species which also is the water consumption per unit of growth of mass or birth of ith species and u is the difference of water potential at the community level in the niche overlap period the total number of individuals n and the number of species s in the water limited plant community are determined by a combination of biological factors i e the average water consumption of one individual and the water consumption per unit mass per unit time environmental factors i e the total quantity of available water resources in the growth season and adaptive factors i e the maximum power of the plant community and the difference of water potential at the community level 4 verification 4 1 experimental verification due to similarities in habitat the maximum power of the plant community y 0 is proportional to the area a of the community and the average community fitness of the unit area h is constant y 0 a h from equations s u c w y 0 and c a a z the species area curve volkov 2005 mcgill 2010 he and hubbell 2011 is expressed as s b a z where z 0 5 z 1 and b u w a h this is a new species area curve but the ecological significance of its parameters can be clearly seen in the formula for the species area curve z is the fractal dimension of resources in space ranging from 1 to 1 5 therefore the range of z in the evolutionarily stable community is below 0 25 but greater than 0 due to the presence of the edge effect of underground resources the area corresponding to actual resources utilization in experimental sampling is larger than the area occupied by the community other parameters in s b a z are shown in fig 4 the number of individuals and the species richness was determined by the average water consumption of one individual of the ith species the total quantity of available water resources in the growth season the water consumption per unit mass per unit time the maximum power of the plant community and the difference of water potential at the community level in the niche overlap period for the same total amount of resources and the same level of resource utilization efficiency greater species diversity lowers the maximum power of the plant community this sets an upper limit for plant diversity van moorsel et al 2017 the available water resource utilization of the community is maximized by allowing more suitable species to enter which is the main driver of the increasing number of species in the community as the area of the community increases the species area curve adopts an exponential function as z 0 5 z 1 0 when z 1 in c a a z there is reuse of available water resources in the community due to the optimal density of species within the original area the community has more available water resources as the area of the community increases this is because h y 0 a and h is a constant for an ecologically stable community if s remained unchanged with the increase in a we obtain the following inequality h a a a z u 2 w s 2 where a u and w are constants in order to use these additional available water resources the available water resource power of the community is maximized by allowing more suitable species to enter which increases s at the same time the increase in the species number of the community also contributes to an increase in the community stability loreau 2010 loreau and mazancourt 2013 4 2 theoretical verification our model can also help clarify the dispute over the interpretation of the species area curve especially in terms of the relationship between the power index and 0 25 drakare et al 2006 qian et al 2007 dengler and boch 2008 according to the current literature the area curve is a power function whose power exponent is close to 0 25 see table 1 to test this model we focused on the z values of species area curves and conducted only qualitative tests for other parameters with our model the spatial fractal distribution of water resources led the power index of the area curve to be less than 0 25 this may explain the relationship between exponential data and the value 0 25 there are several insights that result from this theoretical framework the model illustrates that nested sampling can reduce the edge effect and interference resulting in a good fit but a power index that is slightly larger than 0 25 with independent combination sampling there may be edge effects in above ground and below ground systems that can partially offset each other resulting in more interference from sampling and a power index that is less than 0 25 it is important to verify that an ecologically stable community in a constant area can maintain stable community power via adapting to environmental resource fluctuations by adjusting the community structure herein we hypothesized that the maximum power of the plant community y 0 was a constant an appropriate experimental index was chosen by considering the available water resource utilization efficiency of a community u c as the reciprocal of the mean specific leaf area of the given community sla leaf area dry mass dwyer et al 2014 in other words u c 1 s l a c a a z where a is a constant and z is the fractal distribution constant a is a constant related to water supply such as the amount of water resources per unit area such as multi year average and z was related to the distribution of water resources available so here the hypothesis was that c a z k 1 p k 2 where k 1 and k 2 are constants and p is the total water supply in the community thus a simple relation was obtained from eq 1 4 s s l a 2 k 1 p k 2 k 1 w k 1 a z y 0 k 2 w k 2 a z y 0 therefore a plant diversity model based on the water niche was built to quantitatively describe the relationship among species richness individual characteristics sla and the total water resources available eq 4 predicts that fluctuations in the community s available water resources will result in adjustments to the community structure thereby maintaining community water power stability globally community diversity has been increasing and decreasing over the recent decades these changes have seldom been linked to climatic changes in a heterogeneous california grassland plant diversity declined between 2000 and 2014 on the local community scale 5 m2 and on the landscape scale 27 km2 across multiple functional groups and soil environments serpentine and non serpentine soil harrison et al 2015 we tested our theory by analyzing data on the grassland community fig 5 collected at different temporal and spatial scales the datasets were published within the past 15 years we found that the results were consistent with the predictions of our model these datasets support the conclusion that the community can maximize the utilization efficiency of available water resources by adjusting the number and abundance of species in response to changes in water resources it can be seen in fig 5 that there are other factors affecting the relationship between richness and environmental factors therefore a particularly high r 2 value is impossible to obtain 5 discussion in this paper the theoretical model based on water niche is deducted and verified by theoretical and data verification this model can explain the main characteristics of plant diversity and is an enrichment and improvement of existing plant diversity theories our model deduction is based on maximizing the utilization efficiency of available water resources of an ecologically stable community in water limited terrestrial ecosystem maximizing the efficiency of available water resources in ecologically stable communities is determined by the heterogeneity of the water environment and the characteristics of species adaptation and evolution since the heterogeneity of the water environment exists objectively if there is water there will be corresponding adaptations and distribution of the organisms different species niche differentiation is obvious occupying different habitats the same species can also share similar habitats through plastic genetic and non genetic changes such as plant size age and developmental differences although the community was built through environmental and biological filtration no matter what process the community goes through the resource utilization efficiency is the ultimate goal of the community and other functional indicators serve the same goal therefore the community itself is an evolutionary process loreau 2010 evolutionary community ecology is developed from a synthesis of insights from evolutionary theory genetics and traditional ecology this synthesis has grown into a broad branch of inquiry with important results for example there have been important discoveries about intraspecific density dependence as seen in experimental results at the population level we discovered that this intraspecific density dependent intensity could be explained separately from the perspective of both biophysics and evolutionary stability li et al 2000 han et al 2014 although evolutionary ecology at the community level was proposed very early whittaker 1968 odum 1969 the theory has developed very slowly loreau 2010 loreau and mazancourt 2013 herschgreen et al 2011 and the existing studies are mainly experimental van moorsel et al 2017 the optimization model of our community biodiversity structure is consistent with the published formula for evolutionary stable community results han and liu 2019 therefore the combination of stable community evolution and maximization of resource efficiency should be an interesting research focus for future studies therefore it is believed that theoretical research based on maximizing resource use efficiency as the goal of community evolution is the key to unify the existing theory of plant diversity the predictions of our water niche based model are in agreement with the long term observation data we used published data to verify our predictions and discovered that community utilization efficiency of water resources can be maximized by adjusting the number and abundance of species in response to changes in available water resources our theoretical results suggest that the fractal spatial distribution of water resources led the power index of area curve to be less than 0 25 which adequately explains the relationship between exponential datasets and the

24841,identifying the drivers of species richness is a crucial for biodiversity conservation and community ecology in this paper the maximum utilization efficiency of water resources available to community is determined as the assembly law in an ecologically stable community with limited water resources a plant community diversity model that incorporates water potential impedance is established and the optimization model of community biodiversity structure was obtained based on water niche is also derived it is shown that this optimization model can theoretically derive a species area function similar to the traditional island biogeography curve and it can also verify the predicted values of the species area relationship experimentally and validated by long term observations of plant diversity survey data according to the model analyses the total number of individuals n and the number of species s are determined by the combination of the water resources factors the total quantity of available water resources in the growth season the individual biological factors the water consumption per unit mass of species in unit time the complementary factors of inter and intra species water niche the difference in water potential depending on the water use efficiency of the community and plant community function factors the total productivity of plant community and as the area of plant communities increases the heterogeneity of the water environment has increased by adaptation and coevolution more species are able to go through environmental and biological filtration becoming community species that can utilize more available water resources at different spatial scales changes in water resources resulted in the community maximizing the utilization efficiency of water resources by adjusting the number and abundance of species the main driving force for the increasing number of species is the full utilization of available water resources keywords community assembly diversity theory water limited ecosystems water potential impedance model water niche model 1 introduction the community ecology has been developing rapidly with many theories attempting to explain the patterns of species diversity and abundance the neutral theory metapopulation and metacommunity theories generalized fraction poisson distribution and entropy theory and so on have been developed in the past 20 years hubbell 2005 volkov et al 2005 mcgill 2010 violle et al 2012 harte and newman 2014 these theories start with radically different assumptions and the theories seem extremely different from each other to form a model with reasonable hypothesis verifiable and convincible predictions further research is still needed in essence the distribution of plant diversity is mainly related to the niches of different species obviously the establishment of a biodiversity niche model from the perspective of resource competition is of great significance to the in depth analysis of the mechanisms which is the foundation of the formation and maintenance of biodiversity as well as the improvement of prediction accuracy the most important and basic resource for plant communities is water tilman 1982 jobbágy et al 2011 silvertown et al 2015 especially in arid areas where water resources are scarce water determines the global distribution pattern vegetation and the vegetation types within a region jirka et al 2009 jobbágy et al 2011 at the local scale water also affects carbon dioxide capture soil nutrient availability plant growth and development microbial activity and interspecific interactions although the hydrological niche of plant communities has been verified by experiments in many studies silvertown et al 2015 garcía baquero et al 2016 letten et al 2015 the current theoretical research literature is insufficient at present niche theory based on resource competition fails to explain the diversity of tropical rain forest hubbell 2005 in water limited terrestrial ecosystem with environmental filtration and biological filtration intra and inter specific interactions plant community species can maximize utilization efficiency of community water resource at the individual level of the plant there is a trade off between relative growth rate rgr and water use efficiency wue in different species of a community huxman and venable 2013 at the population level each species has its own niche and there is niche differentiation even for the same resource li et al 2000 nmcgill 2010 niche differentiation is conducive to avoid competition and achieve species coexistence from the perspective of water resource utilization this niche differentiation ensures that more available water resources are fully utilized at the same time different species also have niche overlapped because of the overlap of their functional traits violle et al 2012 when the niche overlaps the competition for available water resources within the community is the most intense which stands for the most efficient use of available water resources at the community level available water resources have spatiotemporal changes and their distribution is fractal distribution bird et al 2000 in order to make full use of available water resources based on species interactions the community is surely to obtain characteristics related to fractal characteristics harte and newman 2014 although a community cannot evolve directly through genetic change as species communities evolve by improving the capacity of the entire community to exist verboef and morin 2010 therefore the community eventually realizes the utilization efficiency of available water resources to the maximum extent to attain the status of an ecologically stable community and to match the living environment trautz et al 2017 in this paper in water limited terrestrial ecosystem plant community species can maximize water resource utilization efficiency to the community including water resource utilization characteristics at the individual and population level all of which are used as the basis for our model construction on the other hand in the development of plant diversity theory the central unanswered question is what determines the total number of individuals n and the number of species s mcgill 2010 s and n are always inputs in existing diversity theory what drives these despite mcgill calling the unified theory a theory of biodiversity in every case the species richness s and number of individuals n are inputs to the model rather than predictions mutshinda et al 2009 mcgill 2010 violle et al 2012 to date the greatest success in the study of these factors has been empirical i e looking for correlations with environmental variables where factors like productivity climate and altitude seem important this paper attempts to answer this question based on the theory of the water niche the main context is shown in fig 1 based on interspecific and intraspecific interactions in water niche and the maximum utilization efficiency of available water resources in an ecologically stable community a water niche theoretical model of plant diversity is established and also validated using published survey data this model we intend to answer in what determine s the number of species and n the total number of individuals as well as what is the driver of the species area relationship 2 methods 2 1 establishment of the plant diversity model based on water niche the formation of plant community diversity involves environmental filtration and biological filtration in water limited plant communities biological filtration of interspecific and intraspecific interactions is based on the trade offs between the utilization efficiency of water resources and the relative growth rate huxman and venable 2013 stable communities are established when water resource utilization is maximized zuppinger dingley et al 2014 trautz et al 2017 this ecologically stable community is similar to the dynamic equilibrium of island biogeographic communities macarthur and wilson 1967 the functional traits of plants have globally consistent effects on competition and trade offs between high growth rate and competitive tolerance stabilize species coexistence huxman and venable 2013 using experimental observations huxman et al have suggested that there is a trade off between relative growth rate rgr and water use efficiency wue in different species of a community although two individuals may consume the same amount of water resources they may be intraspecific and interspecific differences in the temporality of individual growth barabãs and d andrea 2016 this is also the main reason for species coexistence within a water niche in an ecologically stable community the evolutionary stability theorem stearns 1992 entails that the amount of water needed to produce unit mass of ith species and the amount of biomass produced by other species in a community are equal to the amount of biomass produced by ith species and the amount of water needed to produce unit mass of other species in the community odum 1969 let w 0 i water consumption per unit mass of ith species in unit time in an ecologically stable community w 0 i w was constant see supporting material s1 let i i be the average water consumption of ith species over unit time m i be the total biomass production of the ith species ci be the average water consumption of one individual member of the ith species which also is water consumption per unit of growth of mass or birth of i species r i be the water potential impedance at individual level n i be the number of i species individual and p i be the mass production power of the ith species i 1 2 s s being the number of species we can then set up the equality p i m i t i u i i i where i i c i t i u i m i c i c i m i t i w 0 i in the system of resource cycling the average water potential impedance of the ith species is r i at the individual level r i is defined as r i u i 2 p i therefore u i i i r i according to the rule of competitive exclusion organisms of the same species have similar niches the use of water resources is similar to a circuit and different individuals of the same species form a parallel relationship therefore the water potential impedance of the population level r i can be seen as follows r i r i n i for the hydrological niches among multiple species there is niche differentiation and overlap jobbágy et al 2009 silvertown et al 2015 garcía baquero et al 2016 letten et al 2015 fort 2015 herein the water potential impedance function at the plant community level is referred to as ohm s law of the plant community when water niches overlap the utilization efficiency of water resources should be maximized see fig 2 the significance of the plant community maximizing water resource is that water resources are fully utilized when the hydrological niches are completely separated when the water niche overlaps the water resistance reaches the minimum jirka et al 2009 the aim of the community evolution is to make full use of water resources if water is the limiting resource in a stable community barkaoui et al 2017 trautz et al 2017 the utilization efficiency of water resources is maximized with the constant potential difference of a local community u therefore the optimization model of community biodiversity structure was obtained see fig 3 which can be expressed as follows y 0 m a x u 2 u 1 2 n 1 p 1 u 2 2 n 2 p 2 u s 2 n s p s s t i 1 s n i c i c i 1 2 3 s where s is the number of species of a local community in area a and c is the total quantity of available water resources in the growth season because of soils with a fractal pore size distribution bird et al 2000 it is assumed that the available water resources follow the fractal distribution in area a of the community li 2002 the relationship is described as follows c a a z where a is a constant and z is the fractal distribution constant a is a constant related to water supply such as the amount of water resources per unit area such as multi year average z was related to the distribution of water resources available determined by the soils and the extent of their reuse in the community for example the z value of grassland should be less than the z value of forest see table 1 we know that there was relationship among length l volume v and area a i e l 3 v l 2 a in general z is between 1 and 1 5 y0 is the maximum power production capacity of the plant community such as total productivity and u is the difference of water potential at the community level in the niche overlapping period water use efficiency of the community it is particularly noteworthy that the optimization model of community biodiversity structure is consistent with our published formula in terms of evolutionary stable community results han and liu 2019 3 results 3 1 species richness and the number of individuals in plant communities based on a water niche model the above model has a unique solution and the optimal structure of the community can be determined from the above results we know that the number of individuals s and the relationship between the species richness s and the maximum power of the plant community y 0 are as follows for additional details please see supporting material s1 1 s u c w y 0 2 n i 1 s n i c c w where c s i 1 s 1 c i 3 n i n 1 c i i 1 s 1 c i where y 0 is the maximum power of the plant community c is the total quantity of available water resources in the growth season w is the water consumption per unit mass per unit time s is the species richness n is the number of individuals of community c i is the average water consumption of one individual of ith species which also is the water consumption per unit of growth of mass or birth of ith species and u is the difference of water potential at the community level in the niche overlap period the total number of individuals n and the number of species s in the water limited plant community are determined by a combination of biological factors i e the average water consumption of one individual and the water consumption per unit mass per unit time environmental factors i e the total quantity of available water resources in the growth season and adaptive factors i e the maximum power of the plant community and the difference of water potential at the community level 4 verification 4 1 experimental verification due to similarities in habitat the maximum power of the plant community y 0 is proportional to the area a of the community and the average community fitness of the unit area h is constant y 0 a h from equations s u c w y 0 and c a a z the species area curve volkov 2005 mcgill 2010 he and hubbell 2011 is expressed as s b a z where z 0 5 z 1 and b u w a h this is a new species area curve but the ecological significance of its parameters can be clearly seen in the formula for the species area curve z is the fractal dimension of resources in space ranging from 1 to 1 5 therefore the range of z in the evolutionarily stable community is below 0 25 but greater than 0 due to the presence of the edge effect of underground resources the area corresponding to actual resources utilization in experimental sampling is larger than the area occupied by the community other parameters in s b a z are shown in fig 4 the number of individuals and the species richness was determined by the average water consumption of one individual of the ith species the total quantity of available water resources in the growth season the water consumption per unit mass per unit time the maximum power of the plant community and the difference of water potential at the community level in the niche overlap period for the same total amount of resources and the same level of resource utilization efficiency greater species diversity lowers the maximum power of the plant community this sets an upper limit for plant diversity van moorsel et al 2017 the available water resource utilization of the community is maximized by allowing more suitable species to enter which is the main driver of the increasing number of species in the community as the area of the community increases the species area curve adopts an exponential function as z 0 5 z 1 0 when z 1 in c a a z there is reuse of available water resources in the community due to the optimal density of species within the original area the community has more available water resources as the area of the community increases this is because h y 0 a and h is a constant for an ecologically stable community if s remained unchanged with the increase in a we obtain the following inequality h a a a z u 2 w s 2 where a u and w are constants in order to use these additional available water resources the available water resource power of the community is maximized by allowing more suitable species to enter which increases s at the same time the increase in the species number of the community also contributes to an increase in the community stability loreau 2010 loreau and mazancourt 2013 4 2 theoretical verification our model can also help clarify the dispute over the interpretation of the species area curve especially in terms of the relationship between the power index and 0 25 drakare et al 2006 qian et al 2007 dengler and boch 2008 according to the current literature the area curve is a power function whose power exponent is close to 0 25 see table 1 to test this model we focused on the z values of species area curves and conducted only qualitative tests for other parameters with our model the spatial fractal distribution of water resources led the power index of the area curve to be less than 0 25 this may explain the relationship between exponential data and the value 0 25 there are several insights that result from this theoretical framework the model illustrates that nested sampling can reduce the edge effect and interference resulting in a good fit but a power index that is slightly larger than 0 25 with independent combination sampling there may be edge effects in above ground and below ground systems that can partially offset each other resulting in more interference from sampling and a power index that is less than 0 25 it is important to verify that an ecologically stable community in a constant area can maintain stable community power via adapting to environmental resource fluctuations by adjusting the community structure herein we hypothesized that the maximum power of the plant community y 0 was a constant an appropriate experimental index was chosen by considering the available water resource utilization efficiency of a community u c as the reciprocal of the mean specific leaf area of the given community sla leaf area dry mass dwyer et al 2014 in other words u c 1 s l a c a a z where a is a constant and z is the fractal distribution constant a is a constant related to water supply such as the amount of water resources per unit area such as multi year average and z was related to the distribution of water resources available so here the hypothesis was that c a z k 1 p k 2 where k 1 and k 2 are constants and p is the total water supply in the community thus a simple relation was obtained from eq 1 4 s s l a 2 k 1 p k 2 k 1 w k 1 a z y 0 k 2 w k 2 a z y 0 therefore a plant diversity model based on the water niche was built to quantitatively describe the relationship among species richness individual characteristics sla and the total water resources available eq 4 predicts that fluctuations in the community s available water resources will result in adjustments to the community structure thereby maintaining community water power stability globally community diversity has been increasing and decreasing over the recent decades these changes have seldom been linked to climatic changes in a heterogeneous california grassland plant diversity declined between 2000 and 2014 on the local community scale 5 m2 and on the landscape scale 27 km2 across multiple functional groups and soil environments serpentine and non serpentine soil harrison et al 2015 we tested our theory by analyzing data on the grassland community fig 5 collected at different temporal and spatial scales the datasets were published within the past 15 years we found that the results were consistent with the predictions of our model these datasets support the conclusion that the community can maximize the utilization efficiency of available water resources by adjusting the number and abundance of species in response to changes in water resources it can be seen in fig 5 that there are other factors affecting the relationship between richness and environmental factors therefore a particularly high r 2 value is impossible to obtain 5 discussion in this paper the theoretical model based on water niche is deducted and verified by theoretical and data verification this model can explain the main characteristics of plant diversity and is an enrichment and improvement of existing plant diversity theories our model deduction is based on maximizing the utilization efficiency of available water resources of an ecologically stable community in water limited terrestrial ecosystem maximizing the efficiency of available water resources in ecologically stable communities is determined by the heterogeneity of the water environment and the characteristics of species adaptation and evolution since the heterogeneity of the water environment exists objectively if there is water there will be corresponding adaptations and distribution of the organisms different species niche differentiation is obvious occupying different habitats the same species can also share similar habitats through plastic genetic and non genetic changes such as plant size age and developmental differences although the community was built through environmental and biological filtration no matter what process the community goes through the resource utilization efficiency is the ultimate goal of the community and other functional indicators serve the same goal therefore the community itself is an evolutionary process loreau 2010 evolutionary community ecology is developed from a synthesis of insights from evolutionary theory genetics and traditional ecology this synthesis has grown into a broad branch of inquiry with important results for example there have been important discoveries about intraspecific density dependence as seen in experimental results at the population level we discovered that this intraspecific density dependent intensity could be explained separately from the perspective of both biophysics and evolutionary stability li et al 2000 han et al 2014 although evolutionary ecology at the community level was proposed very early whittaker 1968 odum 1969 the theory has developed very slowly loreau 2010 loreau and mazancourt 2013 herschgreen et al 2011 and the existing studies are mainly experimental van moorsel et al 2017 the optimization model of our community biodiversity structure is consistent with the published formula for evolutionary stable community results han and liu 2019 therefore the combination of stable community evolution and maximization of resource efficiency should be an interesting research focus for future studies therefore it is believed that theoretical research based on maximizing resource use efficiency as the goal of community evolution is the key to unify the existing theory of plant diversity the predictions of our water niche based model are in agreement with the long term observation data we used published data to verify our predictions and discovered that community utilization efficiency of water resources can be maximized by adjusting the number and abundance of species in response to changes in available water resources our theoretical results suggest that the fractal spatial distribution of water resources led the power index of area curve to be less than 0 25 which adequately explains the relationship between exponential datasets and the value 0 25 at present there are many studies that explain species area data with power functions mcgill 2010 violle et al 2012 harte and newman 2014 however the interpretation of the species area curve is disputed especially with reference to the relationship between the exponent of the power function and 0 25 table 1 summarizes information on whether the exponents of species area relationships vary widely or tend to take on a particular value such as 0 25 in this paper the relation between exponent of the power function and 0 25 was discovered we obtained a species area curve with well defined parameters and uncovered why the number of species in the community increased as the area of community increased the existing theoretical explanations for this problem are unclear first the ecological significance of the parameters in the existing species area curve is not clear secondly although there are some qualitative explanations from the niche theory the internal mechanism driving the increase in the number of species is not clear according to our research the number of available niches and area are positively correlated at the regional scale due to variations in topography soil and other factors larger areas have more niches and more species can therefore be accommodated at local scales spatial differences in resources intraspecific differences in resource

terrestrial plant communities increases the water environment affected by biotic and abiotic factors changes at local and regional scale changes in water resources resulted in the community maximizing

24842,maximum entropy maxent modelling is a widely used method for developing species distribution models sdms but default maxent modelling methods can result in overly complex models with poor transferability methods suggested to reduce overfitting include increasing regularisation using only linear and quadratic features or applying forward selection of predictors using maximum likelihood ml methods we built models using these options to determine environmental suitability within existing aquaculture zones for eight seaweed species four red rhodophyta florideophyceae and four brown ochrophyta phaeophyceae that are being investigated for aquaculture in southern australia forward selection models were the most parsimonious but we encountered failure of ml methods for pterocladia lucida rhodophyta due to separation separation is a known issue for logistic regression and has recently been recognised in maxent models separation occurs where a variable or combination of variables is a perfect predictor for a binary response here species occurrence and results in ml parameter estimates tending to infinity one method for obtaining finite parameter estimates under separation is to apply a cauchy prior distribution for coefficients we therefore also built models for each species using a cauchy prior version of the forward selection method and found that these models performed similarly to those built with ml methods default models achieved marginally higher predictive performance than other options based on training data metrics but simpler models performed equivalently to or better than default models at predicting independent presence absence test data predictive performance using test data varied considerably between species but the difference in performance between models within each species was generally small our results confirm the concern that default maxent models may suffer from over fitting and poor transferability model transferability and interpretability were important for our purpose hence based on the principle of parsimony forward selection models were preferred we also found that forward selection models retained similar predictive performance to the best model as assessed by each metric further supporting use of these models where ml methods failed due to separation the use of the cauchy prior method was a viable

suitability of the eight candidate species within existing aquaculture zones especially in northern spencer gulf predicted suitability was low for the other rhodophyta considered while each of the

candidates for farming in temperate australia and their potential for aquaculture in sa is being investigated wiltshire et al 2015 the candidate species comprise four red rhodophyta florideophyceae species pterocladia lucida r brown ex turner j agardh pterocladiaceae gelidium australe j agardh gelidiaceae solieria robusta greville kylin solieriaceae and plocamium angustum j agardh j d hooker harvey plocamiaceae and four brown ochrophyta phaeophyceae species ecklonia radiata c agardh j agardh lessoniaceae scytothalia dorycarpa turner greville seirococcaceae cystophora subfarcinata mertens j agardh and sargassum linearifolium turner c agardh sargassaceae these eight candidate species will be referred to by their genus names through the rest of the manuscript several aquaculture zone policies pirsa 2017 list seaweed farming as a permitted class of aquaculture despite the industry not yet being developed in sa pirsa s aquaculture zone policies consider community stakeholder industry and environmental concerns in selecting suitable areas for aquaculture however the factors determining environmental suitability for cultivation of seaweeds in sa are not well understood pirsa 2013 experimental investigation of the biology of the candidate seaweed species will assist in determining their responses to factors such as light temperature and nutrients and hence in identifying locations that may be suitable for their farming wiltshire et al 2015 but this biological knowledge is lacking we therefore applied correlative sdm to predict habitat suitability for each of the candidate seaweed species in existing aquaculture zones in sa maximum entropy maxent modelling is widely used for developing correlative sdms particularly where available occurrence data are presence only elith et al 2011 merow et al 2013 it is relatively easy to apply using the freely available java software maxent jar phillips et al 2006 2017 the default methods employed by maxent jar have however been criticised for producing overly complex models leading to poor transferability of the model over space or time and difficulty in interpretation of ecological responses halvorsen et al 2015 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 syfert et al 2013 verbruggen et al 2013 warren and seifert 2011 more parsimonious models may be produced by species specific tuning of the regularisation multiplier applied by maxent jar anderson and gonzalez jr 2011 muscarella et al 2014 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 but high regularisation can result in biased parameter estimates dormann et al 2013 halvorsen et al 2015 royle et al 2012 vollering et al 2019 and over generalised predictions ashford et al 2014 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 another approach is to limit the complexity of response curves by using only linear and quadratic feature types elith et al 2010 merow et al 2013 syfert et al 2013 forward step wise variable selection using likelihood ratio or f tests under a maximum likelihood ml interpretation of maxent has also been proposed as a method for limiting model complexity and preventing over fitting bendiksby et al 2014 halvorsen 2013 halvorsen et al 2015 2016 mazzoni 2016 mazzoni et al 2015 vollering et al 2019 maxent is now recognised as being equivalent to the inhomogeneous poisson process ipp model aarts et al 2012 fithian and hastie 2013 renner and warton 2013 and options for fitting maxent models using weighted logistic regression fithian and hastie 2013 have been implemented using existing algorithms for fitting generalised linear models glm these include the r r core team 2019 packages maxnet phillips 2017 which replicates the analysis of maxent jar v3 4 0 including construction of the same feature types and application of equivalent regularisation phillips 2017 phillips et al 2017 and miamaxent vollering et al 2018 2019 which is described as a modular integrated approach to maxent mazzoni 2016 mazzoni et al 2015 and implements the alternative approach described by halvorsen et al 2015 2016 in addition to applying forward selection with ml tests this alternative approach seeks to provide more control over constructed feature types than the default maxent jar methods and to generate simpler response curves that are ecologically relevant bendiksby et al 2014 halvorsen et al 2015 2016 mazzoni et al 2015 støa et al 2018 vollering et al 2019 for our purpose of predicting suitability of existing aquaculture zones for novel aquaculture species specifically seaweeds model transferability and ease of ecological interpretation are important considerations we therefore compared the performance of default maxent models as implemented in maxnet to that of models applying each of the proposed strategies to avoid over fitting increased regularisation restricted feature types and the alternative approach as applied by miamaxent using a range of performance metrics we also compared predictions of suitability of existing aquaculture zones across the modelling methods for each species results of these models will help to inform which species may be most suitable within spencer gulf sa and which current aquaculture zones may be most suitable for seaweed farming 2 methods 2 1 aquaculture zones aquaculture zone policies pirsa 2017 for each of the declared zones in spencer gulf sa were examined to determine those in which seaweed farming could be permitted a number of zones consist of sectors that allow different classes of aquaculture zones or sectors as relevant were selected for consideration where they included seaweed farming as a permitted class of aquaculture some zones where seaweed farming is permitted are located in intertidal areas these are used currently for aquaculture of intertidal molluscs such as pacific oyster crassostrea gigas but were not considered in this study as being suitable for cultivation of the candidate seaweeds all of which occur strictly subtidally spatial polygons of all south australian aquaculture zones location sa 2018 were obtained from pirsa the relevant zones within spencer gulf i e subtidal zones where farming of seaweed is a permitted activity were extracted from this data set and are shown in figure 1 2 2 data sources occurrence data for the eight seaweed species of interest was obtained for a geographic area covering all coasts of mainland australia and tasmania bounding box 10 45 s 110 155 e from three online databases atlas of living australia ala 2019 australasia s virtual herbarium avh 2017 and the macroalgal herbarium portal mhp 2017 spatial duplicates were removed from the combined dataset these data are presence only and primarily from herbarium records so are likely to have a strong sampling bias which can influence presence only species distribution modelling results phillips et al 2009 we therefore also obtained records of all other seaweeds of relevant classes rhodophyta florideophyceae and ochrophyta phaeophyceae from these databases to use as target group samples tgs for characterising the background environment elith et al 2011 merow et al 2013 phillips and dudík 2008 phillips et al 2009 støa et al 2018 all occurrence and tgs data used in the models were natural seaweed occurrences given the lack of current seaweed farming in australia and a total of 7967 spatially independent tgs points were used in models our aim was to predict environmental suitability for seaweed farming therefore we selected a suite of relevant predictors from those available based on knowledge of seaweed physiology wiencke and bischof 2012 and with consideration of variables shown to be important in sdms for other seaweeds castelar et al 2015 jueterbock et al 2013 lutchminarayan 2017 yesson et al 2015 we excluded predictors that are not relevant in an aquaculture scenario where seaweeds are typically grown suspended and at optimal depth bathymetry and sediment properties were therefore not used depth and sediment type may be important factors in determining suitability for culture systems e g longlines and environmental carrying capacity radiarta et al 2011 ross et al 2013 but in the case of spencer gulf aquaculture these factors have already been considered in defining aquaculture zone locations and the classes of aquaculture permitted in each zone pirsa 2013 the predictors selected for consideration were 1 sea surface temperature sst annual mean maximum minimum and range 2 light availability photosynthetically available radiation par annual mean and maximum diffuse attenuation kd annual mean maximum and minimum 3 water quality salinity and ph 4 nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus 5 water movement average and maximum current velocity cv 90th percentile of wave energy flux wave energy environmental data layers were obtained from bio oracle assis et al 2017 tyberghein et al 2012 using the r r core team 2019 package sdmpredictors bosch 2017 with the exception of wave energy which was obtained from the australian wave energy atlas durrant et al 2013 wave energy was resampled to the same resolution as the bio oracle layers using the r package raster hijmans 2016 some predictors were highly correlated r 0 7 e g mean sst was highly correlated with both minimum and maximum sst and with mean par we selected variables from these correlated sets based on their average performance in single variable models ashford et al 2014 braunisch et al 2013 dormann et al 2013 merow et al 2013 run using each modelling method see section 2 3 for details the candidate set of environmental variables for each species was selected in order of fractional deviance explained also known as the deviance ratio d2 which is equivalent to the r2 of ordinary least squares regression guisan and zimmermann 2000 vollering et al 2019 excluding variables that were correlated at r 0 7 with any of greater deviance explained the candidate variables used in modelling for each species are shown in table 1 along with the number of available occurrence records for each species 2 3 species distribution modelling approaches to compare the recommended modelling approaches for avoiding overfitting we constructed models using the following approaches to generate sdms for each species 1 default regularisation and feature types which in the maxnet implementation and v3 4 0 of the maxent jar software include linear quadratic hinge and product features phillips 2017 phillips et al 2017 2 regularisation multipliers from 2 to 8 with all feature types anderson and gonzalez jr 2011 muscarella et al 2014 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 3 default regularisation with linear and quadratic features only following elith et al 2010 all implemented using the maxnet package phillips 2017 in r r core team 2019 and 4 forward selection using maximum likelihood ml methods halvorsen 2013 halvorsen et al 2015 mazzoni et al 2015 vollering et al 2019 built with the r package miamaxent vollering et al 2018 the forward selection models were built in three steps following halvorsen 2013 halvorsen et al 2015 mazzoni et al 2015 vollering et al 2019 1 five derived variables were obtained for each environmental predictor one linear one monotonous zero skew and three deviation type 2 the most parsimonious set of derived variables was selected for each environmental predictor and 3 models were built using combinations of environmental predictors each represented by the selected derived variable set for both steps 2 and 3 nested models were compared using likelihood ratio tests lrts and model selection based on α 0 01 the ml model for pterocladia was not identifiable due to complete separation a potential issue for ipp models where the average value of a covariate at presence locations is at the upper or lower limit of the range for that covariate hefley and hooten 2015 where this problem occurs ml estimates become infinite but models may be estimated using penalised likelihoods e g regularisation as applied in maxnet or by using a weakly informative prior such as proposed by gelman et al 2008 for logistic regression to restrict parameter estimates to finite plausible values hefley and hooten 2015 we therefore applied a modification of the forward selection method by replacing calls to the standard r glm function in miamaxent with the bayesglm function of the arm package gelman and su 2018 which implements the cauchy prior recommended by gelman et al 2008 for logistic regression and shown to be effective for the ipp case hefley and hooten 2015 the cauchy prior method was otherwise identical to the ml method including the use of the derived variables generated by miamaxent and forward variable selection based on lrts and was used to generate models for all species not just pterocladia in order to compare its performance with the other modelling approaches used the miamaxent package automatically adds presence points to the background data vollering et al 2019 this is an option in the maxent jar software but not in the maxnet package we therefore manually added presence points to the tgs background samples for use in all maxnet models 2 4 model performance assessment a number of metrics are commonly used to assess sdm performance of these aikikes information criterion with small sample size correction aicc best selects models that have good transferability warren and seifert 2011 we calculated aicc as per burnham et al 2011 using code adapted from the r package enmsdm smith 2019 which calculates aicc based on the method proposed by warren and seifert 2011 and adapted by wright et al 2015 for the case where non random background points e g tgs are used for comparison we also calculated other common performance metrics area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc based on training data auctrain and on independent test data auctest deviance ratio d2 and model calibration fieberg et al 2018 the presence absence data set for determining test data auc was compiled from unpublished data held by sardi aquatic sciences that was collected during temperate reef surveys collings et al 2008 turner et al 2007 and field visits to identify potential collection sites for seaweed seed stock wiltshire et al 2015 these records were not included in the training data set but as with the training data represent natural seaweed occurrence not farmed seaweed locations the purpose of our models was to predict environmental suitability in an aquaculture setting and we therefore excluded some environmental variables that are likely to be important in determining natural seaweed distributions e g depth and substrate characteristics we note that our models are likely to be suboptimal for predicting natural species occurrences in comparison to models including all biologically relevant predictors and may over predict in areas where depth or substrate would be unsuitable for natural species occurrence the ability of each model to predict to this independent test data is however a valid measure of relative model performance as all models were based on the same suite of environmental variables the interpretation of training auc for presence only models is not at straight forward as interpretation of training auc based on presence absence data the maximum training auc possible for models built using presence only data is 1 and is dependent on apparent prevalence i e the ratio of occurrence to background points and additionally the auc of the null or random model may be different to 0 5 raes and ter steege 2007 yackulic et al 2013 we therefore used a null model approach for assessment of training auc which involved building 99 null models for each of the eight modelled species using randomly selected tgs points as presences following merckx et al 2011 raes and ter steege 2007 the number of tgs points used in null models was equal to the number of species occurrence records in each case the rank of training auc in comparison to the 99 null model auc values can be used as a statistical test of predictive performance raes and ter steege 2007 i e where model auc is greater than at least 95 of the 99 null aucs the model is considered better than random at p 0 05 one sided and a model auc higher than all 99 null model aucs indicates prediction better than random at p 0 01 d2 and adjusted d2 of each model were calculated based on guisan and zimmermann 2000 adjusted d2 and aicc are both measures that account for the number of parameters and number of observations and penalise more complex models or those based on fewer data guisan and zimmermann 2000 warren and seifert 2011 calibration of each individual species model was assessed using the continuous boyce index boyce et al 2002 fieberg et al 2018 hirzel et al 2006 a quantitative version of the presence only calibration plot recommended by phillips and elith 2010 boyce indices were calculated using the r package ecospat broennimann et al 2018 di cola et al 2017 the boyce index ranges from 1 to 1 with positive values indicating predictions in agreement with expectation 0 indicating predictions no better than random and negative values indicating predictions contrary to expected 2 5 predicted environmental suitability prediction rasters were generated for spencer gulf using raw output of all models for each species the raw output of maxent jar and maxnet is a relative occurrence rate but its value is dependent on the number of background presence points used elith et al 2011 the default output of miamaxent is the probability ratio output pro proposed by halvorsen 2013 pro output is a rescaling of raw scores to remove the dependence on the number of points used such that the mean suitability of a random cell in the model domain 1 bendiksby et al 2014 halvorsen 2013 halvorsen et al 2015 mazzoni 2016 vollering et al 2019 pro scores through the model domain for a species therefore show suitability for that species relative to an average site and allow comparison between models built using different numbers of points for the same species without strong assumptions or data about prevalence i e the proportion of available sites that a species occupies however raw output and hence pro scores can only be interpreted as relative indices of suitability and not probabilities of occurrence or absolute abundance elith et al 2011 merow et al 2013 yackulic et al 2013 and these scores are not directly comparable between species elith et al 2011 merow et al 2013 maxent jar v3 4 0 uses a complimentary log log transform as the default output this transform has a stronger theoretical basis than the logistic transform that was the default output for earlier versions however it is still not directly comparable between species where prevalence is unknown phillips et al 2017 the maxnet package includes both transforms as prediction options along with raw output phillips 2017 for each species and modelling method we determined the mean raw score at the occurrence points used for modelling equivalent to the meanpred method of liu et al 2013 and used this to scale the raw suitability predictions for our purposes this mean occurrence point score is not taken to be a threshold for defining presence absence or suitable unsuitable areas but rather as a reference value to permit comparison between species the derived relative suitability results illustrate suitability relative to that at an average presence site for each species in comparing between species a higher relative suitability score should not be interpreted as higher absolute suitability for one species over others for the area of interest but does indicate higher suitability relative to known occurrences for that species in comparison to a lower scoring species to assess suitability for each species within existing aquaculture zones mean relative suitability using the modelling method with lowest aicc for that species was extracted for all relevant aquaculture zones to examine how predictions varied between modelling methods relative suitability for each species was extracted for 200 random points across all aquaculture zones for each model gamma generalised linear modelling glm was applied to determine how predicted suitability varied between models for each species the gamma family was used as it is suitable for strictly positive continuous data zuur et al 2013 initial data exploration showed that the effects of modelling methods were not consistent across species and as we were primarily interested in exploring the effects of modelling method we ran a separate glm analysis for each species each glm was run in a bayesian framework using jags v 4 3 0 plummer 2017 with three chains for 10 000 iterations thinned at a rate of 10 following 2000 iterations for adaptation and 10 000 iterations for burn in diffuse normal priors were used for all coefficients and factor levels were considered different to the reference default model where the 95 credible interval of the posterior coefficient estimate did not include zero jags was run using the r2jags package su and yajima 2015 convergence was assessed using the gelman rubin convergence statistic and confirmed by visual inspection of trace density and autocorrelation plots generated using the mcmcplots package mckay curtis 2015 to visualise spatial variation in model predictions using different options we generated maps for each species for the default model regularisation multipliers of 2 4 6 and 8 linear quadratic model and each forward selection model and also of the mean prediction across all models and standard deviation x 5 across models for that species for mapping standard deviation was multiplied by 5 in order to better visualise areas where predictions varied no model weighting was applied to the average predictions in these maps as our aim was to illustrate overall model agreement or difference not to derive average models for the purpose of spatial prediction raster extraction and calculation was performed using the r package raster hijmans 2016 and maps generated using rastervis perpiñán and hijmans 2019 3 results 3 1 model performance forward selection models were the most parsimonious for all species as assessed by aicc table 2 figure 2 with the ml models having the lowest aicc for all species except pterocladia where this model was not identifiable data exploration revealed that salinity was a near perfect predictor for this species leading to separation in the data the cauchy prior model had the lowest aicc for pterocladia and the second lowest for all other species being marginally higher than that of the ml model in each case though less than 0 5 greater in the case of cystophora and sargassum figure 2 table 3 within regularised models for solieria gelidium pterocladia and sargassum aicc was lower at regularisation mutlipliers of 2 4 than for default models before increasing with further regularisation while aicc increased consistently with increasing regularisation for the remaining species linear quadratic models had lower aicc than default models for solieria gelidium and sargassum but higher for other species generally similar to that of high regularisation models default models always had the greatest number of parameters 37 55 table 3 increasing the regularisation multiplier decreased the number of parameters for each species to a minimum of 7 16 across species at a regularisation multiplier of 8 linear quadratic models had a similar number of parameters 13 16 to models with moderate to high regularisation while forward selection models typically had the fewest or equal fewest parameters for each species 3 14 for the ml method and 3 9 for the cauchy prior method default models explained the highest proportion of deviance for each species as measured by d2 figure 3 d2 declined slightly with increasing regularisation with linear quadratic and forward selection models typically having intermediate d2 but overall differences in d2 between models were minor 0 04 figure 3 adjusted d2 was consistently lowest for default models and highest for forward selection models specifically for the ml option for solieria plocamium cystophora sargassum and scytothalia and the cauchy prior option for the remaining species but with 0 005 difference in adjusted d2 between the forward selection models for each species figure 3 predictive performance based on training data was similar within each species across modelling methods table 3 supplementary material and all models had good discriminatory power with a minimum difference of 0 19 between training and null auc and auctrain of each model all 99 null aucs therefore auc better than random p 0 01 average null auc for each species and modelling method was close to 0 5 table 2 the model selected by aicc had the highest or equal highest auctrain for plocamium and ecklonia the difference in auctrain between the selected model and highest auctrain for each species was minor 0 06 table 2 on average auctrain was highest for the default method across species but differences to other models were minor average difference 0 04 table 3 regularisation and use of restricted feature types linear and quadratic only led to marginally reduced auctrain with a regularisation multiplier of 8 and linear quadratic models having lowest auctrain overall while auctrain for forward selection models was intermediate table 3 performance based on auctest showed greater variation across modelling methods although average differences were still minor 0 08 table 3 forward selection ml models had the highest auctest on average while default models had the lowest average auctest across species table 3 default models however had the highest or equal highest auctest for pterocladia plocamium and scytothalia the models selected by aicc had the highest or equal highest auctest for solieria gelidium and plocamium table 2 a regularisation multiplier of 4 resulted in the highest auctest for sargassum with high regularisation multipliers giving the highest auctest for scytothalia and cystophora and the linear quadratic model had the highest auctest for ecklonia see supplementary material auctest scores were notably different between species with the highest auctest scores being between 0 84 and 0 92 for most species but lower for some 0 71 and 0 74 for ecklonia and gelidium respectively and 0 58 for sargassum the difference in auctest between the selected model and the highest auctest for each species was 0 08 table 2 calibration as measured by the continuous boyce index varied across models without displaying consistent patterns calibration generally increased with increasing regularisation to a multiplier of between 2 and 6 but not always monotonically supplementary material with average calibration being highest at regularisation multipliers of 2 3 and lowest for models with restricted feature types table 3 the model selected by aicc had the highest calibration for sargassum while the aicc selected models for gelidium and cystophora showed reduced calibration in comparison to the best models for those species although the selected models still showed good 0 5 calibration table 2 forward selection models had lower calibration on average than default or high regularisation models but the reduction was minor table 3 and average calibration across all modelling methods was good 0 76 in all cases supplementary material the boyce index was positive for all models ranging from 0 48 1 showing predictions consistent with expectation 3 2 environmental suitability of spencer gulf and aquaculture zones the red seaweed solieria was predicted to have high relative suitability 1 throughout spencer gulf by the selected model figure 4 with relative suitability being greatest in northern spencer gulf 2 in parts all other species showed generally higher relative suitability in southern than northern spencer gulf figure 4 relative suitability for the brown seaweeds cystophora and sargassum was predicted to be 1 for much of central and southern spencer gulf and the brown ecklonia also showed areas of relative suitability 1 in central spencer gulf figure 4 predictions were generally similar across modelling methods for most species being most variable for ecklonia the default model for this species predicted somewhat lower relative suitability in central spencer gulf than the selected model although still with areas of relative suitability 0 5 supplementary material for cystophora the selected model also predicted slightly higher suitability through much of spencer gulf and to the south of the gulf than the default model supplementary material and for solieria the selected model predicted higher relative suitability in northern spencer gulf than the default model relative suitability from the selected model for gelidium pterocladia and scytothalia however was slightly lower in southern spencer gulf than for the default model in each case while predictions were generally similar between the selected and default models for plocamium maps of standard deviation across models show that the greatest discrepancies between predictions across all modelling methods were generally in southern spencer gulf and outside the gulf except for solieria where the greatest discrepancies were in northern spencer gulf supplementary material for all species the greatest discrepancies were in areas where the highest relative suitability was predicted with predictions for some modelling methods in these regions being considerably greater than others while differences between models were relatively minor in areas of moderate to low suitability for each species based on the selected model solieria had relative suitability 1 for all existing aquaculture zones figure 5 of the brown seaweeds the highest relative suitability across aquaculture zones was predicted for sargassum which had predicted relative suitability 0 5 except for fitzgerald bay tickera and proper bay and suitability close to 1 for the port neill and lincoln inner zones predicted relative suitability for cystophora was 0 5 for the port neill tumby bay louth bay boston bay and lincoln zones with highest suitability in the lincoln outer zone ecklonia had relative suitability 1 in the port neil zone and 0 5 in tumby bay and louth bay south predicted relative suitability for scytothalia was 0 5 for the boston bay and lincoln inner zones of southern spencer gulf and approached 1 for the lincoln outer zone for the remaining red seaweeds gelidium and plocamium had predicted relative suitability 0 5 for the lincoln outer zone but predicted suitability was 0 5 for other zones for these species and in all zones for pterocladia figure 5 3 3 differences between default and alternative model predictions differences between relative suitability predictions within aquaculture zones from default and alternative modelling methods did not display consistent patterns across species as assessed by the gamma glms table 4 the most parsimonious forward selection models predicted higher relative suitability on average across the aquaculture zones than the default models for solieria and plocamium but lower for gelidium ecklonia and sargassum while predictions were similar between the selected and default models for pterocladia cystophora and scytothalia in all cases however the scale of the difference was small the greatest discrepancy being 20 higher relative suitability predictions on average by the forward selection model than the default model for solieria table 4 predictions from the cauchy prior forward selection model were lower than the ml model for solieria higher for gelidium and ecklonia and similar for the other species but differences where present were minor table 4 increasing regularisation also had variable effects across species leading to increasingly higher suitability predictions with greater regularisation for each of the red seaweeds and ecklonia lower predictions at a regularisation multiplier of 8 for cystophora and for sargassum higher predictions than the default model at regularisation multipliers of 2 4 but with decreasing predictions at higher regularisation while predictions were similar for scytothalia between default and higher regularisation models in most cases the change to the scale of the predictions with regularisation was minor but for pterocladia predicted suitability under high regularisation was almost three times higher than under the default model using restricted feature types linear quadratic only led to higher average predictions than the default model for solieria pterocladia plocamium ecklonia and sargassum with predictions being similar between these modelling methods for the remaining species the scale of differences between the linear quadratic and default models was generally small again with the exception of pterocladia for which the linear quadratic model predictions were approximately twice as high as those of the default model table 4 4 discussion default methods for maximum entropy sdm produce overly complex models halvorsen et al 2015 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 syfert et al 2013 vollering et al 2019 warren and seifert 2011 our results also demonstrate that default models are over parameterised leading to increased aicc and decreases in adjusted d2 and generally lower predictive performance auc using independent test data we found that forward selection methods following the miamaxent approach halvorsen 2013 halvorsen et al 2015 vollering et al 2019 produced the most parsimonious models but as recognised by hefley and hooten 2015 the ml method may fail in some circumstances where ml estimates are not finite due to separation we encountered this problem in the model for the red seaweed pterocladia applying a weakly informative cauchy prior as per gelman et al 2008 to the weighted logistic regression allowed a forward selection model to be produced for pterocladia with this model being most parsimonious for this species for each of the remaining species the cauchy prior model had marginally higher aicc than the ml forward selection model but lower than other modelling methods the other proposed approaches to limit model complexity increasing the regularisation multiplier anderson and gonzalez jr 2011 muscarella et al 2014 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 or using only linear and quadratic feature types elith et al 2010 merow et al 2013 syfert et al 2013 each resulted in models having fewer parameters than the default method these methods however also resulted in poorer model fit i e reduced d2 and log likelihood and hence aicc similar to or higher than default models default models had the best predictive performance as assessed using training data auc but differences to other model options were minor and all models performed well as assessed by this metric auc is often used for sdm assessment but the usefulness of auc for this purpose has been questioned jiménez valverde 2012 lobo et al 2008 peterson et al 2008 training auc in particular has been criticised as a metric for model selection because it typically selects over fitted models warren and seifert 2011 interpretation of auc for presence only models can be problematic but use of null model auc for comparison can assist with this issue merckx et al 2011 raes and ter steege 2007 in contrast to other studies hijmans 2012 raes and ter steege 2007 we found null auc for each species to be close to 0 5 the value expected for presence absence models or in the absence of sampling bias but this will not always be the case where presence only data are used hence the null model auc value serves as a useful comparison for assessment of model auc values the use of independent and ideally presence absence test data for model selection and validation based on test data auc has been recommended and is recognised as a more appropriate measure of model performance than training auc halvorsen et al 2016 liu et al 2013 phillips and dudík 2008 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 warren and seifert 2011 forward selection models had the highest auctest scores on average however we did not find that test data auc consistently selected the most parsimonious models differences in predictive performance to test data between models were generally minor and although default models had decreased auctest in some cases this pattern was not consistent across species we also found that auctest varied more widely between models for different species than between models within any individual species and was consistently lower for some species than others the differences in auc between species likely occurred because auc is typically higher for species with a well defined geographic or ecological niche than for more widespread generalist species lobo et al 2008 van proosdij et al 2016 while some limitations of using auc for model comparison can be overcome raes and ter steege 2007 van proosdij et al 2016 or may not apply in all cases halvorsen et al 2016 it is clear that auc for assessment of presence only models is only valid for comparison within and not across species models for our purpose we wanted to predict potential suitability but in addition to its other drawbacks auc is typically a poor metric for selecting models of the potential as opposed to realised distribution of a species jiménez valverde 2012 calibration measured by the continuous boyce index did not show consistent patterns with modelling method across species although overall calibration was marginally higher for models with increased regularisation than for default models the forward selection models selected by aicc showed reduced calibration on average but were still well calibrated having a minimum boyce index of 0 59 calibration is an often overlooked aspect of model validation fieberg et al 2018 hirzel et al 2006 but its suitability as a metric for model selection has not been thoroughly assessed we selected models using aicc based on the principal of parsimony because simpler models are likely to have greater transferability and ecological interpretability than more complex models halvorsen et al 2016 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 verbruggen et al 2013 vollering et al 2019 warren and seifert 2011 considerations that are more important to our purpose than accuracy of prediction we found that aicc was lowest and adjusted d2 was highest for forward selection models with aicc selecting the ml model except where not identified and adjusted d2 being very similar between ml and cauchy prior models for each species to our knowledge adjusted d2 has not been used for selection of maxent models although it can be applied for comparison in logistic regression gelman and su 2018 hirzel et al 2006 the recognition of maxent as an ipp opens up the possibility of using adjusted d2 to assess and compare model fit for these models aicc does not necessarily select models with the greatest predictive accuracy as demonstrated by velasco and gonzález salazar 2019 and also by our results and the same is likely true of adjusted d2 we note however that differences in auc and calibration between the most parsimonious models and best performing models as assessed by these metrics were minor in our case therefore there was little cost to predictive accuracy in selecting models based on aicc further validation of our model results is however difficult due to the lack of existing seaweed farms or larger sets of systematic survey data for the modelled species the relative suitability predictions for our area of interest varied between modelling methods but the scale of the differences was generally not large and in most cases would not change the interpretation of areas as being broadly suitable or unsuitable for each species we found however that increased regularisation or the use of restricted feature types resulted in considerably 2 3 x higher predictions than the default for pterocladia it appears therefore that predictions based on these particular alternative modelling methods could change interpretations of results in some cases the r packages now implemented to run the various maxent modelling methods via weighted logistic regression are faster than the maxent jar software hence it is more feasible to run and compare multiple modelling methods across several species than previously we therefore encourage further exploration of the effects of using alternative modelling strategies on model performance and predictions choice of modelling method and of the metric applied to assess models should depend on the modelling purpose at hand and the relative importance of transferability interpretability and predictive accuracy for that purpose aquaculture site selection is a relatively new application of sdm and the use of sdm for this purpose is not well established though the potential of this method has been recognised falconer et al 2016 linhoss et al 2016 oyinlola et al 2018 sdm applications for aquaculture site selection to date have primarily used the location falconer et al 2016 oyinlola et al 2018 or commercial yield vincenzi et al 2007 vincenzi et al 2011 of existing farms for model building and have assessed model results relative to the outputs of the more established methods e g multi criteria evaluation that rely on pre existing knowledge of suitable conditions for farming falconer et al 2016 vincenzi et al 2007 falconer et al 2016 found that mahalanobis typicality model outputs were more consistent with multi criteria evaluation results than those of the default maxent jar method for predicting site suitability for fish farms our aims and method varied from theirs for several reasons we were considering novel aquaculture species for which there are no existing farms and the lack of detailed biological knowledge of these species prevented us from applying a multi criteria evaluation for comparison our application of sdm for aquaculture also differed as we considered suitability for candidate species within existing aquaculture zones with these zones having already been spatially defined following assessment for social logistical and general environmental suitability for aquaculture pirsa 2013 our interest was therefore solely habitat suitability for the species being considered and we elected to use maximum entropy modelling as this is a well suited method for the presence only occurrence data that were available our results demonstrate however that the default maxent method may not be the most appropriate where model transferability to different areas is likely to be important such as for predicting aquaculture site suitability the models developed here show relative suitability for the native seaweeds that are being investigated for cultivation across the existing aquaculture zones in sa it is unclear how well predicted suitability from the models which is based on relative occurrence rate will relate to seaweed performance in aquaculture we interpret the results with some caution in light of this limited validation but given the paucity of data on the species considered the results help to inform future research directions specifically the results show which zones may be most suitable for seaweed aquaculture and will assist in identification of the species most suitable for cultivation in each area all existing aquaculture zones in spencer gulf sa where seaweed farming is permitted are likely to be suitable for at least one of the candidate seaweeds solieria appears the best suited for cultivation in spencer gulf especially in the northern zones with the brown seaweeds sargassum ecklonia cystophora and scytothalia each being potentially suited to at least some areas of southern spencer gulf the other candidate red seaweeds gelidium pterocladia and plocamium show generally low suitability throughout the spencer gulf aquaculture zones and appear less suited to cultivation in this area spencer gulf is an inverse estuary with evaporation exceeding precipitation leading to increasingly hypersaline conditions towards the head north of the gulf northern spencer gulf also experiences warmer temperatures and a greater annual temperature range than the southern gulf nunes and lennon 1986 these environmental gradients are likely to be important drivers for seaweed habitat suitability we note that the spatial resolution of the environmental data used is too low to distinguish fine scale distributional preferences such as occurrence on exposed or sheltered sides of a reef thus only broad scale responses to variables such as wave energy are captured in the models the environmental data used are also annual averages or seasonal extremes and so model results reflect suitability for each species to occur long term for those species with low predicted suitability it is possible that conditions in some areas may be suitable for growth at certain times of year and permit seasonal cultivation species with greater relative suitability in an area are however likely to perform better over a greater proportion of the year and it is unlikely that a species will grow well in an area of very low relative suitability for its occurrence the models also provide insight into ecological responses which can be used to guide further investigation of candidate species models built using the alternative modelling approach of miamaxent provide relatively simple response curves to ecological parameters halvorsen et al 2016 støa et al 2018 vollering et al 2019 which can be explored in order to determine potential suitable environmental conditions and apparent optima for each species response curves from sdms do not always reflect physiological or ecological responses due to the influence of correlated variables elith and leathwick 2009 or because a species may be restricted from occurring at sites with favourable conditions of a given predictor by other factors marcelino and verbruggen 2015 the curves can still provide insight where biological knowledge is lacking and help to inform further investigation marcelino and verbruggen 2015 such experimental investigation of optimal conditions for growth will help to inform the best seasons for growth as well as assisting in identifying the best potential areas for seaweed aquaculture credit

24842,maximum entropy maxent modelling is a widely used method for developing species distribution models sdms but default maxent modelling methods can result in overly complex models with poor transferability methods suggested to reduce overfitting include increasing regularisation using only linear and quadratic features or applying forward selection of predictors using maximum likelihood ml methods we built models using these options to determine environmental suitability within existing aquaculture zones for eight seaweed species four red rhodophyta florideophyceae and four brown ochrophyta phaeophyceae that are being investigated for aquaculture in southern australia forward selection models were the most parsimonious but we encountered failure of ml methods for pterocladia lucida rhodophyta due to separation separation is a known issue for logistic regression and has recently been recognised in maxent models separation occurs where a variable or combination of variables is a perfect predictor for a binary response here species occurrence and results in ml parameter estimates tending to infinity one method for obtaining finite parameter estimates under separation is to apply a cauchy prior distribution for coefficients we therefore also built models for each species using a cauchy prior version of the forward selection method and found that these models performed similarly to those built with ml methods default models achieved marginally higher predictive performance than other options based on training data metrics but simpler models performed equivalently to or better than default models at predicting independent presence absence test data predictive performance using test data varied considerably between species but the difference in performance between models within each species was generally small our results confirm the concern that default maxent models may suffer from over fitting and poor transferability model transferability and interpretability were important for our purpose hence based on the principle of parsimony forward selection models were preferred we also found that forward selection models retained similar predictive performance to the best model as assessed by each metric further supporting use of these models where ml methods failed due to separation the use of the cauchy prior method was a viable alternative predictions for the region of interest spencer gulf south australia were generated using the most parsimonious models and solieria robusta rhodophyta showed the highest predicted suitability of the eight candidate species within existing aquaculture zones especially in northern spencer gulf predicted suitability was low for the other rhodophyta considered while each of the phaeophyceae showed moderate to high suitability in at least some southern spencer gulf aquaculture zones these model results help to inform selection of the best candidate species and suitable farming areas for future research graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords maximum entropy species distribution modelling model selection overfitting seaweed aquaculture 1 introduction species distribution modelling sdm is commonly used to predict distributions of terrestrial species with increasing use for aquatic species elith and leathwick 2009 robinson et al 2011 where the biological knowledge required to build mechanistic models is lacking correlative sdm which relates known species occurrences to environmental or sometimes spatial predictors can be applied elith and leathwick 2009 the resulting models can be used to obtain ecological insight or predict distributions with applications in spatial management biosecurity climate change and theoretical ecology elith and leathwick 2009 robinson et al 2011 in recent years correlative sdm has been applied for aquaculture site selection especially for species where there is insufficient knowledge to develop habitat suitability indices e g castelar et al 2015 falconer et al 2016 linhoss et al 2016 oyinlola et al 2018 vincenzi et al 2007 vincenzi et al 2011 in south australia sa several finfish species are farmed in declared aquaculture zones developed and regulated by primary industries and regions sa pirsa pirsa 2013 2017 there is also interest in developing seaweed aquaculture in sa and australia more generally due to growing demand for seaweed products of which australia is a net importer lee 2010 and also the potential for seaweeds to offset nutrient inputs from finfish aquaculture chopin et al 2001 chung et al 2002 neori 2008 pirsa 2013 troell et al 2009 wiltshire et al 2015 seaweed farming is not an established industry in australia however and few species with established farming technology are native to australia so it is likely that local seaweed species that have not been previously cultivated will need to be utilised eight native seaweed species have been identified as candidates for farming in temperate australia and their potential for aquaculture in sa is being investigated wiltshire et al 2015 the candidate species comprise four red rhodophyta florideophyceae species pterocladia lucida r brown ex turner j agardh pterocladiaceae gelidium australe j agardh gelidiaceae solieria robusta greville kylin solieriaceae and plocamium angustum j agardh j d hooker harvey plocamiaceae and four brown ochrophyta phaeophyceae species ecklonia radiata c agardh j agardh lessoniaceae scytothalia dorycarpa turner greville seirococcaceae cystophora subfarcinata mertens j agardh and sargassum linearifolium turner c agardh sargassaceae these eight candidate species will be referred to by their genus names through the rest of the manuscript several aquaculture zone policies pirsa 2017 list seaweed farming as a permitted class of aquaculture despite the industry not yet being developed in sa pirsa s aquaculture zone policies consider community stakeholder industry and environmental concerns in selecting suitable areas for aquaculture however the factors determining environmental suitability for cultivation of seaweeds in sa are not well understood pirsa 2013 experimental investigation of the biology of the candidate seaweed species will assist in determining their responses to factors such as light temperature and nutrients and hence in identifying locations that may be suitable for their farming wiltshire et al 2015 but this biological knowledge is lacking we therefore applied correlative sdm to predict habitat suitability for each of the candidate seaweed species in existing aquaculture zones in sa maximum entropy maxent modelling is widely used for developing correlative sdms particularly where available occurrence data are presence only elith et al 2011 merow et al 2013 it is relatively easy to apply using the freely available java software maxent jar phillips et al 2006 2017 the default methods employed by maxent jar have however been criticised for producing overly complex models leading to poor transferability of the model over space or time and difficulty in interpretation of ecological responses halvorsen et al 2015 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 syfert et al 2013 verbruggen et al 2013 warren and seifert 2011 more parsimonious models may be produced by species specific tuning of the regularisation multiplier applied by maxent jar anderson and gonzalez jr 2011 muscarella et al 2014 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 but high regularisation can result in biased parameter estimates dormann et al 2013 halvorsen et al 2015 royle et al 2012 vollering et al 2019 and over generalised predictions ashford et al 2014 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 another approach is to limit the complexity of response curves by using only linear and quadratic feature types elith et al 2010 merow et al 2013 syfert et al 2013 forward step wise variable selection using likelihood ratio or f tests under a maximum likelihood ml interpretation of maxent has also been proposed as a method for limiting model complexity and preventing over fitting bendiksby et al 2014 halvorsen 2013 halvorsen et al 2015 2016 mazzoni 2016 mazzoni et al 2015 vollering et al 2019 maxent is now recognised as being equivalent to the inhomogeneous poisson process ipp model aarts et al 2012 fithian and hastie 2013 renner and warton 2013 and options for fitting maxent models using weighted logistic regression fithian and hastie 2013 have been implemented using existing algorithms for fitting generalised linear models glm these include the r r core team 2019 packages maxnet phillips 2017 which replicates the analysis of maxent jar v3 4 0 including construction of the same feature types and application of equivalent regularisation phillips 2017 phillips et al 2017 and miamaxent vollering et al 2018 2019 which is described as a modular integrated approach to maxent mazzoni 2016 mazzoni et al 2015 and implements the alternative approach described by halvorsen et al 2015 2016 in addition to applying forward selection with ml tests this alternative approach seeks to provide more control over constructed feature types than the default maxent jar methods and to generate simpler response curves that are ecologically relevant bendiksby et al 2014 halvorsen et al 2015 2016 mazzoni et al 2015 støa et al 2018 vollering et al 2019 for our purpose of predicting suitability of existing aquaculture zones for novel aquaculture species specifically seaweeds model transferability and ease of ecological interpretation are important considerations we therefore compared the performance of default maxent models as implemented in maxnet to that of models applying each of the proposed strategies to avoid over fitting increased regularisation restricted feature types and the alternative approach as applied by miamaxent using a range of performance metrics we also compared predictions of suitability of existing aquaculture zones across the modelling methods for each species results of these models will help to inform which species may be most suitable within spencer gulf sa and which current aquaculture zones may be most suitable for seaweed farming 2 methods 2 1 aquaculture zones aquaculture zone policies pirsa 2017 for each of the declared zones in spencer gulf sa were examined to determine those in which seaweed farming could be permitted a number of zones consist of sectors that allow different classes of aquaculture zones or sectors as relevant were selected for consideration where they included seaweed farming as a permitted class of aquaculture some zones where seaweed farming is permitted are located in intertidal areas these are used currently for aquaculture of intertidal molluscs such as pacific oyster crassostrea gigas but were not considered in this study as being suitable for cultivation of the candidate seaweeds all of which occur strictly subtidally spatial polygons of all south australian aquaculture zones location sa 2018 were obtained from pirsa the relevant zones within spencer gulf i e subtidal zones where farming of seaweed is a permitted activity were extracted from this data set and are shown in figure 1 2 2 data sources occurrence data for the eight seaweed species of interest was obtained for a geographic area covering all coasts of mainland australia and tasmania bounding box 10 45 s 110 155 e from three online databases atlas of living australia ala 2019 australasia s virtual herbarium avh 2017 and the macroalgal herbarium portal mhp 2017 spatial duplicates were removed from the combined dataset these data are presence only and primarily from herbarium records so are likely to have a strong sampling bias which can influence presence only species distribution modelling results phillips et al 2009 we therefore also obtained records of all other seaweeds of relevant classes rhodophyta florideophyceae and ochrophyta phaeophyceae from these databases to use as target group samples tgs for characterising the background environment elith et al 2011 merow et al 2013 phillips and dudík 2008 phillips et al 2009 støa et al 2018 all occurrence and tgs data used in the models were natural seaweed occurrences given the lack of current seaweed farming in australia and a total of 7967 spatially independent tgs points were used in models our aim was to predict environmental suitability for seaweed farming therefore we selected a suite of relevant predictors from those available based on knowledge of seaweed physiology wiencke and bischof 2012 and with consideration of variables shown to be important in sdms for other seaweeds castelar et al 2015 jueterbock et al 2013 lutchminarayan 2017 yesson et al 2015 we excluded predictors that are not relevant in an aquaculture scenario where seaweeds are typically grown suspended and at optimal depth bathymetry and sediment properties were therefore not used depth and sediment type may be important factors in determining suitability for culture systems e g longlines and environmental carrying capacity radiarta et al 2011 ross et al 2013 but in the case of spencer gulf aquaculture these factors have already been considered in defining aquaculture zone locations and the classes of aquaculture permitted in each zone pirsa 2013 the predictors selected for consideration were 1 sea surface temperature sst annual mean maximum minimum and range 2 light availability photosynthetically available radiation par annual mean and maximum diffuse attenuation kd annual mean maximum and minimum 3 water quality salinity and ph 4 nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus 5 water movement average and maximum current velocity cv 90th percentile of wave energy flux wave energy environmental data layers were obtained from bio oracle assis et al 2017 tyberghein et al 2012 using the r r core team 2019 package sdmpredictors bosch 2017 with the exception of wave energy which was obtained from the australian wave energy atlas durrant et al 2013 wave energy was resampled to the same resolution as the bio oracle layers using the r package raster hijmans 2016 some predictors were highly correlated r 0 7 e g mean sst was highly correlated with both minimum and maximum sst and with mean par we selected variables from these correlated sets based on their average performance in single variable models ashford et al 2014 braunisch et al 2013 dormann et al 2013 merow et al 2013 run using each modelling method see section 2 3 for details the candidate set of environmental variables for each species was selected in order of fractional deviance explained also known as the deviance ratio d2 which is equivalent to the r2 of ordinary least squares regression guisan and zimmermann 2000 vollering et al 2019 excluding variables that were correlated at r 0 7 with any of greater deviance explained the candidate variables used in modelling for each species are shown in table 1 along with the number of available occurrence records for each species 2 3 species distribution modelling approaches to compare the recommended modelling approaches for avoiding overfitting we constructed models using the following approaches to generate sdms for each species 1 default regularisation and feature types which in the maxnet implementation and v3 4 0 of the maxent jar software include linear quadratic hinge and product features phillips 2017 phillips et al 2017 2 regularisation multipliers from 2 to 8 with all feature types anderson and gonzalez jr 2011 muscarella et al 2014 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 3 default regularisation with linear and quadratic features only following elith et al 2010 all implemented using the maxnet package phillips 2017 in r r core team 2019 and 4 forward selection using maximum likelihood ml methods halvorsen 2013 halvorsen et al 2015 mazzoni et al 2015 vollering et al 2019 built with the r package miamaxent vollering et al 2018 the forward selection models were built in three steps following halvorsen 2013 halvorsen et al 2015 mazzoni et al 2015 vollering et al 2019 1 five derived variables were obtained for each environmental predictor one linear one monotonous zero skew and three deviation type 2 the most parsimonious set of derived variables was selected for each environmental predictor and 3 models were built using combinations of environmental predictors each represented by the selected derived variable set for both steps 2 and 3 nested models were compared using likelihood ratio tests lrts and model selection based on α 0 01 the ml model for pterocladia was not identifiable due to complete separation a potential issue for ipp models where the average value of a covariate at presence locations is at the upper or lower limit of the range for that covariate hefley and hooten 2015 where this problem occurs ml estimates become infinite but models may be estimated using penalised likelihoods e g regularisation as applied in maxnet or by using a weakly informative prior such as proposed by gelman et al 2008 for logistic regression to restrict parameter estimates to finite plausible values hefley and hooten 2015 we therefore applied a modification of the forward selection method by replacing calls to the standard r glm function in miamaxent with the bayesglm function of the arm package gelman and su 2018 which implements the cauchy prior recommended by gelman et al 2008 for logistic regression and shown to be effective for the ipp case hefley and hooten 2015 the cauchy prior method was otherwise identical to the ml method including the use of the derived variables generated by miamaxent and forward variable selection based on lrts and was used to generate models for all species not just pterocladia in order to compare its performance with the other modelling approaches used the miamaxent package automatically adds presence points to the background data vollering et al 2019 this is an option in the maxent jar software but not in the maxnet package we therefore manually added presence points to the tgs background samples for use in all maxnet models 2 4 model performance assessment a number of metrics are commonly used to assess sdm performance of these aikikes information criterion with small sample size correction aicc best selects models that have good transferability warren and seifert 2011 we calculated aicc as per burnham et al 2011 using code adapted from the r package enmsdm smith 2019 which calculates aicc based on the method proposed by warren and seifert 2011 and adapted by wright et al 2015 for the case where non random background points e g tgs are used for comparison we also calculated other common performance metrics area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc based on training data auctrain and on independent test data auctest deviance ratio d2 and model calibration fieberg et al 2018 the presence absence data set for determining test data auc was compiled from unpublished data held by sardi aquatic sciences that was collected during temperate reef surveys collings et al 2008 turner et al 2007 and field visits to identify potential collection sites for seaweed seed stock wiltshire et al 2015 these records were not included in the training data set but as with the training data represent natural seaweed occurrence not farmed seaweed locations the purpose of our models was to predict environmental suitability in an aquaculture setting and we therefore excluded some environmental variables that are likely to be important in determining natural seaweed distributions e g depth and substrate characteristics we note that our models are likely to be suboptimal for predicting natural species occurrences in comparison to models including all biologically relevant predictors and may over predict in areas where depth or substrate would be unsuitable for natural species occurrence the ability of each model to predict to this independent test data is however a valid measure of relative model performance as all models were based on the same suite of environmental variables the interpretation of training auc for presence only models is not at straight forward as interpretation of training auc based on presence absence data the maximum training auc possible for models built using presence only data is 1 and is dependent on apparent prevalence i e the ratio of occurrence to background points and additionally the auc of the null or random model may be different to 0 5 raes and ter steege 2007 yackulic et al 2013 we therefore used a null model approach for assessment of training auc which involved building 99 null models for each of the eight modelled species using randomly selected tgs points as presences following merckx et al 2011 raes and ter steege 2007 the number of tgs points used in null models was equal to the number of species occurrence records in each case the rank of training auc in comparison to the 99 null model auc values can be used as a statistical test of predictive performance raes and ter steege 2007 i e where model auc is greater than at least 95 of the 99 null aucs the model is considered better than random at p 0 05 one sided and a model auc higher than all 99 null model aucs indicates prediction better than random at p 0 01 d2 and adjusted d2 of each model were calculated based on guisan and zimmermann 2000 adjusted d2 and aicc are both measures that account for the number of parameters and number of observations and penalise more complex models or those based on fewer data guisan and zimmermann 2000 warren and seifert 2011 calibration of each individual species model was assessed using the continuous boyce index boyce et al 2002 fieberg et al 2018 hirzel et al 2006 a quantitative version of the presence only calibration plot recommended by phillips and elith 2010 boyce indices were calculated using the r package ecospat broennimann et al 2018 di cola et al 2017 the boyce index ranges from 1 to 1 with positive values indicating predictions in agreement with expectation 0 indicating predictions no better than random and negative values indicating predictions contrary to expected 2 5 predicted environmental suitability prediction rasters were generated for spencer gulf using raw output of all models for each species the raw output of maxent jar and maxnet is a relative occurrence rate but its value is dependent on the number of background presence points used elith et al 2011 the default output of miamaxent is the probability ratio output pro proposed by halvorsen 2013 pro output is a rescaling of raw scores to remove the dependence on the number of points used such that the mean suitability of a random cell in the model domain 1 bendiksby et al 2014 halvorsen 2013 halvorsen et al 2015 mazzoni 2016 vollering et al 2019 pro scores through the model domain for a species therefore show suitability for that species relative to an average site and allow comparison between models built using different numbers of points for the same species without strong assumptions or data about prevalence i e the proportion of available sites that a species occupies however raw output and hence pro scores can only be interpreted as relative indices of suitability and not probabilities of occurrence or absolute abundance elith et al 2011 merow et al 2013 yackulic et al 2013 and these scores are not directly comparable between species elith et al 2011 merow et al 2013 maxent jar v3 4 0 uses a complimentary log log transform as the default output this transform has a stronger theoretical basis than the logistic transform that was the default output for earlier versions however it is still not directly comparable between species where prevalence is unknown phillips et al 2017 the maxnet package includes both transforms as prediction options along with raw output phillips 2017 for each species and modelling method we determined the mean raw score at the occurrence points used for modelling equivalent to the meanpred method of liu et al 2013 and used this to scale the raw suitability predictions for our purposes this mean occurrence point score is not taken to be a threshold for defining presence absence or suitable unsuitable areas but rather as a reference value to permit comparison between species the derived relative suitability results illustrate suitability relative to that at an average presence site for each species in comparing between species a higher relative suitability score should not be interpreted as higher absolute suitability for one species over others for the area of interest but does indicate higher suitability relative to known occurrences for that species in comparison to a lower scoring species to assess suitability for each species within existing aquaculture zones mean relative suitability using the modelling method with lowest aicc for that species was extracted for all relevant aquaculture zones to examine how predictions varied between modelling methods relative suitability for each species was extracted for 200 random points across all aquaculture zones for each model gamma generalised linear modelling glm was applied to determine how predicted suitability varied between models for each species the gamma family was used as it is suitable for strictly positive continuous data zuur et al 2013 initial data exploration showed that the effects of modelling methods were not consistent across species and as we were primarily interested in exploring the effects of modelling method we ran a separate glm analysis for each species each glm was run in a bayesian framework using jags v 4 3 0 plummer 2017 with three chains for 10 000 iterations thinned at a rate of 10 following 2000 iterations for adaptation and 10 000 iterations for burn in diffuse normal priors were used for all coefficients and factor levels were considered different to the reference default model where the 95 credible interval of the posterior coefficient estimate did not include zero jags was run using the r2jags package su and yajima 2015 convergence was assessed using the gelman rubin convergence statistic and confirmed by visual inspection of trace density and autocorrelation plots generated using the mcmcplots package mckay curtis 2015 to visualise spatial variation in model predictions using different options we generated maps for each species for the default model regularisation multipliers of 2 4 6 and 8 linear quadratic model and each forward selection model and also of the mean prediction across all models and standard deviation x 5 across models for that species for mapping standard deviation was multiplied by 5 in order to better visualise areas where predictions varied no model weighting was applied to the average predictions in these maps as our aim was to illustrate overall model agreement or difference not to derive average models for the purpose of spatial prediction raster extraction and calculation was performed using the r package raster hijmans 2016 and maps generated using rastervis perpiñán and hijmans 2019 3 results 3 1 model performance forward selection models were the most parsimonious for all species as assessed by aicc table 2 figure 2 with the ml models having the lowest aicc for all species except pterocladia where this model was not identifiable data exploration revealed that salinity was a near perfect predictor for this species leading to separation in the data the cauchy prior model had the lowest aicc for pterocladia and the second lowest for all other species being marginally higher than that of the ml model in each case though less than 0 5 greater in the case of cystophora and sargassum figure 2 table 3 within regularised models for solieria gelidium pterocladia and sargassum aicc was lower at regularisation mutlipliers of 2 4 than for default models before increasing with further regularisation while aicc increased consistently with increasing regularisation for the remaining species linear quadratic models had lower aicc than default models for solieria gelidium and sargassum but higher for other species generally similar to that of high regularisation models default models always had the greatest number of parameters 37 55 table 3 increasing the regularisation multiplier decreased the number of parameters for each species to a minimum of 7 16 across species at a regularisation multiplier of 8 linear quadratic models had a similar number of parameters 13 16 to models with moderate to high regularisation while forward selection models typically had the fewest or equal fewest parameters for each species 3 14 for the ml method and 3 9 for the cauchy prior method default models explained the highest proportion of deviance for each species as measured by d2 figure 3 d2 declined slightly with increasing regularisation with linear quadratic and forward selection models typically having intermediate d2 but overall differences in d2 between models were minor 0 04 figure 3 adjusted d2 was consistently lowest for default models and highest for forward selection models specifically for the ml option for solieria plocamium cystophora sargassum and scytothalia and the cauchy prior option for the remaining species but with 0 005 difference in adjusted d2 between the forward selection models for each species figure 3 predictive performance based on training data was similar within each species across modelling methods table 3 supplementary material and all models had good discriminatory power with a minimum difference of 0 19 between training and null auc and auctrain of each model all 99 null aucs therefore auc better than random p 0 01 average null auc for each species and modelling method was close to 0 5 table 2 the model selected by aicc had the highest or equal highest auctrain for plocamium and ecklonia the difference in auctrain between the selected model and highest auctrain for each species was minor 0 06 table 2 on average auctrain was highest for the default method across species but differences to other models were minor average difference 0 04 table 3 regularisation and use of restricted feature types linear and quadratic only led to marginally reduced auctrain with a regularisation multiplier of 8 and linear quadratic models having lowest auctrain overall while auctrain for forward selection models was intermediate table 3 performance based on auctest showed greater variation across modelling methods although average differences were still minor 0 08 table 3 forward selection ml models had the highest auctest on average while default models had the lowest average auctest across species table 3 default models however had the highest or equal highest auctest for pterocladia plocamium and scytothalia the models selected by aicc had the highest or equal highest auctest for solieria gelidium and plocamium table 2 a regularisation multiplier of 4 resulted in the highest auctest for sargassum with high regularisation multipliers giving the highest auctest for scytothalia and cystophora and the linear quadratic model had the highest auctest for ecklonia see supplementary material auctest scores were notably different between species with the highest auctest scores being between 0 84 and 0 92 for most species but lower for some 0 71 and 0 74 for ecklonia and gelidium respectively and 0 58 for sargassum the difference in auctest between the selected model and the highest auctest for each species was 0 08 table 2 calibration as measured by the continuous boyce index varied across models without displaying consistent patterns calibration generally increased with increasing regularisation to a multiplier of between 2 and 6 but not always monotonically supplementary material with average calibration being highest at regularisation multipliers of 2 3 and lowest for models with restricted feature types table 3 the model selected by aicc had the highest calibration for sargassum while the aicc selected models for gelidium and cystophora showed reduced calibration in comparison to the best models for those species although the selected models still showed good 0 5 calibration table 2 forward selection models had lower calibration on average than default or high regularisation models but the reduction was minor table 3 and average calibration across all modelling methods was good 0 76 in all cases supplementary material the boyce index was positive for all models ranging from 0 48 1 showing predictions consistent with expectation 3 2 environmental suitability of spencer gulf and aquaculture zones the red seaweed solieria was predicted to have high relative suitability 1 throughout spencer gulf by the selected model figure 4 with relative suitability being greatest in northern spencer gulf 2 in parts all other species showed generally higher relative suitability in southern than northern spencer gulf figure 4 relative suitability for the brown seaweeds cystophora and sargassum was predicted to be 1 for much of central and southern spencer gulf and the brown ecklonia also showed areas of relative suitability 1 in central spencer gulf figure 4 predictions were generally similar across modelling methods for most species being most variable for ecklonia the default model for this species predicted somewhat lower relative suitability in central spencer gulf than the selected model although still with areas of relative suitability 0 5 supplementary material for cystophora the selected model also predicted slightly higher suitability through much of spencer gulf and to the south of the gulf than the default model supplementary material and for solieria the selected model predicted higher relative suitability in northern spencer gulf than the default model relative suitability from the selected model for gelidium pterocladia and scytothalia however was slightly lower in southern spencer gulf than for the default model in each case while predictions were generally similar between the selected and default models for plocamium maps of standard deviation across models show that the greatest discrepancies between predictions across all modelling methods were generally in southern spencer gulf and outside the gulf except for solieria where the greatest discrepancies were in northern spencer gulf supplementary material for all species the greatest discrepancies were in areas where the highest relative suitability was predicted with predictions for some modelling methods in these regions being considerably greater than others while differences between models were relatively minor in areas of moderate to low suitability for each species based on the selected model solieria had relative suitability 1 for all existing aquaculture zones figure 5 of the brown seaweeds the highest relative suitability across aquaculture zones was predicted for sargassum which had predicted relative suitability 0 5 except for fitzgerald bay tickera and proper bay and suitability close to 1 for the port neill and lincoln inner zones predicted relative suitability for cystophora was 0 5 for the port neill tumby bay louth bay boston bay and lincoln zones with highest suitability in the lincoln outer zone ecklonia had relative suitability 1 in the port neil zone and 0 5 in tumby bay and louth bay south predicted relative suitability for scytothalia was 0 5 for the boston bay and lincoln inner zones of southern spencer gulf and approached 1 for the lincoln outer zone for the remaining red seaweeds gelidium and plocamium had predicted relative suitability 0 5 for the lincoln outer zone but predicted suitability was 0 5 for other zones for these species and in all zones for pterocladia figure 5 3 3 differences between default and alternative model predictions differences between relative suitability predictions within aquaculture zones from default and alternative modelling methods did not display consistent patterns across species as assessed by the gamma glms table 4 the most parsimonious forward selection models predicted higher relative suitability on average across the aquaculture zones than the default models for solieria and plocamium but lower for gelidium ecklonia and sargassum while predictions were similar between the selected and default models for pterocladia cystophora and scytothalia in all cases however the scale of the difference was small the greatest discrepancy being 20 higher relative suitability predictions on average by the forward selection model than the default model for solieria table 4 predictions from the cauchy prior forward selection model were lower than the ml model for solieria higher for gelidium and ecklonia and similar for the other species but differences where present were minor table 4 increasing regularisation also had variable effects across species leading to increasingly higher suitability predictions with greater regularisation for each of the red seaweeds and ecklonia lower predictions at a regularisation multiplier of 8 for cystophora and for sargassum higher predictions than the default model at regularisation multipliers of 2 4 but with decreasing predictions at higher regularisation while predictions were similar for scytothalia between default and higher regularisation models in most cases the change to the scale of the predictions with regularisation was minor but for pterocladia predicted suitability under high regularisation was almost three times higher than under the default model using restricted feature types linear quadratic only led to higher average predictions than the default model for solieria pterocladia plocamium ecklonia and sargassum with predictions being similar between these modelling methods for the remaining species the scale of differences between the linear quadratic and default models was generally small again with the exception of pterocladia for which the linear quadratic model predictions were approximately twice as high as those of the default model table 4 4 discussion default methods for maximum entropy sdm produce overly complex models halvorsen et al 2015 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 syfert et al 2013 vollering et al 2019 warren and seifert 2011 our results also demonstrate that default models are over parameterised leading to increased aicc and decreases in adjusted d2 and generally lower predictive performance auc using independent test data we found that forward selection methods following the miamaxent approach halvorsen 2013 halvorsen et al 2015 vollering et al 2019 produced the most parsimonious models but as recognised by hefley and hooten 2015 the ml method may fail in some circumstances where ml estimates are not finite due to separation we encountered this problem in the model for the red seaweed pterocladia applying a weakly informative cauchy prior as per gelman et al 2008 to the weighted logistic regression allowed a forward selection model to be produced for pterocladia with this model being most parsimonious for this species for each of the remaining species the cauchy prior model had marginally higher aicc than the ml forward selection model but lower than other modelling methods the other proposed approaches to limit model complexity increasing the regularisation multiplier anderson and gonzalez jr 2011 muscarella et al 2014 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 or using only linear and quadratic feature types elith et al 2010 merow et al 2013 syfert et al 2013 each resulted in models having fewer parameters than the default method these methods however also resulted in poorer model fit i e reduced d2 and log likelihood and hence aicc similar to or higher than default models default models had the best predictive performance as assessed using training data auc but differences to other model options were minor and all models performed well as assessed by this metric auc is often used for sdm assessment but the usefulness of auc for this purpose has been questioned jiménez valverde 2012 lobo et al 2008 peterson et al 2008 training auc in particular has been criticised as a metric for model selection because it typically selects over fitted models warren and seifert 2011 interpretation of auc for presence only models can be problematic but use of null model auc for comparison can assist with this issue merckx et al 2011 raes and ter steege 2007 in contrast to other studies hijmans 2012 raes and ter steege 2007 we found null auc for each species to be close to 0 5 the value expected for presence absence models or in the absence of sampling bias but this will not always be the case where presence only data are used hence the null model auc value serves as a useful comparison for assessment of model auc values the use of independent and ideally presence absence test data for model selection and validation based on test data auc has been recommended and is recognised as a more appropriate measure of model performance than training auc halvorsen et al 2016 liu et al 2013 phillips and dudík 2008 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 warren and seifert 2011 forward selection models had the highest auctest scores on average however we did not find that test data auc consistently selected the most parsimonious models differences in predictive performance to test data between models were generally minor and although default models had decreased auctest in some cases this pattern was not consistent across species we also found that auctest varied more widely between models for different species than between models within any individual species and was consistently lower for some species than others the differences in auc between species likely occurred because auc is typically higher for species with a well defined geographic or ecological niche than for more widespread generalist species lobo et al 2008 van proosdij et al 2016 while some limitations of using auc for model comparison can be overcome raes and ter steege 2007 van proosdij et al 2016 or may not apply in all cases halvorsen et al 2016 it is clear that auc for assessment of presence only models is only valid for comparison within and not across species models for our purpose we wanted to predict potential suitability but in addition to its other drawbacks auc is typically a poor metric for selecting models of the potential as opposed to realised distribution of a species jiménez valverde 2012 calibration measured by the continuous boyce index did not show consistent patterns with modelling method across species although overall calibration was marginally higher for models with increased regularisation than for default models the forward selection models selected by aicc showed reduced calibration on average but were still well calibrated having a minimum boyce index of 0 59 calibration is an often overlooked aspect of model validation fieberg et al 2018 hirzel et al 2006 but its suitability as a metric for model selection has not been thoroughly assessed we selected models using aicc based on the principal of parsimony because simpler models are likely to have greater transferability and ecological interpretability than more complex models halvorsen et al 2016 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 verbruggen et al 2013 vollering et al 2019 warren and seifert 2011 considerations that are more important to our purpose than accuracy of prediction we found that aicc was lowest and adjusted d2 was highest for forward selection models with aicc selecting the ml model except where not identified and adjusted d2 being very similar between ml and cauchy prior models for each species to our knowledge adjusted d2 has not been used for selection of maxent models although it can be applied for comparison in logistic regression gelman and su 2018 hirzel et al 2006 the recognition of maxent as an ipp opens up the possibility of using adjusted d2 to assess and compare model fit for these models aicc does not necessarily select models with the greatest predictive accuracy as demonstrated by velasco and gonzález salazar 2019 and also by our results and the same is likely true of adjusted d2 we note however that differences in auc and calibration between the most parsimonious models and best performing models as assessed by these metrics were minor in our case therefore there was little cost to predictive accuracy in selecting models based on aicc further validation of our model results is however difficult due to the lack of existing seaweed farms or larger sets of systematic survey data for the modelled species the relative suitability predictions for our area of interest varied between modelling methods but the scale of the differences was generally not large and in most cases would not change the interpretation of areas as being broadly suitable or unsuitable for each species we found however that increased regularisation or the use of restricted feature types resulted in considerably 2 3 x higher predictions than the default for pterocladia it appears therefore that predictions based on these particular alternative modelling methods could change interpretations of results in some cases the r packages now implemented to run the various maxent modelling methods via weighted logistic regression are faster than the maxent jar software hence it is more feasible to run and compare multiple modelling methods across several species than previously we therefore encourage further exploration of the effects of using alternative modelling strategies on model performance and predictions choice of modelling method and of the metric applied to assess models should depend on the modelling purpose at hand and the relative importance of transferability interpretability and predictive accuracy for that purpose aquaculture site selection is a relatively new application of sdm and the use of sdm for this purpose is not well established though the potential of this method has been recognised falconer et al 2016 linhoss et al 2016 oyinlola et al 2018 sdm applications for aquaculture site selection to date have primarily used the location falconer et al 2016 oyinlola et al 2018 or commercial yield vincenzi et al 2007 vincenzi et al 2011 of existing farms for model building and have assessed model results relative to the outputs of the more established methods e g multi criteria evaluation that rely on pre existing knowledge of suitable conditions for farming falconer et al 2016 vincenzi et al 2007 falconer et al 2016 found that mahalanobis typicality model outputs were more consistent with multi criteria evaluation results than those of the default maxent jar method for predicting site suitability for fish farms our aims and method varied from theirs for several reasons we were considering novel aquaculture species for which there are no existing farms and the lack of detailed biological knowledge of these species prevented us from applying a multi criteria evaluation for comparison our application of sdm for aquaculture also differed as we considered suitability for candidate species within existing aquaculture zones with these zones having already been spatially defined following assessment for social logistical and general environmental suitability for aquaculture pirsa 2013 our interest was therefore solely habitat suitability for the species being considered and we elected to use maximum entropy modelling as this is a well suited method for the presence only occurrence data that were available our results demonstrate however that the default maxent method may not be the most appropriate where model transferability to different areas is likely to be important such as for predicting aquaculture site suitability the models developed here show relative suitability for the native seaweeds that are being investigated for cultivation across the existing aquaculture zones in sa it is unclear how well predicted suitability from the models which is based on relative occurrence rate will relate to seaweed performance in aquaculture we interpret the results with some caution in light of this limited validation but given the paucity of data on the species considered the results help to inform future research directions specifically the results show which zones may be most suitable for seaweed aquaculture and will assist in identification of the species most suitable for cultivation in each area all existing aquaculture zones in spencer gulf sa where seaweed farming is permitted are likely to be suitable for at least one of the candidate seaweeds solieria appears the best suited for cultivation in spencer gulf especially in the northern zones with the brown seaweeds sargassum ecklonia cystophora and scytothalia each being potentially suited to at least some areas of southern spencer gulf the other candidate red seaweeds gelidium pterocladia and plocamium show generally low suitability throughout the spencer gulf aquaculture zones and appear less suited to cultivation in this area spencer gulf is an inverse estuary with evaporation exceeding precipitation leading to increasingly hypersaline conditions towards the head north of the gulf northern spencer gulf also experiences warmer temperatures and a greater annual temperature range than the southern gulf nunes and lennon 1986 these environmental gradients are likely to be important drivers for seaweed habitat suitability we note that the spatial resolution of the environmental data used is too low to distinguish fine scale distributional preferences such as occurrence on exposed or sheltered sides of a reef thus only broad scale responses to variables such as wave energy are captured in the models the environmental data used are also annual averages or seasonal extremes and so model results reflect suitability for each species to occur long term for those species with low predicted suitability it is possible that conditions in some areas may be suitable for growth at certain times of year and permit seasonal cultivation species with greater relative suitability in an area are however likely to perform better over a greater proportion of the year and it is unlikely that a species will grow well in an area of very low relative suitability for its occurrence the models also provide insight into ecological responses which can be used to guide further investigation of candidate species models built using the alternative modelling approach of miamaxent provide relatively simple response curves to ecological parameters halvorsen et al 2016 støa et al 2018 vollering et al 2019 which can be explored in order to determine potential suitable environmental conditions and apparent optima for each species response curves from sdms do not always reflect physiological or ecological responses due to the influence of correlated variables elith and leathwick 2009 or because a species may be restricted from occurring at sites with favourable conditions of a given predictor by other factors marcelino and verbruggen 2015 the curves can still provide insight where biological knowledge is lacking and help to inform further investigation marcelino and verbruggen 2015 such experimental investigation of optimal conditions for growth will help to inform the best seasons for growth as well as assisting in identifying the best potential areas for seaweed aquaculture credit

24843,the rapid process of land use and cover changes can be regarded as the most crucial human induced factor which is responsible for the wildlife habitats destruction while focusing on habitat features of the keystone species with broad habitat requirements it will be possible to provide nature conservation priority maps under different scenarios of landuse and land cover change for the

rainfall of 256 mm and a mean annual temperature of 14 2 c during the year 2 2 data preparation land use and land cover maps for all models were prepared from satellite imagery taken from 1985 to 2016 from tm and etm satellite sensors of landsat the images were subjected to three stages of pre processing processing and post processing and various land uses were extracted output validation has been done by fieldwork in the preselected random points we collected the ecological factors in two scales of microhabitat and landscape levels to provide the species habitat suitability maps meanwhile vegetation percent cover in the activity points vegetation community type as well as earth topography azimuth elevation from sea level and climatic factors have been included we also extracted distal

landuse change modeling using weights of evidence woe woe computes the weight of each independent variable based on the occurrence and nonoccurrence of the dependent variable the probability value is calculated based on the prior probability of occurrence and nonoccurrence of residential pixels in each class of evidence the transitional probability was estimated based on the magnitude of transition in each category the classification of the evidence was defined according to type and proximity analysis was performed on the distance based parameters in the case of nominal parameters such as soil and geological types each type was considered as one class the entire base layer of all pieces of evidence was converted into a grid cell the spatial association of each residential pixel and each level of evidence was computed by subtracting the natural logarithm of occurrence and the natural logarithm of nonoccurrence a positive value indicates a high number of residential pixels while a negative value indicates a low number of residential pixels growing in this class finally the standardized value which represents the significance of the spatial association and measures the relative certainty of the posterior probability was estimated based on the variance and standard deviation of the contrast bonham carter 1994 after preparing the data in such a way that it can be entered into the dinamica ego system the transfer matrix between different classes of user coverage was calculated using the markov series method as the cellular automata rule then all of the assumptive variables were introduced into the model and the effect of each of them was investigated for all existing transfers and finally the matrix of woe was calculated 3 2 maximum entropy maxent maxent model was run with five replicates and 5000 max iterations using 9 habitat variables and 23 species presence points which of them we put away 25 percent of the points to model verification the auc criteria were used to interoperate the acceptability of the model outputs maxent maxent v3 3 3e is a general purpose machine learning method based on maximum entropy theory that has been developed in statistical mechanics for species distribution modeling phillips et al 2006 the idea of maxent is to estimates niches by finding the distribution of probabilities closest to uniform maximum entropy subjected to the constrained that feature values match their empirical average the importance of environmental variables is evaluated by using jackknife tests elith et al 2011 ten random partitions were used to assess the average behavior of the models phillips et al 2006 each partition was generated by cross validation 75 species occurrence as calibration data and the remaining 25 species occurrence as evaluation data the area under the roc receiver operating characteristic curve or auc was used to evaluate the model performance auc is a measure for model performance that varies from 0 to 1 fielding and bell 1997 auc of 0 50 indicates that the performance of the model did not substantially better than random whereas a value of 1 indicates perfect discrimination swets 1998 3 3 co

socioeconomic processes along with scenarios for climate and land use calculating a baseline for current ecosystem service provision and examining a series of interventions or scenes of change will

of 15 years from 2001 to 2016 has been presented in the following table based on the markov chain table 1 for verification of the simulation outputs we compared simulated and observed maps in 2016 using a fuzzy two way similarity analysis the size of the moving window between was changed from 1 ground area of 900 m2 to 33 cells ground area of 98 ha for each animated window with a specified length the corresponding regions were compared in simulated and observed maps of 2016 the similarity ranges from 0 no similarity to 1 complete similarity fig 2 as can be concluded from the following figure the similarity index is changing from 34 to more than 80 for cell sizes of 1 and 33 respectively considering the trend of landuse changes in the study area bare lands gardens and forests show a decreasing trend while rangelands stay nearly constant urbanization and the rural industrial regions experienced a dramatic increase of twice for 15 years these trends will be continued during the next decade as it can be inferred from the future prediction map fig 3 c similarity analysis showed that the output model successfully predicted the land use and land cover change for 15 years therefore we also used this model for the next 15 years from 2016 table 2 thus the outputted maps can be used safely in the integration process of two other models resulted in plans differences between the simulated model and observed reality were also calculated based on the 2016 real situation as a control point table 3 our results for the first 15 years showed that the area of fallow lands increased from 7 27 to 42 6 while farmlands decreased from 2 61 to 1 28 and gardens experienced the same trend as its area fell from 5 79 to 3 63 the size of the soil is almost constant and is estimated at 0 65 rangelands don t show considerable change however forested areas reduce to half of its primary domain the most significant change can be seen in urban rural industrial areas increase from 5 50 to 11 43 the situation for the next 15 years future scenario is slightly different as water bodies and gardens area doesn t change considerably while bare lands area will increase to two times its original size most importantly the size of the forested regions will decrease from 0 59 to 0 21 and urban rural industrial areas will increase from 12 12 to 12 61 4 1 brown bear distribution modeling the results of the desirable habitat modeling of brown bears showed that the average surface area under the curve auc was calculated to be 0 935 which indicates the excellent performance of the model in this regard inquiring about the most effective parameter in the focal species habitat suitability and distribution based on jackknife graphs showed that the presence of forest patches located in the remote areas and far from human settlements and traffic roads paly a significant role in the viability of this umbrella species from other most essential factors distance to the water resources and land slope can be mentioned as well the final habitat suitability map has been shown in fig 4 our analysis based on the de model showed that with the current trends of lulc change missing at least 25 percent of the suitable habitats for the target species will be highly probable fig 5 indicated how the species habitat suitability would change under land use and land cover change scenarios up to 2031 4 2 co ting nature based on this model the relative indices of biodiversity pressure and environmental services has been shown in fig 6 as our analysis showed the areas with the highest potential ecosystem service indices are located along the southern slopes of alborz mountainous ridges specifically in alborz markazi protected area fig 6 this area has the highest values regarding ecosystem services which can be compared with the potential ecosystem services map as the model output maps indicate karaj capital and suburban associated with low inherent service index values the spatial distribution of realized ecosystem services indicates the human communities are located near the potential ecosystem services distribution fig 7 5 discussion for environmental sustainability decision makers require consistent accurate and detailed information to advise and support the necessary actions one of the best strategies to achieve the best of necessary actions is using multiple models and incorporating their predictions to get the ultimate model to this aim the ideal situation will be when we consider both human related environments and wildlife habitats three frequently used models which have been processed in this research can cover a different part of a target area from those related to sustainable development to biodiversity conservation co ting nature assessed ecosystem services in the study province and showed the benefits which people can obtain from nature while assessing the impacts of human activities under different scenarios millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 the most important policy which has been provided by the co ting nature is a map of biodiversity conservation priority under the sustainable management of environmental services while considering critical habitats for an umbrella species like the brown bear and considering current human pressures as well as future threats mulligan 2016 as this output showed northern mountainous parts of the province needs special consideration as these areas face more pressure and future threats zolin and rodrigues 2016 hughes 2019 because co ting nature employed global relationships the generated distributions of the potential and realized ecosystem service indices should be considered as first estimates that need to be further checked against regional and local data and knowledge the results of dinamica ego as a framework that supports the development of geomodeling applications presented that constructed area will be increased at a relatively high speed compared to 2016 status in northern parts an increase in the constructed area was at the cost of a decrease in forested regions and rangelands plus expanding the bare lands in other words an increase in constructed lands would lead to a greater trade off for ecologically important land uses such as forest and rangelands and the pressure on the habitats would result in loss of biodiversity our findings indicate that the study area would experience rapid urbanization in the future mainly because of immigration at the same time cultivated land would experience expansion due to the conversion of mainly unused land to cultivated land in each scenario on the whole it can be stated that with the expansion of the constructed area the cultivated land would also experience an incremental trend parsa and salehi 2016 due to simultaneously increasing demand for natural resources our findings suggest that suitable development can be happened in the study area provided that environmental policy was strictly implemented which can offer both environmental and economic benefits generally land system dynamics is a complex process and any land model is unable to describe the pattern of land use changes completely verburg et al 2006 evaluation of the performance of various spatial models in recent studies indicated that there were still uncertainties present in the projection of land use changes pontius et al 2004 britz et al 2011 in our study we focused only on geophysical climatic biodiversity and proximity variables still we could not consider other factors such as land use policy related variables e g infrastructure policy zoning of land uses due to data availability and the quantification problem thus the absence of these factors may cause differences in simulation results of the land use structure the driving force identified in the study area on the environment has put pressure on the effects of emerging and emerging responses are also activities undertaken by the human community to reduce environmental pressures mitigate impacts and enhance the quality of the environment this research showed that the current trend of lulc changes in this study area is not toward sustainable development the main activities should be focused on the execution of the laws and development policies that were approved based on land use planning studies immigration control is a critical issue that can reduce the loss of natural landscapes and land degradations a future study could use policy and other factors along with current study variables to achieve accurate simulation results of land use changes in the study area besides we focused here only on future landuse changes but did not take into account impacts from these changes future research should consider the impacts of landuse changes on regional climate finally the integrated dynamic model was developed in this study to provide prioritized nature conservation maps for the future relying on the ecosystem services while focusing on a keystone large carnivorous species based on simulation results of landuse changes can guide the planners and policymakers in the decision making of sustainable

24843,the rapid process of land use and cover changes can be regarded as the most crucial human induced factor which is responsible for the wildlife habitats destruction while focusing on habitat features of the keystone species with broad habitat requirements it will be possible to provide nature conservation priority maps under different scenarios of landuse and land cover change for the future in this study an integrated dynamic model was developed to provide prioritized nature conservation maps for the future relying on the ecosystem services while focusing on a keystone large carnivorous species based on the prediction of future landuse changes in karaj district alborz province northwestern iran this study aimed to model the suitability of habitats for brown bears classify the conservation priorities based on the ecosystem services and simulate future changes of landuse or land cover to advise on the protection of biodiversity our results indicated that such a multi approached based modeling can better show the conservation needs and priorities of the lands for a proposed time in the future in the case of the study area karaj district we found that if the current pattern of land use and land cover change is going on continuously we will miss significant parts of the critical habitats and their vital ecosystem services in the near future based on the results the results represented the importance of adopting an integrated approach based on the combination of conservation of focal species maxent ecosystem oriented co ting nature method as well as applying

development turner 1994 khatibi et al 2018a under the ever changing environment and its clear effects on the terrestrial habitats it is necessary to design such a protected area with flexible plans and especially borders to cover the species requirements in the future oliveira et al 2017 different studies that tried to evaluate the efficiency of protected areas in sustaining their ecosystem services and providing species requirements under the climatic scenarios indicated a necessity of protected ecosystems coverage areas pérez vega et al 2012 alagador et al 2014 for example karami et al 2020 resulted that the currently covered areas by the protected habitats will not support its biodiversity needs during the next 5 100 years because of serious climate change and sever change in the large carnivores occurrence range most of species habitat suitability modeling studies have been carried out relying on a single modeling approach like maximum entropy maxent phillips et al 2006 or mixing a couple of focal species models like maxent random forests rf ecological niche factor analysis enfa and generalized linear models glm ahmadi et al 2019 neglecting the major part of ecosystem services maes et al 2012b and human related landuse changes together with these focal species models co ting nature also provides ecosystem services maps which can also be used in modifying the lucc trend to keep the services viable for the long term in the future aziz and cappellen 2019 demographic factors such as population size population growth urban expansion and population density are widely used as the main drivers of landuse change which can be addressed by dinamica ego de modeling approach khatibi et al 2018b this model is mainly dependent on the remote sensing data and spatial analysis to investigate lucc soares et al 2013 overall there are two major types of lucc surveys in the de modeling approach include the machine learning land transformation model which is based on socioeconomic and biological factors kwadwonti 2013 the second common model in the de approach also includes statistical based weight of evidence as a data driven method which estimates the relative priority of evidential themes by statistical methods based on bayesian rules and the application of prior and posterior probabilities soares filho 2009 both of these models can be easily integrated with gis and estimate uncertainty and involve evidence from various data sources wu 1998 verburg et al 2006 large carnivores like brown bears require more habitat area than other terrestrial species thereby acting as umbrella species for landscape conservation noss 1990 as top predators large carnivores are also keystone species important for the integrity and healthy functioning of ecosystems umbrella and keystone species habitat suitability under the different future scenarios can be made using maxent methodology as well maxent as a species distribution model and an important tool for ecological research has been widely used at different scales to understand the behavior of the ecosystem for protected area planning svenning and skov 2005 and to predict the potential distribution of key species xu et al 2012 based on various researches maxent has been distinguished as a simple and fast model with more accurate especially when distribution data for the species being studied are minimal hernandez et al 2006 it is suitable for the prediction of the potential distribution of reserve scale habitat for species guisan and thuiller 2005 all these outputs can be integrated by the potential ecosystem services map and compared with the current situation and then we will able to plan conservation activities for the future so the whole ecosystem can be sustained in long terms couclelis 2005 samie et al 2017 in this research we differentiated the status of the ecosystem services in alborz province based on current and potential ecosystem services we integrated the outputted maps with maximum entropy habitat suitability models and lucc trend in the future finally the best spatially prioritized conservation maps have been provided focusing on brown bears population s as a focal umbrella species in the study area 2 material and methods 2 1 study area alborz province with an area of 5 833 km2 which represents approximately 3 65 percent of the country is located at northwestern iran karaj district is one of six district of alborz province close to central alborz protected area fig 1 some parts of the central alborz protected area around 640 km2 as a critically important habitat which hosts diverse and rich biodiversity nezami and farhadinia 2011 with the city of approximately 4000 km2 has been located in this province from large mammalian species which constitute one part of the area s species richness we can name wild goats capra aegagrus persian leopard panthera pardus eurasian lynx lynx lynx brown bears ursus arctos gray wolves canis lupus wild sheep ovis ammon gmelini the capital city of this province karaj is the second densest megacity of the country after tehran the prevailing climate of the area is a local steppe climate with a little rainfall of 256 mm and a mean annual temperature of 14 2 c during the year 2 2 data preparation land use and land cover maps for all models were prepared from satellite imagery taken from 1985 to 2016 from tm and etm satellite sensors of landsat the images were subjected to three stages of pre processing processing and post processing and various land uses were extracted output validation has been done by fieldwork in the preselected random points we collected the ecological factors in two scales of microhabitat and landscape levels to provide the species habitat suitability maps meanwhile vegetation percent cover in the activity points vegetation community type as well as earth topography azimuth elevation from sea level and climatic factors have been included we also extracted distal factors like distance to the human induced layers e g roads human settlements and distance to the natural based layers like water resources forest patches and core habitats of the protected area karami et al 2020 3 models 3 1 dinamica ego de cellular automata ca models and genetic algorithms were used in lucc modeling the following steps were adopted to gain the model 1 providing land use and land cover map from related satellite images during the 30 years 2 calibrating the lucc model in a time interval from 1 to 2 3 identification of effective factors and calculating the transfer matrix and variables coefficients for the lucc model 4 two way similarity and fuzzy analysis to determine the range of the similarity among difference maps and original lucc map khatibi et al 2018a 3 1 1 landuse change modeling using weights of evidence woe woe computes the weight of each independent variable based on the occurrence and nonoccurrence of the dependent variable the probability value is calculated based on the prior probability of occurrence and nonoccurrence of residential pixels in each class of evidence the transitional probability was estimated based on the magnitude of transition in each category the classification of the evidence was defined according to type and proximity analysis was performed on the distance based parameters in the case of nominal parameters such as soil and geological types each type was considered as one class the entire base layer of all pieces of evidence was converted into a grid cell the spatial association of each residential pixel and each level of evidence was computed by subtracting the natural logarithm of occurrence and the natural logarithm of nonoccurrence a positive value indicates a high number of residential pixels while a negative value indicates a low number of residential pixels growing in this class finally the standardized value which represents the significance of the spatial association and measures the relative certainty of the posterior probability was estimated based on the variance and standard deviation of the contrast bonham carter 1994 after preparing the data in such a way that it can be entered into the dinamica ego system the transfer matrix between different classes of user coverage was calculated using the markov series method as the cellular automata rule then all of the assumptive variables were introduced into the model and the effect of each of them was investigated for all existing transfers and finally the matrix of woe was calculated 3 2 maximum entropy maxent maxent model was run with five replicates and 5000 max iterations using 9 habitat variables and 23 species presence points which of them we put away 25 percent of the points to model verification the auc criteria were used to interoperate the acceptability of the model outputs maxent maxent v3 3 3e is a general purpose machine learning method based on maximum entropy theory that has been developed in statistical mechanics for species distribution modeling phillips et al 2006 the idea of maxent is to estimates niches by finding the distribution of probabilities closest to uniform maximum entropy subjected to the constrained that feature values match their empirical average the importance of environmental variables is evaluated by using jackknife tests elith et al 2011 ten random partitions were used to assess the average behavior of the models phillips et al 2006 each partition was generated by cross validation 75 species occurrence as calibration data and the remaining 25 species occurrence as evaluation data the area under the roc receiver operating characteristic curve or auc was used to evaluate the model performance auc is a measure for model performance that varies from 0 to 1 fielding and bell 1997 auc of 0 50 indicates that the performance of the model did not substantially better than random whereas a value of 1 indicates perfect discrimination swets 1998 3 3 co ting nature as one of the most popular models for natural capital accounting ecosystem service assessment conservation prioritization analysis of co benefits and analysis of pressures and threats on biodiversity co ting nature is a useful web based tool hughes 2019 this model helps to analyze the ecosystem services provided by natural habitats and assessing the impacts of human induced activities like lulc changes and other interventions zolin and rodrigues 2016 in this model detailed spatial datasets at usually one km2 resolution is using to provide spatial models of biophysical and socioeconomic processes along with scenarios for climate and land use calculating a baseline for current ecosystem service provision and examining a series of interventions or scenes of change will help to understand the impacts of human activities and landuse change on ecosystem service sustainability hughes 2019 4 results different land use and land cover changes in the study area for a period of 15 years from 2001 to 2016 has been presented in the following table based on the markov chain table 1 for verification of the simulation outputs we compared simulated and observed maps in 2016 using a fuzzy two way similarity analysis the size of the moving window between was changed from 1 ground area of 900 m2 to 33 cells ground area of 98 ha for each animated window with a specified length the corresponding regions were compared in simulated and observed maps of 2016 the similarity ranges from 0 no similarity to 1 complete similarity fig 2 as can be concluded from the following figure the similarity index is changing from 34 to more than 80 for cell sizes of 1 and 33 respectively considering the trend of landuse changes in the study area bare lands gardens and forests show a decreasing trend while rangelands stay nearly constant urbanization and the rural industrial regions experienced a dramatic increase of twice for 15 years these trends will be continued during the next decade as it can be inferred from the future prediction map fig 3 c similarity analysis showed that the output model successfully predicted the land use and land cover change for 15 years therefore we also used this model for the next 15 years from 2016 table 2 thus the outputted maps can be used safely in the integration process of two other models resulted in plans differences between the simulated model and observed reality were also calculated based on the 2016 real situation as a control point table 3 our results for the first 15 years showed that the area of fallow

24844,knowledge about the interactions among multiple ecosystem services is crucial for the design of land use strategies that optimize their delivery a systematic review of the literature available from 2005 to 2019 was performed to assess the current state of knowledge on this topic the number of scientific papers on interactions among multiple ecosystem services trade offs synergies bundles clusters and flows has increased exponentially since 2005 the review shows that researchers usually only consider a limited number of ecosystem services which restricts the ability to explore their interactions with one another in general logical and empirical models are used most often followed by extrapolations simulation processes data integration methods and direct mapping models although our review shows an increase in the use of two or more modeling techniques in a complementary way 77 of the studies this practice needs to be more broadly adopted and though the diversity of modeling tools applied to the study of the interactions among multiple ecosystem services 26 tools in 209 studies was high invest was still the most applied tool despite its limitations for integrating multiple ecosystem services based on these findings we discuss possible ways for improving our understanding of the interactions among multiple ecosystem services and examine the main barriers and limitations mentioned in the studies reviewed keywords multiple ecosystem services interactions trade off synergy bundle flow 1 introduction analyses of the interactions among multiple ecosystem services ess associated with alternative land use decisions pose a challenge because of their complexity mainly due to conceptual differences in the es research modeling techniques and tools developed to support the models in addition es interactions occur over the same time and space meaning a landscape management activity could lead to different environmental or socioeconomic outcomes services or disservices for different stakeholders calvo rodríguez et al 2017 deng et al 2016 ecosystem services are defined as the benefits that humans derive from nature mea 2005 teeb 2010 and are considered the link between biophysical reality and human well being haines young and potschin 2010 teeb 2010 díaz et al 2015 there are multiple es research complexities braat and de groot 2012 and problems related to the data types used which are not always appropriate for the specific research question e g global scale databases approximate mapping or literature data or study scale de groot et al 2010 boerema et al 2017 suggest that the different measures for the same ess indicate that es reality is complex and there may even be a lack of consensus on what constitutes an es moreover the inconsistent terms definitions and classifications hinder advancing the study and application of ess to the real world nahlik et al 2012 modeling the interactions among multiple ess should improve our understanding of the co benefits that ecosystems can provide for human well being neugarten et al 2018 improving our ability to quantify and model interactions among ess is essential to enhancing ecosystems management bennett et al 2009 mouchet et al 2014 although the literature recognizes that interactions among multiple ess trade offs synergies bundles clusters and flows are an important information level for a landscape s sustainable management their characterization and modeling have not been as developed as decision makers require spake et al 2017 despite this research on interactions among multiple ess has recently gained increasing attention in the scientific community and a synthesis of our existing knowledge and gaps is still lacking lee and lautenbach 2016 identifying and understanding the results of these interactions is important for ecosystems management related decisions for example analyses often revolve around es trade offs and involve services that interact synergistically zheng et al 2018 trade offs that take us by surprise can occur when we do not understand the interactions among the ess or when our knowledge is incomplete yang et al 2018 as human societies transform ecosystems to exploit specific services they will undoubtedly diminish some services to increase others ainscough et al 2018 while some tools have been developed to support decision making for spatially explicit es assessments other decisions may be based on step by step guides neugarten et al 2018 the analyses within these tools begin from the principle of evaluating the ess jointly which allows the decision makers to understand the impacts of an action on multiple ess the trade offs and other interactions although they are promising in their generality accessibility and multi objective capabilities most of the tools lack the critical components of complexity required to fully answer the questions of when where and how nature contributes to the es providing for human well being akçakaya et al 2016 in addition these tools generally focus on biophysical systems and therefore have limited capacity for detailing the benefits ultimately provided to humans saarikoski et al 2018 modeling approaches that go beyond simple media e g soil surface water atmosphere etc appear to pose a significant challenge jones et al 2017 it is not always useful to simply add complexity to existing tools as their addition can be expensive schröter et al 2015 making the models more complicated to test and validate more demanding of additional data and more cumbersome for the end users and academic community voinov et al 2014 given the current considerable increase in studies published in international peer reviewed journals an overview of the research progress on modeling interactions among multiple ess is needed we therefore conducted a systematic literature review 2005 2019 to examine the rise and tendencies of the studies for this review we will be following the interaction typologies proposed by bennett et al 2009 mouchet et al 2014 lee and lautenbach 2016 and spake et al 2017 these are a trade offs which describe an antagonistic situation that implies losing the quality of one thing in exchange for obtaining another b synergies the positive responses of multiple ess to change c bundles clusters which are es sets that appear repeatedly together through space and time and d flow the process that begins with identifying one or more ess and ends with their final use by beneficiaries moreover the accuracy of a model s results relies on the accuracy of the input data the model assumptions and the level of calibration and model validation olander et al 2017 hence this review also considers if the modeling techniques measurements included uncertainty calculations and model validation steps hamel and bryant 2017 defined uncertainty as the lack of confidence that a decision maker has about the possible results and or probabilities of these results and they defined validation as a demonstration that a model within its domain of applicability has a satisfactory range of accuracy consistent with the intended application of the model rykiel 1996 rositano et al 2017 these definitions were used for this review the central questions of the review were 1 what are the publication trends in the research on interactions among multiple ess 2 what are the modeling techniques most applied for understanding interactions among multiple ess 3 what are the most commonly used tools for modeling interactions among multiple ess 4 how are uncertainty and validation measurements treated in the studies and 5 what are the current challenges recommendations and future directions for improving our understanding of interactions among multiple ess the review is structured as follows section 2 presents the materials and methods literature search database and classification used for the review while section 3 provides the results of the review including the publication trends and findings from the database analysis we also explore the common modeling techniques and tools used for understanding the interactions among multiple ess in section 4 we discuss the research challenges and ways to proceed to improve our understanding of the interactions among multiple ess section 5 concludes with the main findings 2 material and methods 2 1 literature search to examine the rise and tendencies of the research progress on modeling interactions among multiple ess in international peer reviewed journals a systematic literature search was conducted using journal articles published from 2005 to 2018 and next to be published in 2019 that contained the following search terms modeling trade offs synergies bundles clusters flows modeling tools qualitative descriptive modeling techniques matrices mapping techniques statistical modeling methods machine learning bayesian networks and semantic meta modeling spelling variants were considered and each search term was combined individually with the terms ecosystem services multiple ecosystem services interactions among ecosystem services and study cases to capture the literature at the core of the review aim study cases on the modeling of multiple ess and the modeling of interactions among ess trade offs synergies bundles clusters and flows articles were sourced from five major science databases science direct scopus scielo isi web of knowledge and google scholar between july and october 2018 we identified 422 scientific papers excluding those that did not explicitly measure es yielded a final number of 209 documents that were reviewed and systematized in a database supplementary material 1 2 2 database and classification 1 key information was recorded for each study including descriptors for the publication e g citation year and journal the scale local regional national continental or global and geographic information location country and continent this data provided information about the trends in publications on interactions among multiple ess 2 to clearly define the interactions among ess trade offs synergies bundles clusters and flows that were differentiated for each case study we followed the typologies proposed by bennett et al 2009 mouchet et al 2014 lee and lautenbach 2016 and spake et al 2017 a trade offs describe an antagonistic situation that implies losing the quality of one thing in exchange for obtaining another the term trade off applies when two entities ess show opposing trends i e when the level of one es supply increases the level of the other es decreases for example water quality and agricultural production are a well known trade off due to differences in responses to the addition of nutrients to the agricultural landscape bennett et al 2009 b synergy is a situation where one es directly increases the benefits provided by another es synergy applies when the supply of two ess co vary positively bennett et al 2009 for example a synergistic relationship exists between algal grazing and recreational opportunities in coral reefs within marine protected areas the protected areas have more fish which increases algal grazing which in turn protects the coral and enhances recreational opportunities hughes et al 2007 c es bundles clusters are sets of ecosystem services that repeatedly appear together across space or time for a given area raudsepp hearne et al 2010 lee and lautenbach 2016 noted that this approach tries to identify groups of es that co occur repeatedly in landscapes showing patterns of explained the provision of es derived from the different land use and land cover types if this repeatability criterion is met then the term bundle or cluster can be used d flow describes the process that begins with identifying one or more ess through their final use by beneficiaries 3 in order to identify whether the case studies addressed interactions among ess really involved multiple ess for each case study the number and type of ess involved provision regulation or cultural was identified research that listed support ess was included in the regulation category in this review two or more ess modeled were considered as multiples ess however for statistical analysis of trends for the number of es modeled three ranges 1 to 10 11 to 20 and more than 21 were established 4 to understand the trends in modeling interactions among multiple ess the modeling techniques were categorized based on criteria from dunford et al 2018 englund et al 2017 grêt regamey et al 2016 mouchet et al 2014 villa et al 2014 2017 willcock et al 2018 and wright et al 2017 who defined the following categories a qualitative descriptive models include participatory mapping sociocultural methods and surveys with open ended questions that are used to elicit individuals perceptions wright et al 2017 b matrices are used to simultaneously present information on a wide range of ess typically these matrices consist of one axis representing ecosystems or regions and the other axis representing the es measured in the study in general matrices can represent a broad range of trade offs and synergies that are being considered simultaneously wright et al 2017 c mapping techniques normally show the provision levels in separate areas within a landscape or the provision densities using techniques such as hot spot mapping wright et al 2017 these techniques include biophysical models integrated mapping modeling approaches and land use scoring approaches englund et al 2017 grêt regamey et al 2016 d statistical techniques mainly include regression and or correlation methods the most popular quantitative method is to compare pairwise correlation coefficients mouchet et al 2014 these techniques also include the chi square and multivariate analyses such as the principal component analysis pca multiple correspondences analysis mca and the factorial analysis for mixed data which combines a pca on the quantitative variables with an mca on the qualitative variables mouchet et al 2014 regression based methods with two es indicators can also detect es associations but their use goes beyond detection because regressions also imply directional causation unlike correlations and address the search for more mechanistic linkages among the ess bennett et al 2009 e data driven modeling ddm relies on machine learning using empirical data machine learning algorithms can be divided into two main groups supervised and unsupervised learning that are distinguished by their use of explicit feedback in the learning process willcock et al 2018 supervised learning algorithms use predefined input output pairs and learn how to derive outputs from inputs several different varieties of machine learning algorithms are used within the supervised and unsupervised learning categories including neural networks decision trees decision rules and bayesian networks barton et al 2016 willcock et al 2018 f integration techniques semantic meta modeling the unified modeling language is emerging as a de facto standard for modeling object oriented systems semantic meta modeling is a technique that enables the flexible integration of models to overcome the service by service modeling approach traditionally applied in es assessments balbi et al 2015 villa et al 2014 2017 5 to recognize the tools more commonly applied in modeling interactions among multiple ess we identified the es tools applied in each study 6 we also considered whether the studies incorporated uncertainty measures and model validations as well as the data types used and reported this spoke to the nature of the studies that addressed interactions among multiple ess 7 similarly we considered whether the data was made available in the document and if it was generated by the study or based on secondary sources 8 to identify the challenges and ways for improving our understanding of interactions among multiple ess each case study s conclusions recommendations and limitations were critically analyzed 3 results and discussion 3 1 publication trends an overview the number of scientific papers on interactions among multiple ess trade offs synergies bundles clusters and flows has increased exponentially since 2005 the 209 papers we evaluated encompassed 70 journals with three predominating 65 ecosystem services ecological indicators and environmental modeling and software eighty percent 167 of the papers modeled between one and ten ess 16 focusing only in one es 14 29 modeled 11 to 20 ess and the remaining 6 13 modeled between 21 and 38 ess as of 2017 however there was a slight increase in the number of articles studying more than six ess jointly eighteen percent 37 of the studies modeled one type of ess provision or regulation or cultural and 82 172 modeled two or three types of ess the countries with the most modeling studies on interactions among multiple ess trade offs synergies bundles clusters and flows were china 41 the usa 23 spain 13 and australia 7 these countries contributed 43 of our current knowledge on interactions among multiple ess fig 1 of the 193 209 reports on interactions among multiple ess 90 used mixed data primary and secondary sources 87 used secondary sources or preexisting databases and 16 used primary information generated by original research these findings are in line with those of boerema et al 2017 who noted that ess often appear to be poorly quantified in many cases an oversimplified approach and it seems like measuring the biophysical and socioeconomic reality of all es will forever rely on indicators costanza et al 2017 highlighted that one key limiting factor in sustaining natural capital is the lack of knowledge about how ecosystems function and how they support human well being jiang 2017 has also recognized the information limitations in es research in china in summary most of the published studies were based on secondary information 3 2 findings from the database analysis 3 2 1 studies on interactions among multiple ecosystem services an overview regarding interactions among the ess trade offs synergies was the most frequent combination category studied 53 which was followed by trade offs 45 it is noteworthy that there is only one study between 2005 and 2019 that encompassed trade offs synergy bundles clusters flows this confirms the research gap in modeling interactions among ess that led to the need for this review in addition 80 of the studies on interactions among multiple ess were developed on the local scale e g watershed specific landscape specific sub national region specific ecosystem etc while only 18 were developed at the national level and 2 at the global level fig 2 studies involved in modeling trade offs or trade offs synergies were the ones that incorporated the largest number and types of ess fig 3 3 2 2 modeling techniques used to study interactions among multiple ess the predominant modeling techniques used to model interactions among multiple ess were complementary techniques thus in 77 of the studies two or more modeling techniques were applied fig 4 the most common mixed approaches were mapping statistical techniques 76 studies and integration mapping techniques 21 studies however 30 of the studies applied only one modeling approach principally statistical techniques fig 4 these findings agree with reporting by dunford et al 2018 who claim that in the context of real world decisions a single modeling approach is rarely sufficient and methods must be combined to meet decision makers needs according to these authors modeling methods should be combined to i address a greater number of ess ii evaluate both es supply and demand iii evaluate different economic measures iv include different stakeholders v compensate for the weaknesses in different methodologies and vi meet the decision s context specific needs thus modeling approaches can be linked in different ways 1 as input output flow charts 2 through machine learning 3 through the development of new methods and 4 through the comparison triangulation of results 3 2 3 modeling tools for interactions among multiple ecosystem services in this review we have emphasized the high diversity of tools applied to understanding interactions among multiple ess we identified 26 tools used in the 209 studies table 1 tools such as invest mixed tools based on geographic information systems gis regressions correlations and bayesian networks were the most commonly applied in the studies 2005 2019 we reviewed fig 5 despite its limitations for integrating multiple ess invest richard et al 2014 remains the most widely used tool for modeling interactions among them posner et al 2016 tracked the use of invest and found it was executed 43 363 times in 104 countries over a period of 25 months using multivariate statistical models they analyzed the combinations of variables at the country level that best explained the use of invest and found evidence against the variables related to technical capacity as being a strong predictor of its use instead when they examined invest training in detail they found a significant effect on the subsequent use of invest models their results indicate that the frequent use of invest is related more to the availability of the tool access and ease in the training processes than to its consideration as the most appropriate tool for modeling interactions among multiple ess additionally most of these tools were designed to estimate differences in es supply from various land uses but the practice of comparing only a current scenario with a few futures in the es evaluation is not adequate to answer key points about the interactions over time bagstad et al 2013 grêt regamey et al 2017 rieb et al 2017 this deficiency is also mentioned by goldstein et al 2012 regarding hawaii kamehameha schools and by bhagabati et al 2014 when comparing the distributions of 5 ess with tiger habitat in central sumatra according to van oudenhoven et al 2012 and kandziora et al 2013 a complete es quantification requires the inclusion of multiple aspects otherwise it is not possible to have an adequate measure these issues were addressed in some studies that provided separate indicators aimed at improving es quantifications hernández morcillo et al 2013 for cultural ecosystem services kandziora et al 2013 for interactions between ecosystem properties integrity and service indicators luederitz et al 2015 for urban ecosystem services and saarikoski et al 2015 for boreal forests turkelboom et al 2015 quantified es interactions using correlations among contemporary ess over 60 years in an urbanizing floodplain in the columbia river basin and cerretelli et al 2018 did similarly for an area in the ethiopian great rift valley although some tools such as aries and bayesian networks are adequate for modeling interactions among multiple ess villa et al 2014 martínez lópez et al 2019 their use is still marginal though it has slightly increased as of 2014 and the tradition of service by service mapping and correlation analyses between pairs of ess persists this situation is probably related to the amount of information required to apply these tools 3 2 4 uncertainty and validation in studies on modeling interactions among multiple ess during the last decade as the es framework has proliferated researchers have expressed the need to integrate uncertainty into their modeling efforts seppelt et al 2011 baustert et al 2018 in this review 31 of the 193 studies 16 considered uncertainty when modeling interactions among multiple ess the most commonly applied methods were matrices and probability distributions in association with uncertainty types related to classification errors and natural variability table 2 hamel and bryant 2017 have noted that uncertainty is complex and manifests itself in different ways they defined it as the lack of confidence that a decision maker has about the possible results and or probabilities of these results and identified three uncertainty dimensions i location what is the source of uncertainty ii level how uncertain is the data incorporated in the analysis and iii nature is the uncertainty due to inherent variability or gaps in scientific knowledge based on a literature review baustert et al 2018 discussed four perceived challenges and gaps for calculating the uncertainty in es research the importance of which will vary in different contexts 1 the lack of consensus on uncertainty terminology 2 the characterization of uncertainty beyond the variables 3 the treatment of heterogeneous uncertainty and 4 the absence of a practical framework for communicating uncertainty the studies on es interactions did not usually perform an uncertainty assessment of the 53 studies that considered the interactions of trade offs synergies only 6 evaluated the uncertainty likewise only 6 of the 45 studies that addressed trade off interactions 6 of the 26 studies that considered flow among ess and 3 of the 22 studies that modeled interactions among trade offs synergies bundles clusters evaluated uncertainty despite this authors such as bryant et al 2018 highlight the importance of this practice because its implementation would facilitate decision making strengthen research transparency and clarify the nature of the evidence reported in contrast 117 of the 209 studies 56 included some type of validation of the es modeling techniques implemented the most commonly applied validation strategies were an adjustment of the field data samples cohen s kappa coefficient and concordance measures trade offs synergies trade offs flows and trade offs synergies bundles clusters were the main interaction categories that included some validation of the implemented models table 3 as seen in table 3 although the practice of validating the models used in research on interactions among multiple ess is more common than the uncertainty measures it is still deficient these findings from 2005 to 2019 support the concerns expressed by boerema et al 2017 and wright et al 2017 who have insisted that these rigorous practices are uncommon in es research 3 2 5 barriers and limitations in the studies modeling interactions among multiple ess to propose or define the most suitable ways for modeling interactions among multiple es it s necessary to analyze the main barriers and limitations mentioned in the literature reviewed that will be a basis to propose a better way to approach the complexity around interactions among multiple es in this section the paper works on these barriers and limitations of the most commonly used tools in the six modeling techniques identifies 3 2 5 1 mapping techniques of the 25 studies that worked with invest 14 reported limitations mostly concerning data availability the accuracy of spatial data sets and a lack of relevant data these studies also mentioned limitations due to the decision making processes within the methods especially those relating to the selected indicators scale spatial pattern choice of es sampling locations and even the use of an incomplete framework where some key elements were left out i e a mapping approach with underestimation overestimation results that affect the es supply configuration the importance of validating and identifying the sources of uncertainty were also recognized reiterating the fact that limitations on the data modeling tools and techniques are still the main challenges to studying multiple ess daily et al 2009 de groot et al 2010 guerry et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 regarding the specific limitations of the invest modules mentioned in the studies that applied this tool the following were highlighted i carbon storage module general and deficient assumptions are made about land use changes carbon stock outputs and sediment retention within specific land use land cover lulc and soil types ii water yield module no consideration is given to the temporal dimensions of water provision and hydropower production and a subsurface water analysis is lacking iii water purification module no consideration is given to the chemical and biological interactions that define these phenomena iv soil erosion control module the universal soil loss equation approach is limited in scope v sediment delivery ratio module only water erosion is included as part of the potential soil loss calculation vi habitat quality module all threats are assumed to be additive vallet et al 2018 have observed that es relationships are partly explained by how invest models the services rather than by real world es interactions another 34 studies used gis tools as well as matrices techniques the main limitations mentioned for these were related to mapping resolution uncertain information in the lulc data a lack of dynamics scale issues the need to include local biophysical and economic variables data uncertainty when stemming from different sources and a general lack of better data in addition there was a lot of uncertainty in the expert assessment process subjective understanding of the es and the selection of participants perceptions of the es do not always cover key stakeholders reilly et al 2018 highlighted that some stakeholders had difficulty mapping the expected es distributions under future management scenarios while chen et al 2018 noted that a high number of influential factors e g socioeconomic factors on the socio ecological systems had to be compromised with simplifications in the es modeling process dong et al 2015 found that increasing the land use mapping error increased the area of uncertainty in the land use transition altered its spatial arrangement and differentially affected the es supply 3 2 5 2 data driven modeling techniques ddm some of the limitations mentioned in the 11 studies that worked with aries were related to both the data and the method these included that the es assessment does not take demand into account it is a static analysis of complex and dynamic processes and it works with databases developed for other purposes aries and invest are considered tools that require a lot of time to apply and they are currently too resource intensive for routine use in public and private sector decision making balbi et al 2015 pointed out that the aries modules are simple probabilistic models that neglect some relevant complexities and feedback 3 2 5 3 integration techniques semantic meta modeling regarding the studies that worked with bayesian networks 19 the main barriers mentioned referred to the method some authors noted that while es interactions may change according to scale some of the proposed approaches focus only on site interactions anderson et al 2009 landuyt et al 2016 dang et al 2019 another limitation mentioned was that spatial interactions are not considered despite the fact that the spatially explicit bayesian network can capture uncertainties at the individual pixel level landuyt et al 2015 stritih et al 2018 this is a major limitation in es modeling where spatial mismatches and cross scale effects are common bagstad et al 2013 stritih et al 2018 3 2 5 4 statistical techniques statistical tools regressions and correlations are complementary to the gis tools in this review 41 studies applied statistical tools some of the barriers identified referred to data availability for example some studies did not consider some ess due to a lack of data for mapping them hou et al 2014 termed this a simplifications of reality to show the incompleteness and bias of the indicator set s chosen they also considered the use of secondary data to be highly uncertain reducing the accuracy of the result another uncertainty arises from the data downscaling process which can consequently affect the credibility of the input data dittrich et al 2017 similarly roces díaz et al 2018 mentioned the common assumption that all the indicators of es regulation represent actual supply although this could be highly context dependent dittrich et al 2017 noted that an important issue in es studies is the mixing of the supply and demand sides of the es indicators burkhard et al 2012 causing the results of the trade off and synergy analyses to become diluted finally 33 studies that worked with regressions and correlations reported these same limitations 3 2 5 5 qualitative descriptive techniques regarding surveys and sociocultural methods 9 case studies ingram et al 2018 noted that participants suggested system connections that the workshop activities did not directly ask for such as feedback and non linear relationships while workshops are a crucial process for collecting information the participants in them may suffer from cognitive biases such as being influenced by current events and other available information 4 challenges and ways to improve our understanding of interactions among multiple ecosystem services 4 1 challenges related to the modeling techniques and tools managing ecosystems to provide ess in the face of global change is a pressing political and scientific challenge predicting how management activities and changing future conditions will alter services is made more complex by the interactions among multiple ess a lack of understanding of these interactions can lead to detrimental management decisions dee et al 2017 and therefore the use of different es modeling approaches is an important research topic englund et al 2017 the simultaneous modeling of multiple ess is a challenge 80 of the papers modeled between one and ten ess 9 focusing only in one es and remains an issue not addressed in the literature due to data limitations the complexity of the phenomena and methodological gaps kolosz et al 2018 services frequently interact and the incentives that stimulate the use of some can negatively affect others although a high percentage of studies included in this review investigated synergies and trade offs among the ess 53 studies important interactions like bundles clusters and flows could be necessary in order to quantifying and determining the explicit functional relationships based on the barriers and limitations reported in the studies reviewed supplementary material 1 modeling interactions among multiple ess had three common limitations 1 static assessment using only a land use map to represent an entire simulation period is problematic because the changes in the rates and magnitudes of land use are dynamic in practice and can be significant during a modeling period land use dynamics and biophysical factors such as climate variability can also be driven by social cultural economic and spatial factors including populations product values distances between various resources and infrastructures 2 scarce socioeconomic data models are often developed to only work with biophysical data such as slope land use and meteorological data this excludes the socioeconomic aspects that contribute to understanding interactions among multiple ess yalew et al 2018 3 lack of available data the lack of adequate data produces a gap between reality and bias which can raise uncertainty levels affecting the results on which different stakeholders may be making their management decisions although this review provides evidence of an increase in the use of complementary modeling techniques 77 of the studies it is important that this practice be generalized this is even more important when the goal is to understand the complexity of interactions among multiple ess to provide for adequate decision making regarding land management complementary modeling techniques can show how a variety of indicators respond to different management actions habib et al 2016 while the diversity of modeling tools applied to the study of interactions between multiple ess 26 tools in 209 case studies is unusually high invest is still the most applied tool despite its limitations for integrating multiple ess according to this review the tradition of service by service mapping and correlation analyses between pairs of ess persists over exploring new tools and comprehensive modeling techniques that systematically capture the complexity of es interactions this situation is a central challenge new developments are probably required to capture interactions among multiple ess such as trade offs synergies bundles clusters and flows and thus substantial structural changes are needed in the tools that model ess independently deng et al 2016 laterra et al 2017 have pointed out this need in the research agenda for latin america meanwhile wolff et al 2015 2017 have highlighted that spatial demand supply mismatches can cause trade offs between ess in distant provisioning areas which can lead to unintended impacts on human well being arthington et al 2018 noted that a more robust dynamic and predictive approach is emerging but another necessary development is the ability to incorporate other environmental variables in ecological flow response models turkelboom et al 2018 emphasized that spatial planning requires dealing with trade offs between various stakeholders wishes and needs for land use planning landscape management natural resource use and or biodiversity finally cord et al 2017 suggest that these new developments should allow for the i identification and characterization of co occurring ess ii identification of the drivers that shape es interactions iii exploration of the biophysical constraints of landscapes and limitations on their multifunctionality and iv support of environmental planning management and policy decisions one way forward for understanding the interactions among multiple ess could be inspired by the efforts made in complex systems modeling from other disciplines cox et al 2000 colléter et al 2015 linking multiple ess would likely be facilitated by the use of process based models which increase understanding by integrating biophysical and social changes balbi et al 2015 network theory which integrates ecological and socioeconomic systems could provide a way to face this challenge although networks offer promising approaches for examining interactions among multiple ess this review found that few studies have identified how to put them into operation to manage and evaluate the interactions dee et al 2017 recently since 2014 bayesian networks have been introduced and applied towards understanding interactions among multiple ess this modeling tool has the potential to close the gap between qualitative and quantitative methods as it can provide an integrated modeling framework to address a wide range of ess bayesian networks are currently a popular tool for environmental models medical diagnoses classification problems and machine learning phan et al 2016 according to chen and pollino 2012 there is enormous scope for their application to environmental models including those for natural resource management species and community modeling management models integrated models social models and risk assessment in summary the ability of bayesian networks to integrate data and knowledge from different sources is attractive for modeling the interactions among multiple ess however barton et al 2016 have raised the question of how to validate object oriented bayesian networks combining different fields of knowledge providing another topic to focus on this approach already has tools developed the main one being aries which is supported by a bayesian networks collection that is based mainly on data another important advantage of bayesian networks as a tool for es modeling is its probabilistic nature which would allow for quantifying different uncertainties despite its potential authors such as landuyt et al 2016 and dang et al 2019 have shown that although bayesian networks have been frequently mentioned as promising tools to investigate interactions among ess as of now no structured approaches to do so have been suggested in other matters villa et al 2017 noted that the correct and reliable linkage of information originating independently in es studies is required to allow for sophisticated applications and workflows based on processes these can help address the challenges posed by complex systems such as interactions among multiple ess whose components can only be described through independently developed data the semantic meta and bayesian network models allow for a high level of information interoperability this suggests that technologically there is a route for the novel consideration of interactions among multiple ess however capacity building in es researchers and practitioners in different countries faced with applying these tools is also an emerging challenge specific training for each tool is just one form of capacity building that is likely to be required for the models to gain widespread use and thereby result in the desired policy impacts there are diverse research challenges derived from the present review at the same time there are the different focus of research that can be approached for the comprehending interactions among multiple es however the question arises under what conditions are it recommended applying one or other modeling technique to understand the interactions among multiple es 1 if the research objective to completely capture the dynamic complexity of interactions among multiple es for better ecosystems management the recommendation that follows this review is the application of integration techniques semantic meta modeling its dynamic dimension allows solving many barriers and limitations detected in this paper static assessment scarce socioeconomic data and lack of available data given that available tools for this modeling technique require special attention about information sources 2 if the research objective is assessing interactions among multiple ecosystem services for a specific time interval static approach with available data and secondary information the application of data driven modeling techniques ddm is recommended this review recommends the use of the aries tool for these circumstances furthermore aries allows an adequate uncertainty assessment in the modeling process 3 if the research objective focuses on the understanding of specific interactions among some es for example only trade off or only synergy it s recommended the use of mapping and statistical techniques as it was concluded in the present review these techniques are applied broadly for the partial assessment of interactions among two or three es now it s necessary to clarify that this approach does not capture the dynamic and complexity of the multiple interactions existing in the real world 4 if the research objective is to develop a general approximation of the ecosystem services dynamics of a place with limited information and broadly local community participation it s recommended to use the qualitative descriptive and matrices techniques however this approach corresponds to a simply exploratory exercise 4 2 challenges related to the uncertainty measure and validation of the models various authors suggest the uncertainty measurement is essential for the potential users of es evaluations for example seppelt et al 2011 believe that es research can take a significant step towards supplying policymakers with dependable and usable results while simultaneously achieving a better understanding of the system itself hamel and bryant 2017 have also noted that in the decision making context it is the uncertainty assessment that helps identify the robust conclusions stritih et al 2018 have similarly emphasized the need to quantify and communicate uncertainties in order to support decision making ecosystem service assessments generally consider three main sources of uncertainty i those associated with characterizing ecological functions and processes ii those that arise from the subjective preferences of the researchers and other participants i e researcher preferences for a specific model or expertise and iii the practical uncertainties that can result from the modeling process employed such as those deriving from the modeling techniques and data burkhard et al 2013 gos and lavorel 2012 hou et al 2018 wang et al 2018 stritih et al 2018 also believe that making sound decisions regarding which models and data to use requires information about their associated uncertainties calculating the uncertainties can also lead to the improved understanding of a model and its credibility grêt regamey et al 2017 in addition identifying uncertainties in order to later reduce them through better models and data should lead to better es management decisions in this review only 16 of the studies considered uncertainty measures demonstrating the challenges presented by its consideration in modeling interactions among multiple ess although model validation is more prevalent in research on interactions among multiple ess it is still deficient boerema et al 2017 showed that uncertainty is often not included and validation is mostly missing englund et al 2017 also mention that although a careful validation of es modeling is necessary it has typically not been done the unsubstantiated results can therefore be difficult to evaluate and thus are of limited use for both academia and society our review of the 20052019 literature agrees with the concerns expressed by these authors as only 56 of the studies included some type of validation of the modeling techniques applied 5 conclusions knowledge about the interactions among multiple ess is crucial for the design of land use strategies that optimize their delivery the number of scientific papers on the interactions among multiple ess trade offs synergies bundles clusters and flows has increased exponentially since 2005 however research considering a limited number of ess predominates restricting the ability to explore interactions among multiple ess since 2017 however there has been a slight increase in the number of articles reporting the joint study of more than six ess this review identified the modeling techniques and tools used for studying interactions among multiple ess in terrestrial landscapes in general logical and empirical models were the most frequently used followed by extrapolations simulation processes data integration and direct mapping models additionally two main limitations were identified regarding the evaluation and quantification of interactions among multiple ess which are related to the model s incorporation of 1 the capacity of different ecosystems to provide a varied set of services and 2 the unpredictability of the inflection points in the provision of ess these aspects are affected by ecosystem dynamics human activities overexploitation and or the rise of new technologies such as the growing number of inputs contributing to agricultural production both phenomena are characterized by high complexity and uncertainty and their study must include science and technology in a transdisciplinary manner parallel with that we need incentives to scientific communities research networks funders and practitioners that are focused on megadiverse countries which currently face high ecosystem transformation rates and thus represent one of the greatest challenges less than 8 of the research on interactions among multiple ess has been performed in these countries with the largest gaps existing in south america and africa platforms such as the ipbes intergovernmental science policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services are the ideal scenario for promoting cooperation to obtain advanced knowledge about the es complexity in these regions similarly regional cooperation is necessary to encourage research that generates new data while simultaneously enriching the preexisting databases only 16 studies used primary information in this review we emphasized the high diversity of tools applied to understanding interactions among multiple ess we identified 26 tools used in the 209 publications reviewed new developments will likely be required to capture the interactions among multiple ess the introduction of bayesian networks to understanding interactions among multiple ess is recent since 2014 but its ability to integrate data and knowledge from different sources is attractive for modeling interactions among multiple ess finally this review recommends for es scientific community and decision makers the application of integration techniques semantic meta modeling to capture the dynamic complexity of interactions among

24844,knowledge about the interactions among multiple ecosystem services is crucial for the design of land use strategies that optimize their delivery a systematic review of the literature available from 2005 to 2019 was performed to assess the current state of knowledge on this topic the number of scientific papers on interactions among multiple ecosystem services trade offs synergies bundles clusters and flows has increased exponentially since 2005 the review shows that researchers usually only consider a limited number of ecosystem services which restricts the ability to explore their interactions with one another in general logical and empirical models are used most often followed by extrapolations simulation processes data integration methods and direct mapping models although our review shows an increase in the use of two or more modeling techniques in a complementary way 77 of the studies this practice needs to be more broadly adopted and though the diversity of modeling tools applied to the study of the interactions among multiple ecosystem services 26 tools in 209 studies was high invest was still the most applied tool despite its limitations for integrating multiple ecosystem services based on these findings we discuss possible ways for improving our understanding of the interactions among multiple ecosystem services and examine the main barriers and limitations mentioned in the studies reviewed keywords multiple ecosystem services interactions trade off synergy bundle flow 1 introduction analyses of the interactions among multiple ecosystem services ess associated with alternative land use decisions pose a challenge because of their complexity mainly due to conceptual differences in the es research modeling techniques and tools developed to support the models in addition es interactions occur over the same time and space meaning a landscape management activity could lead to different environmental or socioeconomic outcomes services or disservices for different stakeholders calvo rodríguez et al 2017 deng et al 2016 ecosystem services are defined as the benefits that humans derive from nature mea 2005 teeb 2010 and are considered the link between biophysical reality and human well being haines young and potschin 2010 teeb 2010 díaz et al 2015 there are multiple es research complexities braat and de groot 2012 and problems related to the data types used which are not always appropriate for the specific research question e g global scale databases approximate mapping or literature data or study scale de groot et al 2010 boerema et al 2017 suggest that the different measures for the same ess indicate that es reality is complex and there may even be a lack of consensus on what constitutes an es moreover the inconsistent terms definitions and classifications hinder advancing the study and application of ess to the real world nahlik et al 2012 modeling the interactions among multiple ess should improve our understanding of the co benefits that ecosystems can provide for human well being neugarten et al 2018 improving our ability to quantify and model interactions among ess is essential to enhancing ecosystems management bennett et al 2009 mouchet et al 2014 although the literature recognizes that interactions among multiple ess trade offs synergies bundles clusters and flows are an important information level for a landscape s sustainable management their characterization and modeling have not been as developed as decision makers require spake et al 2017 despite this research on interactions among multiple ess has recently gained increasing attention in the scientific community and a synthesis of our existing knowledge and gaps is still lacking lee and lautenbach 2016 identifying and understanding the results of these interactions is important for ecosystems management related decisions for example analyses often revolve around es trade offs and involve services that interact synergistically zheng et al 2018 trade offs that take us by surprise can occur when we do not understand the interactions among the ess or when our knowledge is incomplete yang et al 2018 as human societies transform ecosystems to exploit specific services they will undoubtedly diminish some services to increase others ainscough et al 2018 while some tools have been developed to support decision making for spatially explicit es assessments other decisions may be based on step by step guides neugarten et al 2018 the analyses within these tools begin from the principle of evaluating the ess jointly which allows the decision makers to understand the impacts of an action on multiple ess the trade offs and other interactions although they are promising in their generality accessibility and multi objective capabilities most of the tools lack the critical components of complexity required to fully answer the questions of when where and how nature contributes to the es providing for human well being akçakaya et al 2016 in addition these tools generally focus on biophysical systems and therefore have limited capacity for detailing the benefits ultimately provided to humans saarikoski et al 2018 modeling approaches that go beyond simple media e g soil surface water atmosphere etc appear to pose a significant challenge jones et al 2017 it is not always useful to simply add complexity to existing tools as their addition can be expensive schröter et al 2015 making the models more complicated to test and validate more demanding of additional data and more cumbersome for the end users and academic community voinov et al 2014 given the current considerable increase in studies published in international peer reviewed journals an overview of the research progress on modeling interactions among multiple ess is needed we therefore conducted a systematic literature review 2005 2019 to examine the rise and tendencies of the studies for this review we will be following the interaction typologies proposed by bennett et al 2009 mouchet et al 2014 lee and lautenbach 2016 and spake et al 2017 these are a trade offs which describe an antagonistic situation that implies losing the quality of one thing in exchange for obtaining another b synergies the positive responses of multiple ess to change c bundles clusters which are es sets that appear repeatedly together through space and time and d flow the process that begins with identifying one or more ess and ends with their final use by beneficiaries moreover the accuracy of a model s results relies on the accuracy of the input data the model assumptions and the level of calibration and model validation olander et al 2017 hence this review also considers if the modeling techniques measurements included uncertainty calculations and model validation steps hamel and bryant 2017 defined uncertainty as the lack of confidence that a decision maker has about the possible results and or probabilities of these results and they defined validation as a demonstration that a model within its domain of applicability has a satisfactory range of accuracy consistent with the intended application of the model rykiel 1996 rositano et al 2017 these definitions were used for this review the central questions of the review were 1 what are the publication trends in the research on interactions among multiple ess 2 what are the modeling techniques most applied for understanding interactions among multiple ess 3 what are the most commonly used tools for modeling interactions among multiple ess 4 how are uncertainty and validation measurements treated in the studies and 5 what are the current challenges recommendations and future directions for improving our understanding of interactions among multiple ess the review is structured as follows section 2 presents the materials and methods literature search database and classification used for the review while section 3 provides the results of the review including the publication trends and findings from the database analysis we also explore the common modeling techniques and tools used for understanding the interactions among multiple ess in section 4 we discuss the research challenges and ways to proceed to improve our understanding of the interactions among multiple ess section 5 concludes with the main findings 2 material and methods 2 1 literature search to examine the rise and tendencies of the research progress on modeling interactions among multiple ess in international peer reviewed journals a systematic literature search was conducted using journal articles published from 2005 to 2018 and next to be published in 2019 that contained the following search terms modeling trade offs synergies bundles clusters flows modeling tools qualitative descriptive modeling techniques matrices mapping techniques statistical modeling methods machine learning bayesian networks and semantic meta modeling spelling variants were considered and each search term was combined individually with the terms ecosystem services multiple ecosystem services interactions among ecosystem services and study cases to capture the literature at the core of the review aim study cases on the modeling of multiple ess and the modeling of interactions among ess trade offs synergies bundles clusters and flows articles were sourced from five major science databases science direct scopus scielo isi web of knowledge and google scholar between july and october 2018 we identified 422 scientific papers excluding those that did not explicitly measure es yielded a final number of 209 documents that were reviewed and systematized in a database supplementary material 1 2 2 database and classification 1 key information was recorded for each study including descriptors for the publication e g citation year and journal the scale local regional national continental or global and geographic information location country and continent this data provided information about the trends in publications on interactions among multiple ess 2 to clearly define the interactions among ess trade offs synergies bundles clusters and flows that were differentiated for each case study we followed the typologies proposed by bennett et al 2009 mouchet et al 2014 lee and lautenbach 2016 and spake et al 2017 a trade offs describe an antagonistic situation that implies losing the quality of one thing in exchange for obtaining another the term trade off applies when two entities ess show opposing trends i e when the level of one es supply increases the level of the other es decreases for example water quality and agricultural production are a well known trade off due to differences in responses to the addition of nutrients to the agricultural landscape bennett et al 2009 b synergy is a situation where one es directly increases the benefits provided by another es synergy applies when the supply of two ess co vary positively bennett et al 2009 for example a synergistic relationship exists between algal grazing and recreational opportunities in coral reefs within marine protected areas the protected areas have more fish which increases algal grazing which in turn protects the coral and enhances recreational opportunities hughes et al 2007 c es bundles clusters are sets of ecosystem services that repeatedly appear together across space or time for a given area raudsepp hearne et al 2010 lee and lautenbach 2016 noted that this approach tries to identify groups of es that co occur repeatedly in landscapes showing patterns of explained the provision of es derived from the different land use and land cover types if this repeatability criterion is met then the term bundle or cluster can be used d flow describes the process that begins with identifying one or more ess through their final use by beneficiaries 3 in order to identify whether the case studies addressed interactions among ess really involved multiple ess for each case study the number and type of ess involved provision regulation or cultural was identified research that listed support ess was included in the regulation category in this review two or more ess modeled were considered as multiples ess however for statistical analysis of trends for the number of es modeled three ranges 1 to 10 11 to 20 and more than 21 were established 4 to understand the trends in modeling interactions among multiple ess the modeling techniques were categorized based on criteria from dunford et al 2018 englund et al 2017 grêt regamey et al 2016 mouchet et al 2014 villa et al 2014 2017 willcock et al 2018 and wright et al 2017 who defined the following categories a qualitative descriptive models include participatory mapping sociocultural methods and surveys with open ended questions that are used to elicit individuals perceptions wright et al 2017 b matrices are used to simultaneously present information on a wide range of ess typically these matrices consist of one axis representing ecosystems or regions and the other axis representing the es measured in the study in general matrices can represent a broad range of trade offs and synergies that are being considered simultaneously wright et al 2017 c mapping techniques normally show the provision levels in separate areas within a landscape or the provision densities using techniques such as hot spot mapping wright et al 2017 these techniques include biophysical models integrated mapping modeling approaches and land use scoring approaches englund et al 2017 grêt regamey et al 2016 d statistical techniques mainly include regression and or correlation methods the most popular quantitative method is to compare pairwise correlation coefficients mouchet et al 2014 these techniques also include the chi square and multivariate analyses such as the principal component analysis pca multiple correspondences analysis mca and the factorial analysis for mixed data which combines a pca on the quantitative variables with an mca on the qualitative variables mouchet et al 2014 regression based methods with two es indicators can also detect es associations but their use goes beyond detection because regressions also imply directional causation unlike correlations and address the search for more mechanistic linkages among the ess bennett et al 2009 e data driven modeling ddm relies on machine learning using empirical data machine learning algorithms can be divided into two main groups supervised and unsupervised learning that are distinguished by their use of explicit feedback in the learning process willcock et al 2018 supervised learning algorithms use predefined input output pairs and learn how to derive outputs from inputs several different varieties of machine learning algorithms are used within the supervised and unsupervised learning categories including neural networks decision trees decision rules and bayesian networks barton et al 2016 willcock et al 2018 f integration techniques semantic meta modeling the unified modeling language is emerging as a de facto standard for modeling object oriented systems semantic meta modeling is a technique that enables the flexible integration of models to overcome the service by service modeling approach traditionally applied in es assessments balbi et al 2015 villa et al 2014 2017 5 to recognize the tools more commonly applied in modeling interactions among multiple ess we identified the es tools applied in each study 6 we also considered whether the studies incorporated uncertainty measures and model validations as well as the data types used and reported this spoke to the nature of the studies that addressed interactions among multiple ess 7 similarly we considered whether the data was made available in the document and if it was generated by the study or based on secondary sources 8 to identify the challenges and ways for improving our understanding of interactions among multiple ess each case study s conclusions recommendations and limitations were critically analyzed 3 results and discussion 3 1 publication trends an overview the number of scientific papers on interactions among multiple ess trade offs synergies bundles clusters and flows has increased exponentially since 2005 the 209 papers we evaluated encompassed 70 journals with three predominating 65 ecosystem services ecological indicators and environmental modeling and software eighty percent 167 of the papers modeled between one and ten ess 16 focusing only in one es 14 29 modeled 11 to 20 ess and the remaining 6 13 modeled between 21 and 38 ess as of 2017 however there was a slight increase in the number of articles studying more than six ess jointly eighteen percent 37 of the studies modeled one type of ess provision or regulation or cultural and 82 172 modeled two or three types of ess the countries with the most modeling studies on interactions among multiple ess trade offs synergies bundles clusters and flows were china 41 the usa 23 spain 13 and australia 7 these countries contributed 43 of our current knowledge on interactions among multiple ess fig 1 of the 193 209 reports on interactions among multiple ess 90 used mixed data primary and secondary sources 87 used secondary sources or preexisting databases and 16 used primary information generated by original research these findings are in line with those of boerema et al 2017 who noted that ess often appear to be poorly quantified in many cases an oversimplified approach and it seems like measuring the biophysical and socioeconomic reality of all es will forever rely on indicators costanza et al 2017 highlighted that one key limiting factor in sustaining natural capital is the lack of knowledge about how ecosystems function and how they support human well being jiang 2017 has also recognized the information limitations in es research in china in summary most of the published studies were based on secondary information 3 2 findings from the database analysis 3 2 1 studies on interactions among multiple ecosystem services an overview regarding interactions among the ess trade offs synergies was the most frequent combination category studied 53 which was followed by trade offs 45 it is noteworthy that there is only one study between 2005 and 2019 that encompassed trade offs synergy bundles clusters flows this confirms the research gap in modeling interactions among ess that led to the need for this review in addition 80 of the studies on interactions among multiple ess were developed on the local scale e g watershed specific landscape specific sub national region specific ecosystem etc while only 18 were developed at the national level and 2 at the global level fig 2 studies involved in modeling trade offs or trade offs synergies were the ones that incorporated the largest number and types of ess fig 3 3 2 2 modeling techniques used to study interactions among multiple ess the predominant modeling techniques used to model interactions among multiple ess were complementary techniques thus in 77 of the studies two or more modeling techniques were applied fig 4 the most common mixed approaches were mapping statistical techniques 76 studies and integration mapping techniques 21 studies however 30 of the studies applied only one modeling approach principally statistical techniques fig 4 these findings agree with reporting by dunford et al 2018 who claim that in the context of real world decisions a single modeling approach is rarely sufficient and methods must be combined to meet decision makers needs according to these authors modeling methods should be combined to i address a greater number of ess ii evaluate both es supply and demand iii evaluate different economic measures iv include different stakeholders v compensate for the weaknesses in different methodologies and vi meet the decision s context specific needs thus modeling approaches can be linked in different ways 1 as input output flow charts 2 through machine learning 3 through the development of new methods and 4 through the comparison triangulation of results 3 2 3 modeling tools for interactions among multiple ecosystem services in this review we have emphasized the high diversity of tools applied to understanding interactions among multiple ess we identified 26 tools used in the 209 studies table 1 tools such as invest mixed tools based on geographic information systems gis regressions correlations and bayesian networks were the most commonly applied in the studies 2005 2019 we reviewed fig 5 despite its limitations for integrating multiple ess invest richard et al 2014 remains the most widely used tool for modeling interactions among them posner et al 2016 tracked the use of invest and found it was executed 43 363 times in 104 countries over a period of 25 months using multivariate statistical models they analyzed the combinations of variables at the country level that best explained the use of invest and found evidence against the variables related to technical capacity as being a strong predictor of its use instead when they examined invest training in detail they found a significant effect on the subsequent use of invest models their results indicate that the frequent use of invest is related more to the availability of the tool access and ease in the training processes than to its consideration as the most appropriate tool for modeling interactions among multiple ess additionally most of these tools were designed to estimate differences in es supply from various land uses but the practice of comparing only a current scenario with a few futures in the es evaluation is not adequate to answer key points about the interactions over time bagstad et al 2013 grêt regamey et al 2017 rieb et al 2017 this deficiency is also mentioned by goldstein et al 2012 regarding hawaii kamehameha schools and by bhagabati et al 2014 when comparing the distributions of 5 ess with tiger habitat in central sumatra according to van oudenhoven et al 2012 and kandziora et al 2013 a complete es quantification requires the inclusion of multiple aspects otherwise it is not possible to have an adequate measure these issues were addressed in some studies that provided separate indicators aimed at improving es quantifications hernández morcillo et al 2013 for cultural ecosystem services kandziora et al 2013 for interactions between ecosystem properties integrity and service indicators luederitz et al 2015 for urban ecosystem services and saarikoski et al 2015 for boreal forests turkelboom et al 2015 quantified es interactions using correlations among contemporary ess over 60 years in an urbanizing floodplain in the columbia river basin and cerretelli et al 2018 did similarly for an area in the ethiopian great rift valley although some tools such as aries and bayesian networks are adequate for modeling interactions among multiple ess villa et al 2014 martínez lópez et al 2019 their use is still marginal though it has slightly increased as of 2014 and the tradition of service by service mapping and correlation analyses between pairs of ess persists this situation is probably related to the amount of information required to apply these tools 3 2 4 uncertainty and validation in studies on modeling interactions among multiple ess during the last decade as the es framework has proliferated researchers have expressed the need to integrate uncertainty into their modeling efforts seppelt et al 2011 baustert et al 2018 in this review 31 of the 193 studies 16 considered uncertainty when modeling interactions among multiple ess the most commonly applied methods were matrices and probability distributions in association with uncertainty types related to classification errors and natural variability table 2 hamel and bryant 2017 have noted that uncertainty is complex and manifests itself in different ways they defined it as the lack of confidence that a decision maker has about the possible results and or probabilities of these results and identified three uncertainty dimensions i location what is the source of uncertainty ii level how uncertain is the data incorporated in the analysis and iii nature is the uncertainty due to inherent variability or gaps in scientific knowledge based on a literature review baustert et al 2018 discussed four perceived challenges and gaps for calculating the uncertainty in es research the importance of which will vary in different contexts 1 the lack of consensus on uncertainty terminology 2 the characterization of uncertainty beyond the variables 3 the treatment of heterogeneous uncertainty and 4 the absence of a practical framework for communicating uncertainty the studies on es interactions did not usually perform an uncertainty assessment of the 53 studies that considered the interactions of trade offs synergies only 6 evaluated the uncertainty likewise only 6 of the 45 studies that addressed trade off interactions 6 of the 26 studies that considered flow among ess and 3 of the 22 studies that modeled interactions among trade offs synergies bundles clusters evaluated uncertainty despite this authors such as bryant et al 2018 highlight the importance of this practice because its implementation would facilitate decision making strengthen research transparency and clarify the nature of the evidence reported in contrast 117 of the 209 studies 56 included some type of validation of the es modeling techniques implemented the most commonly applied validation strategies were an adjustment of the field data samples cohen s kappa coefficient and concordance measures trade offs synergies trade offs flows and trade offs synergies bundles clusters were the main interaction categories that included some validation of the implemented models table 3 as seen in table 3 although the practice of validating the models used in research on interactions among multiple ess is more common than the uncertainty measures it is still deficient these findings from 2005 to 2019 support the concerns expressed by boerema et al 2017 and wright et al 2017 who have insisted that these rigorous practices are uncommon in es research 3 2 5 barriers and limitations in the studies modeling interactions among multiple ess to propose or define the most suitable ways for modeling interactions among multiple es it s necessary to analyze the main barriers and limitations mentioned in the literature reviewed that will be a basis to propose a better way to approach the complexity around interactions among multiple es in this section the paper works on these barriers and limitations of the most commonly used tools in the six modeling techniques identifies 3 2 5 1 mapping techniques of the 25 studies that worked with invest 14 reported limitations mostly concerning data availability the accuracy of spatial data sets and a lack of relevant data these studies also mentioned limitations due to the decision making processes within the methods especially those relating to the selected indicators scale spatial pattern choice of es sampling locations and even the use of an incomplete framework where some key elements were left out i e a mapping approach with underestimation overestimation results that affect the es supply configuration the importance of validating and identifying the sources of uncertainty were also recognized reiterating the fact that limitations on the data modeling tools and techniques are still the main challenges to studying multiple ess daily et al 2009 de groot et al 2010 guerry et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 regarding the specific limitations of the invest modules mentioned in the studies that applied this tool the following were highlighted i carbon storage module general and deficient assumptions are made about land use changes carbon stock outputs and sediment retention within specific land use land cover lulc and soil types ii water yield module no consideration is given to the temporal dimensions of water provision and hydropower production and a subsurface water analysis is lacking iii water purification module no consideration is given to the chemical and biological interactions that define these phenomena iv soil erosion control module the universal soil loss equation approach is limited in scope v sediment delivery ratio module only water erosion is included as part of the potential soil loss calculation vi habitat quality module all threats are assumed to be additive vallet et al 2018 have observed that es relationships are partly explained by how invest models the services rather than by real world es interactions another 34 studies used gis tools as well as matrices techniques the main limitations mentioned for these were related to mapping resolution uncertain information in the lulc data a lack of dynamics scale issues the need to include local biophysical and economic variables data uncertainty when stemming from different sources and a general lack of better data in addition there was a lot of uncertainty in the expert assessment process subjective understanding of the es and the selection of participants perceptions of the es do not always cover key stakeholders reilly et al 2018 highlighted that some stakeholders had difficulty mapping the expected es distributions under future management scenarios while chen et al 2018 noted that a high number of influential factors e g socioeconomic factors on the socio ecological systems had to be compromised with simplifications in the es modeling process dong et al 2015 found that increasing the land use mapping error increased the area of uncertainty in the land use transition altered its spatial arrangement and differentially affected the es supply 3 2 5 2 data driven modeling techniques ddm some of the limitations mentioned in the 11 studies that worked with aries were related to both the data and the method these included that the es assessment does not take demand into account it is a static analysis of complex and dynamic processes and it works with databases developed for other purposes aries and invest are considered tools that require a lot of time to apply and they are currently too resource intensive for routine use in public and private sector decision making balbi et al 2015 pointed out that the aries modules are simple probabilistic models that neglect some relevant complexities and feedback 3 2 5 3 integration techniques semantic meta modeling regarding the studies that worked with bayesian networks 19 the main barriers mentioned referred to the method some authors noted that while es interactions may change according to scale some of the proposed approaches focus only on site interactions anderson et al 2009 landuyt et al 2016 dang et al 2019 another limitation mentioned was that spatial interactions are not considered despite the fact that the spatially explicit bayesian network can capture uncertainties at the individual pixel level landuyt et al 2015 stritih et al 2018 this is a major limitation in es modeling where spatial mismatches and cross scale effects are common bagstad et al 2013 stritih et al 2018 3 2 5 4 statistical techniques statistical tools regressions and correlations are complementary to the gis tools in this review 41 studies applied statistical tools some of the barriers identified referred to data availability for example some studies did not consider some ess due to a lack of data for mapping them hou et al 2014 termed this a simplifications of reality to show the incompleteness and bias of the indicator set s chosen they also considered the use of secondary data to be highly uncertain reducing the accuracy of the result another uncertainty arises from the data downscaling process which can consequently affect the credibility of the input data dittrich et al 2017 similarly roces díaz et al 2018 mentioned the common assumption that all the indicators of es regulation represent actual supply although this could be highly context dependent dittrich et al 2017 noted that an important issue in es studies is the mixing of the supply and demand sides of the es indicators burkhard et al 2012 causing the results of the trade off and synergy analyses to become diluted finally 33 studies that worked with regressions and correlations reported these same limitations 3 2 5 5 qualitative descriptive techniques regarding surveys and sociocultural methods 9 case studies ingram et al 2018 noted that participants suggested system connections that the workshop activities did not directly ask for such as feedback and non linear relationships while workshops are a crucial process for collecting information the participants in them may suffer from cognitive biases such as being influenced by current events and other available information 4 challenges and ways to improve our understanding of interactions among multiple ecosystem services 4 1 challenges related to the modeling techniques and tools managing ecosystems to provide ess in the face of global change is a pressing political and scientific challenge predicting how management activities and changing future conditions will alter services is made more complex by the interactions among multiple ess a lack of understanding of these interactions can lead to detrimental management decisions dee et al 2017 and therefore the use of different es modeling approaches is an important research topic englund et al 2017 the simultaneous modeling of multiple ess is a challenge 80 of the papers modeled between one and ten ess 9 focusing only in one es and remains an issue not addressed in the literature due to data limitations the complexity of the phenomena and methodological gaps kolosz et al 2018 services frequently interact and the incentives that stimulate the use of some can negatively affect others although a high percentage of studies included in this review investigated synergies and trade offs among the ess 53 studies important interactions like bundles clusters and flows could be necessary in order to quantifying and determining the explicit functional relationships based on the barriers and limitations reported in the studies reviewed supplementary material 1 modeling interactions among multiple ess had three common limitations 1 static assessment using only a land use map to represent an entire simulation period is problematic because the changes in the rates and magnitudes of land use are dynamic in practice and can be significant during a modeling period land use dynamics and biophysical factors such as climate variability can also be driven by social cultural economic and spatial factors including populations product values distances between various resources and infrastructures 2 scarce socioeconomic data models are often developed to only work with biophysical data such as slope land use and meteorological data this excludes the socioeconomic aspects that contribute to understanding interactions among multiple ess yalew et al 2018 3 lack of available data the lack of adequate data produces a gap between reality and bias which can raise uncertainty levels affecting the results on which different stakeholders may be making their management decisions although this review provides evidence of an increase in the use of complementary modeling techniques 77 of the studies it is important that this practice be generalized this is even more important when the goal is to understand the complexity of interactions among multiple ess to provide for adequate decision making regarding land management complementary modeling techniques can show how a variety of indicators respond to different management actions habib et al 2016 while the diversity of modeling tools applied to the study of interactions between multiple ess 26 tools in 209 case studies is unusually high invest is still the most applied tool despite its limitations for integrating multiple ess according to this review the tradition of service by service mapping and correlation analyses between pairs of ess persists over exploring new tools and comprehensive modeling techniques that systematically capture the complexity of es interactions this situation is a central challenge new developments are probably required to capture interactions among multiple ess such as trade offs synergies bundles clusters and flows and thus substantial structural changes are needed in the tools that model ess independently deng et al 2016 laterra et al 2017 have pointed out this need in the research agenda for latin america meanwhile wolff et al 2015 2017 have highlighted that spatial demand supply mismatches can cause trade offs between ess in distant provisioning areas which can lead to unintended impacts on human well being arthington et al 2018 noted that a more robust dynamic and predictive approach is emerging but another necessary development is the ability to incorporate other environmental variables in ecological flow response models turkelboom et al 2018 emphasized that spatial planning requires dealing with trade offs between various stakeholders wishes and needs for land use planning landscape management natural resource use and or biodiversity finally cord et al 2017 suggest that these new developments should allow for the i identification and characterization of co occurring ess ii identification of the drivers that shape es interactions iii exploration of the biophysical constraints of landscapes and limitations on their multifunctionality and iv support of environmental planning management and policy decisions one way forward for understanding the interactions among multiple ess could be inspired by the efforts made in complex systems modeling from other disciplines cox et al 2000 colléter et al 2015 linking multiple ess would likely be facilitated by the use of process based models which increase understanding by integrating biophysical and social changes balbi et al 2015 network theory which integrates ecological and socioeconomic systems could provide a way to face this challenge although networks offer promising approaches for examining interactions among multiple ess this review found that few studies have identified how to put them into operation to manage and evaluate the interactions dee et al 2017 recently since 2014 bayesian networks have been introduced and applied towards understanding interactions among multiple ess this modeling tool has the potential to close the gap between qualitative and quantitative methods as it can provide an integrated modeling framework to address a wide range of ess bayesian networks are currently a popular tool for environmental models medical diagnoses classification problems and machine learning phan et al 2016 according to chen and pollino 2012 there is enormous scope for their application to environmental models including those for natural resource management species and community modeling management models integrated models social models and risk assessment in summary the ability of bayesian networks to integrate data and knowledge from different sources is attractive for modeling the interactions among multiple ess however barton et al 2016 have raised the question of how to validate object oriented bayesian networks combining different fields of knowledge providing another topic to focus on this approach already has tools developed the main one being aries which is supported by a bayesian networks collection that is based mainly on data another important advantage of bayesian networks as a tool for es modeling is its probabilistic nature which would allow for quantifying different uncertainties despite its potential authors such as landuyt et al 2016 and dang et al 2019 have shown that although bayesian networks have been frequently mentioned as promising tools to investigate interactions among ess as of now no structured approaches to do so have been suggested in other matters villa et al 2017 noted that the correct and reliable linkage of information originating independently in es studies is required to allow for sophisticated applications and workflows based on processes these can help address the challenges posed by complex systems such as interactions among multiple ess whose components can only be described through independently developed data the semantic meta and bayesian network models allow for a high level of information interoperability this suggests that technologically there is a route for the novel consideration of interactions among multiple ess however capacity building in es researchers and practitioners in different countries faced with applying these tools is also an emerging challenge specific training for each tool is just one form of capacity building that is likely to be required for the models to gain widespread use and thereby result in the desired policy impacts there are diverse research challenges derived from the present review at the same time there are the different focus of research that can be approached for the comprehending interactions among multiple es however the question arises under what conditions are it recommended applying one or other modeling technique to understand the interactions among multiple es 1 if the research objective to completely capture the dynamic complexity of interactions among multiple es for better ecosystems management the recommendation that follows this review is the application of integration techniques semantic meta modeling its dynamic dimension allows solving many barriers and limitations detected in this paper static assessment scarce socioeconomic data and lack of available data given that available tools for this modeling technique require special attention about information sources 2 if the research objective is assessing interactions among multiple ecosystem services for a specific time interval static approach with available data and secondary information the application of data driven modeling techniques ddm is recommended this review recommends the use of the aries tool for these circumstances furthermore aries allows an adequate uncertainty assessment in the modeling process 3 if the research objective focuses on the understanding of specific interactions among some es for example only trade off or only synergy it s recommended the use of mapping and statistical techniques as it was concluded in the present review these techniques are applied broadly for the partial assessment of interactions among two or three es now it s necessary to clarify that this approach does not capture the dynamic and complexity of the multiple interactions existing in the real world 4 if the research objective is to develop a general approximation of the ecosystem services dynamics of a place with limited information and broadly local community participation it s recommended to use the qualitative descriptive and matrices techniques however this approach corresponds to a simply exploratory exercise 4 2 challenges related to the uncertainty measure and validation of the models various authors suggest the uncertainty measurement is essential for the potential users of es evaluations for example seppelt et al 2011 believe that es research can take a significant step towards supplying policymakers with dependable and usable results while simultaneously achieving a better understanding of the system itself hamel and bryant 2017 have also noted that in the decision making context it is the uncertainty assessment that helps identify the robust conclusions stritih et al 2018 have similarly emphasized the need to quantify and communicate uncertainties in order to support decision making ecosystem service assessments generally consider three main sources of uncertainty i those associated with characterizing ecological functions and processes ii those that arise from the subjective preferences of the researchers and other participants i e researcher preferences for a specific model or expertise and iii the practical uncertainties that can result from the modeling process employed such as those deriving from the modeling techniques and data burkhard et al 2013 gos and lavorel 2012 hou et al 2018 wang et al 2018 stritih et al 2018 also believe that making sound decisions regarding which models and data to use requires information about their associated uncertainties calculating the uncertainties can also lead to the improved understanding of a model and its credibility grêt regamey et al 2017 in addition identifying uncertainties in order to later reduce them through better models and data should lead to better es management decisions in this review only 16 of the studies considered uncertainty measures demonstrating the challenges presented by its consideration in modeling interactions among multiple ess although model validation is more prevalent in research on interactions among multiple ess it is still deficient boerema et al 2017 showed that uncertainty is often not included and validation is mostly missing englund et al 2017 also mention that although a careful validation of es modeling is necessary it has typically not been done the unsubstantiated results can therefore be difficult to evaluate and thus are of limited use for both academia and society our review of the 20052019 literature agrees with the concerns expressed by these authors as only 56 of the studies included some type of validation of the modeling techniques applied 5 conclusions knowledge about the interactions among multiple ess is crucial for the design of land use strategies that optimize their delivery the number of scientific papers on the interactions among multiple ess trade offs synergies bundles clusters and flows has increased exponentially since 2005 however research considering a limited number of ess predominates restricting the ability to explore interactions among multiple ess since 2017 however there has been a slight increase in the number of articles reporting the joint study of more than six ess this review identified the modeling techniques and tools used for studying interactions among multiple ess in terrestrial landscapes in general logical and empirical models were the most frequently used followed by extrapolations simulation processes data integration and direct mapping models additionally two main limitations were identified regarding the evaluation and quantification of interactions among multiple ess which are related to the model s incorporation of 1 the capacity of different ecosystems to provide a varied set of services and 2 the unpredictability of the inflection points in the provision of ess these aspects are affected by ecosystem dynamics human activities overexploitation and or the rise of new technologies such as the growing number of inputs contributing to agricultural production both phenomena are characterized by high complexity and uncertainty and their study must include science and technology in a transdisciplinary manner parallel with that we need incentives to scientific communities research networks funders and practitioners that are focused on megadiverse countries which currently face high ecosystem transformation rates and thus represent one of the greatest challenges less than 8 of the research on interactions among multiple ess has been performed in these countries with the largest gaps existing in south america and africa platforms such as the ipbes intergovernmental science policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services are the ideal scenario for promoting cooperation to obtain advanced knowledge about the es complexity in these regions similarly regional cooperation is necessary to encourage research that generates new data while simultaneously enriching the preexisting databases only 16 studies used primary information in this review we emphasized the high diversity of tools applied to understanding interactions among multiple ess we identified 26 tools used in the 209 publications reviewed new developments will likely be required to capture the interactions among multiple ess the introduction of bayesian networks to understanding interactions among multiple ess is recent since 2014 but its ability to integrate data and knowledge from different sources is attractive for modeling interactions among multiple ess finally this review recommends for es scientific community and decision makers the application of integration techniques semantic meta modeling to capture the dynamic complexity of interactions among
