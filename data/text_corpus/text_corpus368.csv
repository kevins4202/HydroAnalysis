1840,an increasing number of studies have combined saline tracer injections with time lapse electrical resistivity er surveys to explore solute exchange within the hyporheic zone the reliability and resolution of er surveys of the hyporheic zone are rarely discussed here we use a numerical modeling approach to assess how er imaging resolves changes in saline tracer concentration within the hyporheic zone given different synthetic scenarios we create a 3 d synthetic stream and surrounding hyporheic zone with an er electrode transect and solve the coupled equations for porous fluid flow and solute transport then we solve for the 3 d conduction of current between electrodes to create synthetic time lapse er surveys and invert the simulated resistances to obtain 2 d bulk electrical conductivity σ b images perpendicular to the stream which we compare with the known synthetic σ b fields the σ b fields in the inversion generally capture the shape of the simulated σ b fields but with smoothing and artifacts as a function of the inversion process consequently the calculated cross sectional area of tracer plume is inaccurate at inversion pixels beneath the stream the accuracy of the inverted σ b breakthrough curves when compared to the synthetic truth varies with stream size pixel depth and to a lesser extent injection time the tails of these pixel breakthrough curves beneath the stream are consistently underestimated compared to the synthetic truth i e σ b in the inversions appear to return to background faster by one to six hours the time series of average apparent bulk electrical conductivity requires no inversion and captures lingering saline tracer better than bulk ec breakthrough curves at individual pixels in the inversions data availability the input files of the numerical model and r2 inversion are available online https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 7894414 1 introduction the interaction between stream water and groundwater is complicated winter et al 1998 woessner 2000 lewandowski et al 2020 due to site specific heterogeneity in streambed permeability and time and space varying hydraulic gradients stream water groundwater exchange or hyporheic exchange has been inferred from measurements of concentration breakthrough curves during tracer tests either in streams or in monitoring wells hammett et al 2022 processes and parameters of interest such as exchange fluxes and residence times can be difficult to estimate from these data alone because 1 tracer experiments are sensitive to more than just hyporheic exchange harvey et al 1996 and 2 concentrations measured at one location in space give an integrated measure of what occurs upgradient and no information about variability along the transport pathway identifying hydrologic factors that control exchange over various spatial scales is critical for understanding patterns of water quality and ecological community structure triska et al 1993 wondzell and swanson 1996 knapp et al 2017 temporal scales of exchange are also important as daily to seasonal variations in flows may control transport behavior bryant et al 2020 wroblicky et al 1998 however few methods are available to quantify the variations at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales hydrogeophysical methods are a rapidly emerging tool to characterize and monitor hydrologic processes at spatial and temporal resolution heretofore impossible e g binley et al 2015 in particular time lapse electrical resistivity er imaging recording electrical resistivity change with time has provided high resolution spatial and temporal information about transport of fluids and solutes in diverse geologic settings busato et al 2019 doetsch et al 2012 sawyer et al 2015 and has been used extensively in hyporheic studies summarized in table 1 er methods are used to estimate the distribution of bulk electrical resistivity or its reciprocal bulk electrical conductivity denoted σ b of a medium by driving an electrical current between two source electrodes and measuring the resultant potential distribution at two or more receiver electrodes the measured resistances are averages of the electrical properties of the porous media and conductive fluid in the system because er methods are sensitive to changes in σ b of the subsurface er has frequently been used to monitor spatial and temporal surface water groundwater interactions from conductive tracer tests in stream systems er has been found to resolve targets from the sub meter to tens of meters scale in the field depending on the support volume of measurements and tomographic resolution table 1 the resolution and support volume however are complicated functions of the σ b distribution in the subsurface the data acquisition geometry and data noise daily and ramirez 1995 day lewis et al 2005 these properties affect the subsequent er inversions which are generally too smooth underestimate high values and overestimate low ones and show lower resolution far from the electrodes day lewis et al 2005 consequently mapping the mass or volume of conductive targets using er is difficult for example large diffuse targets may be more detectable than small concentrated plumes singha and gorelick 2005 bethune et al 2015 despite these limitations many researchers have been interested in using er to monitor changes in the hyporheic exchange zone e g ward et al 2010 smidt et al 2015 sparacino et al 2019 table 1 which varies in time and space boano et al 2008 gooseff et al 2006 for example ward et al 2012 used er inversions to show that hyporheic extent decreased with baseflow recession in contrast to expectations from some conceptual models e g hakenkamp et al 1993 white 1993 one important caveat is that estimating a quantitative change in hyporheic extent or size of a saline tracer plume requires the selection of a meaningful change in inverted bulk conductivities σ b i between inversions in time which makes the analysis subjective because inversions are affected by smoothing and artifacts as noted above another useful measurement of change within the system is to look at the data themselves e g the apparent bulk electrical conductivity σ b a e g coscia et al 2011 dehkordy et al 2019 doughty et al 2020 for example coscia et al 2011 showed reasonable agreement between the tail of the σ b a measured from er and fluid electical conductivity ec from nearby piezometers that were screened through the 4 m thick saturated aquifer one issue with these σ b a data however is that they are volumetric averages of the system through which the current flows and consequently are not indicative of change in any specific region of interest in the subsurface consequently σ b i are needed to get spatially distributed information in addition to the noise and unreliability introduced via smoothing and artifacts during er inversions the size of the stream hyporheic system and the experimental design likely influence the ability of er inversions to resolve changes in saline tracer extent for example because the stream is a zone of high ec that lies immediately above the hyporheic target changes in saline tracer concentration in overlying surface water may be challenging to disentangle from changes in saline concentration in the hyporheic zone using er inversions alone previous research has explored steps to try to mitigate these effects such as separating the stream from the aquifer during regularization of the inverse problem and or assuming known stream bathymetry and changes in stream water ec e g coscia et al 2011 mclachlan et al 2021 these techniques are undoubtedly necessary in large streams to obtain accurate estimates of subsurface characteristics but may be harder to implement in some of the shallow first order streams where many hyporheic studies are conducted table 1 because to resolve stream bathymetry at high resolution is computationally expensive to make pixel resolution of inversion fine enough in small streams the size of electrodes may be comparable to the pixel size and the impacts of electrodes themselves on the inversion may be exemplified these complications may limit the extent to which we can trust the spatial and temporal information that er surveys give us about the hyporheic zone here we look to explore how tracer injection design and stream characteristics affect the reliability of er surveys in a controlled system to do so we create a set of 3 d finite element models in our synthetic models stream tracer tests are coupled with er surveys and the synthetic resistance data converted to σ b a are then inverted in 2 d following standard methods to compare the known σ b with σ b i and σ b a specifically we explored three primary issues 1 stream area or size 2 injection concentration and 3 injection times we chose to examine stream area because the stream is a highly electrically conductive feature that lies immediately above the target feature the hyporheic zone and we sought to understand how its size influences the quality of the inversion in the target zone we examined injection concentration and injection time to explore whether feasible adjustments to the duration of the injection or peak concentration could improve the detection of tracer in the hyporheic zone downstream our goal is to provide suggestions for designing time lapse er surveys of hyporheic zones in the field and guidelines to improve the interpretation of er inversion results specifically how hyporheic area and the spatial distribution and timing of solute arrival and flushing in the hyporheic zone are interpreted using er inversion results 2 methods our objective is to use a numerical modeling approach to explore the performance of time lapse er surveys for quantifying hyporheic solute transport because these studies are generally conducted in relatively small streams where a continuous injection of saline tracer is feasible e g ward et al 2010a toran et al 2013 gonzalez pinzon et al 2015 we limit our analysis to scenarios with relatively shallow streams three dimensional fluid flow solute transport and electrical conduction are simulated for a stream and the surrounding porous medium during and after the injection of a saline tracer solution a two dimensional er survey profile is set perpendicular to the stream in the model domain and voltages at 12 electrodes are modeled in response to a sequence of currents the synthetic σ b a measurements are then inverted to create maps in σ b i which can be compared with known changed in σ b as a test of interpretation pitfalls we performed this analysis for three scenarios with various stream sizes 0 1 m deep 4 m wide 0 2 m deep 6 m wide and 0 3 m deep 8 m wide because of the long run times of our simulations we took advantage of the fact that stream width and depth tend to scale with one another in natural streams allen et al 2018 and we increased width and depth together we also tested different tracer injection designs injection time for 4 6 and 8 h injection concentration 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 ms cm 1 finally we tested one scenario with heterogeneous sediment permeability to explore how irregular features of the tracer plume are resolved in er inversions the base case has a stream geometry of 0 2 m deep 6 m wide an injection time of 6 h an injection concentration of 0 3 ms cm 1 and homogeneous sediment table 2 we did not test parameters related to er survey design such as number and spacing of electrodes which have been examined previously wilkinson et al 2006 ward et al 2010b 2 1 numerical modeling of a homogeneous hydraulic conductivity system three dimensional finite element models of a stream aquifer system were constructed using comsol multiphysics comsol multiphysics 2019 the model represents three sets of governing physics 1 steady state fluid flow in porous media 2 transient solute transport and 3 steady state electrical conduction the synthetic study reach was designed to be a simplified version of a typical mountain stream which is inspired by work conducted at watershed 03 at the h j andrews experimental forest all synthetic er surveys were conducted with 12 electrodes spaced 1 m apart and 317 combinations of current source sink and measurement electrodes in a dipole dipole configuration similar to ward et al 2010 we focus on a dipole dipole geometry because it usually generates the fastest data collection with most available er systems and speed of er data collection is a particularly important requirement in fast moving stream systems to avoid temporal smearing there is consequently a trade off in the field between speed of data collection and collecting enough data to make quality inversions dipole dipole is one of the best geometries to manage this issue the model geometry was composed of two domains stream and porous aquifer to minimize the calculation cost porous fluid flow and saline tracer transport were only simulated in the portion of the aquifer near the stream and electrode transect because fluid ec and thus σ b do not vary beyond the hyporheic zone over the timescale of tracer injections fig 1 a electrical conduction was simulated over a larger domain that includes areas of constant σ b far from the stream to minimize boundary effects on electrical currents as noted above stream sizes were varied from 4 m wide and 0 1 m deep to 8 m wide and 0 3 m deep table 2 with a base case scenario of 6 m wide and 0 2 m deep the portion of the aquifer near the stream extended 2 4 m from the stream sides on either side and 2 m below the stream bottom the entire aquifer zone was 100 m wide 100 m deep and 100 m long extended 50 m upstream and downstream from the electrode transect to minimize boundary effects on electrical conduction near the electrodes the saline tracer injection location was positioned 50 m upstream from the electrode transect to ensure adequate mixing of salt to depth at the electrode transect at the injection the saline tracer was instantaneously well mixed across the entire stream cross section to resolve fine changes in solute concentration around the electrode transect the finite element model grid spacing along the stream was set to less than 0 03 m in the downstream direction and 0 015 m in the vertical direction the steady state groundwater flow equation was first solved for the aquifer near the stream fig 1a 1 k h 0 where k is the hydraulic permeability m s 1 and h is hydraulic head m the floodplain surface was specified as a no flow boundary zero net recharge at the upstream and downstream faces influx and efflux rates were chosen to be consistent with the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and the down valley hydraulic head gradient j was assumed to be 0 01 m m 1 representative of moderate to steep small order streams in addition the lateral sides and base of the domain were assigned the same down valley slope j in hydraulic head but raised uniformly by an additional 0 1 mm relative to the stream to generate a weakly gaining stream condition or slow groundwater flow towards the stream we created a weakly gaining stream for model convenience to reduce the effect of domain size on the steady state fluid ec field in the hyporheic zone but our findings are equally applicable to neutral or losing systems the sediment water interface was assigned a non uniform hydraulic head condition jx hbed x y to represent the interactions of currents with a rough bed e g elliott and brooks 1997 stonedahl et al 2010 fig 1c where 2 h bed x y h a cos 2 π l 1 x t 1 sin 2 π l 2 y h a sin 2 π l 2 x t 2 cos 2 π l 2 y ha is the amplitude of hydraulic head variations along the stream associated with bedforms of length scale l 1 and l 2 t 1 and t 2 are lateral offsets in the bedform crest locations table 2 the hyporheic exchange patterns and rates that result from this non uniform hydraulic head condition are three dimensional with the greatest hyporheic velocities in the downstream direction the velocity fields from the steady groundwater flow solution were used to solve for conservative tracer transport in the hyporheic zone based on the transient advection dispersion equation with exchange between mobile and immobile pores 3a θ m c m t θ i c i t θ m u c m θ m d d d e 2 c m 3b θ i c i t α c m c i where subscript m denotes the mobile domain and i denotes the immobile domain θ is porosity c ms cm 1 is the solute concentration in the pore space t s is time dd m2 s 1 is the coefficient of hydrodynamic dispersion de m2 s 1 is the diffusion coefficient u m s 1 is the seepage velocity vector and α s 1 is a mass transfer coefficient between mobile and immobile pores table 2 a dual domain model with mobile and immobile pores in the aquifer was chosen over a single domain model to better represent the persistence of tracer in pore spaces long after the bulk of tracer mass has been flushed from the stream ward et al 2010b the solute used to represent the saline tracer was fluid ec which has units of ms cm 1 rather than concentration units since fluid ec travels conservatively and maintains a linear relationship with tracer concentration concentration within the stream and along the sediment water interface cs ms cm 1 was specified based on the ogata

and bottom of the aquifer region near the stream fig 1a table 2 the land surface or top of the aquifer outside the stream was treated as a zero flux boundary the initial concentration or fluid ec field was specified from the steady solution to eq 4 transient solutions for fluid ec eq 4 were retained at 15 minute intervals to simulate time lapse er surveys at those times to convert fluid ec fields at each time step to σ b we used a simple petrophysical model from singha et al 2007 5 σ b θ m θ i m 1 θ m σ f m θ i σ f i where m is the cementation exponent equal to 1 3 and σ f m ms cm 1 and σ f i ms cm 1 are the fluid ec values for the mobile and immobile pore spaces respectively this model assumes that the fluids in mobile and immobile pore spaces behave as conductors in parallel additionally surface conductance is ignored stream ec was converted directly to σ b given a porosity of 100 the calculated σ b fields were then used to simulate resistance values at the electrodes that would be measured by er instrumentation in the field by solving the poisson equation for electrical conduction 6 h σ b v i δ x y where v v is electric potential and i a is the magnitude of the current source applied at electrodes and resistance is defined by δv i between two electrodes the ground and water surfaces were treated as insulation boundaries while the sides and base of the model were zero voltage boundaries to create the synthetic er survey data we solved eq 6 once for each electrode 12 times at each time step where we applied a current source at the electrode of interest and extracted the voltages at the remaining electrodes we then used the law of superposition to calculate 317 combinations of resistance readings according to the electrode sequence at each time step random 2 gaussian noise was added to the modeled resistances to represent the typical magnitude of noise in field surveys in real er surveys the sequence of current induction and voltage readings often spans minutes during which time changes in the σ b field may have occurred as the tracer migrated in this synthetic er survey the sequence is effectively instantaneous because all resistances are measured within the same σ b field as such the synthetic survey does not include the effects of temporal smearing that may occur in real er surveys for each time step in a synthetic survey we computed σ b a for each combination in the electrode sequence σ b a is the equivalent bulk conductivity of a homogeneous earth given a measured δv i 7 σ b a i g v where 8 g 2 π 1 om 1 on 1 pm 1 pn g is a geometric factor where om on pm and pn are the distances between electrodes o and m o and n p and m and p and n respectively we then computed the average of the 317 σ b a values at each time step to construct a breakthrough curve of σ b a the σ b a breakthrough curve allows us to quantify changes in bulk electrical conductivity over time without the complications of regularization from inversion but these measurements do not have true locations in space as they are effective properties over the paths of the current which depends on the σ b of the system we compared the σ b a changes with those of spatially averaged known bulk σ b in the synthetic stream system evaluated across the vertical cross section through the stream and near stream aquifer regions at the er transect location which has cross sectional area at 9 σ b 1 a t σ b d x d z where x and z axis are transversely and vertically perpendicular to the stream respectively this calculation of σ b is valuable for understanding how the salt plume moves through the 2 d cross section where the electrodes are located it is related but not equivalent to the flux of saline tracer through the cross section the flow of current is 3 d in our models but variations in salinity gradients along the stream are minor so changes in σ b can be reasonably captured in 2 d for comparison to σ b a exceptions may occur during two periods lasting a few minutes much less than the survey interval of 15 min at the start and end of the injection while the front of the tracer plume arrives in the stream at the transect location and while the tail passes respectively 2 2 heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity case to test the effects of a more irregular pattern of saline tracer spreading on inversion images we also created a single test case with strong heterogeneity in hydraulic conductivity within the aquifer near the stream fig 1b it is important to note that we did not vary mobile or immobile porosity in this heterogeneous model only hydraulic conductivity which influences σ b through its effect on flow and thus salt transport in the streambed the bimodal hydraulic conductivity field consisting of sand and gravel lenses was simulated using tprogs carle 1999 which calculates the spatial attributes of geologic units using a markov chain approach and indicator simulation with quenching the volume of fine sand strata k 2 10 4 m s 1 in the aquifer was 4 times of that of coarse sand strata k 2 10 2 ms 1 the markov chain approach characterizes fine sand strata with mean length li i represents y and z directions based on transition probability 1 li between facies li is an indicator of connectivity a larger li value means that fine sand strata are continuously distributed over a longer distance li of fine sand was 2 0 and 0 1 m respectively in downstream channel perpendicular and vertical directions x y and z fluid flow solute transport and electrical conduction were solved according to the same steps in section 2 1 2 3 geophysical inversions synthetic er survey data were inverted using the freely available software r2 https www es lancs ac uk people amb freeware freeware htm using an algorithm based on occam s inversion binley and kemna 2005 r2 searches for the best σ b i model that matches the observed data in a least squares sense in an iterative manner for our models we use the commonly adopted isotropic smoothness regularization given the small size of the synthetic stream which is intended to represent 1st or 2nd order streams we did not break it out separately from inversion as has been done in field studies for larger streams table 1 an inversion was performed on the background dataset and then subsequent data were inverted using the time lapse difference inversion approach of labrecque and yang 2001 inversions were acceptable when the root mean squared error between the true data and model simulated data normalized by the noise approached unity we consider changes in σ b i greater than 2 the applied noise to be meaningful we compared the inferred changes in σ b i at three model pixels in the hyporheic zone with known changes in σ b within the synthetic stream system also referred to as reality fig 1a the three pixels are positioned at three locations intended to represent a shallow hyporheic location that is well connected to the overlying channel a deeper location that is less hydrologically connected to the channel and a location outside the stream in the bank beneath the electrode transect specifically location 1 is located 12 5 cm off the stream center and 15 cm below the sediment water interface location 2 is located 12 5 cm off the stream center and 95 cm below the sediment water interface and location 3 is located 187 5 cm outside the stream edge and 15 cm below the land surface interface these places were selected based on where it would be reasonable to look for tracer to appear in a field setting assuming no other knowledge from prior experiments therefore comparing σ b i with σ b at these three locations should illustrate potential interpretation pitfalls for example scenarios where the inversion indicates a faster tracer arrival than the real arrival in the simulation we also estimated the area of the saline tracer plume for the base case scenario to show difficulties in estimating this parameter meaningfully the areas were defined by locations where the percent increase in σ b i exceeded some thresholds change over background as is often done in the literature in this work the actual decision of a threshold was not particularly important as we just aimed to compare the inferred plume area in the inversion with the known area in the synthetic system or reality we selected two thresholds of 5 and 10 because we focused on 2 d inversions we did not estimate mass of tracer from the inversions as has been done in 3 d efforts e g singha and gorelick 2005 3 results 3 1 base scenario 3 1 1 σ b and σ b a in the base scenario fig 2 a fluid ec in the stream increases from 0 1 ms cm 1 to 0 3 ms cm 1 within the first 30 min of the injection and rapidly declines to the background value 6 5 h into the experiment or 0 5 h after the end of the injection fig 2a the breakthrough curves in σ b a and σ b both increase gradually over the duration of the injection as the hyporheic zone fills with tracer and have lower magnitudes than the fluid ec as expected and they also show different magnitudes from one another fig 2a the magnitudes depend arbitrarily on the choice of averaging areas for σ b and electrode configurations for σ b a and need not agree but the shape of the tails holds important information about the passage of saline tracer in this respect the shape of the tails is similar at least when compared to the fluid ec a comparison between σ b a eq 7 dashed orange line in fig 2a and σ b in a transect beneath the electrodes eq 9 solid orange line in fig 2a shows that both decay to 2 of the background value around 11 0 h table 3 3 1 2 inversions in the synthetic hyporheic system reality most of the saline tracer remains confined to a region approximately 1 m from the sediment water interface during the 6 hour injection period fig 2c after the injection ends and saline tracer has been flushed from the stream a diffuse region of elevated σ b remains within the hyporheic zone and expands outward 1 5 m from the stream at 8 h by 12 h the plume decreases in concentration and the change in σ b falls below 5 fig 2c the inversion results generally capture the geometry of the synthetic saline plume at 4 and 8 h with inversion effects fig 2c and d namely the change in σ b i is underestimated in the highest σ b areas of the plume and there is an apparent decrease in σ b i below the core of the plume that is not real fig 2d at later times after 8 h σ b i continues to underestimate the greatest changes in σ b fig 2d examining the three individual pixel locations in the hyporheic zone fig 2b the changes in the system estimated σ b i are generally similar to the true σ b but decrease too rapidly at the end of the injection at location 1 0 15 m deep in the streambed σ b in the synthetic system gradually increases over a period of 6 h in comparison σ b i at location 1 rapidly increases within the first 45 min and then generally plateaus until the end of the injection the breakthrough curve reaches a slightly greater plateau in σ b i than in σ b at this location table 3 after the injection ends σ b declines to 10 of the background value after 8 h and obtains the background value after 11 8 h in the synthetic system fig 2b meanwhile σ b i declines faster reaching 10 of background within 8 h and obtaining its background value 10 2 h into the experiment fig 2b table 3 at location 2 depth of 0 95 m in the streambed tracer arrival is slower than at location 1 in both σ b i and σ b some tracer arrives within 15 min in the synthetic system and σ b slowly climbs over the entire 6 hour injection period fig 2b meanwhile in the inversion artifacts cause an initial decrease in σ b i within the first hour followed by a gradual increase with a peak change of 48 at 6 5 h σ b decreases to 10 of the background value at 10 h in the synthetic simulation and 7 8 h in σ b i at location 3 within the floodplain the simulated σ b change is less than 0 6 in general agreement with σ b i all times except one have a change of less than 2 table 3 it is impractical to visualize the mismatch everywhere in the inversion for all times so we have selected these three locations as examples but other points within the er profile can be inferred from the changes in σ b i and σ b fields supplementary figs s1 s4 plume areas estimated by inversion agree poorly with the simulated reality for either choice of threshold change 5 or 10 fig 3 but relative changes from timestep to timestep appear reasonable in the case of the 10 threshold the simulated plume area expands to 2 7 m2 in the first 15 min of the test as tracer floods the stream fig 3a the plume area then continues to rise over the next 6 3 h as pore spaces in the hyporheic zone fill with tracer from the stream and the plume disperses fig 3a at 6 3 h the tracer plume area abruptly decreases from 10 2 to 9 1 m2 due to flushing of freshwater from the stream with further spreading tracer concentrations become more diluted within the hyporheic zone and the plume area continues to decline after 10 h from the start of the test the plume area decreases to zero meaning that σ b falls within 10 of the background value everywhere in the 2 d transect beneath the electrodes in comparison the plume area from σ b i is overestimated during the early part of the injection when the stream behaves as a highly conductive region fig 3a the area initially increases to 5 4 m2 in the first 15 min plume area from σ b i continues to increase during most of the remaining injection period fig 3a however plume area from σ b i rapidly contracts after 7 h when the stream is fully flushed of saline tracer though the plume area from σ b continues to decline over several more hours fig 3a 3 2 stream geometry effects 3 2 1 σ b and σ b a for streams of different geometry 4 0 1 m 6 0 2 m and 8 0 3 m breakthrough curves for σ b a and σ b again show very different plateau values during the injection but similar tailing behavior for streams of any size fig 4 a table 3 especially when compared to the fluid ec 3 2 2 inversions in the inversions at location 1 0 15 m deep in the streambed the stream geometry has an impact on the σ b i breakthrough curve in our small stream less than or equal to 6 m wide the change in σ b i beneath the stream is overestimated while in the relatively larger stream wider than 6 m fig 4 it is underestimated because of the negative inversion artifact fig s1 the tail in the inversions at location 1 is consistently underestimated for streams of any size because of smoothing affects in the inversion fig 4b table 3 at location 2 depth of 0 95 m in the streambed negative changes in σ b i are particularly severe during the injection period in the case of the larger stream fig 4c the tail in the inversion is again underestimated at this location for stream of all sizes fig 4c table 3 at location 3 within the floodplain the change in σ b is never more than 1 table 3 but σ b i increases above the noise threshold in the smaller streams 4 0 and 4 9 for 4 m and 6 m wide streams respectively in other words the inversion suggests the presence of tracer where only negligible concentrations exist due again to smoothing in the inversion however the inversions generally resolve the overarching patterns of saline tracer migration supplementary fig s1 with differing impacts from artifacts the 4 m channel and its hyporheic zone form a smaller target but the plume is still well resolved exhibiting roughly a 19 9 178 2 change in σ b i beneath the stream until late time around 12 h in the case of the larger 8 m wide channel the inversions during the tracer injection period show a particularly large artifact negative anomaly at great depth beneath the stream supplementary fig s1 comparing the inversion results in 4 6 and 8 m wide streams the artifact size and magnitude both increase with the stream size in these models as noted earlier we did not test changes in stream depth and width separately in an effort to reduce the number of scenarios since depth and width tend to scale together however we can speculate that depth might influence artifacts more than width because it has a more local influence on the electrical conductance between pairs of electrodes in the stream but increasing either one would increase the volume of electrically conductive surface water that is accessible to current so both are controlling factors 3 3 tracer concentration effects 3 3 1 σ b and σ b a for changes in stream water ec of 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 ms cm 1 breakthrough curves for σ b a and σ b again show good agreement in tailing behavior fig 5 a table 3 especially when compared to fluid ec 3 3 2 inversions the inversions again resolve the overarching patterns of saline tracer migration fig s2 however severe negative inversion artifacts occur during the saline tracer injection for greater plateau concentrations fig s2 at location 1 in the shallow hyporheic zone the pixel breakthrough curves from σ b i again capture the approximate behavior of σ b breakthrough curves but with a faster arrival and shorter tail regardless of plateau concentration in the stream fig 5b table 3 the peak change in σ b and σ b i during the injection agrees best for the dilute injection 0 2 ms cm 1 fig 5b table 3 at location 2 fig 5c agreement in the peak change is again best for the dilute injection but the tails in the inversion are consistently underestimated for all injection scenarios table 3 at location 3 σ b i increases above the 2 noise threshold for all scenarios even though σ b in reality at this location does not fig 5c table 3 3 4 tracer injection interval effects 3 4 1 σ b and σ b a for tracer injection times of 4 6 and 8 h the tails in σ b a are again similar in character to the tails in σ b fig 6 a when compared to fluid ec 3 4 2 inversions the inversions again resolve the general patterns of saline tracer migration fig s3 at the end of the longest injection period 8 h the inversion suggests a substantial increase in σ b i in the floodplain along the stream sides that does not exist in the synthetic system fig s3 for injections of any length peak changes in σ b i at the three locations in the inversion and the synthetic system are all similar fig 6b d for example at location 1 fig 6b the peak change in ec in the synthetic system is 178 for the 4 hour injection while the peak change is 181 for the 8 hour injection fig 6b which matches the peak change in σ b i for all three scenarios σ b i again declines too rapidly after the injection at location 1 relative to the synthetic system at location 2 σ b i is generally underestimated at most times particularly in the tail for all three injection length scenarios at location 3 σ b i again changes more than σ b peaks of 5 9 4 9 and 5 8 in the inversion compared with peaks of 0 5 0 6 and 0 7 in the synthetic system for injection times of 4 6 and 8 h 3 5 heterogeneity effects 3 5 1 σ b and σ b a the net effect of heterogeneity is to slightly increase the time that the saline tracer lingers in the subsurface σ b returns to within 2 of background after 11 0 h instead of 10 7 for the base case in table 3 and fig 7 a interestingly σ b a does not reflect this heavier tailing behavior fig 7a the time to recover to within 2 of background is actually 0 3 h shorter for the heterogeneous case than the homogeneous case compare dashed lines in fig 7a table 3 heterogeneity likely holds onto solute in the subsurface more than a homogeneous system but this mass may be lost to the er and not clearly detected fig 7a in other words heterogeneity changes the distribution of saline tracer in the subsurface only slightly as simulated here as in the homogeneous case the tail in σ b a is similar to the tail in σ b but the peak changes do not agree very well fig 7a table 3 3 5 2 inversions for heterogeneous sediments with bimodally distributed permeabilities the saline tracer plume in the synthetic system is more irregular in shape following connected pathways along zones of greater permeability fig s4 the inversions capture the general evolution of the plume but miss some irregularities in the plume shape due to limited resolution and smoothing so again underestimate the concentration of tracer at late time fig s4 at the three pixel locations of interest σ b i curves show little difference between homogeneous and heterogeneous cases fig 7b d table 3 in contrast differences in σ b for the synthetic heterogeneous and homogeneous systems are slightly greater particularly at locations 1 and 2 fig 7b d table 3 for example at location 1 in the shallow hyporheic zone the synthetic system has a peak change in σ b of 176 in heterogenous case versus 151 in homogenous one but both σ b i show a peak change of 186 similarly at location 2 the heterogeneous synthetic system has a longer tail than the homogeneous one σ b returns to 2 of its background value after 15 and 13 h respectively but σ b i returns to 2 of its background value after 9 7 and 10 2 h fig 7c σ b i noticeably underestimates variations in σ b caused by heterogeneity in permeability table 3 4 discussion 4 1 insights from synthetic models 4 1 1 σ b and σ b a changes in σ b a as measured in er surveys and σ b within the synthetic system the reality both decreased to within 2 of the background value over similar times the closest agreement in this tailing behavior occurred for the smaller 4 m stream with dilute injection 0 2 ms cm 1 fig 4a fig 6a and fig 7a suggesting that σ b a can be a valuable calculation for capturing the tail of the saline tracer passage it is important to remember however that σ b a curves are not spatially explicit they have a large support volume beneath the electrode transect and are sensitive to solute well outside of the single plane calculation done here thus the σ b a curve is useful for quantifying timescales of saline tracer plume passage and retention rather than magnitudes of concentration changes in any part of the transect for example the recovery time for σ b and σ b a to return to within 2 of the background value is 10 7 and 11 0 h for the base case scenario though their peak values are quite different fig 2a table 3 the σ b a curves can also be used prior to inversion to determine whether one would expect detectable changes to be present in an inversion if there are no changes in σ b a above noise then the inversion will not show meaningful changes either and there is no point inverting data that do not show changes 4 1 2 inversions in contrast inversions offer highly desirable spatially distributed maps with information on solute transport but are prone to artifacts fig 2d figs s1 s4 hyporheic tracer test applications are mathematically challenging for inversion because the hyporheic zone is an inherently thin target overlain by a highly electrically conductive stream note strong contrasts in σ b near the stream in the background model fig 2 in inversions σ b i changes in the stream will bleed into pixels in the hyporheic zone and surrounding aquifer during the injection period e g inversion at 4 h in fig 2d without a regularization constraint separating one from the other thus changes in σ b i and saline tracer plume area from σ b i are prone to gross overestimation compared to reality as tracer appears to extend beyond the stream prior to its actual arrival sawyer et al 2015 noted similar issues resolving the appearance of tracer in a karst conduit where the tracer plume appeared larger and more diffuse than borehole observations suggested without separating the stream from the subsurface in inversions the inversions may not yield reliable estimations of σ b i in the subsurface during the injection period inversions should not be interpreted for quantitative areas of saline tracer penetration beneath the stream in any regard but the impact of tracer area or volume on measurements and subsequent inversions can be explored with forward models at least in a synthetic sense another complicating factor is that 2 d inversions squeeze the three dimensionality of flow and transport into a single plane e g nimmer et al 2008 which can create the illusion of the tracer arriving early as an electrically conductive tracer approaches the transect from upstream this out of plane effect has been noted in previous field tracer studies e g ward et al 2010 it is less of an issue here we can be confident that the early appearance of saline tracer beneath the streambed is mainly due to aforementioned smoothing of the ec anomaly in the stream for the following reason the saline tracer moves rapidly downstream relative to the 15 minute interval for synthetic time lapse er measurements specifically the advective travel distance of saline tracer in the stream over one 15 minute sequence is 90 m vs 0 1 m s 1 table 2 suggesting that the saline tracer plume fills the stream over the entire experimental reach in much less than one survey interval the implication is that only one snapshot in the time series is subject to potentially large out of plane effects as the injection begins and similarly only one snapshot as the injection ends while inversions tend to overestimate σ b i immediately below the stream e g location 1 during injections they can underestimate σ b i much deeper below the stream e g location 2 due to smoothing around zones of abrupt change in σ b i such as the sediment water interface and base of the saline plume within the hyporheic zone many of our inversions also show artifacts in the stream banks that appear like dipoles of neighboring positive and negative changes in σ b i these zones of overestimation and underestimation emerge near sharp contrasts in σ b due to minimization of the second derivative during regularization and are also apparent in field studies e g fig 6 in clemence et al 2017 and fig 2 in ward et al 2010a by minimizing the 2nd derivative trying to keep the curvature small rather than the slope the inversion changes the slope and creates overshoots and undershoots associated with the estimated field 4 2 recommendations our results suggest that injecting saline tracers at modest concentration in streams is likely to produce a better target for hyporheic imaging namely a plume with smaller gradients in σ b for example the scenario with an 6 m wide stream and a 100 change 2 fold increase in stream fluid ec had the smallest discrepancies between σ b i and σ b in location 1 figs 2 and 3 in field applications the differences between stream ec before and during the plateau have often been on the order of 3 fold increase doughty et al 2020 menichino et al 2014 doetsch et al 2012 ward et al 2010b it is fortuitous that lower concentrations are better suited for resolving hyporheic transport as more labor is needed to inject more salt as discussed further below especially in larger streams the optimal injection period and plateau tracer concentration depend on the flow paths of interest and are site specific e g gonzález pinzón et al 2022 related to each site s unique system our results show that a shorter injection period in this case 4 h may not be sufficient to introduce enough salt to the hyporheic zone to aid detection at later times supplementary fig 3 suggesting that a longer injection period at low concentration is best for resolving hyporheic transport even if optimal injection periods and plateau tracer concentrations could be known or estimated for every site at a given time it would not necessarily be practical to inject the required amount of tracer over the optimal time period for example at some sites without road access the mass of tracers that can be carried in on foot exerts a practical constraint this study also suggests that er inversions in larger streams may be more prone to artifacts as observed in the 8 m wide stream scenario fig 4 ideally smaller streams with bigger hyporheic zones are more ideal for er imaging both in terms of minimizing the impact of the stream in the inversions and resolving tracer plume migration but hyporheic size may scale with stream size up to a point hester and doyle 2008 most field applications have utilized small streams generally 10 m wide table 1 this small size is partially due to a common research focus on headwater streams but also due to the practical challenge of adding enough salt to large rivers to resolve changes in σ b within the subsurface in two cases where time lapse er methods were applied to large rivers cardenas and markowski 2011 and coscia et al 2011 took advantage of natural changes in river discharge to image the movement of the mixing interface between river water and groundwater rather than adding tracers these synthetic experiments are useful for creating guidelines for interpreting time lapse er surveys of stream tracer tests 1 the injection period is generally a time when er measurements inadequately resolve changes in σ b nearest the stream due to severe artifacts that obscure tracer transport in the hyporheic zone while we did not explore it here specifying the stream bathymetry and concentration directly in inversions and decoupling the regularization across the aquifer system to the stream can improve inversions coscia et al 2011 while fluid ec is easy to monitor estimating stream bathymetry and then introducing it into numerical models can be difficult for shallow rocky bedded streams inversions are most reliable when the steep gradients in σ b that present problems for er are mostly dissipated so at late time during tracer tests as long as changes in σ b remain above the noise threshold while tracer concentrations in the stream are elevated during injection smoothing effects and artifacts may be most apparent meaning that high tracer concentrations in the hyporheic zone and stream may be most severely underestimated in the inversion and low values most severely overestimated the tracer appears to extend over a larger area than it does in reality supplementary fig 1 2 pixels at intermediate distance from the stream may be more likely to yield reliable breakthrough information the locations of best resolved pixels will vary with the geometry and electrical conductivity of the stream and hyporheic zone as well as electrode positions and geometry used to collect data on those electrodes for example the most reliable information was often between locations 1 and 2 in this synthetic study as could be mapped with a resolution matrix e g day lewis et al 2005 it is worth noting that pixel breakthrough curves are a complimentary analysis but not a replacement for monitoring breakthrough curves at specific locations in the subsurface for example using a piezometer and fluid electrical conductivity sensor when possible e g houzé et al 2022 we recognize however that in many headwater streams the rocky nature of the streambed can make it difficult to install such monitoring points e g doughty et al 2020 3 plume areas estimated from er is not reliable because of smoothing in the inversions moment based analyses may be one way forward if plume areas are the primary interest pidlisecky et al 2011 4 we recommend calculating σ b a for all tracer data sets as it does not require inversion and is an indicator of lingering tracer in the hyporheic zone after the passage of tracer in the stream and also determines whether inversions are worth conducting if σ b a does not change over time during salt injection experiment er surveyed data is invalid and there is no need to do an inversion for this data set a downside of σ b a is that it lacks spatial information inherent in er inversions and represents a blended measure of tracer transport in the stream and subsurface it is also worth noting that er offers important information to the stream community that can be used to make decisions during tracer tests for example a common concern is whether an injection has proceeded long enough for saline tracer to penetrate hyporheic flow paths of interest and return to the stream often referred to as the window of detection issue harvey and bencala 1993 wagner and harvey 1997 harvey and wagner 2000 er measurements particularly of σ b a may provide a tool that can be used in real time or near real time to explore when most of the tracer has returned from the hyporheic zone to the stream 4 3 limitations of this study our study uses a simplified conceptualization of hyporheic flow and solute transport to test the capability and resolution of er for hyporheic zone detection heterogeneities in stream properties such as width length slope meanders bathymetric roughness sediment hydraulic properties gaining or losing conditions and turbulence all have an impact on hyporheic flow and the transport of electrically conductive solutes through the hyporheic zone in field systems other properties may impact er data that we did not consider here including temperature moisture content location of the water table and temporal smearing changing one or several of these factors would change the hyporheic exchange zone and or affect the er inversion results hinnell et al 2010 in this study we only tested one er transect configuration perpendicular to the stream transects could also be positioned along the thalweg inside the stream for example and in this case artifacts beneath the stream and out of plane effects would be expected to differ in particular changes in artifacts due to variations in stream depth along a stream parallel profile could incorrectly be interpreted as changes in the depth of saline tracer mixing other aspects of er survey design for example electrode spacing and er profile length also determine the inversion outputs and were not examined here but have been addressed in other studies ward et al 2010b in field applications designs are constrained by what is suitable for site conditions for example large rivers would require a long er profile and braided streams may need small electrode spacing a small electrode spacing and long survey profile certainly provide more information and resolution for the output results 5 conclusions the application of time lapse electrical resistivity methods to hyporheic zone studies has rapidly advanced and a variety of approaches exist to analyze the data this study explored how differing field characteristics might be interpreted from er data by creating synthetic stream and hyporheic systems using coupled three dimensional fluid flow solute transport and electricity conduction models in cases of small streams where regularization was coupled across the stream aquifer boundary as explored here we found that inversions tend to overestimate the change in σ b within the hyporheic zone immediately beneath the stream while saline tracer is present in the stream and underestimate σ b at late times when the saline tracer is more dilute the amount of smoothing and size of discrepancies between reality and the subsequent inversions change under different stream depths and widths tracer concentrations and injection periods and scenarios of aquifer heterogeneity generally we find that there is such a thing as injecting too much tracer some inversion artifacts can be minimized by maintaining lower spatial gradients in σ b by injecting at lower concentrations discrepancies between σ b i and σ b both in terms of peak change and the time for recovery to background may be minimized for small streams with relatively large hyporheic zones and relatively homogeneous sediments the time series of σ b a measured at electrodes requires no inversion and generally appears to better detect lingering tracer in the hyporheic zone compared with pixel breakthrough curves in the inversion and may be useful in thinking about the window of detection problem that occurs with tracer tests our analysis also suggests that tracer plume areas cannot be reliably interpreted from inversions due to

1840,an increasing number of studies have combined saline tracer injections with time lapse electrical resistivity er surveys to explore solute exchange within the hyporheic zone the reliability and resolution of er surveys of the hyporheic zone are rarely discussed here we use a numerical modeling approach to assess how er imaging resolves changes in saline tracer concentration within the hyporheic zone given different synthetic scenarios we create a 3 d synthetic stream and surrounding hyporheic zone with an er electrode transect and solve the coupled equations for porous fluid flow and solute transport then we solve for the 3 d conduction of current between electrodes to create synthetic time lapse er surveys and invert the simulated resistances to obtain 2 d bulk electrical conductivity σ b images perpendicular to the stream which we compare with the known synthetic σ b fields the σ b fields in the inversion generally capture the shape of the simulated σ b fields but with smoothing and artifacts as a function of the inversion process consequently the calculated cross sectional area of tracer plume is inaccurate at inversion pixels beneath the stream the accuracy of the inverted σ b breakthrough curves when compared to the synthetic truth varies with stream size pixel depth and to a lesser extent injection time the tails of these pixel breakthrough curves beneath the stream are consistently underestimated compared to the synthetic truth i e σ b in the inversions appear to return to background faster by one to six hours the time series of average apparent bulk electrical conductivity requires no inversion and captures lingering saline tracer better than bulk ec breakthrough curves at individual pixels in the inversions data availability the input files of the numerical model and r2 inversion are available online https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 7894414 1 introduction the interaction between stream water and groundwater is complicated winter et al 1998 woessner 2000 lewandowski et al 2020 due to site specific heterogeneity in streambed permeability and time and space varying hydraulic gradients stream water groundwater exchange or hyporheic exchange has been inferred from measurements of concentration breakthrough curves during tracer tests either in streams or in monitoring wells hammett et al 2022 processes and parameters of interest such as exchange fluxes and residence times can be difficult to estimate from these data alone because 1 tracer experiments are sensitive to more than just hyporheic exchange harvey et al 1996 and 2 concentrations measured at one location in space give an integrated measure of what occurs upgradient and no information about variability along the transport pathway identifying hydrologic factors that control exchange over various spatial scales is critical for understanding patterns of water quality and ecological community structure triska et al 1993 wondzell and swanson 1996 knapp et al 2017 temporal scales of exchange are also important as daily to seasonal variations in flows may control transport behavior bryant et al 2020 wroblicky et al 1998 however few methods are available to quantify the variations at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales hydrogeophysical methods are a rapidly emerging tool to characterize and monitor hydrologic processes at spatial and temporal resolution heretofore impossible e g binley et al 2015 in particular time lapse electrical resistivity er imaging recording electrical resistivity change with time has provided high resolution spatial and temporal information about transport of fluids and solutes in diverse geologic settings busato et al 2019 doetsch et al 2012 sawyer et al 2015 and has been used extensively in hyporheic studies summarized in table 1 er methods are used to estimate the distribution of bulk electrical resistivity or its reciprocal bulk electrical conductivity denoted σ b of a medium by driving an electrical current between two source electrodes and measuring the resultant potential distribution at two or more receiver electrodes the measured resistances are averages of the electrical properties of the porous media and conductive fluid in the system because er methods are sensitive to changes in σ b of the subsurface er has frequently been used to monitor spatial and temporal surface water groundwater interactions from conductive tracer tests in stream systems er has been found to resolve targets from the sub meter to tens of meters scale in the field depending on the support volume of measurements and tomographic resolution table 1 the resolution and support volume however are complicated functions of the σ b distribution in the subsurface the data acquisition geometry and data noise daily and ramirez 1995 day lewis et al 2005 these properties affect the subsequent er inversions which are generally too smooth underestimate high values and overestimate low ones and show lower resolution far from the electrodes day lewis et al 2005 consequently mapping the mass or volume of conductive targets using er is difficult for example large diffuse targets may be more detectable than small concentrated plumes singha and gorelick 2005 bethune et al 2015 despite these limitations many researchers have been interested in using er to monitor changes in the hyporheic exchange zone e g ward et al 2010 smidt et al 2015 sparacino et al 2019 table 1 which varies in time and space boano et al 2008 gooseff et al 2006 for example ward et al 2012 used er inversions to show that hyporheic extent decreased with baseflow recession in contrast to expectations from some conceptual models e g hakenkamp et al 1993 white 1993 one important caveat is that estimating a quantitative change in hyporheic extent or size of a saline tracer plume requires the selection of a meaningful change in inverted bulk conductivities σ b i between inversions in time which makes the analysis subjective because inversions are affected by smoothing and artifacts as noted above another useful measurement of change within the system is to look at the data themselves e g the apparent bulk electrical conductivity σ b a e g coscia et al 2011 dehkordy et al 2019 doughty et al 2020 for example coscia et al 2011 showed reasonable agreement between the tail of the σ b a measured from er and fluid electical conductivity ec from nearby piezometers that were screened through the 4 m thick saturated aquifer one issue with these σ b a data however is that they are volumetric averages of the system through which the current flows and consequently are not indicative of change in any specific region of interest in the subsurface consequently σ b i are needed to get spatially distributed information in addition to the noise and unreliability introduced via smoothing and artifacts during er inversions the size of the stream hyporheic system and the experimental design likely influence the ability of er inversions to resolve changes in saline tracer extent for example because the stream is a zone of high ec that lies immediately above the hyporheic target changes in saline tracer concentration in overlying surface water may be challenging to disentangle from changes in saline concentration in the hyporheic zone using er inversions alone previous research has explored steps to try to mitigate these effects such as separating the stream from the aquifer during regularization of the inverse problem and or assuming known stream bathymetry and changes in stream water ec e g coscia et al 2011 mclachlan et al 2021 these techniques are undoubtedly necessary in large streams to obtain accurate estimates of subsurface characteristics but may be harder to implement in some of the shallow first order streams where many hyporheic studies are conducted table 1 because to resolve stream bathymetry at high resolution is computationally expensive to make pixel resolution of inversion fine enough in small streams the size of electrodes may be comparable to the pixel size and the impacts of electrodes themselves on the inversion may be exemplified these complications may limit the extent to which we can trust the spatial and temporal information that er surveys give us about the hyporheic zone here we look to explore how tracer injection design and stream characteristics affect the reliability of er surveys in a controlled system to do so we create a set of 3 d finite element models in our synthetic models stream tracer tests are coupled with er surveys and the synthetic resistance data converted to σ b a are then inverted in 2 d following standard methods to compare the known σ b with σ b i and σ b a specifically we explored three primary issues 1 stream area or size 2 injection concentration and 3 injection times we chose to examine stream area because the stream is a highly electrically conductive feature that lies immediately above the target feature the hyporheic zone and we sought to understand how its size influences the quality of the inversion in the target zone we examined injection concentration and injection time to explore whether feasible adjustments to the duration of the injection or peak concentration could improve the detection of tracer in the hyporheic zone downstream our goal is to provide suggestions for designing time lapse er surveys of hyporheic zones in the field and guidelines to improve the interpretation of er inversion results specifically how hyporheic area and the spatial distribution and timing of solute arrival and flushing in the hyporheic zone are interpreted using er inversion results 2 methods our objective is to use a numerical modeling approach to explore the performance of time lapse er surveys for quantifying hyporheic solute transport because these studies are generally conducted in relatively small streams where a continuous injection of saline tracer is feasible e g ward et al 2010a toran et al 2013 gonzalez pinzon et al 2015 we limit our analysis to scenarios with relatively shallow streams three dimensional fluid flow solute transport and electrical conduction are simulated for a stream and the surrounding porous medium during and after the injection of a saline tracer solution a two dimensional er survey profile is set perpendicular to the stream in the model domain and voltages at 12 electrodes are modeled in response to a sequence of currents the synthetic σ b a measurements are then inverted to create maps in σ b i which can be compared with known changed in σ b as a test of interpretation pitfalls we performed this analysis for three scenarios with various stream sizes 0 1 m deep 4 m wide 0 2 m deep 6 m wide and 0 3 m deep 8 m wide because of the long run times of our simulations we took advantage of the fact that stream width and depth tend to scale with one another in natural streams allen et al 2018 and we increased width and depth together we also tested different tracer injection designs injection time for 4 6 and 8 h injection concentration 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 ms cm 1 finally we tested one scenario with heterogeneous sediment permeability to explore how irregular features of the tracer plume are resolved in er inversions the base case has a stream geometry of 0 2 m deep 6 m wide an injection time of 6 h an injection concentration of 0 3 ms cm 1 and homogeneous sediment table 2 we did not test parameters related to er survey design such as number and spacing of electrodes which have been examined previously wilkinson et al 2006 ward et al 2010b 2 1 numerical modeling of a homogeneous hydraulic conductivity system three dimensional finite element models of a stream aquifer system were constructed using comsol multiphysics comsol multiphysics 2019 the model represents three sets of governing physics 1 steady state fluid flow in porous media 2 transient solute transport and 3 steady state electrical conduction the synthetic study reach was designed to be a simplified version of a typical mountain stream which is inspired by work conducted at watershed 03 at the h j andrews experimental forest all synthetic er surveys were conducted with 12 electrodes spaced 1 m apart and 317 combinations of current source sink and measurement electrodes in a dipole dipole configuration similar to ward et al 2010 we focus on a dipole dipole geometry because it usually generates the fastest data collection with most available er systems and speed of er data collection is a particularly important requirement in fast moving stream systems to avoid temporal smearing there is consequently a trade off in the field between speed of data collection and collecting enough data to make quality inversions dipole dipole is one of the best geometries to manage this issue the model geometry was composed of two domains stream and porous aquifer to minimize the calculation cost porous fluid flow and saline tracer transport were only simulated in the portion of the aquifer near the stream and electrode transect because fluid ec and thus σ b do not vary beyond the hyporheic zone over the timescale of tracer injections fig 1 a electrical conduction was simulated over a larger domain that includes areas of constant σ b far from the stream to minimize boundary effects on electrical currents as noted above stream sizes were varied from 4 m wide and 0 1 m deep to 8 m wide and 0 3 m deep table 2 with a base case scenario of 6 m wide and 0 2 m deep the portion of the aquifer near the stream extended 2 4 m from the stream sides on either side and 2 m below the stream bottom the entire aquifer zone was 100 m wide 100 m deep and 100 m long extended 50 m upstream and downstream from the electrode transect to minimize boundary effects on electrical conduction near the electrodes the saline tracer injection location was positioned 50 m upstream from the electrode transect to ensure adequate mixing of salt to depth at the electrode transect at the injection the saline tracer was instantaneously well mixed across the entire stream cross section to resolve fine changes in solute concentration around the electrode transect the finite element model grid spacing along the stream was set to less than 0 03 m in the downstream direction and 0 015 m in the vertical direction the steady state groundwater flow equation was first solved for the aquifer near the stream fig 1a 1 k h 0 where k is the hydraulic permeability m s 1 and h is hydraulic head m the floodplain surface was specified as a no flow boundary zero net recharge at the upstream and downstream faces influx and efflux rates were chosen to be consistent with the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and the down valley hydraulic head gradient j was assumed to be 0 01 m m 1 representative of moderate to steep small order streams in addition the lateral sides and base of the domain were assigned the same down valley slope j in hydraulic head but raised uniformly by an additional 0 1 mm relative to the stream to generate a weakly gaining stream condition or slow groundwater flow towards the stream we created a weakly gaining stream for model convenience to reduce the effect of domain size on the steady state fluid ec field in the hyporheic zone but our findings are equally applicable to neutral or losing systems the sediment water interface was assigned a non uniform hydraulic head condition jx hbed x y to represent the interactions of currents with a rough bed e g elliott and brooks 1997 stonedahl et al 2010 fig 1c where 2 h bed x y h a cos 2 π l 1 x t 1 sin 2 π l 2 y h a sin 2 π l 2 x t 2 cos 2 π l 2 y ha is the amplitude of hydraulic head variations along the stream associated with bedforms of length scale l 1 and l 2 t 1 and t 2 are lateral offsets in the bedform crest locations table 2 the hyporheic exchange patterns and rates that result from this non uniform hydraulic head condition are three dimensional with the greatest hyporheic velocities in the downstream direction the velocity fields from the steady groundwater flow solution were used to solve for conservative tracer transport in the hyporheic zone based on the transient advection dispersion equation with exchange between mobile and immobile pores 3a θ m c m t θ i c i t θ m u c m θ m

pores table 2 a dual domain model with mobile and immobile pores in the aquifer was chosen over a single domain model to better represent the persistence of tracer in pore spaces long after the bulk of tracer mass has been flushed from the stream ward et al 2010b the solute used to represent the saline tracer was fluid ec which has units of ms cm 1 rather than concentration units since fluid ec

field was specified from the steady solution to eq 4 transient solutions for fluid ec eq 4 were retained at 15 minute intervals to simulate time lapse er surveys at those times to convert fluid ec fields at each time step to σ b we used a simple petrophysical model from singha et al 2007 5 σ b θ m θ i m 1 θ m σ f m θ i σ f i where m is the cementation exponent equal to 1 3 and σ f m ms cm 1 and σ f i ms cm 1 are the fluid ec values for the mobile and immobile pore spaces respectively this model assumes that the fluids in mobile and immobile pore spaces behave as conductors in parallel additionally surface conductance is ignored stream ec was converted directly to σ b given a porosity of 100 the calculated σ b fields were then used to simulate resistance values at the electrodes that would be measured by er instrumentation in the field by solving the poisson equation for electrical conduction 6 h σ b v i δ x y where v v is electric potential and i a is the magnitude of the current source applied at electrodes and resistance is defined by δv i between two electrodes the ground and water surfaces were treated as insulation boundaries while the sides and base of the model were zero voltage boundaries to create the synthetic er survey data we solved eq 6 once for each electrode 12 times at each time step where we applied a current source at the electrode of interest and extracted the voltages at the remaining electrodes we then used the law of superposition to calculate 317 combinations of resistance readings according to the electrode sequence at each time step random 2 gaussian noise was added to the modeled resistances to represent the typical magnitude of noise in field surveys in real er surveys the sequence of current induction and voltage readings often spans minutes during which time changes in the σ b field may have occurred as the tracer migrated in this synthetic er survey the sequence is effectively instantaneous because all resistances are measured within the same σ b field as such the synthetic survey does not include the effects of temporal smearing that may occur in real er surveys for each time step in a synthetic survey we computed σ b a for each combination in the electrode sequence σ b a is the equivalent bulk conductivity of a homogeneous earth given a measured δv i 7 σ b a i g v where 8 g 2 π 1 om 1 on 1 pm 1 pn g is a geometric factor where om on pm and pn are the distances between electrodes o and m o and n p and m and p and n respectively we then computed the average of the 317 σ b a values at each time step to construct a breakthrough curve of σ b a the σ b a breakthrough curve allows us to quantify changes in bulk electrical conductivity over time without the complications of regularization from inversion but these measurements do not have true locations in space as they are effective properties over the paths of the current which depends on the σ b of the system we compared the σ b a changes with those of spatially averaged known bulk σ b in the synthetic stream system evaluated across the vertical cross section through the stream and near stream aquifer regions at the er transect location which has cross sectional area at 9 σ b 1 a t σ b d x d z where x and z axis are transversely and vertically perpendicular to the stream respectively this calculation of σ b is valuable for understanding how the salt plume moves through the 2 d cross section where the electrodes are located it is related but not equivalent to the flux of saline tracer through the cross section the flow of current is 3 d in our models but variations in salinity gradients along the stream are minor so changes in σ b can be reasonably captured in 2 d for comparison to σ b a exceptions may occur during two periods lasting a few minutes much less than the survey interval of 15 min at the start and end of the injection while the front of the tracer plume arrives in the stream at the transect location and while the tail passes respectively 2 2 heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity case to test the effects of a more irregular pattern of saline tracer spreading on inversion images we also created a single test case with strong heterogeneity in hydraulic conductivity within the aquifer near the stream fig 1b it is important to note that we did not vary mobile or immobile porosity in this heterogeneous model only hydraulic conductivity which influences σ b through its effect on flow and thus salt transport in the streambed the bimodal hydraulic conductivity field consisting of sand and gravel lenses was simulated using tprogs carle 1999 which calculates the spatial attributes of geologic units using a markov chain approach and indicator simulation with quenching the volume of fine sand strata k 2 10 4 m s 1 in the aquifer was 4 times of that of coarse sand strata k 2 10 2 ms 1 the markov chain approach characterizes fine sand strata with mean length li i represents y and z directions based on transition probability 1 li between facies li is an indicator of connectivity a larger li value means that fine sand strata are continuously distributed over a longer distance li of fine sand was 2 0 and 0 1 m respectively in downstream channel perpendicular and vertical directions x y and z fluid flow solute transport and electrical conduction were solved according to the same steps in section 2 1 2 3 geophysical inversions synthetic er survey data were inverted using the freely available software r2 https www es lancs ac uk people amb freeware freeware htm using an algorithm based on occam s inversion binley and kemna 2005 r2 searches for the best σ b i model that matches the observed data in a least squares sense in an iterative manner for our models we use the commonly adopted isotropic smoothness regularization given the small size of the synthetic stream which is intended to represent 1st or 2nd order streams we did not break it out separately from inversion as has been done in field studies for larger streams table 1 an inversion was performed on the background dataset and then subsequent data were inverted using the time lapse difference inversion approach of labrecque and yang 2001 inversions were acceptable when the root mean squared error between the true data and model simulated data normalized by the noise approached unity we consider changes in σ b i greater than 2 the applied noise to be meaningful we compared the inferred changes in σ b i at three model pixels in the hyporheic zone with known changes in σ b within the synthetic stream system also referred to as reality fig 1a the three pixels are positioned at three locations intended to represent a shallow hyporheic location that is well connected to the overlying channel a deeper location that is less hydrologically connected to the channel and a location outside the stream in the bank beneath the electrode transect specifically location 1 is located 12 5 cm off the stream center and 15 cm below the sediment water interface location 2 is located 12 5 cm off the stream center and 95 cm below the sediment water interface and location 3 is located 187 5 cm outside the stream edge and 15 cm below the land surface interface these places were selected based on where it would be reasonable to look for tracer to appear in a field setting assuming no other knowledge from prior experiments therefore comparing σ b i with σ b at these three locations should illustrate potential interpretation pitfalls for example scenarios where the inversion indicates a faster tracer arrival than the real arrival in the simulation we also estimated the area of the saline tracer plume for the base case scenario to show difficulties in estimating this parameter meaningfully the areas were defined by locations where the percent increase in σ b i exceeded some thresholds change over background as is often done in the literature in this work the actual decision of a threshold was not particularly important as we just aimed to compare the inferred plume area in the inversion with the known area in the synthetic system or reality we selected two thresholds of 5 and 10 because we focused on 2 d inversions we did not estimate mass of tracer from the inversions as has been done in 3 d efforts e g singha and gorelick 2005 3 results 3 1 base scenario 3 1 1 σ b and σ b a in the base scenario fig 2 a fluid ec in the stream increases from 0 1 ms cm 1 to 0 3 ms cm 1 within the first 30 min of the injection and rapidly declines to the background value 6 5 h into the experiment or 0 5 h after the end of the injection fig 2a the breakthrough curves in σ b a and σ b both increase gradually over the duration of the injection as the hyporheic zone fills with tracer and have lower magnitudes than the fluid ec as expected and they also show different magnitudes from one another fig 2a the magnitudes depend arbitrarily on the choice of averaging areas for σ b and electrode configurations for σ b a and need not agree but the shape of the tails holds important information about the passage of saline tracer in this respect the shape of the tails is similar at least when compared to the fluid ec a comparison between σ b a eq 7 dashed orange line in fig 2a and σ b in a transect beneath the electrodes eq 9 solid orange line in fig 2a shows that both decay to 2 of the background value around 11 0 h table 3 3 1 2 inversions in the synthetic hyporheic system reality most of the saline tracer remains confined to a region approximately 1 m from the sediment water interface during the 6 hour injection period fig 2c after the injection ends and saline tracer has been flushed from the stream a diffuse region of elevated σ b remains within the hyporheic zone and expands outward 1 5 m from the stream at 8 h by 12 h the plume decreases in concentration and the change in σ b falls below 5 fig 2c the inversion results generally capture the geometry of the synthetic saline plume at 4 and 8 h with inversion effects fig 2c and d namely the change in σ b i is underestimated in the highest σ b areas of the plume and there is an apparent decrease in σ b i below the core of the plume that is not real fig 2d at later times after 8 h σ b i continues to underestimate the greatest changes in σ b fig 2d examining the three individual pixel locations in the hyporheic zone fig 2b the changes in the system estimated σ b i are generally similar to the true σ b but decrease too rapidly at the end of the injection at location 1 0 15 m deep in the streambed σ b in the synthetic system gradually increases over a period of 6 h in comparison σ b i at location 1 rapidly increases within the first 45 min and then generally plateaus until the end of the injection the breakthrough curve reaches a slightly greater plateau in σ b i than in σ b at this location table 3 after the injection ends σ b declines to 10 of the background value after 8 h and obtains the background value after 11 8 h in the synthetic system fig 2b meanwhile σ b i declines faster reaching 10 of background within 8 h and obtaining its background value 10 2 h into the experiment fig 2b table 3 at location 2 depth of 0 95 m in the streambed tracer arrival is slower than at location 1 in both σ b i and σ b some tracer arrives within 15 min in the synthetic system and σ b slowly climbs over the entire 6 hour injection period fig 2b meanwhile in the inversion artifacts cause an initial decrease in σ b i within the first hour followed by a gradual increase with a peak change of 48 at 6 5 h σ b decreases to 10 of the background value at 10 h in the synthetic simulation and 7 8 h in σ b i at location 3 within the floodplain the simulated σ b change is less than 0 6 in general agreement with σ b i all times except one have a change of less than 2 table 3 it is impractical to visualize the mismatch everywhere in the inversion for all times so we have selected these three locations as examples but other points within the er profile can be inferred from the changes in σ b i and σ b fields supplementary figs s1 s4 plume areas estimated by inversion agree poorly with the simulated reality for either choice of threshold change 5 or 10 fig 3 but relative changes from timestep to timestep appear reasonable in the case of the 10 threshold the simulated plume area expands to 2 7 m2 in the first 15 min of the test as tracer floods the stream fig 3a the plume area then continues to rise over the next 6 3 h as pore spaces in the hyporheic zone fill with tracer from the stream and the plume disperses fig 3a at 6 3 h the tracer plume area abruptly decreases from 10 2 to 9 1 m2 due to flushing of freshwater from the stream with further spreading tracer concentrations become more diluted within the hyporheic zone and the plume area continues to decline after 10 h from the start of the test the plume area decreases to zero meaning that σ b falls within 10 of the background value everywhere in the 2 d transect beneath the electrodes in comparison the plume area from σ b i is overestimated during the early part of the injection when the stream behaves as a highly conductive region fig 3a the area initially increases to 5 4 m2 in the first 15 min plume area from σ b i continues to increase during most of the remaining injection period fig 3a however plume area from σ b i rapidly contracts after 7 h when the stream is fully flushed of saline tracer though the plume area from σ b continues to decline over several more hours fig 3a 3 2 stream geometry effects 3 2 1 σ b and σ b a for streams of different geometry 4 0 1 m 6 0 2 m and 8 0 3 m breakthrough curves for σ b a and σ b again show very different plateau values during the injection but similar tailing behavior for streams of any size fig 4 a table 3 especially when compared to the fluid ec 3 2 2 inversions in the inversions at location 1 0 15 m deep in the streambed the stream geometry has an impact on the σ b i breakthrough curve in our small stream less than or equal to 6 m wide the change in σ b i beneath the stream is overestimated while in the relatively larger stream wider than 6 m fig 4 it is underestimated because of the negative inversion artifact fig s1 the tail in the inversions at location 1 is consistently underestimated for streams of any size because of smoothing affects in the inversion fig 4b table 3 at location 2 depth of 0 95 m in the streambed negative changes in σ b i are particularly severe during the injection period in the case of the larger stream fig 4c the tail in the inversion is again underestimated at this location for stream of all sizes fig 4c table 3 at location 3 within the floodplain the change in σ b is never more than 1 table 3 but σ b i increases above the noise threshold in the smaller streams 4 0 and 4 9 for 4 m and 6 m wide streams respectively in other words the inversion suggests the presence of tracer where only negligible concentrations exist due again to smoothing in the inversion however the inversions generally resolve the overarching patterns of saline tracer migration supplementary fig s1 with differing impacts from artifacts the 4 m channel and its hyporheic zone form a smaller target but the plume is still well resolved exhibiting roughly a 19 9 178 2 change in σ b i beneath the stream until late time around 12 h in the case of the larger 8 m wide channel the inversions during the tracer injection period show a particularly large artifact negative anomaly at great depth beneath the stream supplementary fig s1 comparing the inversion results in 4 6 and 8 m wide streams the artifact size and magnitude both increase with the stream size in these models as noted earlier we did not test changes in stream depth and width separately in an effort to reduce the number of scenarios since depth and width tend to scale together however we can speculate that depth might influence artifacts more than width because it has a more local influence on the electrical conductance between pairs of electrodes in the stream but increasing either one would increase the volume of electrically conductive surface water that is accessible to current so both are controlling factors 3 3 tracer concentration effects 3 3 1 σ b and σ b a for changes in stream water ec of 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 ms cm 1 breakthrough curves for σ b a and σ b again show good agreement in tailing behavior fig 5 a table 3 especially when compared to fluid ec 3 3 2 inversions the inversions again resolve the overarching patterns of saline tracer migration fig s2 however severe negative inversion artifacts occur during the saline tracer injection for greater plateau concentrations fig s2 at location 1 in the shallow hyporheic zone the pixel breakthrough curves from σ b i again capture the approximate behavior of σ b breakthrough curves but with a faster arrival and shorter tail regardless of plateau concentration in the stream fig 5b table 3 the peak change in σ b and σ b i during the injection agrees best for the dilute injection 0 2 ms cm 1 fig 5b table 3 at location 2 fig 5c agreement in the peak change is again best for the dilute injection but the tails in the inversion are consistently underestimated for all injection scenarios table 3 at location 3 σ b i increases above the 2 noise threshold for all scenarios even though σ b in reality at this location does not fig 5c table 3 3 4 tracer injection interval effects 3 4 1 σ b and σ b a for tracer injection times of 4 6 and 8 h the tails in σ b a are again similar in character to the tails in σ b fig 6 a when compared to fluid ec 3 4 2 inversions the inversions again resolve the general patterns of saline tracer migration fig s3 at the end of the longest injection period 8 h the inversion suggests a substantial increase in σ b i in the floodplain along the stream sides that does not exist in the synthetic system fig s3 for injections of any length peak changes in σ b i at the three locations in the inversion and the synthetic system are all similar fig 6b d for example at location 1 fig 6b the peak change in ec in the synthetic system is 178 for the 4 hour injection while the peak change is 181 for the 8 hour injection fig 6b which matches the peak change in σ b i for all three scenarios σ b i again declines too rapidly after the injection at location 1 relative to the synthetic system at location 2 σ b i is generally underestimated at most times particularly in the tail for all three injection length scenarios at location 3 σ b i again changes more than σ b peaks of 5 9 4 9 and 5 8 in the inversion compared with peaks of 0 5 0 6 and 0 7 in the synthetic system for injection times of 4 6 and 8 h 3 5 heterogeneity effects 3 5 1 σ b and σ b a the net effect of heterogeneity is to slightly increase the time that the saline tracer lingers in the subsurface σ b returns to within 2 of background after 11 0 h instead of 10 7 for the base case in table 3 and fig 7 a interestingly σ b a does not reflect this heavier tailing behavior fig 7a the time to recover to within 2 of background is actually 0 3 h shorter for the heterogeneous case than the homogeneous case compare dashed lines in fig 7a table 3 heterogeneity likely holds onto solute in the subsurface more than a homogeneous system but this mass may be lost to the er and not clearly detected fig 7a in other words heterogeneity changes the distribution of saline tracer in the subsurface only slightly as simulated here as in the homogeneous case the tail in σ b a is similar to the tail in σ b but the peak changes do not agree very well fig 7a table 3 3 5 2 inversions for heterogeneous sediments with bimodally distributed permeabilities the saline tracer plume in the synthetic system is more irregular in shape following connected pathways along zones of greater permeability fig s4 the inversions capture the general evolution of the plume but miss some irregularities in the plume shape due to limited resolution and smoothing so again underestimate the concentration of tracer at late time fig s4 at the three pixel locations of interest σ b i curves show little difference between homogeneous and heterogeneous cases fig 7b d table 3 in contrast differences in σ b for the synthetic heterogeneous and homogeneous systems are slightly greater particularly at locations 1 and 2 fig 7b d table 3 for example at location 1 in the shallow hyporheic zone the synthetic system has a peak change in σ b of 176 in heterogenous case versus 151 in homogenous one but both σ b i show a peak change of 186 similarly at location 2 the heterogeneous synthetic system has a longer tail than the homogeneous one σ b returns to 2 of its background value after 15 and 13 h respectively but σ b i returns to 2 of its background value after 9 7 and 10 2 h fig 7c σ b i noticeably underestimates variations in σ b caused by heterogeneity in permeability table 3 4 discussion 4 1 insights from synthetic models 4 1 1 σ b and σ b a changes in σ b a as measured in er surveys and σ b within the synthetic system the reality both decreased to within 2 of the background value over similar times the closest agreement in this tailing behavior occurred for the smaller 4 m stream with dilute injection 0 2 ms cm 1 fig 4a fig 6a and fig 7a suggesting that σ b a can be a valuable calculation for capturing the tail of the saline tracer passage it is important to remember however that σ b a curves are not spatially explicit they have a large support volume beneath the electrode transect and are sensitive to solute well outside of the single plane calculation done here thus the σ b a curve is useful for quantifying timescales of saline tracer plume passage and retention rather than magnitudes of concentration changes in any part of the transect for example the recovery time for σ b and σ b a to return to within 2 of the background value is 10 7 and 11 0 h for the base case scenario though their peak values are quite different fig 2a table 3 the σ b a curves can also be used prior to inversion to determine whether one would expect detectable changes to be present in an inversion if there are no changes in σ b a above noise then the inversion will not show meaningful changes either and there is no point inverting data that do not show changes 4 1 2 inversions in contrast inversions offer highly desirable spatially distributed maps with information on solute transport but are prone to artifacts fig 2d figs s1 s4 hyporheic tracer test applications are mathematically challenging for inversion because the hyporheic zone is an inherently thin target overlain by a highly electrically conductive stream note strong contrasts in σ b near the stream in the background model fig 2 in inversions σ b i changes in the stream will bleed into pixels in the hyporheic zone and surrounding aquifer during the injection period e g inversion at 4 h in fig 2d without a regularization constraint separating one from the other thus changes in σ b i and saline tracer plume area from σ b i are prone to gross overestimation compared to reality as tracer appears to extend beyond the stream prior to its actual arrival sawyer et al 2015 noted similar issues resolving the appearance of tracer in a karst conduit where the tracer plume appeared larger and more diffuse than borehole observations suggested without separating the stream from the subsurface in inversions the inversions may not yield reliable estimations of σ b i in the subsurface during the injection period inversions should not be interpreted for quantitative areas of saline tracer penetration beneath the stream in any regard but the impact of tracer area or volume on measurements and subsequent inversions can be explored with forward models at least in a synthetic sense another complicating factor is that 2 d inversions squeeze the three dimensionality of flow and transport into a single plane e g nimmer et al 2008 which can create the illusion of the tracer arriving early as an electrically conductive tracer approaches the transect from upstream this out of plane effect has been noted in previous field tracer studies e g ward et al 2010 it is less of an issue here we can be confident that the early appearance of saline tracer beneath the streambed is mainly due to aforementioned smoothing of the ec anomaly in the stream for the following reason the saline tracer moves rapidly downstream relative to the 15 minute interval for synthetic time lapse er measurements specifically the advective travel distance of saline tracer in the stream over one 15 minute sequence is 90 m vs 0 1 m s 1 table 2 suggesting that the saline tracer plume fills the stream over the entire experimental reach in much less than one survey interval the implication is that only one snapshot in the time series is subject to potentially large out of plane effects as the injection begins and similarly only one snapshot as the injection ends while inversions tend to overestimate σ b i immediately below the stream e g location 1 during injections they can underestimate σ b i much deeper below the stream e g location 2 due to smoothing around zones of abrupt change in σ b i such as the sediment water interface and base of the saline plume within the hyporheic zone many of our inversions also show artifacts in the stream banks that appear like dipoles of neighboring positive and negative changes in σ b i these zones of overestimation and underestimation emerge near sharp contrasts in σ b due to minimization of the second derivative during regularization and are also apparent in field studies e g fig 6 in clemence et al 2017 and fig 2 in ward et al 2010a by minimizing the 2nd derivative trying to keep the curvature small rather than the slope the inversion changes the slope and creates overshoots and undershoots associated with the estimated field 4 2 recommendations our results suggest that injecting saline tracers at modest concentration in streams is likely to produce a better target for hyporheic imaging namely a plume with smaller gradients in σ b for example the scenario with an 6 m wide stream and a 100 change 2 fold increase in stream fluid ec had the smallest discrepancies between σ b i and σ b in location 1 figs 2 and 3 in field applications the differences between stream ec before and during the plateau have often been on the order of 3 fold increase doughty et al 2020 menichino et al 2014 doetsch et al 2012 ward et al 2010b it is fortuitous that lower concentrations are better suited for resolving hyporheic transport as more labor is needed to inject more salt as discussed further below especially in larger streams the optimal injection period and plateau tracer concentration depend on the flow paths of interest and are site specific e g gonzález pinzón et al 2022 related to each site s unique system our results show that a shorter injection period in this case 4 h may not be sufficient to introduce enough salt to the hyporheic zone to aid detection at later times supplementary fig 3 suggesting that a longer injection period at low concentration is best for resolving hyporheic transport even if optimal injection periods and plateau tracer concentrations could be known or estimated for every site at a given time it would not necessarily be practical to inject the required amount of tracer over the optimal time period for example at some sites without road access the mass of tracers that can be carried in on foot exerts a practical constraint this study also suggests that er inversions in larger streams may be more prone to artifacts as observed in the 8 m wide stream scenario fig 4 ideally smaller streams with bigger hyporheic zones are more ideal for er imaging both in terms of minimizing the impact of the stream in the inversions and resolving tracer plume migration but hyporheic size may scale with stream size up to a point hester and doyle 2008 most field applications have utilized small streams generally 10 m wide table 1 this small size is partially due to a common research focus on headwater streams but also due to the practical challenge of adding enough salt to large rivers to resolve changes in σ b within the subsurface in two cases where time lapse er methods were applied to large rivers cardenas and markowski 2011 and coscia et al 2011 took advantage of natural changes in river discharge to image the movement of the mixing interface between river water and groundwater rather than adding tracers these synthetic experiments are useful for creating guidelines for interpreting time lapse er surveys of stream tracer tests 1 the injection period is generally a time when er measurements inadequately resolve changes in σ b nearest the stream due to severe artifacts that obscure tracer transport in the hyporheic zone while we did not explore it here specifying the stream bathymetry and concentration directly in inversions and decoupling the regularization across the aquifer system to the stream can improve inversions coscia et al 2011 while fluid ec is easy to monitor estimating stream bathymetry and then introducing it into numerical models can be difficult for shallow rocky bedded streams inversions are most reliable when the steep gradients in σ b that present problems for er are mostly dissipated so at late time during tracer tests as long as changes in σ b remain above the noise threshold while tracer concentrations in the stream are elevated during injection smoothing effects and artifacts may be most apparent meaning that high tracer concentrations in the hyporheic zone and stream may be most severely underestimated in the inversion and low values most severely overestimated the tracer appears to extend over a larger area than it does in reality supplementary fig 1 2 pixels at intermediate distance from the stream may be more likely to yield reliable breakthrough information the locations of best resolved pixels will vary with the geometry and electrical conductivity of the stream and hyporheic zone as well as electrode positions and geometry used to collect data on those electrodes for example the most reliable information was often between locations 1 and 2 in this synthetic study as could be mapped with a resolution matrix e g day lewis et al 2005 it is worth noting that pixel breakthrough curves are a complimentary analysis but not a replacement for monitoring breakthrough curves at specific locations in the subsurface for example using a piezometer and fluid electrical conductivity sensor when possible e g houzé et al 2022 we recognize however that in many headwater streams the rocky nature of the streambed can make it difficult to install such monitoring points e g doughty et al 2020 3 plume areas estimated from er is not reliable because of smoothing in the inversions moment based analyses may be one way forward if plume areas are the primary interest pidlisecky et al 2011 4 we recommend calculating σ b a for all tracer data sets as it does not require inversion and is an indicator of lingering tracer in the hyporheic zone after the passage of tracer in the stream and also determines whether inversions are worth conducting if σ b a does not change over time during salt injection experiment er surveyed data is invalid and there is no need to do an inversion for this data set a downside of σ b a is that it lacks spatial information inherent in er inversions and represents a blended measure of tracer transport in the stream and subsurface it is also worth noting that er offers important information to the stream community that can be used to make decisions during tracer tests for example a common concern is whether an injection has proceeded long enough for saline tracer to penetrate hyporheic flow paths of interest and return to the stream often referred to as the window of detection issue harvey and bencala 1993 wagner and harvey 1997 harvey and wagner 2000 er measurements particularly of σ b a may provide a tool that can be used in real time or near real time to explore when most of the tracer has returned from the hyporheic zone to the stream 4 3 limitations of this study our study uses a simplified conceptualization of hyporheic flow and solute transport to test the capability and resolution of er for hyporheic zone detection heterogeneities in stream properties such as width length slope meanders bathymetric roughness sediment hydraulic properties gaining or losing conditions and turbulence all have an impact on hyporheic flow and the transport of electrically conductive solutes through the hyporheic zone in field systems other properties may impact er data that we did not consider here including temperature moisture content location of the water table and temporal smearing changing one or several of these factors would change the hyporheic exchange zone and or affect the er inversion results hinnell et al 2010 in this study we only tested one er transect configuration perpendicular to the stream transects could also be positioned along the thalweg inside the stream for example and in this case artifacts beneath the stream and out of plane effects would be expected to differ in particular changes in artifacts due to variations in stream depth along a stream parallel profile could incorrectly be interpreted as changes in the depth of saline tracer mixing other aspects of er survey design for example electrode spacing and er profile length also determine the inversion outputs and were not examined here but have been addressed in other studies ward et al 2010b in field applications designs are constrained by what is suitable for site conditions for example large rivers would require a long er profile and braided streams may need small electrode spacing a small electrode spacing and long survey profile certainly provide more information and resolution for the output results 5 conclusions the application of time lapse electrical resistivity methods to hyporheic zone studies has rapidly advanced and a variety of approaches exist to analyze the data this study explored how differing field characteristics might be interpreted from er data by creating synthetic stream and hyporheic systems using coupled three dimensional fluid flow solute transport and electricity conduction models in cases of small streams where regularization was coupled across the stream aquifer boundary as explored here we found that inversions tend to overestimate the change in σ b within the hyporheic zone immediately beneath the stream while saline tracer is present in the stream and underestimate σ b at late times when the saline tracer is more dilute the amount of smoothing and size of discrepancies between reality and the subsequent inversions change under different stream depths and widths tracer concentrations and injection periods and scenarios of aquifer heterogeneity generally we find that there is such a thing as injecting too much tracer some inversion artifacts can be minimized by maintaining lower spatial gradients in σ b by injecting at lower concentrations discrepancies between σ b i and σ b both in terms of peak change and the time for recovery to background may be minimized for small streams with relatively large hyporheic zones and relatively homogeneous sediments the time series of σ b a measured at electrodes requires no inversion and generally appears to better detect lingering tracer in the hyporheic zone compared with pixel breakthrough curves in the inversion and may be useful in thinking about the window of detection problem that occurs with tracer tests our analysis also suggests that tracer plume areas cannot be reliably interpreted from inversions due to

1841,a 2d eulerian meshless shallow water model based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph is proposed to study overland flow rain on a dry bed to generate a runoff flow is one common hydraulic phenomenon however it is difficult for existing lagrangian sph shallow water models to present the flow because no computational particle exists on a dry bed to overcome this difficulty the eulerian form of the 2d shallow water equations is used to describe flow behavior in the proposed model an hllc approximate riemann solver is applied to calculate fluxes between two neighboring particles to smear out the instabilities caused by the discretization of the nonlinear convective term and the discontinuity of wet dry beds additionally we use a surface reconstruction method srm to ensure that the proposed model has well balanced and positivity preserving properties bed friction and infiltration effects are also analytically considered eight case studies involving various overland flows with wet dry transitions rainfall infiltration bed friction and complex topography are adopted to test the proposed model capacity the first order convergence rate is obtained in the convergence analysis against the exact and measured results in the analytical case studies the relative root mean square errors of depth and velocity are approximately 0 02 to 0 3 and 1 3 to 1 7 respectively in the experimental case studies the relative root mean square errors of depth and discharge velocity are approximately 3 8 and 1 2 to 6 1 respectively the good agreement demonstrates between the results shows the reliability of the proposed 2d eulerian sph shallow water model for real world overland flows keywords smoothed particle hydrodynamics shallow water rainfall runoff well balanced positivity

soulaimani 2005 an upwinding kernel function chang et al 2017 a variable smoothing length rodriguez paz and bonet 2005 a particle splitting technique vacondio et al 2012 and various well balanced approaches xia et al 2013 vacondio et al 2013 moreover xia and liang 2016 and wu et al 2020 adopted graphics processing unit gpu and openmp parallel algorithms respectively to accelerate the computational efficiency of lsph sw models these published works of lsph sw models used the sph interpolation operator to calculate the depth based on the time variable distance between two neighboring particles on the other hand rossi et al 2017 and chang et al 2018 solved the differential equation of classical fluid dynamics such as the lagrangian form of the continuity equation to obtain the depth of each particle in multiphase flows and open channel flows the lsph sw models have attracted increasing attention since they have three features 1 no mesh is required to construct complex boundary geometries 2 the nonlinear convective effect is considered based on moving particles i e the nonlinear convective terms are not considered in simulations and 3 wet dry bed transitions are described without the need for special treatment however there are no particles on a dry bed in the lagrangian framework which makes it difficult for lsph sw models to describe the common hydraulic phenomenon of overland flows induced by rainfall on a dry bed although chang et al 2016b attempted to place particles with extremely small water depths on a dry bed to conduct rainfall runoff flows it is only suitable for specified cases fei et al 2021 proposed a naked area treatment to extend the applicability of the work of chang et al 2016b for simulating rainfall runoff infiltration processes however the criticism of the lsph sw rainfall models is their great computational expenses for the predictions of rainfall induced overland flows it is clear that rainfall induced overland flows which commonly occur in hydraulic problems have not been handled well using lsph sw models thus far recently nasar et al 2019 developed an eulerian sph ns model in which the eulerian form of nses is solved by sph to study fluid structure interaction problems eulerian fixed particles only require neighbor searching once for a whole simulation and avoid particle disorder the work shows that eulerian fixed particles can give more stable and effective performance than lagrangian moving particles for internal flows apparently it is much easier to address shallow water flows with rainfall on a dry bed based on eulerian models yet the eulerian sph approach has not been applied to solve the shallow water equations hence we are motivated to propose an eulerian sph shallow water esph sw model to overcome the mentioned difficulty of lsph sw models and further investigate the convergence accuracy and efficiency of the proposed esph sw model for various overland flows fig 1 shows the neighboring cells and particles for the finite volume fv method and sph under uniform cartesian cell particle arrangements each particle has eight neighboring particles in sph while each cell has four neighboring cells in the fv the eulerian sph approach has the feature that the calculations of fluxes and bed elevation slopes based on the proposed model consider four extra interacting particles in the diagonal directions in particular the variation in bed elevation slopes often has a dominant impact on hydraulic problems guan et al 2014 considered extra diagonal uniform cartesian meshes to calculate the bed elevations varied by avalanches in their 2d fv based morphodynamic model but the extra meshes were not involved in the calculations of fluxes and bed elevation slopes therefore it will exploit the impact of the feature on overland flow simulations compared to an fv sw model in the study in the eulerian framework sph shallow water models will suffer the instabilities caused by the discretization of the nonlinear convection terms and the discontinuity of wet dry beds to smear the instabilities the riemann sph approach of lanson and vila 2008 is applied in the proposed model in which the flux at the middle of two neighboring particles is required in simulations we thus apply the hllc approximate riemann solver liang and borthwick 2009 toro 2019 to seek stable solutions furthermore two well balanced and positivity preserving properties are satisfied in the proposed model to prevent nonphysical phenomena such as an oscillated water surface in the case of still water and a negative water depth in flows with complex topography well balanced and positivity preserving approaches in mesh based shallow water models such as the hydrostatic reconstruction method audusse et al 2004 duran 2015 the modified hydrostatic reconstruction method chen and noelle 2017 and the surface reconstruction method srm xia et al 2017 have been extensively discussed based on the applicability in this study the surface reconstruction method of xia et al 2017 is adopted to maintain the two properties in addition we analytically address bed friction and infiltration effects by utilizing the works of xia and liang 2018 and ni et al 2020 respectively to enhance the efficiency of the proposed model in their studies an analytical friction slope term treatment was derived by xia and liang 2018 while the full green ampt infiltration equation with ponded depth was analytically solved by ni et al 2020 this paper is organized as follows in

treatment of boundary conditions is addressed at the end of the section in section 3 eight 2d case studies including various overland flows with wet dry transitions rainfall infiltration bed friction

source terms of bed slope friction slope and infiltration 2 5 1 surface reconstruction method the surface reconstruction method of xia et al 2017 is used to guarantee that the proposed esph sw model

respectively from the reconstructed surface levels of particles a and b in eq 16 the corresponding bed elevations can be obtained as follows 18 z b a z s a h a z b b z s b h b then z b a b is introduced based on 19 z b a b max z b a z b b the positive depths of particles a and b can be given by 20 h a max 0 z s a z b a b h b max 0 z s b z b a b the reconstructed depths h are used in eqs 13

corrector is employed to perform the temporal integration of eq 10 monaghan 1994 the predictor step to obtain intermediate variables u a n 1 2 is shown in eq 24 while the corrector step to correct the intermediate variables to become u a n 1 2 is found in eq 25 the final variables without the mass source and sink term are calculated based on eq 26 24 u a n 1 2 u a n δ t 2 2 b 1 b n v b f a n f n c

step the superscript denotes the final variables without the mass source and sink term and the subscript indicates the intermediate variables from the predictor step when the depth is extremely shallow the instability caused by calculating the friction slope terms in the momentum components in eqs 24 and 25 will happen to resolve this problem an efficient implicit scheme with the analytical formulation proposed by xia and liang 2018 is adopted two vector variables of m a n and m a n 1 2 are first defined as eqs 27 and 28 then the variables u a n 1 2 and u a n 1 2 in the velocity

used to calculate the infiltration rate of a particle 33 i a d f a d t k s a 1 θ s a θ i a h c a h a f a where f is the cumulative infiltration depth k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity θ s and c are the saturated and initial volumetric water contents respectively and h c is the capillary suction head borrowing the idea of ni et al 2020 we perform a finite difference based temporal discretization of eq 33 to obtain 34 i a n 1 f a n 1 f a n δ t k s a 1 θ s a θ i a h c a h a n 1 f a n 1 then the discretized equation of i a n 1 f a n 1 f a n δ t from eq 34 applied to eq 32 can lead 35 h a n 1 h a n 1 δ t r a n 1 f a n f a n 1 next the substitution of eq 35 into eq 34 can yield the following quadratic equation 36 f a n 1 2 c 0 f a n 1 c 1 0 in which c 0 f a n k s a δ t 1 θ s a θ

1 is assumed to be zero if h a n 1 0 it is noted that the velocity components of u a n 1 and u a n 1 are identical while the depth components of u a n 1 and u a n 1 are equal only when the mass source and sink terms are not involved 2 6 boundary condition treatments in the proposed esph sw model one layer dummy particles are used to construct solid and inflow outflow boundary conditions the detailed procedure can be found in chang et al 2018 in all case studies the solid boundary condition is given as a slip boundary condition 3 results in this section eight 2d case studies including a still water test dam break flows over wet and dry beds and through a scaled model of the toce watershed an oscillation flow on a parabolic bed topography rainfall runoff flows on impermeable and permeable inclined planes and in the thies catchment are chosen to assess the performance of the proposed 2d esph sw model furthermore a mesh based shallow water model is established based on a cartesian uniform cell centered godunov type finite volume method toro 2001 to conduct a comparison between the meshless and mesh based shallow water models the hllc approximate riemann solver surface reconstruction method analytical friction slope term treatment and analytical green ampt infiltration model in the proposed 2d esph sw model are adopted in the established fv sw model numerical simulations were performed on an intel r core tm i7 8700 k cpu 3 70 ghz pc that was equipped with 16 gb of ram to evaluate the accuracy of the simulated results the relative root mean square error rrmse based on ϕ is chosen as eq 38 while the relative absolute error ε ϕ i based on ϕ is shown in eq 39 38 e ϕ 1 n e i n e ϕ i sim ϕ i ext mes 2 i n e ϕ i ext mes 2 39 ε ϕ i ϕ i sim ϕ i ext mes ϕ i ext mes where the spatial rrmse is given as n e is the number of recorded particles meshes at a fixed time while the temporal rrmse is obtained as n e is the number of recorded steps for a fixed particle mesh and the subscripts sim ext and mes denote the simulated exact and measured results respectively 3 1 analytical dam break flows 3 1 1 case 1 dam break flow over a wet bed an analytical dam break flow over a wet bed delestre et al 2013 is chosen as the first case study to show the accuracy and convergence of the proposed esph sw model for discontinuous problems the water depths of 0 005 m upstream x 5 m and 0 001 m downstream x 5 m are initially still in a smooth rectangular channel whose length and width are 10 m and 10 m respectively five particle spacings of 0 5 m 0 25 m 0 125 m 0 0625 m and 0 03125 m are used to calculate the convergence rates based on depth and velocity as 0 76 and 0 87 respectively fig 2 shows the simulated profiles of the depth and velocity based on the different particle spacings along the channel centerline at t 5 s as the particle spacing becomes finer the simulated depth profile and peak velocity are closer to the exact ones especially near the bore the spatial rrmses based on depth and velocity are 0 3 and 1 3 respectively for a particle spacing of 0 03125 m the simulated results show agreement with the exact solutions 3 1 2 case 2 dam break flow over a dry bed in the second case study the same channel of the first case study is used an initial upstream depth of 0 005 m is adopted to conduct a dam break flow over a dry bed delestre et al 2013 the convergence rate is calculated based on five particle spacings 0 5 m 0 25 m 0 125 m 0 0625 m and 0 03125 m the convergence rate of depth is 0 88 while the convergence rate of velocity is 1 03 the simulated profiles of the depth and velocity based on the different particle spacings along the channel centerline at t 5 s are shown in fig 3 the simulated and exact results are almost identical except for the underpredicted velocities near the advancing front which are also found in published works such as sanders 2001 ying and wang 2008 and yu and chang 2021 an advancing front with an extremely small depth is a strong discontinuity that usually causes numerical instability to damp out the instability the introduced numerical dissipation causes the velocity discrepancy the spatial rrmses based on depth and velocity are 0 2 and 1 7 respectively for a particle spacing of 0 03125 m based on the results of the first two case studies it can be demonstrated that the proposed esph sw model can yield first order accurate results for discontinuous dam break problems 3 2 case 3 oscillation flow on a parabolic bed topography a smooth parabolic bed topography is given by eq 40 in the third case study delestre et al 2013 to produce a periodic oscillation flow a water column with a depth and velocity such as eq 41 with t 0 s is initially placed on the bed a comparison of the efficiency and accuracy between the esph sw and fv sw models is performed in the case study the same particle and cell numbers of 250 000 l 0 0 008 m and a constant time step of 0 001 s are adopted to run a 3 t simulation fig 4 reveals the simulated surface levels along the centerline of y l 2 the predictions of both sw models are consistent with the exact solutions furthermore table 1 shows the required cpu time and the accuracy of both sw models the esph sw model requires twice as much cpu time as the fv sw model since the neighboring particles in esph are twice as many as the neighboring meshes in fv the spatial rrmses based on depth show that the esph sw based prediction is more accurate than the fv sw based prediction before 1 5 t however the fv sw model has less error after a time of 1 5 t it can be deduced that the fv sw model has better flux conservation than the esph sw model overall the esph sw model can address oscillation flow problems well 40 z 0 x y h 0 1 x l 2 2 y l 2

case 4 still water the fourth case study of still water over uneven topography which is given by eq 42 xia et al 2017 is used to check the well balanced property of the proposed model there are 25 600 particles i e the particle spacing l 0 50 m uniformly arranged in the 8000 m 8000 m domain the initial water surface level is 1000 m and the initial water velocity in the and y directions is zero the spatial rrmse based on the depth of 4 9 10 11 indicates that the proposed esph sw model is well balanced 42 z 0 x y max 0 z 1 z 2 where z 1 x y 2000 0 00032 x 3000 2 y 5000 2 and z 2 x y 900 0 000144

a rectangular laboratory channel with a length and width of 24 m and 0 196 m respectively consists of three bed planes with slopes of 0 020 0 015 and 0 010 in the downstream direction iwagaki 1995 manning s roughness coefficient is given at 0 01 three rainfall intensities including 389 230 and 288 cm h are prescribed on the upper middle and lower planes respectively to present spatially variable rainfall the measurement procedure is reported in iwagaki 1955 a particle spacing of 0 004 294000 particles and a maximum time step of 0 004 s are used to conduct three scenarios with different rainfall durations of 10 s 20 s and 30 s fig 5 shows the simulated unit discharge hydrographs the outlet unit discharges for the three durations quickly increase at approximately 25 s which is the required time of upstream flood arrival compared to the measured data obtained from iwagaki 1955 the time of occurrence of peak flow is delayed by approximately 5 s for the 10 s duration while the peak flow is overestimated by approximately 0 003 m2 s for the 20 s duration the temporal rrmses based on unit discharge are 4 6 2 5 and 1 2 for rainfall durations of 10 s 20 s and 30 s respectively in summary the simulated results are in close agreement with the measured results 3 5 case 6 rainfall runoff flow on a permeable plane the sixth case study was experimentally conducted by lima 1989 to present a rainfall runoff flow on a plane covered by loam we refer to lima 1989 for the experimental details the length width and longitudinal slope of the plane are equal to 1 m 0 5 m and 0 01 respectively to numerically reproduce the case by the proposed esph sw model the parameters k s of 1 67 10 6 θ s of 0 506 θ i of 0 0107 and h c of 0 3035 are prescribed in the green ampt infiltration model costabile et al 2021 the manning coefficient is given at 0 021 a total of 1250 particles particle spacing of 0 02 m and a maximum time step of 0 002 s are used to run a 1200 second simulation fig 6 shows the simulated unit discharge hydrograph at the outlet the proposed model provides a fairly good prediction of outlet unit discharge since the shape of the simulated hydrograph is similar to that of lima s measured hydrograph and the temporal rrmse based on discharge is 6 1 it can be demonstrated that the proposed esph sw model can be exploited to show rainfall runoff infiltration processes 3 6 case 7 dam break flow in a scaled model of the toce watershed in the seventh case study a 1 100 scale model of the toce watershed in italy established by morris 2000 is used to test the performance of the proposed model on dam break flows through complex topography fig 7 shows the topography of the scale model of the toce watershed the bed of the watershed is initially dry the incoming flow whose discharge and depth hydrographs are presented in fig 8 causes a dam break flow through the watershed a 180 s simulation is conducted with a particle spacing of 0 05 m 140985 particles and an average manning roughness coefficient of 0 0162 the simulated flow patterns at different times are shown in fig 9 the dam break flow reaches an island near the middle of the watershed at t 30 s then the island flooded at t 60 s and the flow starts to leave the watershed at t 90 s nine gauges p1 p4 p5 p9 p10 p19 p21 p23 p24 and p25 in fig 10 are used to check the accuracy against the measured data from morris 2000 fig 10 shows the temporal variations in the simulated surface levels at the nine gauges the temporal rrmses based on depth are 1 4 0 9 1 2 0 7 1 8 0 5 0 5 1 9 and 1 2 for gauges p1 p4 p5 p9 p10 p19 p21 p23 p24 and p25 respectively the simulated profiles agree with the measured profiles however the surface levels at gauges p23 and p24 are overestimated while those at gauge p1 are underestimated the differences may be caused by the real inflow direction which cannot be known overall the proposed esph sw model exhibits good predictions of dam break flows through a complex topography 3 7 case 8 rainfall runoff flows in the thies catchment the last case study is about the rainfall runoff experiments in the thies catchment of senegal reported by tatard et al 2008 and mügler et al 2011 in which detailed measurements can be found the bed topography of the catchment with a length of 10 m and a width of 4 m is shown in fig 11 the manning roughness coefficient is 0 02 the first scenario is a steady rainfall runoff flow that is generated by a constant effective rainfall intensity of 51 5 mm h as suggested by simons et al 2014 the proposed esph sw and the established fv sw simulations are both conducted the same numbers of particles and cells are given at 4141 i e a spatial resolution of 0 1 m while a maximum time step of 0 01 s is prescribed in both simulations the total simulation time is 900 s to reach a steady state for the scenario the locations of 62 gauges are shown in fig 11 fig 12 gives the comparison between the measured and simulated velocities the two sw models yield good predictions against the measured results the spatial rrmses based on velocity are 4 7 and 3 7 for the esph sw and fv sw models respectively furthermore fig 13 shows the distributions of the relative absolute error based on discharge ε vel for the esph sw model the numbers of ε vel 50 and ε vel 1 are 52 and 3 while for the fv sw model the numbers are 50 and 1 it can be said that the results obtained by the proposed esph sw model have slightly better quality the second scenario is an unsteady rainfall runoff flow generated by a rainfall hydrograph shown as the dash dot line in fig 14 the total rainfall time is 5100 s the same particle number and maximum time step in the simulation of the steady scenario are adopted in the proposed model to present the unsteady flow fig 14 shows the simulated hydrograph of discharge at the outlet for the unsteady scenario the simulated and measured results are consistent and the temporal rrmse based on discharge is 2 3 however the outlet discharge before approximately 800 s is not numerically captured this phenomenon was mentioned by simons et al 2014 a possible explanation is that the infiltration model used cannot reflect the surface coating effect based on the simulated results of the two scenarios it can be demonstrated that the proposed esph sw model has the capacity to handle real rainfall runoff problems 4 conclusion remarks in this study we proposed a novel eulerian sph sw model to resolve the difficulty of the traditional lagrangian sph sw model regarding overland flows induced by rain on a dry bed the proposed model is validated by eight case studies regarding a still water test dam break flows over wet and dry beds and through a scaled model of the toce watershed an oscillation flow on a parabolic bed topography rainfall runoff flows on impermeable and permeable inclined planes and in the thies catchment the simulated solutions show good agreement with respect to the exact measured and mesh based results although the proposed eulerian model introduces a numerical error from the discretization of the nonlinear convective terms the efficiency of the proposed model is significantly improved since neighbor searching is only performed once furthermore compared to the built fv sw model the proposed esph sw model yields more accurate predictions on nonflat topography problems while the built fv sw model gives slightly better flux conservation and efficiency the eight case studies demonstrate the success of the proposed esph sw model with first order convergence and a uniform cartesian particle arrangement further improvements to the existing esph sw model will be necessary including adaptive spatial resolution algorithms

1841,a 2d eulerian meshless shallow water model based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph is proposed to study overland flow rain on a dry bed to generate a runoff flow is one common hydraulic phenomenon however it is difficult for existing lagrangian sph shallow water models to present the flow because no computational particle exists on a dry bed to overcome this difficulty the eulerian form of the 2d shallow water equations is used to describe flow behavior in the proposed model an hllc approximate riemann solver is applied to calculate fluxes between two neighboring particles to smear out the instabilities caused by the discretization of the nonlinear convective term and the discontinuity of wet dry beds additionally we use a surface reconstruction method srm to ensure that the proposed model has well balanced and positivity preserving properties bed friction and infiltration effects are also analytically considered eight case studies involving various overland flows with wet dry transitions rainfall infiltration bed friction and complex topography are adopted to test the proposed model capacity the first order convergence rate is obtained in the convergence analysis against the exact and measured results in the analytical case studies the relative root mean square errors of depth and velocity are approximately 0 02 to 0 3 and 1 3 to 1 7 respectively in the experimental case studies the relative root mean square errors of depth and discharge velocity are approximately 3 8 and 1 2 to 6 1 respectively the good agreement demonstrates between the results shows the reliability of the proposed 2d eulerian sph shallow water model for real world overland flows keywords smoothed particle hydrodynamics shallow water rainfall runoff well balanced positivity preservation data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph a lagrangian meshless numerical method proposed by lucy 1977 and gingold and monaghan 1977 has been applied to astrophysical fluid dynamics problems because no boundary must be specified owing to the lagrangian description of sph but without the limitation of meshes monaghan 1994 further applied sph to complicated fluid dynamics problems involving free surface flows by solving the lagrangian form of the navier stokes equations nses referred to as lsph ns models abundant applications of lsph ns models to free surface flows such as solitary wave run up on a slope monaghan and kos 1999 he et al 2021 dam break flows lee et al 2008 yang et al 2021 english et al 2022 fluid and structure interaction bouscasse et al 2013 luo et al 2021 sun et al 2021 lyu et al 2022 and multiphase flows he et al 2022 have been brought forth since 1994 in addition to the lsph ns models the lagrangian form of the shallow water equations swes which are commonly used to describe flow behaviors in hydraulics chaudhry 2008 solved using sph is called an lsph sw model wang and shen 1999 first explored the topic of dam break flows on a flat and smooth bed using their lsph sw model various hydraulic applications of lsph sw models have been presented including dam break flows over complex topography de leffe et al 2010 chang et al 2011 kao and chang 2012 gu et al 2017 open channel flows with hydraulic jumps vacondio et al 2012 chang and chang 2013 chang et al 2017 chang et al 2021 open channel junction flows chang et al 2016a rainfall runoff flows chang et al 2016b fei et al 2021 nonhydrostatic shallow water flows chang et al 2014 and debris flows pastor et al 2018 pastor et al 2023 aslami et al 2023 to enhance the stability and accuracy of lsph sw models several improvements have been proposed for example a nonparametric formulation of artificial viscosity ata and soulaimani 2005 an upwinding kernel function chang et al 2017 a variable smoothing length rodriguez paz and bonet 2005 a particle splitting technique vacondio et al 2012 and various well balanced approaches xia et al 2013 vacondio et al 2013 moreover xia and liang 2016 and wu et al 2020 adopted graphics processing unit gpu and openmp parallel algorithms respectively to accelerate the computational efficiency of lsph sw models these published works of lsph sw models used the sph interpolation operator to calculate the depth based on the time variable distance between two neighboring particles on the other hand rossi et al 2017 and chang et al 2018 solved the differential equation of classical fluid dynamics such as the lagrangian form of the continuity equation to obtain the depth of each particle in multiphase flows and open channel flows the lsph sw models have attracted increasing attention since they have three features 1 no mesh is required to construct complex boundary geometries 2 the nonlinear convective effect is considered based on moving particles i e the nonlinear convective terms are not considered in simulations and 3 wet dry bed transitions are described without the need for special treatment however there are no particles on a dry bed in the lagrangian framework which makes it difficult for lsph sw models to describe the common hydraulic phenomenon of overland flows induced by rainfall on a dry bed although chang et al 2016b attempted to place particles with extremely small water depths on a dry bed to conduct rainfall runoff flows it is only suitable for specified cases fei et al 2021 proposed a naked area treatment to extend the applicability of the work of chang et al 2016b for simulating rainfall runoff infiltration processes however the criticism of the lsph sw rainfall models is their great computational expenses for the predictions of rainfall induced overland flows it is clear that rainfall induced overland flows which commonly occur in hydraulic problems have not been handled well using lsph sw models thus far recently nasar et al 2019 developed an eulerian sph ns model in which the eulerian form of nses is solved by sph to study fluid structure interaction problems eulerian fixed particles only require neighbor searching once for a whole simulation and avoid particle disorder the work shows that eulerian fixed particles can give more stable and effective performance than lagrangian moving particles for internal flows apparently it is much easier to address shallow water flows with rainfall on a dry bed based on eulerian models yet the eulerian sph approach has not been applied to solve the shallow water equations hence we are motivated to propose an eulerian sph shallow water esph sw model to overcome the mentioned difficulty of lsph sw models and further investigate the convergence accuracy and efficiency of the proposed esph sw model for various overland flows fig 1 shows the neighboring cells and particles for the finite volume fv method and sph under uniform cartesian cell particle arrangements each particle has eight neighboring particles in sph while each cell has four neighboring cells in the fv the eulerian sph approach has the feature that the calculations of fluxes and bed elevation slopes based on the proposed model consider four extra interacting particles in the diagonal directions in particular the variation in bed elevation slopes often has a dominant impact on hydraulic problems guan et al 2014 considered extra diagonal uniform cartesian meshes to calculate the bed elevations varied by avalanches in their 2d fv based morphodynamic model but the extra meshes were not involved in the calculations of fluxes and bed elevation slopes therefore it will exploit the impact of the feature on overland flow simulations compared to an fv sw model in the study in the eulerian framework sph shallow water models will suffer the instabilities caused by the discretization of the nonlinear convection terms and the discontinuity of wet dry beds to smear the instabilities the riemann sph approach of lanson and vila 2008 is applied in the proposed model in which the flux at the middle of two neighboring particles is required in simulations we thus apply the hllc approximate riemann solver liang and borthwick 2009 toro 2019 to seek stable solutions furthermore two well balanced and positivity preserving properties are satisfied in the proposed model to prevent nonphysical phenomena such as an oscillated water surface in the case of still water and a negative water depth in flows with complex topography well balanced and positivity preserving approaches in mesh based shallow water models such as the hydrostatic reconstruction method audusse et al 2004 duran 2015 the modified hydrostatic reconstruction method chen and noelle 2017 and the surface reconstruction method srm xia et al 2017 have been extensively discussed based on the applicability in this study the surface reconstruction method of xia et al 2017 is adopted to maintain the two properties in addition we analytically address bed friction and infiltration effects by utilizing the works of xia and liang 2018 and ni et al 2020 respectively to enhance the efficiency of the proposed model in their studies an analytical friction slope term treatment was derived by xia and liang 2018 while the full green ampt infiltration equation with ponded depth was analytically solved by ni et al 2020 this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the eulerian and conservative 2d swes are first presented and the fundamental sph operators are introduced to discretize the 2d swes i e 2d sph based discretized swes in the following the hllc riemann approximation solver the surface reconstruction method the analytical friction slope term treatment and the analytical green ampt infiltration model are sequentially presented the treatment of boundary conditions is addressed at the end of the section in section 3 eight 2d case studies including various overland flows with wet dry transitions rainfall infiltration bed friction and complex topography are investigated to validate the proposed model the results are compared against exact solutions measured data and mesh based numerical solutions 2 methodology 2 1 two

source terms of bed slope friction slope and infiltration 2 5 1 surface reconstruction method the surface reconstruction method of xia et al 2017 is used to guarantee that the proposed esph sw model can maintain well balanced and positivity preserving properties the reconstruction begins with 16 z s a z s a max 0 min z b b z b a δ z b z s b z s a z s b z s b max 0 min z b a z b b δ z b z s a z s

2006 as 17 z b a z b a 1 2 ψ ζ z b b z b a z b b z b b 1 2 ψ ζ z b b z b a in eq 17 ψ is the minmod slope limiter and ζ and ζ are given as ζ z b a z b a 1 z b b z b a and ζ z b b 1 z b b z b b z b a respectively from the reconstructed surface levels of particles a and b in eq 16 the corresponding bed elevations can be obtained as follows 18 z b a z s a h a z b b z s b h b then z b a b is introduced based on 19 z b a b max z b a z b b the positive depths of particles a and b can be given by 20 h a max 0 z s a z b a b h b max 0 z s b z b a b the reconstructed depths h are used in eqs 13 to 15 to yield the riemann flux in eq 11 after performing the surface reconstruction the bed slope source term of a particle can be calculated as 21 s 0 a 2 b 1 b n v b z b a z b a b b a a ω ab a where z b a b z b a b δ z b and δ z b are defined as 22 if z b b z b a 0 δ z b max 0 z b a b z s a for h b 10 10 δ z b max 0 min z b b z b a z b a b z s a for h b 10 10 23 if z b b z b a 0 δ z b max 0

corrector is employed to perform the temporal integration of eq 10 monaghan 1994 the predictor step to obtain intermediate variables u a n 1 2 is shown in eq 24 while the corrector step to correct the intermediate variables to become u a n 1 2 is found in eq 25 the final variables without the mass source and sink term are calculated based on eq 26 24 u a n 1 2 u a n δ t 2 2 b 1 b n v b f a n f n c

step the superscript denotes the final variables without the mass source and sink term and the subscript indicates the intermediate variables from the predictor step when the depth is extremely shallow the instability caused by calculating the friction slope terms in the momentum components in eqs 24 and 25 will happen to resolve this problem an efficient implicit scheme with the analytical formulation proposed by xia and liang 2018 is adopted two vector variables of m a n and m a n 1 2 are first defined as eqs 27 and 28 then the variables u a n 1 2 and u a n 1 2 in the velocity

and λ δ t g n ma a 2 h a n 1 2 4 3 m x h a n 1 2 2 m y h a n 1 2 2 the time step size δ t is determined according to the courant friedrichs lewy cfl stability condition i e 31 δ t c c r min a l 0 u a

used to calculate the infiltration rate of a particle 33 i a d f a d t k s a 1 θ s a θ i a h c a h a f a where f is the cumulative infiltration depth k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity θ s and c are the saturated and initial volumetric water contents respectively and h c is the capillary suction head borrowing the idea of ni et al 2020 we perform a finite difference based temporal discretization of eq 33 to obtain 34 i a n 1 f a n 1 f a n δ t k s a 1 θ s a θ i a h c a h a n 1 f a n 1 then the discretized equation of i a n 1 f a n 1 f a n δ t from eq 34 applied to eq 32 can lead 35 h a n 1 h a n 1 δ t r a n 1 f a n f a n 1 next the substitution of eq 35 into eq 34 can yield the following quadratic equation 36 f a n 1 2 c 0 f a n 1 c 1 0 in which c 0 f a n k s a δ t 1 θ s a θ

1 is assumed to be zero if h a n 1 0 it is noted that the velocity components of u a n 1 and u a n 1 are identical while the depth components of u a n 1 and u a n 1 are equal only when the mass source and sink terms are not involved 2 6 boundary condition treatments in the proposed esph sw model one layer dummy particles are used to construct solid and inflow outflow boundary conditions the detailed procedure can be found in chang et al 2018 in all case studies the solid boundary condition is given as a slip boundary condition 3 results in this section eight 2d case studies including a still water test dam break flows over wet and dry beds and through a scaled model of the toce watershed an oscillation flow on a parabolic bed topography rainfall runoff flows on impermeable and permeable inclined planes and in the thies catchment are chosen to assess the performance of the proposed 2d esph sw model furthermore a mesh based shallow water model is established based on a cartesian uniform cell centered godunov type finite volume method toro 2001 to conduct a comparison between the meshless and mesh based shallow water models the hllc approximate riemann solver surface reconstruction method analytical friction slope term treatment and analytical green ampt infiltration model in the proposed 2d esph sw model are adopted in the established fv sw model numerical simulations were performed on an intel r core tm i7 8700 k cpu 3 70 ghz pc that was equipped with 16 gb of ram to evaluate the accuracy of the simulated results the relative root mean square error rrmse based on ϕ is chosen as eq 38 while the relative absolute error ε ϕ i based on ϕ is shown in eq 39 38 e ϕ 1 n e i n e ϕ i sim ϕ i ext mes 2 i n e ϕ i ext mes 2 39 ε ϕ i ϕ i sim ϕ i ext mes ϕ i ext mes where the spatial rrmse is given as n e is the number of recorded particles meshes at a fixed time while the temporal rrmse is obtained as n e is the number of recorded steps for a fixed particle mesh and the subscripts sim ext and mes denote the simulated exact and measured results respectively 3 1 analytical dam break flows 3 1 1 case 1 dam break flow over a wet bed an analytical dam break flow over a wet bed delestre et al 2013 is chosen as the first case study to show the accuracy and convergence of the proposed esph sw model for discontinuous problems the water depths of 0 005 m upstream x 5 m and 0 001 m downstream x 5 m are initially still in a smooth rectangular channel whose length and width are 10 m and 10 m respectively five particle spacings of 0 5 m 0 25 m 0 125 m 0 0625 m and 0 03125 m are used to calculate the convergence rates based on depth and velocity as 0 76 and 0 87 respectively fig 2 shows the simulated profiles of the depth and velocity based on the different particle spacings along the channel centerline at t 5 s as the particle spacing becomes finer the simulated depth profile and peak velocity are closer to the exact ones especially near the bore the spatial rrmses based on depth and velocity are 0 3 and 1 3 respectively for a particle spacing of 0 03125 m the simulated results show agreement with the exact solutions 3 1 2 case 2 dam break flow over a dry bed in the second case study the same channel of the first case study is used an initial upstream depth of 0 005 m is adopted to conduct a dam break flow over a dry bed delestre et al 2013 the convergence rate is calculated based on five particle spacings 0 5 m 0 25 m 0 125 m 0 0625 m and 0 03125 m the convergence rate of depth is 0 88 while the convergence rate of velocity is 1 03 the simulated profiles of the depth and velocity based on the different particle spacings along the channel centerline at t 5 s are shown in fig 3 the simulated and exact results are almost identical except for the underpredicted velocities near the advancing front which are also found in published works such as sanders 2001 ying and wang 2008 and yu and chang 2021 an advancing front with an extremely small depth is a strong discontinuity that usually causes numerical instability to damp out the instability the introduced numerical dissipation causes the velocity discrepancy the spatial rrmses based on depth and velocity are 0 2 and 1 7 respectively for a particle spacing of 0 03125 m based on the results of the first two case studies it can be demonstrated that the proposed esph sw model can yield first order accurate results for discontinuous dam break problems 3 2 case 3 oscillation flow on a parabolic bed topography a smooth parabolic bed topography is given by eq 40 in the third case study delestre et al 2013 to produce a periodic oscillation flow a water column with a depth and velocity such as eq 41 with t 0 s is initially placed on the bed a comparison of the efficiency and accuracy between the esph sw and fv sw models is performed in the case study the same particle and cell numbers of 250 000 l 0 0 008 m and a constant time step of 0 001 s are adopted to run a 3 t simulation fig 4 reveals the simulated surface levels along the centerline of y l 2 the predictions of both sw models are consistent with the exact solutions furthermore table 1 shows the required cpu time and the accuracy of both sw models the esph sw model requires twice as much cpu time as the fv sw model since the neighboring particles in esph are twice as many as the neighboring meshes in fv the spatial rrmses based on depth show that the esph sw based prediction is more accurate than the fv sw based prediction before 1 5 t however the fv sw model has less error after a time of 1 5 t it can be deduced that the fv sw model has better flux conservation than the esph sw model overall the esph sw model can address oscillation flow problems well 40 z 0 x y h 0 1 x l 2 2 y l 2

a rectangular laboratory channel with a length and width of 24 m and 0 196 m respectively consists of three bed planes with slopes of 0 020 0 015 and 0 010 in the downstream direction iwagaki 1995 manning s roughness coefficient is given at 0 01 three rainfall intensities including 389 230 and 288 cm h are prescribed on the upper middle and lower planes respectively to present spatially variable rainfall the measurement procedure is reported in iwagaki 1955 a particle spacing of 0 004 294000 particles and a maximum time step of 0 004 s are used to conduct three scenarios with different rainfall durations of 10 s 20 s and 30 s fig 5 shows the simulated unit discharge hydrographs the outlet unit discharges for the three durations quickly increase at approximately 25 s which is the required time of upstream flood arrival compared to the measured data obtained from iwagaki 1955 the time of occurrence of peak flow is delayed by approximately 5 s for the 10 s duration while the peak flow is overestimated by approximately 0 003 m2 s for the 20 s duration the temporal rrmses based on unit discharge are 4 6 2 5 and 1 2 for rainfall durations of 10 s 20 s and 30 s respectively in summary the simulated results are in close agreement with the measured results 3 5 case 6 rainfall runoff flow on a permeable plane the sixth case study was experimentally conducted by lima 1989 to present a rainfall runoff flow on a plane covered by loam we refer to lima 1989 for the experimental details the length width and longitudinal slope of the plane are equal to 1 m 0 5 m and 0 01 respectively to numerically reproduce the case by the proposed esph sw model the parameters k s of 1 67 10 6 θ s of 0 506 θ i of 0 0107 and h c of 0 3035 are prescribed in the green ampt infiltration model costabile et al 2021 the manning coefficient is given at 0 021 a total of 1250 particles particle spacing of 0 02 m and a maximum time step of 0 002 s are used to run a 1200 second simulation fig 6 shows the simulated unit discharge hydrograph at the outlet the proposed model provides a fairly good prediction of outlet unit discharge since the shape of the simulated hydrograph is similar to that of lima s measured hydrograph and the temporal rrmse based on discharge is 6 1 it can be demonstrated that the proposed esph sw model can be exploited to show rainfall runoff infiltration processes 3 6 case 7 dam break flow in a scaled model of the toce watershed in the seventh case study a 1 100 scale model of the toce watershed in italy established by morris 2000 is used to test the performance of the proposed model on dam break flows through complex topography fig 7 shows the topography of the scale model of the toce watershed the bed of the watershed is initially dry the incoming flow whose discharge and depth hydrographs are presented in fig 8 causes a dam break flow through the watershed a 180 s simulation is conducted with a particle spacing of 0 05 m 140985 particles and an average manning roughness coefficient of 0 0162 the simulated flow patterns at different times are shown in fig 9 the dam break flow reaches an island near the middle of the watershed at t 30 s then the island flooded at t 60 s and the flow starts to leave the watershed at t 90 s nine gauges p1 p4 p5 p9 p10 p19 p21 p23 p24 and p25 in fig 10 are used to check the accuracy against the measured data from morris 2000 fig 10 shows the temporal variations in the simulated surface levels at the nine gauges the temporal rrmses based on depth are 1 4 0 9 1 2 0 7 1 8 0 5 0 5 1 9 and 1 2 for gauges p1 p4 p5 p9 p10 p19 p21 p23 p24 and p25 respectively the simulated profiles agree with the measured profiles however the surface levels at gauges p23 and p24 are overestimated while those at gauge p1 are underestimated the differences may be caused by the real inflow direction which cannot be known overall the proposed esph sw model exhibits good predictions of dam break flows through a complex topography 3 7 case 8 rainfall runoff flows in the thies catchment the last case study is about the rainfall runoff experiments in the thies catchment of senegal reported by tatard et al 2008 and mügler et al 2011 in which detailed measurements can be found the bed topography of the catchment with a length of 10 m and a width of 4 m is shown in fig 11 the manning roughness coefficient is 0 02 the first scenario is a steady rainfall runoff flow that is generated by a constant effective rainfall intensity of 51 5 mm h as suggested by simons et al 2014 the proposed esph sw and the established fv sw simulations are both conducted the same numbers of particles and cells are given at 4141 i e a spatial resolution of 0 1 m while a maximum time step of 0 01 s is prescribed in both simulations the total simulation time is 900 s to reach a steady state for the scenario the locations of 62 gauges are shown in fig 11 fig 12 gives the comparison between the measured and simulated velocities the two sw models yield good predictions against the measured results the spatial rrmses based on velocity are 4 7 and 3 7 for the esph sw and fv sw models respectively furthermore fig 13 shows the distributions of the relative absolute error based on discharge ε vel for the esph sw model the numbers of ε vel 50 and ε vel 1 are 52 and 3 while for the fv sw model the numbers are 50 and 1 it can be said that the results obtained by the proposed esph sw model have slightly better quality the second scenario is an unsteady rainfall runoff flow generated by a rainfall hydrograph shown as the dash dot line in fig 14 the total rainfall time is 5100 s the same particle number and maximum time step in the simulation of the steady scenario are adopted in the proposed model to present the unsteady flow fig 14 shows the simulated hydrograph of discharge at the outlet for the unsteady scenario the simulated and measured results are consistent and the temporal rrmse based on discharge is 2 3 however the outlet discharge before approximately 800 s is not numerically captured this phenomenon was mentioned by simons et al 2014 a possible explanation is that the infiltration model used cannot reflect the surface coating effect based on the simulated results of the two scenarios it can be demonstrated that the proposed esph sw model has the capacity to handle real rainfall runoff problems 4 conclusion remarks in this study we proposed a novel eulerian sph sw model to resolve the difficulty of the traditional lagrangian sph sw model regarding overland flows induced by rain on a dry bed the proposed model is validated by eight case studies regarding a still water test dam break flows over wet and dry beds and through a scaled model of the toce watershed an oscillation flow on a parabolic bed topography rainfall runoff flows on impermeable and permeable inclined planes and in the thies catchment the simulated solutions show good agreement with respect to the exact measured and mesh based results although the proposed eulerian model introduces a numerical error from the discretization of the nonlinear convective terms the efficiency of the proposed model is significantly improved since neighbor searching is only performed once furthermore compared to the built fv sw model the proposed esph sw model yields more accurate predictions on nonflat topography problems while the built fv sw model gives slightly better flux conservation and efficiency the eight case studies demonstrate the success of the proposed esph sw model with first order convergence and a uniform cartesian particle arrangement further improvements to the existing esph sw model will be necessary including adaptive spatial resolution algorithms

1842,surfactant enhanced solubilization has been proven successful to remediate aquifers contaminated with non aqueous phase liquids dnapls understanding mass transfer from dnapls to the surfactant solution is highly important for improving remediation efficiency however the pore scale mechanisms underlying the effect of surfactants on mass transfer behaviors have not been fully understood here we use microfluidic experiments to investigate the fundamental physical processes and quantify the impacts of surfactants on mass transfer rate at the pore scale we find that surfactants can induce droplet breakup behaviors due to the interfacial disparity of mass transfer strength resulting in the subsequent micro movement of daughter blobs due to capillary force through image based measurements we find a significant inhibition of the mass transfer rates by surfactants at concentrations above the critical micelle concentration and the inhibition becomes more pronounced as the concentration increases which can be explained by an increase in stagnant film thickness but the total mass transfer flux is improved because of the enhanced driving force caused by the surfactant enhanced concentration gradient in light of the observed physical processes and the behavior of mass transfer inhibition we finally develop a new empirical model that explicitly considers the effects of surfactant concentration dnapl distribution effective interface area and flow rate to predict the mass transfer rate this work provides pore scale underpinnings of the mass transfer behaviors and a new mass transfer model considering the effect of surfactants which improves the understanding of interphase mass transfer processes under the action of surfactants in subsurface hydrological and

anthropogenic activities and accidental spills such as the recent spill of vinyl chloride a chlorinated hydrocarbon in ohio also belonging to the chlorinated hydrocarbon family trichloroethylene is reported to be a human carcinogen and can cause serious groundwater pollution stroo et al 2012 yuan et al 2014 pan et al 2020 trichloroethylene in the subsurface often exists as a dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl due to its very low solubility and high density compared to water soga et al 2004 after accidental spills or leaks dnapl migrates to deep aquifers and forms contaminant pools above the low permeability layers zheng et al 2015 during the downward migration under gravity dnapl can also be trapped in pores and fractures as discrete droplets or ganglia due to the capillary forces yang et al 2012 2013 the residual dnapl in the forms of droplets ganglia or pools can serve as long term contaminant sources and a small fraction of dnapl can pollute a large volume of the downstream aquifer ding et al 2022 which makes dnapl remediation valuable and important many in situ strategies such as pump and treat chemical oxidation surfactant cosolvent flushing nanoremediation thermal remediation and bioremediation have been studied applied to remediate dnapls mcguire et al 2006 li and hanlie 2008 stroo et al 2012 ahn et al 2016 liu et al 2020 inglis et al 2021 kong et al 2021 wang et al 2022 such schemes work by degrading most dnapl in the form of the dissolved compound while also directly degrading a small amount of the free phase dnapl but the very low dnapl solubility always causes limited pollutant concentration in the aqueous phase hence resulting in slow remediation and difficulty in complete removal one of the most efficient methods for improving remediation efficiency is to inject surfactant solutions into the subsurface at contaminated sites mulligan et al 2001 ramsburg et al 2005 cheng et al 2016 besha et al 2018 huo et al 2020 du et al 2022 surfactants containing both hydrophilic and lipophilic moieties prefer to accumulate at the energetically optimal two phase interface thus leading to a decrease in interfacial tension and dnapl mobilization which should be avoided because of its potential to contaminate previously clean zones johnson et al 1999 grimberg et al 1995 in the solutions with the content exceeding the critical micelle concentration cmc surfactant molecules tend to form micelles with the lipophilic moieties incorporating dnapl fraction inside and the micelles are hydrodynamically dispersed towards the aqueous bulk fig 1 which facilitates the dnapl solubilization and enhances the apparent dnapl solubility dejam 2019 but during surfactant enhanced dnapl solubilization a key question that must be addressed is how surfactants affect the mass transfer behavior and rate at the pore scale which helps to understand the fundamental physical processes and improve removal efficiency over the past few decades dnapl mass transfer processes and rates have been studied mostly by measuring the dissolved dnapl concentrations in column tank field experiments geller and hunt 1993 ji and brusseau 1998 bradford et al 1999 2003 schaerlaekens and feyen 2004 page et al 2007 russo et al 2009 agaoglu et al 2015 aydin sarikurt et al 2016 2017 luciano et al 2018 a common and typical approach for describing the nonequilibrium dnapl dissolution solubilization is the linear driving force model miller et al 1990 powers et al 1992 kokkinaki et al 2013b which can be described mathematically as 1 ρ φ s dnapl t k a s c s c k c s c where ρ m l3 is the density of the dnapl phase φ is the porosity of the media sdnapl is dnapl saturation cs m l3 is dnapl equilibrium solubility c m l3 is the dissolved dnapl concentration and k is mass transfer rate coefficient which combines the mass transfer coefficient k and the specific interfacial area as k kas a number of phenomenological models have been developed and evaluated for predicting mass transfer rate in the form of dimensionless sherwood numbers which were found to be affected by dnapl saturation groundwater velocity molecular diffusivity etc powers et al 1994 imhoff et al 1994 mason and kueper 1996 kennedy and lennox 1997 mayer et al 1999 saba and illangasekare 2000 taylor et al 2001 nambi and powers 2003 kokkinaki et al 2013a luciano et al 2018 ramezanzadeh et al 2020 however to the best of our knowledge few models have directly quantified the effect of surfactants on dnapl aqueous mass transfer either enhancement or inhibition accurate prediction of mass transfer requires a clear physical understanding of interphase mass transfer behavior at the pore scale but it is difficult to observe the evolving interfaces and multiphase flow dynamics through column tank field experiments for example missing interfacial area and imprecision in dnapl saturation can result in large uncertainties in the mass transfer parameters eq 1 limited experimental works that attempt to quantify the interfacial areas or and dnapl saturations during dnapl remediation by water surfactant nanoparticles cosolvent have been reported based on microfluidic techniques magnetic resonance imaging or x ray micro computed tomography zhong et al 2001 zhang et al 2002 chomsurin and werth 2003 cho et al 2005 corapcioglu et al 2009 bahar et al 2018 khasi et al 2020 ramezanzadeh et al 2020 hu et al 2021 yang et al 2022 among them the microfluidic techniques can enable characterization of pore scale mass transfer behaviors and accurate calculation of mass transfer rate coefficients by quantifying morphological changes however accurate prediction of dnapl mass transfer under the action of surfactants based on the physical understanding of pore scale interphase mass transfer behavior has not been systematically investigated in this work we systematically study the pore scale dnapl mass transfer behaviors and rates during surfactant enhanced dnapl remediation firstly we set up a microfluidic visualization system which enables direct observation of the pore scale mass transfer process during dnapl remediation secondly we characterize the evolving phase structure and quantify dnapl droplet size morphology saturation and interface thirdly we investigate the pore scale mass transfer behaviors during dnapl dissolution solubilization under various surfactant concentrations and flow rates and discuss the fundamental physical processes at the pore scale finally we propose an empirical model of mass transfer rate considering the impacts of dnapl distribution flow rate effective interfacial area and surfactant concentration 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and experimental setup trichloroethylene tce sigma aldrich chemical acs reagent 99 5 was selected as a representative dnapl the colorless tce was dyed with oil red o which is an organic soluble azo dye and has no discernible effect on tce remediation at the concentration of 0 1 g l conrad et al 2002 alazaiza et al 2020 the properties of tce are listed in table 1 polyoxyethylene 20 sorbitan monooleate tween 80 sigma aldrich chemical is selected as a representative nonionic surfactant because of its ability to induce significant solubilization without any mobilization the molecular weight and critical micelle concentration cmc of tween 80 at 25 c are 1310 g mol and 13 mg l respectively the tween 80 solutions were prepared with deionized di water at desired concentrations we set up an experimental system to visualize the dnapl solubilization process the experimental system consists of a microfluidic chip a syringe pump a light emitting diode led light a camera and a computer fig 2 a to represent the pore structure of real rocks the section morphology of real sandstones was used as the flow geometry of the microfluidic chips fig 2b the microfluidic chip was formed by bonding two transparent glass plates schott b270 one of which was etched with hydrofluoric acid to obtain the desired flow geometry the properties of the microfluidic chips are listed in table 1 to record spatial distribution and temporal evolution of the phase structure during the surfactant enhanced dnapl solubilization the led light and the cmos camera g3 xc30 c4095 dalsa with a macro lens af s micro nikkor 40 mm f 2 8g nikon were mounted below and above the microfluidic chip respectively during each experiment a series of high resolution 2048 3344 pixels images of the horizontally positioned microfluidic chip were captured at a frame rate per sec fps of 0 06 the syringe pump phd ultra 70 3007 harvard apparatus was used to inject di water tce or tween 80 solutions from left to right at a constant injection rate q 2 2 experimental procedures the microfluidic chips were initially saturated with di water in a vacuum tce dnapl was then injected into the microfluidic chip q 0 1 μl min until the maximum tce saturation subsequently di water was injected into the microfluidic chip q 20 μl min to displace mobile tce and establish an initial point where the tce blobs were trapped and immobile sdnapl 6 the preparations mimic the conditions in a real contamination source zone containing residual dnapl the di water was saturated with tce to eliminate tce dissolution during the entrapment stage after the preparations the tween 80 solutions with different concentrations were injected into the microfluidic chips a total of 16 experiments were performed with an injection volume of 360 μl per experiment corresponding to 120 pore volumes pv the detailed operations of the experiments are shown in table 2 the temperature of the experimental system was controlled at 22 c 0 5 c by an air conditioner and the images were recorded by the cmos camera 2 3 image processing the tce was dyed red to distinguish the different fluid phases which helps identify the interfaces among the dnapl phase the aqueous phase and the solid phase an image processing algorithm was developed in matlab to calculate dnapl saturation quantify the geometrics of dnapl blobs analyze the interfaces and characterize dnapl solubilization the image processing scheme is shown in fig 3 a firstly the original rgb images are adjusted to reference images with uniform light intensity and size secondly the pixels representing the dnapl phase are identified as red according to the differences in the rgb value ranges of each phase fig 3b the pixels of the flow domain are obtained from the image of the microfluidic chip saturated with tce dyed red fig 3b therefore the dnapl saturation of each image can be calculated as the ratio of the number of dnapl pixels to the number of flow domain pixels thirdly the dnapl blobs geometrics is quantified based on the built in regionprops script of matlab fourthly the interfaces between the dnapl phase and the aqueous phase are determined according to the distances from dnapl pixels to the solid phase and the aqueous phase further details about the interface calculation are shown in supporting information si text s1 2 4 mass transfer calculation the dnapl saturation can be easily obtained based on the image processing algorithm the lumped mass transfer rate coefficient k and the mass transfer coefficient k can be calculated from eq 2 3 2 k ρ φ c s c s dnapl t 3 k ρ φ a s c s c s dnapl t where the dnapl concentration c can be calculated as the mass of dnapl reduction due to dissolution solubilization divided by the total volume of the injected aqueous phase the tce dnapl equilibrium solubility cs in tween 80 solution depends on the tween 80 concentration and their high correlation r2 0 987 at 22 c has been found by schaerlaekens et al 2000 the cs and c can be expressed as 4 c s 26 414 c tween 0 971 5 c ρ tce v s dnapl q t where c tween is the weight percentage of tween 80 ρ tce m l3 is the density of tce v l3 is the pore volume of the microfluidic chip q l3 t is the injection rate of tween 80 solution the specific interfacial area as 1 l is the dnapl aqueous phase interface area per unit pore volume of the microfluidic chip we also use a normalized interfacial area ai 1 l defined as the dnapl aqueous phase interface area per unit volume of dnapl phase therefore as and ai can be calculated as 6 a s l dnapl q h v 7 a i l dnapl q h v s dnapl where l dnapl q l is the length of the dnapl aqueous phase interface and h l is the etched depth of the microfluidic chip the mass transfer rate obtained from dnapl solubilization experiment is often expressed as the dimensionless form of the modified sherwood number which is defined as 8 s h k l 2 d m where l l is the characteristic length of the porous medium which is equal to the mean grain radius dm l2 t is the dnapl molecular diffusivity in the aqueous phase 3 results and discussion 3 1 pore scale evolution of dnapl solubilization the evolving phase structure during dnapl solubilization was captured in the experiments with different surfactant concentrations and the high resolution images are shown in fig 4 q 4 μl min the dnapl desaturation curves are shown in fig 5 according to the observation covering the entire microfluidic chip fig 4 the tween 80 surfactant causes significant dnapl solubilization without any dnapl mobilization during the entire injection duration which favors dnapl remediation as this protects the previously clean zone from contamination by dnapl redistribution at the end of the injection 120 pv the aqueous phase containing tween 80 dissolves all the residual dnapl while the di water only dissolves around 50 dnapl figs 5 and 6 indicating that tween 80 greatly increases the apparent solubility of dnapl on the other hand the dnapl dissolution evolution in di water experiment 0 wt in fig 4 shows the dnapl blobs trapped in the upstream half of the microfluidic chip are almost completely dissolved whereas the dnapl blobs in the downstream half are hardly dissolved even by the end of injection 120 pv the dnapl blobs in the downstream are difficult to dissolve because the flowing aqueous phase reaches easily as it dissolves the dnapl in the upstream the dissolution variability in different parts of the micromodel is not observed in tween 80 experiments because the large apparent solubility of dnapl in tween 80 solution results in an unsaturated concentration across the domain which is also responsible for the faster dissolution than by di water figs 5 and 6 the effect of tween 80 concentration on dnapl solubilization is evident in fig 4 according to the slopes of dnapl desaturation curves in fig 5 the higher surfactant concentrations result in the better dnapl solubilization or faster dissolution the linear driving force model representing interphase mass transfer in eq 1 shows that the mass transfer flux is proportional to the dnapl concentration difference and the mass transfer rate coefficient the tce dnapl equilibrium solubility is proportional to the tween 80 concentration with a scaling factor over 26 schaerlaekens et al 2000 so the dnapl concentration difference can be greatly enlarged by improving the tween 80 content explaining the better dnapl solubilization the mass transfer rate coefficient may also play a role in dnapl solubilization which will be discussed in section 3 3 the coupled effect of surfactant concentration and injection rate on dnapl solubilization was also investigated and their dnapl desaturation curves are shown in fig 6 fig 6a shows that the higher tween 80 content causes better dnapl solubilization regardless of the injection rate and that the tween 80 solutions are much better than di water for dnapl dissolution on the other hand tween 80 solutions with different injection rates cause similar dissolution rates fig 6b implying a weak effect of injection rate on dnapl solubilization therefore from a practical and economic perspective multiple injections of the aqueous phase with high tween 80 content may be an option worth considering during dnapl remediation 3 2 mass transfer behavior during dnapl solubilization close inspection of dnapl distribution can provide detailed information on mass transfer behavior during dnapl solubilization the partially enlarged images fig 7 show different mass transfer behaviors during dnapl dissolution by di water and dnapl solubilization by tween 80 solution mass transfer in di water flooding hardly changes the morphology of dnapl blobs showing an overall shrinkage until complete dissolution and dnapl blobs in the hydraulically less accessible areas are difficult to dissolve completely 0 wt in fig 7 the phenomenon suggests the mass transfer rates are similar along the dnapl aqueous phase interface of trapped blob in contrast the difference in mass transfer rates on the dnapl aqueous phase interface induces the morphological change of dnapl blobs during tween 80 solution flooding 2 8 wt in fig 7 what is more the breakup behavior of dnapl ganglia and long droplets is observed during the tween 80 enhanced dnapl solubilization 2 8 wt in fig 7 unlike the transient droplet breakup in surfactant enhanced dnapl mobilization zhong et al 2001 the breakup behavior in dnapl solubilization is the result of a combination of viscous force capillary force and chemical force mass transfer and micellar solubilization during the mass transfer of a dnapl droplet to the aqueous phase strong convection causes the rapid dnapl solubilization whereas weak convection or diffusion causes slow dnapl dissolution therefore the disparity of the mass transfer strength induces the rapid retreat of the dnapl boundary around some parts of the interface and the almost stationary dnapl boundary around the other parts when the disparity of the mass transfer strength intensifies sufficiently to break the force equilibrium the droplet breaks into several smaller daughter blobs meanwhile the flow field in the porous medium undergoes abrupt change and the small daughter blobs prefer to move toward the narrow pore throat due to the higher capillary force than viscous force 2 8 wt in fig 7 it should be pointed out that the slight movements of daughter blobs around several adjacent pores do not create new contamination of previously clean pores and the blobs are dissolved completely later 2 8 wt in fig 7 in addition the earlier droplet breakup behavior and the faster micro movement of dnapl daughter blobs are found in the experiment with higher tween 80 content which corresponds to the more pronounced solubilization overall the strong concentration gradient due to the high equilibrium solubility and the droplet breakup behavior due to the difference in mass transfer strength greatly promote dnapl solubilization in the tween 80 experiments from the perspective of pore scale physics the geometric parameters of dnapl blobs help quantify the mass transfer and solubilization evolution the mean geometric blob length is similar for different experiments at the beginning of the experiments see fig 8 a as the injection processes the mean blob lengths in tween 80 experiments decrease and reach zero before 80 pv which corresponds well to the solubilization evolution fig 5 the standard deviation of the geometric blob lengths also decreases with the injection volume fig 8a implying the droplet breakup behavior and complete dissolution of dnapl blobs in contrast the mean blob length in the di water experiments exhibits only a slight decline and a consistently large variation fig 8a indicating the limited mass transfer and the spatial variability in dissolution which also corresponds well to the dnapl desaturation curves fig 6 the dnapl aqueous phase interfacial lengths show the similar evolution to dnapl blob lengths in tween 80 experiments and they decrease much faster than that in the di water experiment fig 8 furthermore the higher the tween 80 content the faster declines of blob length and interfacial length and the more efficient dnapl solubilization fig 8 the mass transfer rate depends on the mass transfer coefficient and the dnapl aqueous phase interface area and the specific interfacial area as is often used to represent the total interface area fig 9 a b shows that tween 80 significantly alters as than di water and the better performance by higher tween 80 content is consistent with the images desaturation curves and blob lengths figs 5 6 and 9 here from a pore scale perspective the interfacial area ai is used as a more suitable parameter to reflect the morphology and distribution of dnapl and may be a better representative of the effective mass transfer interface area than as fig 9c d shows that ai increases as the injection progresses and rises sharply near the complete dissolution because the saturation becomes small the higher tween 80 content the earlier ai sharp rise echoing the earlier droplet breakup and stronger solubilization the effect of flushing rates on mass transfer is shown in fig 9 at 20 pv the decrease in as is around 80 and 95 for injection rates of 4 μl min and 0 5 μl min respectively but the former requires only 1 8 of the flushing time of the latter for the same injection volume the lower ai values for high injection rates indicate the insufficient contact time fig 9c d which may result in the ineffectiveness and waste of tween 80 surfactant because of flow bypass without exposure to dnapl contaminants therefore a high tween 80 content and a low injection rate may be preferred for dnapl solubilization during practical dnapl remediation 3 3 mass transfer rate during dnapl solubilization based on image processing the mass transfer rate coefficients at different dnapl saturations were calculated and shown in fig 10 regardless of the injection rate as the dnapl saturation decreases the interphase mass transfer rate coefficient k decreases due to the decreasing specific interfacial area as during dnapl dissolution by di water fig 10 unexpectedly the mass transfer rate coefficient k caused by tween 80 is much smaller than that of di water during almost the entire dnapl dissolution solubilization process and the inhibition of k is more pronounced in the experiment with higher tween 80 content fig 10 the k is a lumped parameter proportional to the mass transfer coefficient k and the specific interfacial area as k kas while the stagnant film model of interphase mass transfer shows k is the ratio of molecular diffusion coefficient dm to the film thickness δ and as is the ratio of interface area to the media volume miller et al 1990 even for the similar as values at the beginning of the experiments increasing the tween 80 content still causes a decrease in k which is much smaller than that for di water fig 10a hence the k inhibition can only be attributed to the decline of mass transfer coefficient k tween 80 surfactant containing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups prefer to accumulate at the interface between dnapl and aqueous phase and micelles are preferentially formed around the interface when the surfactant concentration is higher than cmc value both of which greatly increase the stagnant film thickness and thus lead to a decrease in k and k the higher the tween 80 content the thicker the stagnant film and the smaller the k and k value nevertheless the total mass transfer flux in tween 80 experiments is enhanced due to the increased apparent solubility concentration the enhanced mass transfer along with k inhibition is also found in other surfactant enhanced dnapl remediation systems johnson et al 1999 which can also be explained by the increased thickness of the stagnant film for most tween 80 experiments the mass transfer rate coefficient k generally decreases as dnapl saturation decreases and reaches zero at complete dissolution but for a few curves in fig 10a d it is interesting that the k value increases slightly at the beginning of injection this phenomenon may be qualitatively explained from dnapl mass transfer behavior and initial phase structure at the beginning of dnapl solubilization the initial phase structure provides a limited effective mass transfer interface ai then the surfactant induced droplet breakup behavior increases the effective interface leading to the short term increase of mass transfer rate after the formation of a stable phase structure the decreasing dnapl saturation and the decreasing total mass transfer interface as mainly contribute to the decline of k the higher k values in the experiments with faster injections are also evident regardless of the tween 80 concentration fig 10 suggesting faster mass transfer the mass transfer coefficient k values in various experiments versus the dnapl saturation sdnapl are shown in fig 11 the overall trends of the k sdnapl curves are similar to that of the k sdnapl curves but the variation of k values is more drastic because of the differences in the specific interfacial area at different dissolution periods most of the k values in tween 80 experiments are smaller than those in the di water experiments and the smaller k values are found in the experiments with higher tween 80 concentrations fig 11 which is also found in phenanthrene dissolution by six nonionic surfactants grimberg et al 1995 and may be attributed to the rate limiting diffusion of micelles across the stagnant film however some k values in fig 11a b d are larger than the k values at the same dnapl saturation in the di water experiments indicating the weak mass transfer in the relatively stable period of late dnapl dissolution generally the higher k values are also found in the higher injection rate experiments the interfacial area ai reflecting effective mass transfer interface versus the dnapl saturation sdnapl are shown in fig 12 different from the evolutions of k values and k values the ai values show continuous increases as sdnapl decreases regardless of the tween 80 concentration and injection rate this trend can be well fitted with power law functions fig 12 the slow increase of ai values in the early dnapl solubilization is mainly due to the droplet breakup and gradual homogenization of droplet morphology while the sharp rise of ai is due to the small sdnapl generally the smaller ai values in the experiments with higher injection rates are evident during dnapl dissolution solubilization fig 12 reflecting the faster mass transfer fig 10 based on the data from all 16 experiments fig 12e an empirical equation characterizing the ai evolution during surfactant enhanced dnapl solubilization is established 9 a i 71 37 s dnapl 0 17 3 4 mass transfer model of dnapl solubilization according to the discussion above the mass transfer during surfactant enhanced dnapl solubilization is affected by the mass transfer behavior the effective interface the complex phase structure the surfactant concentration and the flow field here dnapl saturation can be regarded as a comprehensive indicator reflecting phase structure and effective interface see eq 9 the surfactant weight ratio csf and reynolds number re are selected as the measures for surfactant inhibition effect and pore water velocity respectively re can be calculated as 10 re v aq l ν aq where the pore water velocity v aq l t can be simply calculated as v aq q darcy φ 1 s dnapl ν aq l2 t is the viscosity of the aqueous phase which is composition dependent and can be calculated as guarnaccia et al 1997 11 log ν aq c s ρ dnapl log ν dnapl 1 c s ρ dnapl log ν w where ρ dnapl m l3 is dnapl density c s m l3 is dnapl equilibrium solubility ν dnapl and ν w l2 t are viscosities of dnapl and di water respectively based on the results of experiments with various surfactant contents and injection rates an empirical model suitable for surfactant enhanced dnapl solubilization is developed where the dimensionless modified sherwood number representing the mass transfer rate is as follows 12 s h 0 36 s dnapl 0 812 r e 0 492 c sf 1 684 590 61 the positive exponents of sdnapl and re indicate the dependence of mass transfer rate on dnapl saturation and water flow velocity while the negative exponent of csf demonstrates the surfactant inhibition effect fig 13 a shows an overall good fit of the mass transfer sherwood correlation for the 12 surfactant flushing experiments with 92 of the measured values falling within a factor of 1 3 of the estimated value the model is also validated against other experimental results such as those from cosolvents napl flushing experiments in porous media yaksi et al 2021 fig 13b shows that the proposed mass transfer model has an overall good prediction for the ethanol dichlorobenzene flushing system but the study by yang et al 2022 shows that ethanol may enhance the mass transfer from tetrachloroethene to cosolvent solutions therefore the effectiveness of the proposed model also depends on the types of surfactants cosolvents and dnapls which may have various chemical effects on dnapl mass transfer a comparison of mass transfer empirical models for surfactant enhanced dnapl solubilization at various scales is shown in table 3 this comparison indicates that dnapl aqueous mass transfer behaviors and rates may also be dependent on the spatial scale fig 14 shows a comparison of different dnapl solubilization predictions as a function of re a major difference between the empirical model proposed in this work and the sherwood correlations by other researchers is the introduction of the variable csf which is used to account for the inhibitory effect of surfactants on dnapl mass transfer in the tce tween 80 systems schaerlaekens et al 2000 and schaerlaekens and feyen 2004 this work the exponents are close for both θdnapl and re which illustrates similar dependences of mass transfer on saturation and water flow velocity in the same dnapl surfactant systems regardless the scales the large differences in proportion parameters 0 26 0 63 and 6 254 in the three models above can cause large differences in mass transfer rates which are attributed to the spatial scale but are vital for designing field remediation so upscaling studies on dnapl mass transfer prediction are needed to optimize aquifer remediation saenton and illangasekare 2007 for the same surfactant tween 80 changing the type of chlorinated hydrocarbon from tce to pce does not cause a substantial change in the exponent of θdnapl and re cf 0 712 and 0 712 in rathfelder et al 2001 but for the same dnapl tce different surfactant causes a significant change in the correlation parameter of θdnapl and re cf 1 15 and 1 04 as in mayer et al 1999 generally the effectiveness of sherwood correlations depends on the form of the empirical model as well as the experimental conditions scales surfactants dnapls with models derived from larger scale experiments predicting lower mass transfer rates 2 d tank experiments 1 d column experiments microfluidic experiments fig 14 4 summary and conclusions although numerous studies on mass transfer have been performed at column and field scales the challenges in optimizing surfactant enhanced dnapl dissolution solubilization remediation remain due to the knowledge gap in the effects of surfactants on interphase mass transfer behaviors and rates at the pore scale the present study focuses on characterizing the fundamental mass transfer behaviors revealing the effect of surfactants and predicting the mass transfer rates during surfactant enhanced dnapl remediation relying on a series of microfluidic experiments that allow real time observation of phase structures in a 2 d micromodel the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 during the surfactant enhanced dnapl remediation we clearly observe the droplet breakup behavior caused by the disparity of the mass transfer strength along dnapl aqueous interface and the subsequent interface adjustment due to capillary force both of which are the result of a combination of viscous force capillary force and chemical force mass transfer and micellar solubilization and are mechanistically significantly different from the transient droplet breakup followed by mobilization that caused by surfactant reduced interfacial tension 2 the surfactant with a concentration above cmc distinctly reduces the mass transfer rate coefficient k and the inhibition is more pronounced as surfactant concentration increases but the total mass transfer flux is improved because of the enhanced driving force or concentration gradient resulting from enhanced dnapl equilibrium solubility the decline of k is due to the increase in stagnant film thickness decrease in mass transfer coefficient k because surfactant molecules prefer to accumulate at the interface and micelles are preferentially formed at the interface 3 based on microfluidic visualization experiments we develop a new empirical model of mass transfer rate evolution considering the impacts of surfactant concentration dnapl distribution effective interface and flow rate the model explicitly considers the surfactant inhibition effect and distinguishes itself from the previous mass transfer correlations even though the effects of surfactants on pore scale mass transfer processes and rates have been systematically investigated and a new empirical sherwood type of correlation of mass transfer has been proposed in light of the observed pore scale behavior of droplet breakup and inhibition of surfactants on mass transfer it should be noted that there are also disadvantages limitations of this work to further understand the physical mechanism of interphase mass transfer more systematic and dedicated studies across scales may be required to transfer the understanding of pore scale physical processes and the effects of surfactants on mass transfer to field scale applications careful upscaling studies are needed overall this work contributes to the understanding of interphase mass transfer processes that occur widely in the soil and groundwater environment and subsurface engineering activities such as geological storage of co2 tong et al 2013 our work has elucidated the pore scale physics of interphase mass transfer during dnapl remediation and has probed the effects of surfactant concentration dnapl distribution effective interface and flow rate on dnapl dissolution solubilization which can be combined with additional treatment technologies e g adding oxidants or nanoparticles to further elevate remediation efficiency the new empirical model can provide an alternative in predicting mass transfer rate during surfactant enhanced dnapl remediation and can also serve as a reference for studying various mass transfer processes involving surfactants in similar working environments credit authorship contribution statement

1842,surfactant enhanced solubilization has been proven successful to remediate aquifers contaminated with non aqueous phase liquids dnapls understanding mass transfer from dnapls to the surfactant solution is highly important for improving remediation efficiency however the pore scale mechanisms underlying the effect of surfactants on mass transfer behaviors have not been fully understood here we use microfluidic experiments to investigate the fundamental physical processes and quantify the impacts of surfactants on mass transfer rate at the pore scale we find that surfactants can induce droplet breakup behaviors due to the interfacial disparity of mass transfer strength resulting in the subsequent micro movement of daughter blobs due to capillary force through image based measurements we find a significant inhibition of the mass transfer rates by surfactants at concentrations above the critical micelle concentration and the inhibition becomes more pronounced as the concentration increases which can be explained by an increase in stagnant film thickness but the total mass transfer flux is improved because of the enhanced driving force caused by the surfactant enhanced concentration gradient in light of the observed physical processes and the behavior of mass transfer inhibition we finally develop a new empirical model that explicitly considers the effects of surfactant concentration dnapl distribution effective interface area and flow rate to predict the mass transfer rate this work provides pore scale underpinnings of the mass transfer behaviors and a new mass transfer model considering the effect of surfactants which improves the understanding of interphase mass transfer processes under the action of surfactants in subsurface hydrological and

anthropogenic activities and accidental spills such as the recent spill of vinyl chloride a chlorinated hydrocarbon in ohio also belonging to the chlorinated hydrocarbon family trichloroethylene is reported to be a human carcinogen and can cause serious groundwater pollution stroo et al 2012 yuan et al 2014 pan et al 2020 trichloroethylene in the subsurface often exists as a dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl due to its very low solubility and high density compared to water soga et al 2004 after accidental spills or leaks dnapl migrates to deep aquifers and forms contaminant pools above the low permeability layers zheng et al 2015 during the downward migration under gravity dnapl can also be trapped in pores and fractures as discrete droplets or ganglia due to the capillary forces yang et al 2012 2013 the residual dnapl in the forms of droplets ganglia or pools can serve as long term contaminant sources and a small fraction of dnapl can pollute a large volume of the downstream aquifer ding et al 2022 which makes dnapl remediation valuable and important many in situ strategies such as pump and treat chemical oxidation surfactant cosolvent flushing nanoremediation thermal remediation and bioremediation have been studied applied to remediate dnapls mcguire et al 2006 li and hanlie 2008 stroo et al 2012 ahn et al 2016 liu et al 2020 inglis et al 2021 kong et al 2021 wang et al 2022 such schemes work by degrading most dnapl in the form of the dissolved compound while also directly degrading a small amount of the free phase dnapl but the very low dnapl solubility always causes limited pollutant concentration in the aqueous phase hence resulting in slow remediation and difficulty in complete removal one of the most efficient methods for improving remediation efficiency is to inject surfactant solutions into the subsurface at contaminated sites mulligan et al 2001 ramsburg et al 2005 cheng et al 2016 besha et al 2018 huo et al 2020 du et al 2022 surfactants containing both hydrophilic and lipophilic moieties prefer to accumulate at the energetically optimal two phase interface thus leading to a decrease in interfacial tension and dnapl mobilization which should be avoided because of its potential to contaminate previously clean zones johnson et al 1999 grimberg et al 1995 in the solutions with the content exceeding the critical micelle concentration cmc surfactant molecules tend to form micelles with the lipophilic moieties incorporating dnapl fraction inside and the micelles are hydrodynamically dispersed towards the aqueous bulk fig 1 which facilitates the dnapl solubilization and enhances the apparent dnapl solubility dejam 2019 but during surfactant enhanced dnapl solubilization a key question that must be addressed is how surfactants affect the mass transfer behavior and rate at the pore scale which helps to understand the fundamental physical processes and improve removal efficiency over the past few decades dnapl mass transfer processes and rates have been studied mostly by measuring the dissolved dnapl concentrations in column tank field experiments geller and hunt 1993 ji and brusseau 1998 bradford et al 1999 2003 schaerlaekens and feyen 2004 page et al 2007 russo et al 2009 agaoglu et al 2015 aydin sarikurt et al 2016 2017 luciano et al 2018 a common and typical approach for describing the nonequilibrium dnapl dissolution solubilization is the linear driving force model miller et al 1990 powers et al 1992 kokkinaki et al 2013b which can be described mathematically as 1 ρ φ s dnapl t k a s c s c k c s c where ρ m l3 is the density of the dnapl phase φ is the porosity of the media sdnapl is dnapl saturation cs m l3 is dnapl equilibrium solubility c m l3 is the dissolved dnapl concentration and k is mass transfer rate coefficient which combines the mass transfer coefficient k and the specific interfacial area as k kas a number of phenomenological models have been developed and evaluated for predicting mass transfer rate in the form of dimensionless sherwood numbers which were found to be affected by dnapl saturation groundwater velocity molecular diffusivity etc powers et al 1994 imhoff et al 1994 mason and kueper 1996 kennedy and lennox 1997 mayer et al 1999 saba and illangasekare 2000 taylor et al 2001 nambi and powers 2003 kokkinaki et al 2013a luciano et al 2018 ramezanzadeh et al 2020 however to the best of our knowledge few models have directly quantified the effect of surfactants on dnapl aqueous mass transfer either enhancement or inhibition accurate prediction of mass transfer requires a clear physical understanding of interphase mass transfer behavior at the pore scale but it is difficult to observe the evolving interfaces and multiphase flow dynamics through column tank field experiments for example missing interfacial area and imprecision in dnapl saturation can result in large uncertainties in the mass transfer parameters eq 1 limited experimental works that attempt to quantify the interfacial areas or and dnapl saturations during dnapl remediation by water surfactant nanoparticles cosolvent have been reported based on microfluidic techniques magnetic resonance imaging or x ray micro computed tomography zhong et al 2001 zhang et al 2002 chomsurin and werth 2003 cho et al 2005 corapcioglu et al 2009 bahar et al 2018 khasi et al 2020 ramezanzadeh et al 2020 hu et al 2021 yang et al 2022 among them the microfluidic techniques can enable characterization of pore scale mass transfer behaviors and accurate calculation of mass transfer rate coefficients by quantifying morphological changes however accurate prediction of dnapl mass transfer under the action of surfactants based on the physical understanding of pore scale interphase mass transfer behavior has not been systematically investigated in this work we systematically study the pore scale dnapl mass transfer behaviors and rates during surfactant enhanced dnapl remediation firstly we set up a microfluidic visualization system which enables direct observation of the pore scale mass transfer process during dnapl remediation secondly we characterize the evolving phase structure and quantify dnapl droplet size morphology saturation and interface thirdly we investigate the pore scale mass transfer behaviors during dnapl dissolution solubilization under various surfactant concentrations and flow rates and discuss the fundamental physical processes at the pore scale finally we propose an empirical model of mass transfer rate considering the impacts of dnapl distribution flow rate effective interfacial area and surfactant concentration 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and experimental setup trichloroethylene tce sigma aldrich chemical acs reagent 99 5 was selected as a representative dnapl the colorless tce was dyed with oil red o which is an organic soluble azo dye and has no discernible effect on tce remediation at the concentration of 0 1 g l conrad et al 2002 alazaiza et al 2020 the properties of tce are listed in table 1 polyoxyethylene 20 sorbitan monooleate tween 80 sigma aldrich chemical is selected as a representative nonionic surfactant because of its ability to induce significant solubilization without any mobilization the molecular weight and critical micelle concentration cmc of tween 80 at 25 c are 1310 g mol and 13 mg l respectively the tween 80 solutions were prepared with deionized di water at desired concentrations we set up an experimental system to visualize the dnapl solubilization process the experimental system consists of a microfluidic chip a syringe pump a light emitting diode led light a camera and a computer fig 2 a to represent the pore structure of real rocks the section morphology of real sandstones was used as the flow geometry of the microfluidic chips fig 2b the microfluidic chip was formed by bonding two transparent glass plates schott b270 one of which was etched with hydrofluoric acid to obtain the desired flow geometry the properties of the microfluidic chips are listed in table 1 to record spatial distribution and temporal evolution of the phase structure during the surfactant enhanced dnapl solubilization the led light and the cmos camera g3 xc30 c4095 dalsa with a macro lens af s micro nikkor 40 mm f 2 8g nikon were mounted below and above the microfluidic chip respectively during each experiment a series of high resolution 2048 3344 pixels images of the horizontally positioned microfluidic chip were captured at a frame rate per sec fps of 0 06 the syringe pump phd ultra 70 3007 harvard apparatus was used to inject di water tce or tween 80 solutions from left to right at a constant injection rate q 2 2 experimental procedures the microfluidic chips were initially saturated with di water in a vacuum tce dnapl was then injected into the microfluidic chip q 0 1 μl min until the maximum tce saturation subsequently di water was injected into the microfluidic chip q 20 μl min to displace mobile tce and establish an initial point where the tce blobs were trapped and immobile sdnapl 6 the preparations mimic the conditions in a real contamination source zone containing residual dnapl the di water was saturated with tce to eliminate tce dissolution during the entrapment stage after the preparations the tween 80 solutions with different concentrations were injected into the microfluidic chips a total of 16 experiments were performed with an injection volume of 360 μl per experiment corresponding to 120 pore volumes pv the detailed operations of the experiments are shown in table 2 the temperature of the experimental system was controlled at 22 c 0 5 c by an air conditioner and the images were recorded by the cmos camera 2 3 image processing the tce was dyed red to distinguish the different fluid phases which helps identify the interfaces among the dnapl phase the aqueous phase and the solid phase an image processing algorithm was developed in matlab to calculate dnapl saturation quantify the geometrics of dnapl blobs analyze the interfaces and characterize dnapl solubilization the image processing scheme is shown in fig 3 a firstly the original rgb images are adjusted to reference images with uniform light intensity and size secondly the pixels representing the dnapl phase are identified as red according to the differences in the rgb value ranges of each phase fig 3b the pixels of the flow domain are obtained from the image of the microfluidic chip saturated with tce dyed red fig 3b therefore the dnapl saturation of each image can be calculated as the ratio of the number of dnapl pixels to the number of flow domain pixels thirdly the dnapl blobs geometrics is quantified based on the built in regionprops script of matlab fourthly the interfaces between the dnapl phase and the aqueous phase are determined according to the distances from dnapl pixels to the solid phase and the aqueous phase further details about the interface calculation are shown in supporting information si text s1 2 4 mass transfer calculation the dnapl saturation can be easily obtained based on the image processing algorithm the lumped mass transfer rate coefficient k and the mass transfer coefficient k can be calculated from eq 2 3 2 k ρ φ c s c s dnapl t 3 k ρ φ a s c s c s dnapl t where the dnapl concentration c can be calculated as the mass of dnapl reduction due to dissolution solubilization divided by the total volume of the injected aqueous phase the tce dnapl equilibrium solubility cs in tween 80 solution depends on the tween 80 concentration and their high correlation r2 0 987 at 22 c has been found by schaerlaekens et al 2000 the cs and c can be expressed as 4 c s 26 414 c tween 0 971 5 c ρ tce v s dnapl q t where c tween is the weight percentage of tween 80 ρ tce m l3 is the density of tce v l3 is the pore volume of the microfluidic chip q l3 t is the injection rate of tween 80 solution the specific interfacial area as 1 l is the dnapl aqueous phase interface area per unit pore volume of the microfluidic chip we also use a normalized interfacial area ai 1 l defined as the dnapl aqueous phase interface area per unit volume of dnapl phase therefore as and ai can be calculated as 6 a s l dnapl q h v 7 a i l dnapl q h v s dnapl where l dnapl q l is the length of the dnapl aqueous phase interface and h l is the etched depth of the microfluidic chip the mass transfer rate obtained from dnapl solubilization experiment is often expressed as the dimensionless form of the modified sherwood number which is defined as 8 s h k l 2 d m where l l is the characteristic length of the porous medium which is equal to the mean grain radius dm l2 t is the dnapl molecular diffusivity in the aqueous phase 3 results and discussion 3 1 pore scale evolution of dnapl solubilization the evolving phase structure during dnapl solubilization was captured in the experiments with different surfactant concentrations and the high resolution images are shown in fig 4 q 4 μl min the dnapl desaturation curves are shown in fig 5 according to the observation covering the entire microfluidic chip fig 4 the tween 80 surfactant causes significant dnapl solubilization without any dnapl mobilization during the entire injection duration which favors dnapl remediation as this protects the previously clean zone from contamination by dnapl redistribution at the end of the injection 120 pv the aqueous phase containing tween 80 dissolves all the residual dnapl while the di water only dissolves around 50 dnapl figs 5 and 6 indicating that tween 80 greatly increases the apparent solubility of dnapl on the other hand the dnapl dissolution evolution in di water experiment 0 wt in fig 4 shows the dnapl blobs trapped in the upstream half of the microfluidic chip are almost completely dissolved whereas the dnapl blobs in the downstream half are hardly dissolved even by the end of injection 120 pv the dnapl blobs in the downstream are difficult to dissolve because the flowing aqueous phase reaches easily as it dissolves the dnapl in the upstream the dissolution variability in different parts of the micromodel is not observed in tween 80 experiments because the large apparent solubility of dnapl in tween 80 solution results in an unsaturated concentration across the domain which is also responsible for the faster dissolution than by di water figs 5 and 6 the effect of tween 80 concentration on dnapl solubilization is evident in fig 4 according to the slopes of dnapl desaturation curves in fig 5 the higher surfactant concentrations result in the better dnapl solubilization or faster dissolution the linear driving force model representing interphase mass transfer in eq 1 shows that the mass transfer flux is proportional to the dnapl concentration difference and the mass transfer rate coefficient the tce dnapl equilibrium solubility is proportional to the tween 80 concentration with a scaling factor over 26 schaerlaekens et al 2000 so the dnapl concentration difference can be greatly enlarged by improving the tween 80 content explaining the better dnapl solubilization the mass transfer rate coefficient may also play a role in dnapl solubilization which will be discussed in section 3 3 the coupled effect of surfactant concentration and injection rate on dnapl solubilization was also investigated and their dnapl desaturation curves are shown in fig 6 fig 6a shows that the higher tween 80 content causes better dnapl solubilization regardless of the injection rate and that the tween 80 solutions are much better than di water for dnapl dissolution on the other hand tween 80 solutions with different injection rates cause similar dissolution rates fig 6b implying a weak effect of injection rate on dnapl solubilization therefore from a practical and economic perspective multiple injections of the aqueous phase with high tween 80 content may be an option worth considering during dnapl remediation 3 2 mass transfer behavior during dnapl solubilization close inspection of dnapl distribution can provide detailed information on mass transfer behavior during dnapl solubilization the partially enlarged images fig 7 show different mass transfer behaviors during dnapl dissolution by di water and dnapl solubilization by tween 80 solution mass transfer in di water flooding hardly changes the morphology of dnapl blobs showing an overall shrinkage until complete dissolution and dnapl blobs in the hydraulically less accessible areas are difficult to dissolve completely 0 wt in fig 7 the phenomenon suggests the mass transfer rates are similar along the dnapl aqueous phase interface of trapped blob in contrast the difference in mass transfer rates on the dnapl aqueous phase interface induces the morphological change of dnapl blobs during tween 80 solution flooding 2 8 wt in fig 7 what is more the breakup behavior of dnapl ganglia and long droplets is observed during the tween 80 enhanced dnapl solubilization 2 8 wt in fig 7 unlike the transient droplet breakup in surfactant enhanced dnapl mobilization zhong et al 2001 the breakup behavior in dnapl solubilization is the result of a combination of viscous force capillary force and chemical force mass transfer and micellar solubilization during the mass transfer of a dnapl droplet to the aqueous phase strong convection causes the rapid dnapl solubilization whereas weak convection or diffusion causes slow dnapl dissolution therefore the disparity of the mass transfer strength induces the rapid retreat of the dnapl boundary around some parts of the interface and the almost stationary dnapl boundary around the other parts when the disparity of the mass transfer strength intensifies sufficiently to break the force equilibrium the droplet breaks into several smaller daughter blobs meanwhile the flow field in the porous medium undergoes abrupt change and the small daughter blobs prefer to move toward the narrow pore throat due to the higher capillary force than viscous force 2 8 wt in fig 7 it should be pointed out that the slight movements of daughter blobs around several adjacent pores do not create new contamination of previously clean pores and the blobs are dissolved completely later 2 8 wt in fig 7 in addition the earlier droplet breakup behavior and the faster micro movement of dnapl daughter blobs are found in the experiment with higher tween 80 content which corresponds to the more pronounced solubilization overall the strong concentration gradient due to the high equilibrium solubility and the droplet breakup behavior due to the difference in mass transfer strength greatly promote dnapl solubilization in the tween 80 experiments from the perspective of pore scale physics the geometric parameters of dnapl blobs help quantify the mass transfer and solubilization evolution the mean geometric blob length is similar for different experiments at the beginning of the experiments see fig 8 a as the injection processes the mean blob lengths in tween 80 experiments decrease and reach zero before 80 pv which corresponds well to the solubilization evolution fig 5 the standard deviation of the geometric blob lengths also decreases with the injection volume fig 8a implying the droplet breakup behavior and complete dissolution of dnapl blobs in contrast the mean blob length in the di water experiments exhibits only a slight decline and a consistently large variation fig 8a indicating the limited mass transfer and the spatial variability in dissolution which also corresponds well to the dnapl desaturation curves fig 6 the dnapl aqueous phase interfacial lengths show the similar evolution to dnapl blob lengths in tween 80 experiments and they decrease much faster than that in the di water experiment fig 8 furthermore the higher the tween 80 content the faster declines of blob length and interfacial length and the more efficient dnapl solubilization fig 8 the mass transfer rate depends on the mass transfer coefficient and the dnapl aqueous phase interface area and the specific interfacial area as is often used to represent the total interface area fig 9 a b shows that tween 80 significantly alters as than di water and the better performance by higher tween 80 content is consistent with the images desaturation curves and blob lengths figs 5 6 and 9 here from a pore scale perspective the interfacial area ai is used as a more suitable parameter to reflect the morphology and distribution of dnapl and may be a better representative of the effective mass transfer interface area than as fig 9c d shows that ai increases as the injection progresses and rises sharply near the complete dissolution because the saturation becomes small the higher tween 80 content the earlier ai sharp rise echoing the earlier droplet breakup and stronger solubilization the effect of flushing rates on mass transfer is shown in fig 9 at 20 pv the decrease in as is around 80 and 95 for injection rates of 4 μl min and 0 5 μl min respectively but the former requires only 1 8 of the flushing time of the latter for the same injection volume the lower ai values for high injection rates indicate the insufficient contact time fig 9c d which may result in the ineffectiveness and waste of tween 80 surfactant because of flow bypass without exposure to dnapl contaminants therefore a high tween 80 content and a low injection rate may be preferred for dnapl solubilization during practical dnapl remediation 3 3 mass transfer rate during dnapl solubilization based on image processing the mass transfer rate coefficients at different dnapl saturations were calculated and shown in fig 10 regardless of the injection rate as the dnapl saturation decreases the interphase mass transfer rate coefficient k decreases due to the decreasing specific interfacial area as during dnapl dissolution by di water fig 10 unexpectedly the mass transfer rate coefficient k caused by tween 80 is much smaller than that of di water during almost the entire dnapl dissolution solubilization process and the inhibition of k is more pronounced in the experiment with higher tween 80 content fig 10 the k is a lumped parameter proportional to the mass transfer coefficient k and the specific interfacial area as k kas while the stagnant film model of interphase mass transfer shows k is the ratio of molecular diffusion coefficient dm to the film thickness δ and as is the ratio of interface area to the media volume miller et al 1990 even for the similar as values at the beginning of the experiments increasing the tween 80 content still causes a decrease in k which is much smaller than that for di water fig 10a hence the k inhibition can only be attributed to the decline of mass transfer coefficient k tween 80 surfactant containing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups prefer to accumulate at the interface between dnapl and aqueous phase and micelles are preferentially formed around the interface when the surfactant concentration is higher than cmc value both of which greatly increase the stagnant film thickness and thus lead to a decrease in k and k the higher the tween 80 content the thicker the stagnant film and the smaller the k and k value nevertheless the total mass transfer flux in tween 80 experiments is enhanced due to the increased apparent solubility concentration the enhanced mass transfer along with k inhibition is also found in other surfactant enhanced dnapl remediation systems johnson et al 1999 which can also be explained by the increased thickness of the stagnant film for most tween 80 experiments the mass transfer rate coefficient k generally decreases as dnapl saturation decreases and reaches zero at complete dissolution but for a few curves in fig 10a d it is interesting that the k value increases slightly at the beginning of injection this phenomenon may be qualitatively explained from dnapl mass transfer behavior and initial phase structure at the beginning of dnapl solubilization the initial phase structure provides a limited effective mass transfer interface ai then the surfactant induced droplet breakup behavior increases the effective interface leading to the short term increase of mass transfer rate after the formation of a stable phase structure the decreasing dnapl saturation and the decreasing total mass transfer interface as mainly contribute to the decline of k the higher k values in the experiments with faster injections are also evident regardless of the tween 80 concentration fig 10 suggesting faster mass transfer the mass transfer coefficient k values in various experiments versus the dnapl saturation sdnapl are shown in fig 11 the overall trends of the k sdnapl curves are similar to that of the k sdnapl curves but the variation of k values is more drastic because of the differences in the specific interfacial area at different dissolution periods most of the k values in tween 80 experiments are smaller than those in the di water experiments and the smaller k values are found in the experiments with higher tween 80 concentrations fig 11 which is also found in phenanthrene dissolution by six nonionic surfactants grimberg et al 1995 and may be attributed to the rate limiting diffusion of micelles across the stagnant film however some k values in fig 11a b d are larger than the k values at the same dnapl saturation in the di water experiments indicating the weak mass transfer in the relatively stable period of late dnapl dissolution generally the higher k values are also found in the higher injection rate experiments the interfacial area ai reflecting effective mass transfer interface versus the dnapl saturation sdnapl are shown in fig 12 different from the evolutions of k values and k values the ai values show continuous increases as sdnapl decreases regardless of the tween 80 concentration and injection rate this trend can be well fitted with power law functions fig 12 the slow increase of ai values in the early dnapl solubilization is mainly due to the droplet breakup and gradual homogenization of droplet morphology while the sharp rise of ai is due to the small sdnapl generally the smaller ai values in the experiments with higher injection rates are evident during dnapl dissolution solubilization fig 12 reflecting the faster mass transfer fig 10 based on the data from all 16 experiments fig 12e an empirical equation characterizing the ai evolution during surfactant enhanced dnapl solubilization is established 9 a i 71 37 s dnapl 0 17 3 4 mass transfer model of dnapl solubilization according to the discussion above the mass transfer during surfactant enhanced dnapl solubilization is affected by the mass transfer behavior the effective interface the complex phase structure the surfactant concentration and the flow field here dnapl saturation can be regarded as a comprehensive indicator reflecting phase structure and effective interface see eq 9 the surfactant weight ratio csf and reynolds number re are selected as the measures for surfactant inhibition effect and pore water velocity respectively re can be calculated as 10 re v aq l ν aq where the pore water velocity v aq l t can be simply calculated as v aq q darcy φ 1 s dnapl ν aq l2 t is the viscosity of the aqueous phase which is composition dependent and can be calculated as guarnaccia et al 1997 11 log ν aq c s ρ dnapl log ν dnapl 1 c s ρ dnapl log ν w where ρ dnapl m l3 is dnapl density c s m l3 is dnapl equilibrium solubility ν dnapl and ν w l2 t are viscosities of dnapl and di water respectively based on the results of experiments with various surfactant contents and injection rates an empirical model suitable for surfactant enhanced dnapl solubilization is developed where the dimensionless modified sherwood number representing the mass transfer rate is as follows 12 s h 0 36 s dnapl 0 812 r e 0 492 c sf 1 684 590 61 the positive exponents of sdnapl and re indicate the dependence of mass transfer rate on dnapl saturation and water flow velocity while the negative exponent of csf demonstrates the surfactant inhibition effect fig 13 a shows an overall good fit of the mass transfer sherwood correlation for the 12 surfactant flushing experiments with 92 of the measured values falling within a factor of 1 3 of the estimated value the model is also validated against other experimental results such as those from cosolvents napl flushing experiments in porous media yaksi et al 2021 fig 13b shows that the proposed mass transfer model has an overall good prediction for the ethanol dichlorobenzene flushing system but the study by yang et al 2022 shows that ethanol may enhance the mass transfer from tetrachloroethene to cosolvent solutions therefore the effectiveness of the proposed model also depends on the types of surfactants cosolvents and dnapls which may have various chemical effects on dnapl mass transfer a comparison of mass transfer empirical models for surfactant enhanced dnapl solubilization at various scales is shown in table 3 this comparison indicates that dnapl aqueous mass transfer behaviors and rates may also be dependent on the spatial scale fig 14 shows a comparison of different dnapl solubilization predictions as a function of re a major difference between the empirical model proposed in this work and the sherwood correlations by other researchers is the introduction of the variable csf which is used to account for the inhibitory effect of surfactants on dnapl mass transfer in the tce tween 80 systems schaerlaekens et al 2000 and schaerlaekens and feyen 2004 this work the exponents are close for both θdnapl and re which illustrates similar dependences of mass transfer on saturation and water flow velocity in the same dnapl surfactant systems regardless the scales the large differences in proportion parameters 0 26 0 63 and 6 254 in the three models above can cause large differences in mass transfer rates which are attributed to the spatial scale but are vital for designing field remediation so upscaling studies on dnapl mass transfer prediction are needed to optimize aquifer remediation saenton and illangasekare 2007 for the same surfactant tween 80 changing the type of chlorinated hydrocarbon from tce to pce does not cause a substantial change in the exponent of θdnapl and re cf 0 712 and 0 712 in rathfelder et al 2001 but for the same dnapl tce different surfactant causes a significant change in the correlation parameter of θdnapl and re cf 1 15 and 1 04 as in mayer et al 1999 generally the effectiveness of sherwood correlations depends on the form of the empirical model as well as the experimental conditions scales surfactants dnapls with models derived from larger scale experiments predicting lower mass transfer rates 2 d tank experiments 1 d column experiments microfluidic experiments fig 14 4 summary and conclusions although numerous studies on mass transfer have been performed at column and field scales the challenges in optimizing surfactant enhanced dnapl dissolution solubilization remediation remain due to the knowledge gap in the effects of surfactants on interphase mass transfer behaviors and rates at the pore scale the present study focuses on characterizing the fundamental mass transfer behaviors revealing the effect of surfactants and predicting the mass transfer rates during surfactant enhanced dnapl remediation relying on a series of microfluidic experiments that allow real time observation of phase structures in a 2 d micromodel the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 during the surfactant enhanced dnapl remediation we clearly observe the droplet breakup behavior caused by the disparity of the mass transfer strength along dnapl aqueous interface and the subsequent interface adjustment due to capillary force both of which are the result of a combination of viscous force capillary force and chemical force mass transfer and micellar solubilization and are mechanistically significantly different from the transient droplet breakup followed by mobilization that caused by surfactant reduced interfacial tension 2 the surfactant with a concentration above cmc distinctly reduces the mass transfer rate coefficient k and the inhibition is more pronounced as surfactant concentration increases but the total mass transfer flux is improved because of the enhanced driving force or concentration gradient resulting from enhanced dnapl equilibrium solubility the decline of k is due to the increase in stagnant film thickness decrease in mass transfer coefficient k because surfactant molecules prefer to accumulate at the interface and micelles are preferentially formed at the interface 3 based on microfluidic visualization experiments we develop a new empirical model of mass transfer rate evolution considering the impacts of surfactant concentration dnapl distribution effective interface and flow rate the model explicitly considers the surfactant inhibition effect and distinguishes itself from the previous mass transfer correlations even though the effects of surfactants on pore scale mass transfer processes and rates have been systematically investigated and a new empirical sherwood type of correlation of mass transfer has been proposed in light of the observed pore scale behavior of droplet breakup and inhibition of surfactants on mass transfer it should be noted that there are also disadvantages limitations of this work to further understand the physical mechanism of interphase mass transfer more systematic and dedicated studies across scales may be required to transfer the understanding of pore scale physical processes and the effects of surfactants on mass transfer to field scale applications careful upscaling studies are needed overall this work contributes to the understanding of interphase mass transfer processes that occur widely in the soil and groundwater environment and subsurface engineering activities such as geological storage of co2 tong et al 2013 our work has elucidated the pore scale physics of interphase mass transfer during dnapl remediation and has probed the effects of surfactant concentration dnapl distribution effective interface and flow rate on dnapl dissolution solubilization which can be combined with additional treatment technologies e g adding oxidants or nanoparticles to further elevate remediation efficiency the new empirical model can provide an alternative in predicting mass transfer rate during surfactant enhanced dnapl remediation and can also serve as a reference for studying various mass transfer processes involving surfactants in similar working environments credit authorship contribution statement

1843,applying potassium k fertilizer to fields is considered to be an important agricultural production practice to improve crop water use efficiency wue however the magnitude of crop wue response to k fertilization has only been reported for individual regions crops and scales due to lack of extensive and complete global datasets here we quantified the responses of crop wue to k fertilization at the three scales of field population wuefield whole plant wueplant and single leaf wueleaf through synthesizing 797 paired observations from 81 field based studies worldwide meta analysis results showed that k fertilization increased wuefield wueplant and wueleaf of crops by 19 0 12 0 and 29 9 respectively with the key factors influencing this being crop type mean annual precipitation and soil ph respectively it should be noted that the magnitude of wuefield wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization was significantly positively correlated with mean annual precipitation while significantly negatively correlated with soil ph which implying that k fertilization is an effective way to improve crop wue in the region with humid climate or acidic soil furthermore the conclusive findings of this meta analysis showed that the relative importance of environmental factors in the magnitude of the wuefield wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization was 49 8 68 8 and 82 0 respectively which indicated that climatic characteristics and soil properties were drivers of crop wue response to k fertilization rather than management practices overall our meta analysis provides new insight into the crop wue response to k fertilization from field plant to leaf was driven by environmental factors and highlights the great potential of improved field k fertilization strategies

data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the global population expected to reach between 9 and 11 billion by 2050 continued population growth leads to expanding demand for crop yields fao 2017 the production of food to meet the basic needs of human civilization requires large amounts of freshwater resources wallace 2000 zhong et al 2017 qi et al 2022 which means that agricultural water demand could double by 2050 whereas by then the amount of freshwater available for agriculture is expected to drop by 50 due to climate change gupta et al 2020 denissen et al 2022 thus the challenge of food security posed by increasingly scarce freshwater in agriculture must be met by improving crop water use efficiency wue kang et al 2017 leakey et al 2019 wue is mainly regulated by a combination of genetic characteristics of the crop and environmental factors shao et al 2008 liu et al 2016 xia et al 2021 screening and breeding water saving and drought resistance varieties by altering crops carbon metabolism and water transport processes through molecular biotechnology is a direct means of improving wue luo 2010 zhang et al 2011 hughes et al 2017 in addition field management measures such as mulching optimized irrigation regime rational fertilizer application conservation tillage and weed control have also proved to be effective in increasing crop wue in agricultural production zhao et al 2012 bowles et al 2016 choudhary and kumar 2019 yan et al 2021 zhang et al 2022d as water and nutrients are two key limiting factors for plant growth and they interact with each other scientific water and nutrient management in agricultural production have been the main way to improve crop wue castell and terradas 1994 li et al 2009 but with climate change exacerbating the uneven distribution of global water resources konapala et al 2020 pokhrel et al 2021 irrigation on farmland is facing huge challenges and in this context rational fertilizer application is not only essential to ensure food security but also to improve crop wue and achieve sustainable global agricultural development sardans and peñuelas 2015 zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2022a fertilization not only promotes crop root growth and expands its water foraging space but also promotes crop canopy development increases transpiration and reduces evaporation thus increasing the transpiration evaporation ratio and greatly improving crop wue trachsel et al 2013 jákli et al 2018 potassium k a key mineral nutrient essential for crop growth and development plays an important

bradbury and malcolm 1977 first reported that k fertilization could improve the wue of plants under water deficit by increasing stomatal resistance to reduce transpiration rates of sitka spruce seedlings in pot experiments subsequently numerous studies have reported the effects of k fertilization on wue in various crops worldwide over the past decades andersen et al 1992 pervez et al 2004 ezui et al 2017 saloner et al 2019 yang et al 2022 which have improved our understanding of the mechanisms of efficient water use in crops however there is still a great deal of uncertainty regarding the effects of k fertilization on crop wue as these results are inconsistent for example the results of zain et al 2014 and howladar 2018 showed that k fertilization significantly increases crop wue while the results of leite et al 2013 and endris et al 2021 showed that k fertilizer significantly decreases crop wue the effect of k fertilization on crop wue depends on the trade off between the carbon fixation benefits and water dissipation costs it brings and this process is not only related to the different k fertilization treatments but can also be influenced by factors such as the climate of the study site soil physicochemical properties and cultivation management practices but whose effects are typically ignored in case of studies because they cannot be evaluated quantitatively in addition there were significant differences in the response of crop wue to k fertilization at different scales with jákli et al 2018 reporting that k fertilization had significant effects on agronomic wue and leaf wue of sugar beet while there was no significant effect on canopy wue reviews usually only report the effects of k fertilization on wue for individual regions bhattacharyya et al 2018 crops liu et al 2021 and scales jákli et al 2016 due to the lack of large and complete global datasets therefore the integration and analysis of available global field data from different sources to quantitatively assess the effects of k fertilization on crop wue at different scales and to identify the key factors influencing the response of field crops wue to k fertilization at different scales which will help to develop appropriate k fertilization management strategies for future global agricultural production under climate change in addition unlike individual field experiments the global synthesis is more comprehensive realistic and accurate in quantifying the crop wue response to k fertilization and its sources of heterogeneity to fill these knowledge gaps a global meta analysis was conducted to quantify the response of crop wue to k fertilization at field population wuefield whole plant wueplant and single leaf wueleaf scales our objective in this study was to i investigate the effects of climatic characteristics soil properties and management practices on the magnitude of wuefield wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization ii assess the contribution of climatic characteristics soil properties and management practices in the response of wuefield wueplant and wueleaf to k fertilization and iii quantify the relationship between climatic characteristics soil properties and management practices and the magnitude of wuefield wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization 2 materials and methods 2 1 data

into monocotyledons and dicotyledons and the photosynthetic pathway was separated into c3 and c4 k fertilizer type was divided into three categories k chloride k sulfate and others others included k nitrate a mixture of k nitrate and k chloride k application rate was divided into three categories lower k application rate lower than farmers practices equal k application rate equal to farmers practices and higher k application rate higher than farmers practices similarly irrigation amount was divided into four categories rainfed no irrigation under farmers practices lower irrigation amount lower than farmers practices equal irrigation amount equal than farmers practices and higher irrigation amount higher than farmers practices if multiple k application rates were set in the paper and a conclusion was given on the appropriate k application rate then the appropriate application rate was used as the local farmers practices rate if no appropriate application rate was given then the k application rate that maximizes crop wue was used as the local farmers practices rate if only a single k application rate was set in the paper and no indication was given of how high or low the rate was compared to the local k application rate then that rate was used as the local farmers practices rate the above method was also used to evaluate the level of irrigation amount for local farmers practices around the world 2 3 meta analysis a global meta analysis was conducted based on the three scales of field population whole plant and single leaf to quantify the magnitude of crop wue response to k fertilization by using the natural log of the response ratio ln rr hedges et al 1999 ln r r ln x e x c where ln rr is unitless and its positive and negative values represented an increase or decrease of crop wue in response to k fertilization respectively and xe and xc are the means of crop wue under experimental with k fertilizer application and control without k fertilizer application treatment respectively then the effect sizes of crop wue response to k fertilization were converted to a percentage as follows wang and zou 2020 effect s i z e e ln r r 1 100 the variance of ln rr v ln rr for each study was calculated from the standard deviation sd of crop wue as follows curtis and wang 1998 v ln r r s d e 2 ne x e 2 s d c 2 nc x c 2 where sde and sdc are the standard deviations of crop wue for the experimental and control groups respectively and ne and nc are the sample sizes of crop wue for the experimental and control groups respectively if only the standard error se of crop wue was given in the study then the sd was calculated as follows sd s e n where n represented the number of replicates as some studies where sd and se of crop wue were not given sd was estimated as 0 1 times the mean to use as many of these studies as possible in this meta analysis luo et al 2006 kallenbach and grandy 2011 tian et al 2015 a weighted random effects model was used to analyze the effect size of crop wue response to k fertilization according to hedges et al 1999 the weighted mean response ratio ln rr was calculated as follows ln r r i 1 k ω i ln r r i i 1 k ω i where k is the number of studies ωi is the weighting factors calculated as the inverse of the sample variance 1 v ln rr τ 2 and ln rr i represented the ln rr from the ith comparison the restricted maximum likelihood method was used to calculate the between group variance τ 2 as follows hedges et al 1999 τ 2 qt k 1 i 1 k ω i i 1 k ω i 2 i 1 k ω i where q t is the total heterogeneity across case studies if q t is significant p 0 05 it indicated that other explanatory variables may influence the response of crop wue to k fertilization then q t was partitioned into the within group q w and between group q b heterogeneity gurevitch et al 1992 if q b is significant p 0 05 it indicated that the corresponding explanatory variables are the important factors causing variation in crop wue response to k fertilization ouyang et al 2018 the 95 confidence interval ci for the ln rr was calculated as follows 95 c i ln r r 1 96 1 i 1 k ω i the mean effects of k fertilization on crop wue are considered significant if the 95 ci of the effect size did not overlap with zero p 0 05 and positive values represent increases negative values represent decreases all the meta analysis procedures were performed in metawin 2 1 software 64999 iterations sinauer associates inc sunderland ma usa rosenberg et al 2000 2 4 data analysis in this meta analysis q b was calculated to analyze the effects of k fertilization on crop wue among different subgrouping categories to prevent human screening or bias in the data itself from affecting the accuracy of the results a fail safe number m rosenthal s method at p 0 05 was used to test the effect of publication bias rosenthal 1979 and only results with m 5n 10 where n is the number of studies were used in this study as this indicates that there is no publication bias and the results are plausible viechtbauer 2007 the frequency distribution of the ln rr was plotted using the origin 2021 software program origin lab massachusetts usa and the frequency of ln rr was fitted to a gaussian distribution function in addition we also calculated the relative importance of every variable map mat soil texture soc soil ph soil ak crop type fertilizer

significantly to k fertilization across observations p 0 05 fig 5b and c map and mat had a significant effect on the magnitude of the wueleaf response to k fertilization p 0 001 with the largest magnitude of the wueleaf response to k fertilization occurring for climate factors with map 800 mm 77 4 and mat 10 41 4 respectively fig 4d and e it should be noted that k fertilization significantly decreased wueleaf by 28 4 under 200 mm map 400 mm p 0 05 for different soil textures the effect size of k fertilization on wueleaf was significantly increased in coarse 18 3 and medium textured soil 66 8 p 0 05 fig 5f soc had a significant effect on the magnitude of the wueleaf response to k fertilization p 0 001 with 5 g kg 1 soc 10 g kg 1 showing the significant increase in wueleaf 54 7 as compared to soc 10 g kg 1 26 3 fig 5g soil ph and ak showed a significant effect on the magnitude of wueleaf response to k fertilization p 0 01 with the largest magnitude of the wueleaf response to k fertilization occurring for soil properties with ph 6 5 83 8 and ak 75 mg kg 1 58 2 fig 4h and i different k fertilizer types were considered with k sulfate fertilizer 50 1 performing the significant increase as compared to k chloride fertilizer 1 1 or others e g k nitrate 10 6 for wueleaf response to k fertilization fig 5j for the comparison of different k rates with higher application rate of k showing the significant increase as compared to lower and equal application rate of k fig 5k for the comparison of different irrigation amounts the effect size of k fertilization on wueleaf was significantly increased only at the equal irrigation amount p 0 05 fig 5l 3 4 key factors affecting wuefield wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization the relative importance of environmental factors including climate characteristics and soil properties and management practices for wuefield wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization was quantified by comparing standardized regression coefficients between different variables to assess the main factors influencing the response of crop wue to k fertilization at different scales fig 6 at the field population scale of crops environmental factors and management practices were equally important for the magnitude of the wuefield response to k fertilization with the relative importance of 49 8 and 50 2 respectively fig 6a among different variables the key factor influencing the magnitude of wuefield response to k fertilization was crop type at the whole plant scale of crops the relative importance of environmental factors and management practices in the magnitude of the wueplant response to k fertilization was 68 8 and 31 2 respectively with the key factor influencing the wueplant response to k fertilization being map fig 6b at the single leaf scale of crops the relative importance of environmental factors in the magnitude of the wueleaf response to k fertilization was much higher than that of management practices with soil ph being the key factor influencing the wue response to k fertilization fig 6c from field to plant to leaf the increasing relative importance of environmental factors and decreasing relative importance of management practices in the response of crop wue to k fertilization which means that improved understanding of field k fertilization management is essential in achieving efficient agricultural water use under climate change 3 5 response of wuefield wueplant and wueleaf to k fertilization as affected by climate characteristic as shown in fig 7 both climate characteristic map and mat positively affected the magnitude of the crop wue response to k fertilization at different scales the effect size of k fertilization on wuefield wueplant and wueleaf showed a significant linear increase with increasing map p 0 0001 fig 7a b and c for every 100 mm increase in map the effect size of k fertilization on wuefield wueplant and wueleaf increased by 0 9 10 3 and 4 0 percentage points respectively which indicated that the magnitude of wueplant response to k fertilization was more sensitive to map compared to wuefield and wueleaf similarly with increasing mat the effect size of k fertilization on wuefield wueplant and wueleaf showed a linear increase while only significantly in wuefield p 0 0118 and wueleaf p 0 0131 fig 7d e and f for every 1 increase in mat the effect size of k fertilization on wuefield and wueleaf increased by 0 3 and 1 6 percentage points respectively which indicated that the increase in temperature under global warming may lead to a more sensitive response of crop wue to k fertilization 3 6 response of wuefield wueplant and wueleaf to k fertilization as affected by soil properties the effect size of wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization was significantly affected by soc soil ph and ak while the effect size of wuefield response to k fertilization was only significantly affected by soil ph fig 8 the effect size of k fertilization on wuefield and wueplant showed a linear increase with increasing soc while only significantly in wueplant p 0 0001 fig 8a and b for every 1 g kg 1 increase in soc the effect size of k fertilization on wueplant increased by 1 4 percentage points while the magnitude of wueleaf response to k fertilization decreased by 2 4 percentage points fig 8c the magnitude of response of wuefield wueplant and wueleaf to k fertilization all showed a significant linear decrease with increasing soil ph p 0 001 fig 8d e and f for every unit increase in soil ph the effect size of wuefield wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization decreased by 3 4 24 7 and 20 1 percentage points respectively which indicated that the magnitude of wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization was more sensitive to soil ph compared to wuefield the effect size of wuefield wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization all decreased linearly with increasing soil ak whereas only significantly in wueplant and wueleaf p 0 001 fig 8g h and i for every 10 mg kg 1 increase in ak the effect size of wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization decreased by 1 5 and 1 9 percentage points respectively 3 7 response of wuefield wueplant and wueleaf to k fertilization as affected by agronomic management practices compared with the treatment without k fertilization the wuefield of potato maize rice jatropha curcas cotton wheat radish apple and other crops e g rapeseed with k fertilization treatment increased by 1 02 0 38 0 16 0 06 0 14 0 07 0 48 0 42 and 0 34 kg m 3 respectively table 1 rice showed the largest increase in wuefield 54 2 followed by cotton 24 5 maize 21 9 radish 19 7 other crops e g rapeseed 16 0 apple 15 0 potato 13 8 and jatropha curcas 5 5 compared with the treatment without k fertilization the wueplant of potato jatropha curcas cassava hybrid millet and others e g maize with k fertilization treatment increased by 0 16 0 06 0 97 0 40 and 0 39 kg m 3 respectively table 2 cassava showed the largest increase in wueplant 26 2 followed by other crops e g maize 25 7 hybrid millet 16 8 jatropha curcas 5 5 and potato 5 1 kiwi showed the largest increase in wueleaf 313 4 followed by nai plum 86 2 apple 38 6 ziziphus jujube 35 3 jun jujube 30 3 wheat 18 5 and tomato 17 7 while cotton showed a significant decrease in wueleaf 28 4 table 3 overall the response of wuefield and wueplant to k fertilization was significantly increased by water input including irrigation and precipitation p 0 05 fig 9 a and b however for every 100 mm increase in water input the effect size of wuefield response to k fertilization decreased by 1 6 percentage points the magnitude of wueleaf response to k fertilization was not significantly affected by water input fig 9c it should be noted that the effect size of k fertilization on maize wuefield increased with the increase of k application and showed a significant linear relationship p 0 0003 fig 9d in contrast there was a significant negative correlation between the magnitude of wheat wuefield response to k fertilization and the k application rate the overall response of crop wueplant to k fertilization was significantly affected by the k application rate p 0 001 fig 9e for every 100 kg hm 2 increase in k application rate the magnitude of wueleaf response to k fertilization increased by 55 0 8 4 and 67 5 percentage points in kiwi nai plum and ziziphus jujube respectively fig 9f 4 discussion 4 1 overall effects of k fertilization on crop wue and their controlling factors conclusive findings of this meta analysis showed that k fertilizer application to agricultural fields worldwide has increased crop wue not only at the field population scale but also at the whole plant and single leaf scales the overall effect size of k fertilization on wuefield wueplant and wueleaf were 19 0 12 0 and 29 9 fig 3 fig 4 and fig 5 respectively which indicated that field k fertilization management is important for agricultural production to cope with challenges posed by water scarcity under climate change the increase in wue was directly related to the reduction of unproductive water losses e g soil evapotranspiration and crop luxury transpiration from the crop by k fertilization brag 1972 martineau et al 2017 in addition k fertilization indirectly increased crop wue by promoting the expansion of leaf area to increase the cumulative amount of light intercepted to promote the synthesis of carbon assimilation products pettigrew 2003 ezui et al 2017 however hatam et al 2020 also reported that the increase in cotton transpiration rate was larger than the increase in net photosynthetic rate after the application of k fertilizer resulting in a decrease in the instantaneous wue of leaves to further explain this variability in crop wue response to k fertilization climatic characteristics e g map and mat soil properties e g soil texture soc soil ph soil ak and management practices e g crop type plant type photosynthetic pathway from 81 field based studies worldwide were grouped for analysis fig 3 fig 4 and fig 5 4 1 1 climatic characteristics to clarify the source of variation in the magnitude of crop wue response to k fertilization under different climatic regions we quantified the effect of map and mat rather than cumulative temperature and rainfall within the crop growing season on the magnitude of crop wue response to k fertilization on average the magnitude of crop wue response to k fertilization was higher in regions with map 800 mm as compared to regions with map 200 mm 200 map 400 mm and 400 mm map 800 mm fig 3d fig 4d and fig 5d which may be because the low k use efficiency in regions with map 800 mm limon ortega et al 2020 in addition the effect size of k fertilization on crop wuefield and wueleaf in regions with mat 10 was larger than in regions with mat 10 fig 3e fig 4e and fig 5e k guaranteed water and carbon transport of the plant under high temperatures by reducing the leaf temperature to maintain the crop canopy humidity and increased crop wue under high temperatures by enhancing the antioxidant enzyme activity and reducing the stomatal opening to reduce the transpiration rate and increase the net photosynthetic rate shahid et al 2019 sarwar et al 2022 thus we suggested that agricultural production in regions with map 800 mm or mat 10 should ensure an adequate supply of crop k fertilizer to ensure the effective use of agricultural water resources 4 1 2 soil properties soil texture determined the water and fertility holding capacity of the soil esetlili et al 2016 reported that k fertilizer was better applied in fine textured than in coarse textured similar results were found in our meta analysis where the effect size of k fertilization on crop wuefield was larger in medium textured than in coarse textured fig 3f which may be because the more compact soils of medium textured can trap more water and ak the results of the meta analysis of soc showed that k fertilization had the larger increase in crop wueleaf in soil with 5 g kg 1 soc 10 g kg 1 as compared to soc 10 g kg 1 fig 5g which may be due to a suitable soc concentration can promote soil structure formation and microbial activity song et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 thus promoting soil adsorption of water and nutrient activation while an excessive soc concentration can lead to increased microbial respiratory activity resulting in lower oxygen concentration in the soil which is detrimental to crop water and nutrient uptake wang et al 2022 soil ph was one of the main drivers of variation in soil ak which in turn affected the magnitude of crop wue response to k fertilization the results showed that the effect size of k fertilization on crop wuefield was larger in soil with 6 5 ph 7 5 than with ph 6 5 and ph 7 5 fig 3h while the effect size of k fertilization on crop wueplant and wueleaf were larger in soil with ph 6 5 than with 6 5 ph 7 5 and ph 7 5 fig 4h and fig 5h which indicated that the response of crop wue to k fertilization will become more sensitive in acidic soil a long term field experiment by liu et al 2020 reported that soil ph significantly affected the non available k concentration of soil aggregates and that higher k fertilizer utilization in acidic soil was due to lower soil k concentration which is consistent with the results of our meta analysis qiu et al 2014 concluded that additional k fertilization did not have a significant yield and efficiency increase in fields with abundant soil k pools although there were comprehensive effects of soil ak and the k application in crop response to k fertilization but soil ak k fertilizer type and k application rate varied among field studies in our meta analysis and it was difficult to quantify their comprehensive effects on crop wue therefore we analyzed the effect of soil ak in crop wue response to k fertilization separately without considering k fertilization and its comprehensive impact the effect size of k fertilization on crop wue was larger in soil with ak 75 mg kg 1 than with 75 mg kg 1 ak 150 mg kg 1 and ak 150 mg kg 1 fig 3i fig 4i and fig 5i thus we suggested that k fertilization was an effective way to improve crop wue for sustainable agricultural production in regions with soil properties medium textured or 5 g kg 1 soc 10 g kg 1 or ph 6 5 or ak 75 mg kg 1 4 1 3 management practices wue of different crop types responded differently to k fertilization at the same scale fig 3a fig 4a and fig 5a which provided a theoretical reference for the development of field k management strategies for different crops at field population and whole plant scale k fertilization was more effective in increasing wuefield of cereals compared to oil crops tuber crops and fruit fig 3a and fig 4a especially for rice where the increase was the largest table 1 which is consistent with our previously reported results that k plays an important role in maintaining high wue in rice yang et al 2022 in addition in fig 4a we found a larger 95 ci for the wueplant of vegetables in response to k fertilization which may be related to its small sample size n 4 or to the large differences in the magnitude of the wueplant response to k fertilization for different vegetable species appendix a while at single leaf scale k fertilization significantly increased the wueleaf of fruits while it significantly decreased the wueleaf of fiber crop fig 5a especially for kiwi where the increase in wueleaf reached 313 4 table 3 which is related to the fact that kiwi is more sensitive to k than other mineral elements during fruit expansion stage as reported by santoni et al 2014 in addition another important explanation for the greater susceptibility of wue of rice and kiwi to k fertilization compared to other crops is that their photosynthetic pathways are dominated by c3 fig 5c and their own wue is much lower than that of other crops table 1 and table 3 therefore we suggested that more attention should be paid to the management of k fertilization of cereals vegetables and fruit in the field especially for rice where k fertilization is 2 5 and 7 6 times more effective in increasing wue than maize and wheat respectively in addition to crop type management practices such as k fertilizer type irrigation level and k fertilization level can also significantly affect the response of crop wue to k fertilization for example k chloride was more effective in increasing crop wuefield than k sulfate while it was less effective in increasing crop wueleaf than k sulfate fig 3j and fig 5j chen et al 2021 also found that k sulfate was more effective than k chloride in enhancing photosynthesis of cotton and increasing soil ak concentration which may be because the additional sulphur nutrient added by k sulfate which is an important component of protein and can significantly increase enzyme activity in the crop gigolashvili and kopriva 2014 it should be noted that although the effect size of k fertilization on wueleaf increased with increasing k application rate fig 5k while higher k application rate did not maximize the increase in the magnitude of wuefield and wueplant response to k fertilization fig 3k and fig 4k which was similarly reported in several previous studies pervez et al 2004 zain et al 2014 zhang et al 2022e in addition although the effect size of k fertilization on wuefield increased with increasing water input fig 3l while higher water input did not maximize the increase in the magnitude of wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization fig 4l and fig 5l which was similarly reported by liu et al 2021 and zhang et al 2022b interestingly k fertilizer inputs in rainfed farming systems can also result in a large increase in crop wuefield and wueplant these results indicated that scientific water and k fertilization management in the field has a greater potential to achieve efficient crop water use and sustainable agricultural production therefore we suggested that k fertilizer inputs should give priority to k sulfate and provide equal water input and k application rate according to the water and k requirements of the crop in agricultural systems 4 2 inconsistencies in the magnitude of response of wuefield wueplant and wueleaf to k fertilization and their drivers medrano et al 2015 reported a significant correlation between wueplant and leaf intrinsic water use efficiency while this relationship was worse with increasing water stress which implied that crop wue between different scales may show a strong heterogeneity with environment change similarly our meta analysis showed that the magnitude of wuefield wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization was inconsistent which may be caused by differences in the sample sizes or k fertilization rate at field population scale the key factor affecting crop wuefield response to k fertilization was crop type fig 6a for example k fertilization significantly increased wuefield of cereals fiber crops tuber crops and vegetables while there was no significant effect on fruit fig 3a conversely k fertilization significantly increased wueleaf of fruit while significantly decreased wueleaf of fiber crops and there was no significant effect on cereals tuber crops and vegetables fig 5a wuefield and wueleaf were inconsistent in response to k fertilization which similarly with the results found by wang et al 2013b that wuefield and wueleaf were inconsistent at different nitrogen levels in addition our results showed that there was a significant difference in the response of wue to k fertilization between c3 and c4 crops at single leaf scale fig 5c while there was no significant difference at field population and whole plant scales fig 3c and fig 4c which may be because wue at different scales is inherently inconsistent across vegetation types medlyn et al 2017 field water input was significantly and positively correlated with the magnitude of response to k fertilization for wuefield and wueplant fig 9a and b while it was not significant for wueleaf fig 9c k application rate was positively correlated with the magnitude of response to k fertilization for wueplant fig 9e while it was not significant for wuefield and wueleaf fig 9d and f at whole plant and single leaf scales the key factors affecting the response of wueplant and wueleaf to k fertilization were map and soil ph respectively fig 6b and c with increasing map the increase of wueplant is higher than that of wuefield fig 7a and b which indicated that the increase in dry matter of the crop caused by k fertilization was higher than the increase in economic yield unlike wuefield and wueplant wueleaf was more sensitive to mat than map fig 7d e and f which is similar with several previous studies showed that mat was significantly more strongly correlated with plant traits than was map zhang et al 2010 moles et al 2014 goldsmith et al 2017 remarkably the magnitude of wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization was significantly correlated with soc soil ph and soil ak while the magnitude of wuefield response to k fertilization was only significantly correlated with soil ph fig 8 which may be because the most important factor in soil properties that affects the physiological processes of crop water use was soil ph zhang et al 2022b low soil ph will result in lower wueleaf li et al 2022 overall the relative importance of management practice in the magnitude of the wuefield wueplant and wueleaf was low as 50 2 31 2 and 18 0 respectively which indicated that climatic characteristics and soil properties are drivers of crop wue response to k fertilization rather than management practices 4 3 uncertainties and perspectives although our meta analysis provides an insight into the response of crop wue to k fertilization based on the three scales of field population whole plant and single leaf the following uncertainties may exist across studies due to inherent limitations of the synthetic analysis approach and differences in data quality i more than 70 of the study sites in our database were located in asia fig 1 with fewer observations from south america and europe while these regions account for approximately 30 of the world s total cropland area fao 2020 thus there is still a deficit in representing all climatic characteristics soil properties and management practices of global cropland this requires field measurements of wue for various crops at different scales in regions not covered by the dataset and statistics on field environment factors and management practices to compensate for the deficiencies of the database in terms of the breadth of observations ii the appropriate water input and k application rate for the specific crop from different scales of wue were not provided due to the small sample size of data on management practices in our database fig 9 this requires that gradient field experiments worldwide of irrigation amount and k application rate be conducted on various crops to quantify the relationship between the magnitude of wue response to k fertilization and management practices at different scales thus bridging the gap from theory to practice in the meta analysis approach furthermore due to the variability of global cropland climatic characteristics and soil properties crop types were not uniformly distributed and those grown on a large scale under specific climatic characteristics and soil properties were often locally dominant crops in the process of classifying crop types we cannot avoid the comprehensive effects of climate characteristics and soil properties therefore this requires conducting experiments on the response of wue to k fertilization in different crop types under the same field iii the process by which the response of crop wue to k fertilization is transformed between scales is not yet clear for example the magnitude of wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization was more susceptible to soil properties than wuefield but the specific physiological and biochemical mechanisms are still not fully understood ultimately future work will further reveal the relationship between different scales of crop wue and the realization of the transformation between multi scale wue to achieve this it is important to explore the response of crop wue to k fertilization at different scales in the same field to exclude the influence of potential environmental factors and management practices iv the effect of the global application of other fertilizers such as nitrogen and phosphorus on crop wue at different scales still needs to be quantified du et al 2021 and liu et al 2022 demonstrated by the meta analysis that nitrogen fertilizer application can significantly increase wheat wuefield but these studies mostly focused on a single region crop and scale future work will further compile the current global knowledge on crop wue at the three scales of field population whole plant and single leaf in field studies of other fertilizer applications such as nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers to provide a theoretical basis for nutrient management decisions for efficient production of water resources in global agriculture 5 conclusion global synthesis results showed that the magnitude of crop wue response to k fertilization at the three scales of field population wuefield whole plant wueplant and single leaf wueleaf were 19 0 12 0 and 29 9 respectively while key factors affecting the magnitude of wuefield wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization were crop type mean annual precipitation and soil ph respectively it should be noted that the magnitude of wuefield wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization was significantly positively correlated with mean annual precipitation while significantly negatively correlated with soil ph which implying that k fertilization is an effective way to improve crop wue in the region with humid climate or acidic soil compared to local farmers k application rates although higher application rates of k significantly increased crop wueleaf there was no significant increase in wuefield overall the k application rate was significantly positively correlated with the increase in wueplant with a 5 percentage point increase in wueplant for every 100 kg hm 2 increase in k application rate furthermore the conclusive findings of this meta analysis showed that the relative importance of environmental factors in the magnitude of the wuefield wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization was 49 8 68 8 and 82 0 respectively which provides new insight into the crop wue response to k fertilization from field plant to leaf was driven by environmental factors and highlights the potential importance of improving crop wue through field k fertilization management to meet

1843,applying potassium k fertilizer to fields is considered to be an important agricultural production practice to improve crop water use efficiency wue however the magnitude of crop wue response to k fertilization has only been reported for individual regions crops and scales due to lack of extensive and complete global datasets here we quantified the responses of crop wue to k fertilization at the three scales of field population wuefield whole plant wueplant and single leaf wueleaf through synthesizing 797 paired observations from 81 field based studies worldwide meta analysis results showed that k fertilization increased wuefield wueplant and wueleaf of crops by 19 0 12 0 and 29 9 respectively with the key factors influencing this being crop type mean annual precipitation and soil ph respectively it should be noted that the magnitude of wuefield wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization was significantly positively correlated with mean annual precipitation while significantly negatively correlated with soil ph which implying that k fertilization is an effective way to improve crop wue in the region with humid climate or acidic soil furthermore the conclusive findings of this meta analysis showed that the relative importance of environmental factors in the magnitude of the wuefield wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization was 49 8 68 8 and 82 0 respectively which indicated that climatic characteristics and soil properties were drivers of crop wue response to k fertilization rather than management practices overall our meta analysis provides new insight into the crop wue response to k fertilization from field plant to leaf was driven by environmental factors and highlights the great potential of improved field k fertilization strategies

data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the global population expected to reach between 9 and 11 billion by 2050 continued population growth leads to expanding demand for crop yields fao 2017 the production of food to meet the basic needs of human civilization requires large amounts of freshwater resources wallace 2000 zhong et al 2017 qi et al 2022 which means that agricultural water demand could double by 2050 whereas by then the amount of freshwater available for agriculture is expected to drop by 50 due to climate change gupta et al 2020 denissen et al 2022 thus the challenge of food security posed by increasingly scarce freshwater in agriculture must be met by improving crop water use efficiency wue kang et al 2017 leakey et al 2019 wue is mainly regulated by a combination of genetic characteristics of the crop and environmental factors shao et al 2008 liu et al 2016 xia et al 2021 screening and breeding water saving and drought resistance varieties by altering crops carbon metabolism and water transport processes through molecular biotechnology is a direct means of improving wue luo 2010 zhang et al 2011 hughes et al 2017 in addition field management measures such as mulching optimized irrigation regime rational fertilizer application conservation tillage and weed control have also proved to be effective in increasing crop wue in agricultural production zhao et al 2012 bowles et al 2016 choudhary and kumar 2019 yan et al 2021 zhang et al 2022d as water and nutrients are two key limiting factors for plant growth and they interact with each other scientific water and nutrient management in agricultural production have been the main way to improve crop wue castell and terradas 1994 li et al 2009 but with climate change exacerbating the uneven distribution of global water resources konapala et al 2020 pokhrel et al 2021 irrigation on farmland is facing huge challenges and in this context rational fertilizer application is not only essential to ensure food security but also to improve crop wue and achieve sustainable global agricultural development sardans and peñuelas 2015 zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2022a fertilization not only promotes crop root growth and expands its water foraging space but also promotes crop canopy development increases transpiration and reduces evaporation thus increasing the transpiration evaporation ratio and greatly improving crop wue trachsel et al 2013 jákli et al 2018 potassium k a key mineral nutrient essential for crop growth and development plays an important role in root and leaf growth stomatal opening photosynthesis phloem loading of sucrose grain disease resistance xylem water transport and abiotic stress tolerance in crops rubio et al 1995 wang et al 2013a de bang et al 2021 lu et al 2022 zhang et al 2022c when plants are exposed to water deficit stress k promotes root water uptake by increasing intracellular osmotic pressure and enhancing aquaporin activity coffey et al 2018 and coordinates the conductance of carbon dioxide co2 and water h2o by affecting the stomatal area and mesophyll structure horaruang et al 2022 hu et al 2022 bradbury and malcolm 1977 first reported that k fertilization could improve the wue of plants under water deficit by increasing stomatal resistance to reduce transpiration rates of sitka spruce seedlings in pot experiments subsequently numerous studies have reported the effects of k fertilization on wue in various crops worldwide over the past decades andersen et al 1992 pervez et al 2004 ezui et al 2017 saloner et al 2019 yang et al 2022 which have improved our understanding of the mechanisms of efficient water use in crops however there is still a great deal of uncertainty regarding the effects of k fertilization on crop wue as these results are inconsistent for example the results of zain et al 2014 and howladar 2018 showed that k fertilization significantly increases crop wue while the results of leite et al 2013 and endris et al 2021 showed that k fertilizer significantly decreases crop wue the effect of k fertilization on crop wue depends on the trade off between the carbon fixation benefits and water dissipation costs it brings and this process is not only related to the different k fertilization treatments but can also be influenced by factors such as the climate of the study site soil physicochemical properties and cultivation management practices but whose effects are typically ignored in case of studies because they cannot be evaluated quantitatively in addition there were significant differences in the response of crop wue to k fertilization at different scales with jákli et al 2018 reporting that k fertilization had significant effects on agronomic wue and leaf wue of sugar beet while there was no significant effect on canopy wue reviews usually only report the effects of k fertilization on wue for individual regions bhattacharyya et al 2018 crops liu et al 2021 and scales jákli et al 2016 due to the lack of large and complete global datasets therefore the integration and analysis of available global field data from different sources to quantitatively assess the effects of k fertilization on crop wue at different scales and to identify the key factors influencing the response of field crops wue to k fertilization at different scales which will help to develop appropriate k fertilization management strategies for future global agricultural production under climate change in addition unlike individual field experiments the global synthesis is more comprehensive realistic and accurate in quantifying the crop wue response to k fertilization and its sources of heterogeneity to fill these knowledge gaps a global meta analysis was conducted to quantify the response of crop wue to k fertilization at field population wuefield whole plant wueplant and single leaf wueleaf scales our

into monocotyledons and dicotyledons and the photosynthetic pathway was separated into c3 and c4 k fertilizer type was divided into three categories k chloride k sulfate and others others included k nitrate a mixture of k nitrate and k chloride k application rate was divided into three categories lower k application rate lower than farmers practices equal k application rate equal to farmers practices and higher k application rate higher than farmers practices similarly irrigation amount was divided into four categories rainfed no irrigation under farmers practices lower irrigation amount lower than farmers practices equal irrigation amount equal than farmers practices and higher irrigation amount higher than farmers practices if multiple k application rates were set in the paper and a conclusion was given on the appropriate k application rate then the appropriate application rate was used as the local farmers practices rate if no appropriate application rate was given then the k application rate that maximizes crop wue was used as the local farmers practices rate if only a single k application rate was set in the paper and no indication was given of how high or low the rate was compared to the local k application rate then that rate was used as the local farmers practices rate the above method was also used to evaluate the level of irrigation amount for local farmers practices around the world 2 3 meta analysis a global meta analysis was conducted based on the three scales of field population whole plant and single leaf to quantify the magnitude of crop wue response to k fertilization by using the natural log of the response ratio ln rr hedges et al 1999 ln r r ln x e x c where ln rr is unitless and its positive and negative values represented an increase or decrease of crop wue in response to k fertilization respectively and xe and xc are the means of crop wue under experimental with k fertilizer application and control without k fertilizer application treatment respectively then the effect sizes of crop wue response to k fertilization were converted to a percentage as follows wang and zou 2020 effect s i z e e ln r r 1 100 the variance of ln rr v ln rr for each study was calculated from the standard deviation sd of crop wue as follows curtis and wang 1998 v ln r r s d e 2 ne x e 2 s d c 2 nc x c 2 where sde and sdc are the standard deviations of crop wue for the experimental and control groups respectively and ne and nc are the sample sizes of crop wue for the experimental and control groups respectively if only the standard error se of crop wue was given in the study then the sd was calculated as follows sd s e n where n represented the number of replicates as some studies where sd and se of crop wue were not given sd was estimated as 0 1 times the mean to use as many of these studies as possible in this meta analysis luo et al 2006 kallenbach and grandy 2011 tian et al 2015 a weighted random effects model was used to analyze the effect size of crop wue response to k fertilization according to hedges et al 1999 the weighted mean response ratio ln rr was calculated as follows ln r r i 1 k ω i ln r r i i 1 k ω i where k is the number of studies ωi is the weighting factors calculated as the inverse of the sample variance 1 v ln rr τ 2 and ln rr i represented the ln rr from the ith comparison the restricted maximum likelihood method was used to calculate the between group variance τ 2 as follows hedges et al 1999 τ 2 qt k 1 i 1 k ω i i 1 k ω i 2 i 1 k ω i where q t is the total heterogeneity across case studies if q t is significant p 0 05 it indicated that other explanatory variables may influence the response of crop wue to k fertilization then q t was partitioned into the within group q w and between group q b heterogeneity gurevitch et al 1992 if q b is significant p 0 05 it indicated that the corresponding explanatory variables are the important factors causing variation in crop wue response to k fertilization ouyang et al 2018 the 95 confidence interval ci for the ln rr was calculated as follows 95 c i ln r r 1 96 1 i 1 k ω i the mean effects of k fertilization on crop wue are considered significant if the 95 ci of the effect size did not overlap with zero p 0 05 and positive values represent increases negative values represent decreases all the meta analysis procedures were performed in metawin 2 1 software 64999 iterations sinauer associates inc sunderland ma usa rosenberg et al 2000 2 4 data analysis in this meta analysis q b was calculated to analyze the effects of k fertilization on crop wue among different subgrouping categories to prevent human screening or bias in the data itself from affecting the accuracy of the results a fail safe number m rosenthal s method at p 0 05 was used to test the effect of publication bias rosenthal 1979 and only results with m 5n 10 where n is the number of studies were used in this study as this indicates that there is no publication bias and the results are plausible viechtbauer 2007 the frequency distribution of the ln rr was plotted using the origin 2021 software program origin lab massachusetts usa and the frequency of ln rr was fitted to a gaussian distribution function in addition we also calculated the relative importance of every variable map mat soil texture soc soil ph soil ak crop type fertilizer

for 336 paired observations of wueleaf q t 702 2 p 0 001 fig 5 among different crop types k fertilization significantly increased the wueleaf of vegetables 11 3 and fruit 82 2 while significantly decreased the wueleaf of fiber crops 28 4 p 0 05 fig 5a this difference may be related to plant type and crop photosynthetic pathways with only the wueleaf of dicotyledonous or c3 crops responding

magnitude of the wueleaf response to k fertilization occurring for climate factors with map 800 mm 77 4 and mat 10 41 4 respectively fig 4d and e it should be noted that k fertilization significantly decreased wueleaf by 28 4 under 200 mm map 400 mm p 0 05 for different soil textures the effect size of k fertilization on wueleaf was significantly increased in coarse 18 3 and medium textured soil

factors including climate characteristics and soil properties and management practices for wuefield wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization was quantified by comparing standardized regression coefficients between different variables to assess the main factors influencing the response of crop wue to k fertilization at different scales fig 6 at the field population scale of crops environmental factors and management practices were equally important for the magnitude of the wuefield response to k fertilization with the relative importance of 49 8 and 50 2 respectively fig 6a among different variables the key factor influencing the magnitude of wuefield response to k fertilization was crop type at the whole plant scale of crops the relative importance of environmental factors and management practices in the magnitude of the wueplant response to k fertilization was 68 8 and 31 2 respectively with the key factor influencing the wueplant response to k fertilization being map fig 6b at the single leaf scale of crops the relative importance of environmental factors in the magnitude of the wueleaf response to k fertilization was much higher than that of management practices with soil ph being the key factor influencing the wue response to k fertilization fig 6c from field to plant to leaf the increasing relative importance of environmental factors and decreasing relative importance of management practices in the response of crop wue to k fertilization which means that improved understanding of field k fertilization management is essential in achieving efficient agricultural water use under climate change 3 5 response of wuefield wueplant and wueleaf to k fertilization as affected by climate characteristic as shown in fig 7 both climate characteristic map and mat positively affected the magnitude of the crop wue response to k fertilization at different scales the effect size of k fertilization on wuefield wueplant and wueleaf showed a significant linear increase with increasing map p 0 0001 fig 7a b and c for every 100 mm increase in map the effect size of k fertilization on wuefield wueplant and wueleaf increased by 0 9 10 3 and 4 0 percentage points respectively which indicated that the magnitude of wueplant response to k fertilization was more sensitive to map compared to wuefield and wueleaf similarly with increasing mat the effect size of k fertilization on wuefield wueplant and wueleaf showed a linear increase while only significantly in wuefield p 0 0118 and wueleaf p 0 0131 fig 7d e and f for every 1 increase in mat the effect size of k fertilization on wuefield and wueleaf increased by 0 3 and 1 6 percentage points respectively which indicated that the increase in temperature under global warming may lead to a more sensitive response of crop wue to k fertilization 3 6 response of wuefield wueplant and wueleaf to k fertilization as affected by soil properties the effect size of wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization was significantly affected by soc soil ph and ak while the effect size of wuefield response to k fertilization was only significantly affected by soil ph fig 8 the effect size of k fertilization on wuefield and wueplant showed a linear increase with increasing soc while only significantly in wueplant p 0 0001 fig 8a and b for every 1 g kg 1 increase in soc the effect size of k fertilization on wueplant increased by 1 4 percentage points while the magnitude of wueleaf response to k fertilization decreased by 2 4 percentage points fig 8c the magnitude of response of wuefield wueplant and wueleaf to k fertilization all showed a significant linear decrease with increasing soil ph p 0 001 fig 8d e and f for every unit increase in soil ph the effect size of wuefield wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization decreased by 3 4 24 7 and 20 1 percentage points respectively which indicated that the magnitude of wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization was more sensitive to soil ph compared to wuefield the effect size of wuefield wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization all decreased linearly with increasing soil ak whereas only significantly in wueplant and wueleaf p 0 001 fig 8g h and i for every 10 mg kg 1 increase in ak the effect size of wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization decreased by 1 5 and 1 9 percentage points respectively 3 7 response of wuefield wueplant and wueleaf to k fertilization as affected by agronomic management practices compared with the treatment without k fertilization the wuefield of potato maize rice jatropha curcas cotton wheat radish apple and other crops e g rapeseed with k fertilization treatment increased by 1 02 0 38 0 16 0 06 0 14 0 07 0 48 0 42 and 0 34 kg m 3 respectively table 1 rice showed the largest increase in wuefield 54 2 followed by cotton 24 5 maize 21 9 radish 19 7 other crops e g rapeseed 16 0 apple 15 0 potato 13 8 and jatropha curcas 5 5 compared with the treatment without k fertilization the wueplant of potato jatropha curcas cassava hybrid millet and others e g maize with k fertilization treatment increased by 0 16 0 06 0 97 0 40 and 0 39 kg m 3 respectively table 2 cassava showed the largest increase in wueplant 26 2 followed by other crops e g maize 25 7 hybrid millet 16 8 jatropha curcas 5 5 and potato 5 1 kiwi showed the largest increase in wueleaf 313 4 followed by nai plum 86 2 apple 38 6 ziziphus jujube 35 3 jun jujube 30 3 wheat 18 5 and tomato 17 7 while cotton showed a significant decrease in wueleaf 28 4 table 3 overall the response of wuefield and wueplant to k fertilization was significantly increased by water input including irrigation and precipitation p 0 05 fig 9 a and b however for every 100 mm increase in water input the effect size of wuefield response to k fertilization decreased by 1 6 percentage points the magnitude of wueleaf response to k fertilization was not significantly affected by water input fig 9c it should be noted that the effect size of k fertilization on maize wuefield increased with the increase of k application and showed a significant linear relationship p 0 0003 fig 9d in contrast there was a significant negative correlation between the magnitude of wheat wuefield response to k fertilization and the k application rate the overall response of crop wueplant to k fertilization was significantly affected by the k application rate p 0 001 fig 9e for every 100 kg hm 2 increase in k application rate the magnitude of wueleaf response to k fertilization increased by 55 0 8 4 and 67 5 percentage points in kiwi nai plum and ziziphus jujube respectively fig 9f 4 discussion 4 1 overall effects of k fertilization on crop wue and their controlling factors conclusive findings of this meta analysis showed that k fertilizer application to agricultural fields worldwide has increased crop wue not only at the field population scale but also at the whole plant and single leaf scales the overall effect size of k fertilization on wuefield wueplant and wueleaf were 19 0 12 0 and 29 9 fig 3 fig 4 and fig 5 respectively which indicated that field k fertilization management is important for agricultural production to cope with challenges posed by water scarcity under climate change the increase in wue was directly related to the reduction of unproductive water losses e g soil evapotranspiration and crop luxury transpiration from the crop by k fertilization brag 1972 martineau et al 2017 in addition k fertilization indirectly increased crop wue by promoting the expansion of leaf area to increase the cumulative amount of light intercepted to promote the synthesis of carbon assimilation products pettigrew 2003 ezui et al 2017 however hatam et al 2020 also reported that the increase in cotton transpiration rate was larger than the increase in net photosynthetic rate after the application of k fertilizer resulting in a decrease in the instantaneous wue of leaves to further explain this variability in crop wue response to k fertilization climatic characteristics e g map and mat soil properties e g soil texture soc soil ph soil ak and management practices e g crop type plant type photosynthetic pathway from 81 field based studies worldwide were grouped for analysis fig 3 fig 4 and fig 5 4 1 1 climatic characteristics to clarify the source of variation in the magnitude of crop wue response to k fertilization under different climatic regions we quantified the effect of map and mat rather than cumulative temperature and rainfall within the crop growing season on the magnitude of crop wue response to k fertilization on average the magnitude of crop wue response to k fertilization was higher in regions with map 800 mm as compared to regions with map 200 mm 200 map 400 mm and 400 mm map 800 mm fig 3d fig 4d and fig 5d which may be because the low k use efficiency in regions with map 800 mm limon ortega et al 2020 in addition the effect size of k fertilization on crop wuefield and wueleaf in regions with mat 10 was larger than in regions with mat 10 fig 3e fig 4e and fig 5e k guaranteed water and carbon transport of the plant under high temperatures by reducing the leaf temperature to maintain the crop canopy humidity and increased crop wue under high temperatures by enhancing the antioxidant enzyme activity and reducing the stomatal opening to reduce the transpiration rate and increase the net photosynthetic rate shahid et al 2019 sarwar et al 2022 thus we suggested that agricultural production in regions with map 800 mm or mat 10 should ensure an adequate supply of crop k fertilizer to ensure the effective use of agricultural water resources 4 1 2 soil properties soil texture determined the water and fertility holding capacity of the soil esetlili et al 2016 reported that k fertilizer was better applied in fine textured than in coarse textured similar results were found in our meta analysis where the effect size of k fertilization on crop wuefield was larger in medium textured than in coarse textured fig 3f which may be because the more compact soils of medium textured can trap more water and ak the results of the meta analysis of soc showed that k fertilization had the larger increase in crop wueleaf in soil with 5 g kg 1 soc 10 g kg 1 as compared to soc 10 g kg 1 fig 5g which may be due to a suitable soc concentration can promote soil structure formation and microbial activity song et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 thus promoting soil adsorption of water and nutrient activation while an excessive soc concentration can lead to increased microbial respiratory activity resulting in lower oxygen concentration in the soil which is detrimental to crop water and nutrient uptake wang et al 2022 soil ph was one of the main drivers of variation in soil ak which in turn affected the magnitude of crop wue response to k fertilization the results showed that the effect size of k fertilization on crop wuefield was larger in soil with 6 5 ph 7 5 than with ph 6 5 and ph 7 5 fig 3h while the effect size of k fertilization on crop wueplant and wueleaf were larger in soil with ph 6 5 than with 6 5 ph 7 5 and ph 7 5 fig 4h and fig 5h which indicated that the response of crop wue to k fertilization will become more sensitive in acidic soil a long term field experiment by liu et al 2020 reported that soil ph significantly affected the non available k concentration of soil aggregates and that higher k fertilizer utilization in acidic soil was due to lower soil k concentration which is consistent with the results of our meta analysis qiu et al 2014 concluded that additional k fertilization did not have a significant yield and efficiency increase in fields with abundant soil k pools although there were comprehensive effects of soil ak and the k application in crop response to k fertilization but soil ak k fertilizer type and k application rate varied among field studies in our meta analysis and it was difficult to quantify their comprehensive effects on crop wue therefore we analyzed the effect of soil ak in crop wue response to k fertilization separately without considering k fertilization and its comprehensive impact the effect size of k fertilization on crop wue was larger in soil with ak 75 mg kg 1 than with 75 mg kg 1 ak 150 mg kg 1 and ak 150 mg kg 1 fig 3i fig 4i and fig 5i thus we suggested that k fertilization was an effective way to improve crop wue for sustainable agricultural production in regions with soil properties medium textured or 5 g kg 1 soc 10 g kg 1 or ph 6 5 or ak 75 mg kg 1 4 1 3 management practices wue of different crop types responded differently to k fertilization at the same scale fig 3a fig 4a and fig 5a which provided a theoretical reference for the development of field k management strategies for different crops at field population and whole plant scale k fertilization was more effective in increasing wuefield of cereals compared to oil crops tuber crops and fruit fig 3a and fig 4a especially for rice where the increase was the largest table 1 which is consistent with our previously reported results that k plays an important role in maintaining high wue in rice yang et al 2022 in addition in fig 4a we found a larger 95 ci for the wueplant of vegetables in response to k fertilization which may be related to its small sample size n 4 or to the large differences in the magnitude of the wueplant response to k fertilization for different vegetable species appendix a while at single leaf scale k fertilization significantly increased the wueleaf of fruits while it significantly decreased the wueleaf of fiber crop fig 5a especially for kiwi where the increase in wueleaf reached 313 4 table 3 which is related to the fact that kiwi is more sensitive to k than other mineral elements during fruit expansion stage as reported by santoni et al 2014 in addition another important explanation for the greater susceptibility of wue of rice and kiwi to k fertilization compared to other crops is that their photosynthetic pathways are dominated by c3 fig 5c and their own wue is much lower than that of other crops table 1 and table 3 therefore we suggested that more attention should be paid to the management of k fertilization of cereals vegetables and fruit in the field especially for rice where k fertilization is 2 5 and 7 6 times more effective in increasing wue than maize and wheat respectively in addition to crop type management practices such as k fertilizer type irrigation level and k fertilization level can also significantly affect the response of crop wue to k fertilization for example k chloride was more effective in increasing crop wuefield than k sulfate while it was less effective in increasing crop wueleaf than k sulfate fig 3j and fig 5j chen et al 2021 also found that k sulfate was more effective than k chloride in enhancing photosynthesis of cotton and increasing soil ak concentration which may be because the additional sulphur nutrient added by k sulfate which is an important component of protein and can significantly increase enzyme activity in the crop gigolashvili and kopriva 2014 it should be noted that although the effect size of k fertilization on wueleaf increased with increasing k application rate fig 5k while higher k application rate did not maximize the increase in the magnitude of wuefield and wueplant response to k fertilization fig 3k and fig 4k which was similarly reported in several previous studies pervez et al 2004 zain et al 2014 zhang et al 2022e in addition although the effect size of k fertilization on wuefield increased with increasing water input fig 3l while higher water input did not maximize the increase in the magnitude of wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization fig 4l and fig 5l which was similarly reported by liu et al 2021 and zhang et al 2022b interestingly k fertilizer inputs in rainfed farming systems can also result in a large increase in crop wuefield and wueplant these results indicated that scientific water and k fertilization management in the field has a greater potential to achieve efficient crop water use and sustainable agricultural production therefore we suggested that k fertilizer inputs should give priority to k sulfate and provide equal water input and k application rate according to the water and k requirements of the crop in agricultural systems 4 2 inconsistencies in the magnitude of response of wuefield wueplant and wueleaf to k fertilization and their drivers medrano et al 2015 reported a significant correlation between wueplant and leaf intrinsic water use efficiency while this relationship was worse with increasing water stress which implied that crop wue between different scales may show a strong heterogeneity with environment change similarly our meta analysis showed that the magnitude of wuefield wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization was inconsistent which may be caused by differences in the sample sizes or k fertilization rate at field population scale the key factor affecting crop wuefield response to k fertilization was crop type fig 6a for example k fertilization significantly increased wuefield of cereals fiber crops tuber crops and vegetables while there was no significant effect on fruit fig 3a conversely k fertilization significantly increased wueleaf of fruit while significantly decreased wueleaf of fiber crops and there was no significant effect on cereals tuber crops and vegetables fig 5a wuefield and wueleaf were inconsistent in response to k fertilization which similarly with the results found by wang et al 2013b that wuefield and wueleaf were inconsistent at different nitrogen levels in addition our results showed that there was a significant difference in the response of wue to k fertilization between c3 and c4 crops at single leaf scale fig 5c while there was no significant difference at field population and whole plant scales fig 3c and fig 4c which may be because wue at different scales is inherently inconsistent across vegetation types medlyn et al 2017 field water input was significantly and positively correlated with the magnitude of response to k fertilization for wuefield and wueplant fig 9a and b while it was not significant for wueleaf fig 9c k application rate was positively correlated with the magnitude of response to k fertilization for wueplant fig 9e while it was not significant for wuefield and wueleaf fig 9d and f at whole plant and single leaf scales the key factors affecting the response of wueplant and wueleaf to k fertilization were map and soil ph respectively fig 6b and c with increasing map the increase of wueplant is higher than that of wuefield fig 7a and b which indicated that the increase in dry matter of the crop caused by k fertilization was higher than the increase in economic yield unlike wuefield and wueplant wueleaf was more sensitive to mat than map fig 7d e and f which is similar with several previous studies showed that mat was significantly more strongly correlated with plant traits than was map zhang et al 2010 moles et al 2014 goldsmith et al 2017 remarkably the magnitude of wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization was significantly correlated with soc soil ph and soil ak while the magnitude of wuefield response to k fertilization was only significantly correlated with soil ph fig 8 which may be because the most important factor in soil properties that affects the physiological processes of crop water use was soil ph zhang et al 2022b low soil ph will result in lower wueleaf li et al 2022 overall the relative importance of management practice in the magnitude of the wuefield wueplant and wueleaf was low as 50 2 31 2 and 18 0 respectively which indicated that climatic characteristics and soil properties are drivers of crop wue response to k fertilization rather than management practices 4 3 uncertainties and perspectives although our meta analysis provides an insight into the response of crop wue to k fertilization based on the three scales of field population whole plant and single leaf the following uncertainties may exist across studies due to inherent limitations of the synthetic analysis approach and differences in data quality i more than 70 of the study sites in our database were located in asia fig 1 with fewer observations from south america and europe while these regions account for approximately 30 of the world s total cropland area fao 2020 thus there is still a deficit in representing all climatic characteristics soil properties and management practices of global cropland this requires field measurements of wue for various crops at different scales in regions not covered by the dataset and statistics on field environment factors and management practices to compensate for the deficiencies of the database in terms of the breadth of observations ii the appropriate water input and k application rate for the specific crop from different scales of wue were not provided due to the small sample size of data on management practices in our database fig 9 this requires that gradient field experiments worldwide of irrigation amount and k application rate be conducted on various crops to quantify the relationship between the magnitude of wue response to k fertilization and management practices at different scales thus bridging the gap from theory to practice in the meta analysis approach furthermore due to the variability of global cropland climatic characteristics and soil properties crop types were not uniformly distributed and those grown on a large scale under specific climatic characteristics and soil properties were often locally dominant crops in the process of classifying crop types we cannot avoid the comprehensive effects of climate characteristics and soil properties therefore this requires conducting experiments on the response of wue to k fertilization in different crop types under the same field iii the process by which the response of crop wue to k fertilization is transformed between scales is not yet clear for example the magnitude of wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization was more susceptible to soil properties than wuefield but the specific physiological and biochemical mechanisms are still not fully understood ultimately future work will further reveal the relationship between different scales of crop wue and the realization of the transformation between multi scale wue to achieve this it is important to explore the response of crop wue to k fertilization at different scales in the same field to exclude the influence of potential environmental factors and management practices iv the effect of the global application of other fertilizers such as nitrogen and phosphorus on crop wue at different scales still needs to be quantified du et al 2021 and liu et al 2022 demonstrated by the meta analysis that nitrogen fertilizer application can significantly increase wheat wuefield but these studies mostly focused on a single region crop and scale future work will further compile the current global knowledge on crop wue at the three scales of field population whole plant and single leaf in field studies of other fertilizer applications such as nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers to provide a theoretical basis for nutrient management decisions for efficient production of water resources in global agriculture 5 conclusion global synthesis results showed that the magnitude of crop wue response to k fertilization at the three scales of field population wuefield whole plant wueplant and single leaf wueleaf were 19 0 12 0 and 29 9 respectively while key factors affecting the magnitude of wuefield wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization were crop type mean annual precipitation and soil ph respectively it should be noted that the magnitude of wuefield wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization was significantly positively correlated with mean annual precipitation while significantly negatively correlated with soil ph which implying that k fertilization is an effective way to improve crop wue in the region with humid climate or acidic soil compared to local farmers k application rates although higher application rates of k significantly increased crop wueleaf there was no significant increase in wuefield overall the k application rate was significantly positively correlated with the increase in wueplant with a 5 percentage point increase in wueplant for every 100 kg hm 2 increase in k application rate furthermore the conclusive findings of this meta analysis showed that the relative importance of environmental factors in the magnitude of the wuefield wueplant and wueleaf response to k fertilization was 49 8 68 8 and 82 0 respectively which provides new insight into the crop wue response to k fertilization from field plant to leaf was driven by environmental factors and highlights the potential importance of improving crop wue through field k fertilization management to meet

1844,though flash drought is an intrinsically three dimensional phenomenon that evolves in both temporal and spatial dimensions most studies have overlooked its spatiotemporal features by analyzing its characteristics at individual grid points the rapid expansion of drought over time and space also brings great challenges for drought monitoring and management strategies focusing on the mapping of rapid development trajectories of drought in the three dimensional space this study proposes the normalized area time accumulation nata curve to describe the evolution characteristics of flash drought using the nata curve information about the expansion rate of drought area over time and the dominant severity of drought area can be extracted on this basis such drought events were classified and investigated considering drought monitoring difficulty and potential drought damages results showed that the shape of proposed nata curve and the slope of curves of varying severity levels had explicit indicative function for distinguishing drought events characterized by flash and drought events from traditional slowly evolving drought events drought events which have a rapid rate of area expansion and high drought severity mostly meets the characteristics of flash droughts in the spatiotemporal dimensions the findings highlight the significance of incorporating information on drought area expansion with time for an efficient recognition and improved accuracy of rapid drought development from a three dimensional perspective this is a step forward for flash drought identification in a higher dimension the proposed nata curve provides intuitive and comprehensive information on how drought evolves over time and space and is a promising alternative method to analyze drought characteristics from a three dimensional perspective keywords drought flash drought drought identification soil moisture spatiotemporal dimensions data availability i have provided a description of data availability in the paper 1 introduction flash droughts have aroused considerable attention in recent years compared with traditional slowly evolving droughts flash droughts are characterized by sudden onset and rapid intensification svoboda et al 2002 otkin et al 2018 that leave less time for early warning and preparation and may impose severe impacts on ecosystems and economic development chen et al 2021 sehgal et al 2021 mukherjee and mishra 2022 qing et al 2022 gerken et al 2018 poonia et al 2022 otkin et al 2022 for example a catastrophic drought in the central united states during the summer of 2012 had substantial impacts on energy systems water resources and agricultural production resulting in estimated economic losses of over 30 billion hoerling et al 2014 otkin et al 2016 basara et al 2019 china has also suffered serious flash droughts in recent years for instance the reduction of agricultural production in jiangxi province led to direct economic losses of approximately 260 million dollars in 2003 zhang et al 2017 in the context of climate change flash droughts have become more frequent in different regions of the world such as australia the u s africa and southern china gerken et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 he et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 liu et al 2020a nguyen et al 2021 christian et al 2021 hao 2022 there is currently a lack of consensus on how to define a flash drought lisonbee et al 2021 i e whether it should be based on its short duration mo and lettenmaier 2015 mo and lettenmaier 2016 or instead be based on its rapid intensification otkin et al 2014 2018 the emphasis on short duration drought may lead to misjudgment and the settings of each threshold is also debatable liu et al 2020b focusing on the rate of soil moisture intensification process is another approach that has been widely used in recent studies hunt et al 2014 otkin et al 2014 otkin et al 2018 liu et al 2020b for example the changes of soil moisture from above the 40 percentile to below the 20 percentile within 20 days ford and labosier 2017 has been employed as a criterion which ensures that the identified events have the characteristics of both flash and drought in addition several researchers used new drought indicators e g standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index and evaporative stress index and introduce new technologies such as machine learning to analyze flash droughts otkin et al 2013 nguyen et al 2019 hao et al 2020 osman et al 2021 tyagi et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 like all drought flash drought is a phenomenon that evolves simultaneously over space and time most current studies have neglected the synchronous changes of flash drought in spatiotemporal dimensions by simplifying analysis into lower dimensional subspace i e analyzing the rate of change of soil moisture or another relevant variable at discrete sites or grid cells such treatments of descending dimension may miss the temporal and spatial links among drought patches which is essential for understanding drought development and migration behavior at large scales chen et al 2019 feng et al 2021 although the three dimensional drought identification approach proposed by andreadis et al 2005 and improved by lloyd huges 2012 has been widely applied for revisiting global and regional drought events wang et al 2011 xu et al 2015 herrera estrada et al 2017 and characterizing drought propagation zhu et al 2019 studies specific to flash drought are generally rare gou et al 2022 li et al 2022 how to define flash drought e g which parameter are competent for representing the rapid intensification rates of flash drought in the spatiotemporal dimensions is a major obstacle to be addressed before extending the existing three dimensional drought identification approach to flash drought the aim of this study therefore is to develop an approach to identify rapid drought expansion in three dimensions and discuss the connection between such areal expansion and evolution of flash drought in higher dimensions based on the existing three dimensional identification approach liu et al 2019 we moved one step further by introducing additional criteria to distinguish the rapid expansion processes from traditional slowly evolving ones we proposed a new curve that provides an intuitive view of the spatiotemporal evolution of drought combined with the variation of drought severity to assess the potential damage of drought on ecological and hydrological systems the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi wang et al 2022 was employed for analysis as an active factor in modulating the water and carbon cycles of most ecosystems vegetation controls the land atmosphere exchanges of water and energy and responds quickly to the water stresses in the soil wang et al 2014 novick et al 2016 lanning et al 2020 the reminder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the data and methods and section 3 presents the result of three dimensional identification and the application of the proposed curve for distinguishing drought types with varied features such as drought monitoring difficulty and potential drought damages section 4 discusses the findings and some conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 data and methods 2 1 data daily soil moisture data provided by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf reanalysis era product https www ecmwf int en forecasts were used to characterize droughts in china during 1979 2018 the data set supplied soil moisture sm estimates for four layers namely 0 7 cm 7 28 cm 28 100 cm and 100 289 cm albergel et al 2013 in this study we used the top three layers of the sm product at a 0 25 spatial resolution daily volumetric soil water m3 m3 data from 1979 to 2018 were aggregated to weekly values to identify droughts weekly soil moisture percentiles were derived from the eight candidate theoretical distributions including the exponential gamma beta lognormal logic weibull generalized extreme value and generalized pareto distributions the best probability distribution function was chosen according to the kolmogorov smirnov test results and the root mean square error rmse the detailed different theoretical probability distributions were employed for each week according to the goodness of fit test results the detailed steps for selecting the best probability distribution function are provided in the supplementary material section s1 in this way the original soil moisture series were converted to percentile values which further served for flash drought identification the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi 3rd generation dataset used in this study is produced by the global inventory monitoring and modelling studies gimms group https ecocast arc nasa gov da ta pub gimms 3g v1 it is derived from the u s national oceanic and atmospheric administration s advanced very high resolution radiometer satellite record the ndvi data from 1982 to 2015 were collected with a spatial resolution of 0 083 and a temporal interval of 15 days in this study the original data were resampled into a spatial resolution of 0 25 and the values of ndvi nearest to the date of weekly soil moisture percentile were extracted to reflect the vegetation condition a standardized procedure was performed by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation to obtain the anomalous values of ndvi positive anomalies of ndvi indicate good health conditions for vegetation while negative values indicate an inhibitive effect on vegetation growth 2 2 methods drought is an intrinsically three dimensional phenomenon that develops in both temporal and spatial dimensions feng et al 2021 xu et al 2015a lloyd hughes 2012 in this study a three dimensional identification method previously proposed by andreadis et al 2005 and developed by lloyd hughes 2012 was employed for identifying droughts this method acquires three dimensional drought events by spatially identifying and temporally connecting adjacent drought patches into a drought object in this study we build upon this method by further extracting drought events with flash expansion characteristics the superiority of the three dimensional approach lies in comparing to the traditional two dimensional flash drought method which only considers the rate of development of soil moisture deficits at a single site grid both the magnitude of soil moisture deficits and the expansion of affected area are considered in higher spaces which is close to the real development of drought 2 2 1 drought identification in spatiotemporal dimensions the three dimensional drought identification method can be divided into two major parts namely the spatial identification and temporal connection for each week a grid with soil moisture percentile below 0 3 wang and yuan 2018 was considered as under drought then the 3 3 neighborhood of the under drought grid cell is searched and the neighboring grids under drought were grouped into the same drought patch and the clusters with area smaller than the minimum threshold of drought patch area were filtered out given their minor influences for temporal connection the remaining clusters were combined into larger objects according to a predetermined minimum overlapping area in two adjacent weeks the thresholds for the minimum drought patch area and overlapping area are important parameters which can be adjusted according to the area of the study domain following wang et al 2011 a threshold value of 150 000 km2 equivalent to 200 grid cells in this study was employed for the minimum drought patch area details on the sensitive test of the selection of thresholds can be found in supplementary material s2 the definition of drought characteristics is also different from that in lower spaces in the three dimensional continuum drought duration is defined as the temporal span from the initial drought patches to the terminal drought patches which could be in different locations as drought conditions first expand and then contract similar to cases in two dimensions the drought affected area for each week can be extracted to show the areal expansion process the maximum drought affected region i e the chinese region affected by a drought event is calculated as the intersection of the projection of the affected area over whole persistence period of the event drought severity reflects the degree of water deficiency for a drought event and can be calculated by the sum of the differences between the soil moisture percentile and the soil moisture threshold used to identify drought 0 3 summed over all drought affected grid points drought intensity is defined as drought severity per drought area and per drought duration in addition we also extract the geometrical characteristics of drought events including the north south length east west length and perimeter the east west and north south lengths refer to the maximum span lengths of the maximum drought affected area in both directions the perimeter is the length of the maximum drought affected area 2 3 normalized area time accumulation curve with all drought events identified a method was used to determine whether a drought is a drought event with rapid expansion over time and space from a three dimensional perspective since more drought information is incorporated under higher dimensions e g growth of drought area etc additional flash characteristics are necessary to indicate such rapid drought events a new curve named the normalized area time accumulation nata curve was proposed for assessing the spatiotemporal evolution of drought this curve reflects the spatial and temporal evolution of drought thereby making drought events of different shapes comparable under three dimensional identification through this curve increases in drought area over time were used to capture the rapid expansion of drought the accumulated area in each week was normalized by the total accumulated area of the drought event 1 no r area cu m c u r r e n t a r e a cu m t o t a l a r e a where norarea represents the normalized area cumcurrent area represents the accumulated area of this drought in the current period and cumtotal area represents the sum of the accumulated area of this drought in the whole period the duration for the current week was also normalized to match norarea 2 no r time curren t t i m e tota l t i m e where nortime represents the normalized time current time represents the current number of weeks of drought occurrence and total time represents the total number of weeks of drought events fig 1 depicts the spatiotemporal evolution of three drought events using the nata approach the 1 1 line dashed line represents a hypothetical state where the drought area increases uniformly with time if the curve deviates from the 1 1 line it represents a nonuniform variation in the spatiotemporal dimensions as shown in fig 1a the slope of the green curve was close to the 1 1 line throughout the expansion phase indicating a uniform growth of drought area over time in contrast the purple and blue lines in fig 1a suggest that the drought affected area can also grow rapidly and maintain a relatively high affected area i e nortime from 0 02 to 0 43 and from 0 33 to 0 67 which is a substantial rapid development process to emphasize such rapid development and maintenance periods the dash dotted line was used when the slope was substantially higher than 1 the black solid dots also referred to as the inflection point represent the onset time of rapid area expansion in the following weeks for example the purple dash dotted line had a slope of 2 00 from the inflection point to 35 weeks i e nortime from 0 04 to 0 43 the initial drought affected area in this period was 657 680 km2 which rapidly increased to 3 033 973 km2 during the following three weeks i e nortime from 0 04 to 0 07 and then fluctuated around 2 446 487 km2 in the following weeks in this sense the period from 0 02 to 0 43 was recognized as rapid expansion and maintained the period due to the slope of 2 0 the black hollow point in fig 1a represents the termination of the rapid drought expansion with the accumulated drought affected area thereafter increasing at a slower rate the above curves identified the flash characteristics of drought event with rapid expansion the varied drought characteristics of drought event with rapid expansion e g the magnitude of drought and corresponding damages to vegetation are also essential to distinguish droughts with varied damages the blue curve in fig 1a was disassembled into three curves in fig 1b for assessing the magnitude of drought to this end the nata curves of different severity levels were extracted i e moderate drought area yellow line 0 2 soil moisture percentile 0 3 severe drought area red line 0 1 soil moisture percentile 0 2 and extreme drought area dark red line 0 soil moisture percentile 0 1 accordingly the largest slope of the three disassembled nata curves represented the dominant role of the drought process the nata curve provides information on how drought evolves in the three dimensional continuum according to the characteristics of flash expansion and drought severity drought events can be distinguished from aspects of drought monitoring difficulty and potential drought damages a drought event that is rapidly growing in area but not at a high level of drought severity would have minimal effects on agriculture or the environment similarly if a drought event of high severity over a small area fails to expand rapidly in space its damaging effects on associated sectors are generally minor since many areas will remain drought free 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal patterns of drought characteristics following the three dimensional identification method 734 drought events during 1979 2018 in china were recognized and 163 drought events with duration of at least 4 weeks were selected for further analysis fig 2 shows the percentage of weeks under drought in china during 1979 2018 higher values indicated longer persistence of drought while lower values indicated shorter persistence of drought overall the number of weeks under drought mainly showed a decreasing pattern from east to west with the percentage values varying between 24 and 31 for example the northern part of northeast china exhibited a high value with 33 indicating that approximately 686 weeks were under drought from 1979 to 2018 similarly the yellow river basin the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin and the huang huai hai region also experienced long term droughts these regions were mostly agricultural production bases and were more vulnerable to agricultural losses with long lasting exposure under drought in contrast total drought persistence in parts of northwest china was generally short with percentage values less than 14 table 1 shows the drought characteristics of the 10 most severe drought events of different persistence i e short term drought 4 weeks to 12 weeks medium short drought 13 weeks to 26 weeks and long term drought 26 weeks or longer the no 88 drought event occurred from may 1996 to july 1996 8 weeks and swept over 49 6 105 km2 approximately half of china was ranked as the most severe event among short term droughts it can be seen that the intensity of drought was 0 150 and the total cumulative affected area affected reached 125 46 105 km2 within 8 weeks we also used the geometrical characteristics to indicate the spatiotemporal trajectories of such drought events compared to other short term drought events the 1996 summer drought had the largest magnitude in terms of all these features similarly for medium short droughts the 2000 spring drought i e no 105 event also exhibited a rapid increase of affected area and thus was more damaging than the 2018 drought i e no 161 event these findings suggest the magnitude of droughts may reach a high level both in area and severity within a shorter time period 3 2 drought spatiotemporal patterns indicated by nata curve 3 2 1 flash characteristics following the nata curve described above the spatial expansion of each drought event over time can be recognized which provided a visualized image for distinguishing droughts with flash expansion characteristics from those that evolve more slowly as shown in fig 3 the 1987 summer drought in the northeast region is a typical example where the increase in the total drought affected area varies nonuniformly in spatiotemporal dimensions through the nata curve fig 3a we can see that the total drought area curve significantly deviated from the 1 1 line during the early and middle periods nor time from 0 2 to 0 5 with a slope of 1 92 such a rapid increase in drought area was consistent with the changes in the three dimensional drought continuum fig 3b i e the drought area in 4 6 weeks was much larger than that in other weeks to quantify the expansion rate of drought area the spatiotemporal evolution of the 1987 drought from the onset time t 0 to the maximum of drought affected area t 4 was extracted as shown in fig 5 the nonuniformly spatiotemporally evolving event initiated in the western part of northeast china with several patches experiencing severe dry conditions from 4 june to 2 july the dry soil conditions intensified and moved eastward which eventually spread over the majority of northeast china during these five weeks the total drought area increased at a rate of 5 27 i e a 5 27 fold expansion of the maximum drought area relative to the initial drought area the 1997 drought from 9 july to 10 september represented another case where drought also persisted as long as the 1987 drought but its areal expansion was relatively stable as shown in fig 4 a the nata curve of the 1997 drought was relatively close to the 1 1 line which can be viewed as a uniform evolution process in spatiotemporal dimensions this was consistent with the smooth and slow development process of drought events fig 6 presents the projection of affected area for the 1997 drought this drought event began on 9 july covering a small part of northwest china despite this very dry condition the drought affected area did not expand rapidly with an areal growth rate of 1 35 it was evident that the 1997 drought evolved much more slowly than the 1987 drought over space in general the nata curves provided informative images depicting how the total drought affected area varied over time and provide a tool to distinguish droughts with flash expansion characteristics from those that evolve more slowly when the nata curve significantly deviates from the 1 1 line it indicates a nonuniformly spatiotemporal evolution with a rapid expansion of drought area accordingly when the nata curve approached the 1 1 line it indicated a uniformly spatiotemporal evolution with the drought area increasing much more slowly with time 3 2 2 drought severity of expanded area with the nata curve drought events that rapidly expanded over time and space can be recognized i e the time period that nata curve presented a nonuniformly evolved pattern however their impacts and damages to the ecosystem can be different given the varied severity levels of increased area the drought event that occurred from december 1985 to february 1986 is a case that had flash expansion characteristics but the increased drought area for each time interval was of low severity as shown in fig 7 a the slope of nata curve was 1 73 which is a typical nonuniformly evolved process with respect to the behavior of each drought category it can be seen that the curve of moderate drought was generally higher than that of severe and extreme droughts according to fig 7b and 7c it is apparent that the 1986 event was dominated by moderate drought with the corresponding percentage exceeding 40 while the area of extreme drought only accounted for a small proportion during the whole drought process by contrast the 1983 drought event also showed a nonuniformly evolving with a slope of 1 70 pattern but its impacts may be more damaging as shown in fig 8 c this event was dominated by extreme drought with the percentage above 50 in most of the weeks while moderate drought merely accounted for a small proportion to investigate the impacts of these two drought events on vegetation the negative anomalies of ndvi during drought episodes were extracted for each drought affected grid point fig 9 the probability density distribution of the 1983 drought red curve had a more negative mean 0 75 than that of the 1986 drought blue curve 0 57 with respect to the tail characteristics of the probability density distribution i e the upper right corner panel in fig 9 it can be seen that the minimum 5 and 10 values of the 1983 drought event were about 1 5 1 9 and 3 5 respectively which were all lower than those of the 1986 drought event this showed the differentiated influences among droughts of varied severity levels compared to moderate drought dominated events events dominated by extreme drought were more destructive by inducing more severe vegetation impacts 3 3 typology of droughts in three dimensional spaces based on an in depth analysis of the spatiotemporal evolution patterns of drought events a drought typology is proposed with the monitoring difficulty and potential drought impacts as basic principles in section 3 2 1 it was found that the shape of the nata curve had implications for distinguishing events containing flash expansion characteristics from slower evolving events i e a nonuniform pattern of the nata curve suggested a rapid evolution process of drought that is more challenging for drought monitoring the potential drought impacts can be measured by the expanded area of drought severity categories where an extreme drought dominated event was undoubtedly more destructive than events dominated by moderate drought accordingly five drought categories were distinguished in the three dimensional spaces i e uniformly evolving events dominated by moderate drought type ⅰ uniformly evolving events dominated by extreme drought type ⅱ uniformly evolving events dominated by moderate and severe droughts type iii nonuniformly evolving events dominated by moderate drought type ⅳ and nonuniformly evolving events dominated by extreme drought type ⅴ fig 10 exhibits drought events identified in spatiotemporal dimensions and the drought types they belong to given the wide variation of drought duration a logarithmic processing was performed for the horizontal axis meanwhile enveloping curves were added to more clearly identify groups of events with similar drought type for uniformly evolved events i e type i ii and iii the increments of area generally followed constant speed over time with scatters evenly distributed around a straight line representing the average increase rate of drought area by contrast the envelope curves of type ⅳ and type ⅴ were generally slanted upward especially type ⅴ indicating a rapid expansion of drought area within very short time period such rapid expansion of nonuniformly evolving events left less time for preparation and their spatiotemporal migration trajectories were also difficult to capture which made these event difficult to monitor in addition scatter sizes also showed the distinction among drought types in terms of drought occurrences events with flash characteristics i e type iv and type v only accounted for a small proportion of historical drought events but their associated ecological impacts cannot be ignored given their severe magnitude over time and space as shown in fig 11 four metrics including the minimum 5 10 and average values derived from the probability density distribution of ndvi anomalies under drought type i and type v were employed to compare their influences on vegetation health among them the minimum values exhibited the largest distinction between type i and type v with the gaps of ndvi anomalies by 0 9 fig 11a followed by 5 and 10 values while minor differences were found for the average values in addition all four statistical metrics revealed a similar pattern where vegetation conditions under type i exhibited larger variabilities than cases under type v these results suggest that events of drought type v were more destructive to vegetation with potential irrecoverable impacts in some cases with information extracted from the nata curve a drought typology distinguishing events from the aspects of monitoring difficulty and expansion of drought area in varied categories is shown in table 2 with both great difficulty of drought monitoring and deteriorating impacts on vegetation the drought type ⅴ generally met the characteristics of both flash expansion and drought as for events of type iv they evolved more rapidly in three dimensional spaces and whether they severely damage vegetation depends on the proportion of each increased drought severity area for events of types i to iii these are more typical slowly evolving droughts and some preparations can be made to reduce potential drought losses 4 discussion drought is widely recognized as a phenomenon that develops in the spatial and temporal dimensions to improve the understanding of how drought evolves over time and space andreadis et al 2005 first introduced the definition of contiguous drought area cda which can aggregate spatial cells into drought clusters this method has been further applied for analyzing the three dimensional migration patterns of droughts at global and regional scales e g xu et al 2015 herrera estrada et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 verhoeven et al 2022 diaz et al 2020 rakovec et al 2022 meanwhile attempts of improving the three dimensional drought tracking algorithm can be found in recent literature for instance cammalleri and toreti 2023 proposed a new algorithm by introducing a set of six parameters that control both the spatial and the temporal connectivity between cells under drought conditions and also accounting for the local intensity of the drought itself as a newly recognized type of drought the characteristics of flash drought have mostly been analyzed in lower spaces while overlooking its spatiotemporal features in higher dimensions the motivation of this study therefore was to propose a method to fill this gap to do this we employed a three dimensional identification approach to identify historical drought events across china then we proposed the nata curve to distinguish drought events characterized by rapid expansion from other droughts that develop more uniformly with time in particular the expansion of drought area over time was employed to depict the trajectory of space time evolution which is different from previous studies that focus on the behavior at an individual site or grid cell meanwhile the nata curve provided an intuitive image on the evolution characteristics of drought and one can easily judge whether the event has the characteristics of flash expansion and drought or not according to the shape or slope of the curve and the area percentage for different drought severity categories in addition the normalized treatment of accumulated drought area over time made drought events of varied development processes comparable which facilitates recognizing droughts of varied features based on the information extracted from the nata curve a conceptual framework of drought topology was proposed considering the monitoring difficulty and potential drought impacts as two concerned factors compared to slowly evolving drought it is much more difficult to prepare for drought with rapid expansion given the rapid outbreak of drought and the rapid growth of its spatial extent particularly for drought area it is commonly viewed as one of the drought characteristics in lower spaces rather than a criterion for event identification e g ford and labosier 2017 it is necessary to consider the rapid development of drought affected area to acquire a more detailed understanding of drought besides the damages caused by drought are also essential factors to measure the magnitude of drought extreme drought dominated events impose devastating effects on vegetation in general type ⅴ can be mostly close to the rapid intensification of flash drought under the two dimensional definition because of its rapid expansion of drought area and extreme drought levels whether there is a link between these rapid drought events and flash droughts needs to be further verified considering soil moisture of different depths may respond differently to the increased atmospheric water demand shah et al 2022 to verify the applicability and robustness of the proposed framework for flash drought analysis we also analyzed flash drought by using era5 soil moisture of the top two soil layers 0 28 cm as expected minor differences can be found for the characteristics of flash drought but the overall patterns indicated by soil moisture data of top two layers 0 28 cm are generally consistent with those by 0 1 m soil moisture data for example fig s1 shows the percentage of weeks under drought in china during 1979 2018 soil moisture of 0 28 cm depth it can be seen that expect for southwest china where drought also present longer persistence the spatial patterns indicated by soil moisture of top two layers are generally consistent with those identified by soil moisture of 0 1 m depth fig 2 similar to the findings by shah et al 2022 the differences may be related to the different response of soil moisture at different layers to the increased atmospheric water demand previous studies also indicated higher frequency of flash drought in the southwest region in china by using soil moisture data of the top layer e g liu et al 2020 in addition we also selected typical events to analyze their patterns in the nata curve as done with the 0 1 m soil moisture data figs s2 s10 similar to the findings with the 0 1 m soil moisture data the results from the 0 28 cm soil moisture data show that there is still significant discrepancy between drought type ⅰ and type ⅴ in terms of the potential impact to vegetation and drought events which have a rapid expansion and high drought severity are more destructive to vegetation than other types the results confirm the robustness of the proposed normalized area time accumulation curve for flash drought identification with soil moisture data of different depths in the spatiotemporal dimensions it is worth mentioning that the proposal of drought typology is based on the slope of nata curve and dominant severity levels of drought and the boundaries are not sharp between drought types in other words there is no explicit threshold or quantitative value of curve slope or proportion of dominant drought area to distinguish droughts among five types but rather we would like to provide an alternative to understand how drought may proceed in spatiotemporal spaces and their potential damages to the environment this may be beneficial for stakeholders to make timely and effective measures to mitigate the effects of drought and drought risk management ongoing researches on the applicability of nata curve in different regions are necessary 5 conclusions revolving around the issue of flash drought identification in three dimensional spaces this study proposed a nata curve to characterize the evolution of drought we first identified historical drought events and their characteristics in the spatiotemporal dimension and then implemented a normalization procedure for the accumulated area over time both the expansion of drought area and drought severity were incorporated into the nata curve on this basis ndvi anomalies were employed to evaluate the impacts of drought of varied severity and classification of drought events was investigated from aspects of drought monitoring difficulty and potential drought damages results showed that during the past 40 years the percentage of drought episodes in china ranged between 24 and 33 of all weeks with a decreasing pattern from east to west the proposed nata curve combined both the expanded drought area and drought severity and one can easily judge whether the event had the characteristics of flash expansion and drought or not according to the shape or slope of the curve and the area percentage for different drought categories events with a nonuniformly evolving pattern i e the nonuniform expansion of drought area manifested as the nata curve greatly deviated from the 1 1 line indicates a rapid evolution of drought over time and space with information extracted from the nata curve a drought typology considered both the difficulty of drought monitoring and potential drought damages to vegetation was proposed among the five classified drought types drought events with rapid area expansion and high severity namely drought type v were most difficult to monitor with huge damages to vegetation and therefore mostly conformed to the rapidly evolved feature of drought over time and space from a perspective of higher dimension this study showed the necessity of incorporating information on drought area expansion over time for reliable identification results of drought with rapid expansion with the ability to accurately capture the rapid development process of droughts the nata curve is promising to be an alternative for the efficient recognition of droughts with varied features over time and space which also provides valuable information for drought risk management author contributions ruiqc carried out the analyses designed the paper and prepared the figures yl

1844,though flash drought is an intrinsically three dimensional phenomenon that evolves in both temporal and spatial dimensions most studies have overlooked its spatiotemporal features by analyzing its characteristics at individual grid points the rapid expansion of drought over time and space also brings great challenges for drought monitoring and management strategies focusing on the mapping of rapid development trajectories of drought in the three dimensional space this study proposes the normalized area time accumulation nata curve to describe the evolution characteristics of flash drought using the nata curve information about the expansion rate of drought area over time and the dominant severity of drought area can be extracted on this basis such drought events were classified and investigated considering drought monitoring difficulty and potential drought damages results showed that the shape of proposed nata curve and the slope of curves of varying severity levels had explicit indicative function for distinguishing drought events characterized by flash and drought events from traditional slowly evolving drought events drought events which have a rapid rate of area expansion and high drought severity mostly meets the characteristics of flash droughts in the spatiotemporal dimensions the findings highlight the significance of incorporating information on drought area expansion with time for an efficient recognition and improved accuracy of rapid drought development from a three dimensional perspective this is a step forward for flash drought identification in a higher dimension the proposed nata curve provides intuitive and comprehensive information on how drought evolves over time and space and is a promising alternative method to analyze drought characteristics from a three dimensional perspective keywords drought flash drought drought identification soil moisture spatiotemporal dimensions data availability i have provided a description of data availability in the paper 1 introduction flash droughts have aroused considerable attention in recent years compared with traditional slowly evolving droughts flash droughts are characterized by sudden onset and rapid intensification svoboda et al 2002 otkin et al 2018 that leave less time for early warning and preparation and may impose severe impacts on ecosystems and economic development chen et al 2021 sehgal et al 2021 mukherjee and mishra 2022 qing et al 2022 gerken et al 2018 poonia et al 2022 otkin et al 2022 for example a catastrophic drought in the central united states during the summer of 2012 had substantial impacts on energy systems water resources and agricultural production resulting in estimated economic losses of over 30 billion hoerling et al 2014 otkin et al 2016 basara et al 2019 china has also suffered serious flash droughts in recent years for instance the reduction of agricultural production in jiangxi province led to direct economic losses of approximately 260 million dollars in 2003 zhang et al 2017 in the context of climate change flash droughts have become more frequent in different regions of the world such as australia the u s africa and southern china gerken et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 he et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 liu et al 2020a nguyen et al 2021 christian et al 2021 hao 2022 there is currently a lack of consensus on how to define a flash drought lisonbee et al 2021 i e whether it should be based on its short duration mo and lettenmaier 2015 mo and lettenmaier 2016 or instead be based on its rapid intensification otkin et al 2014 2018 the emphasis on short duration drought may lead to misjudgment and the settings of each threshold is also debatable liu et al 2020b focusing on the rate of soil moisture intensification process is another approach that has been widely used in recent studies hunt et al 2014 otkin et al 2014 otkin et al 2018 liu et al 2020b for example the changes of soil moisture from above the 40 percentile to below the 20 percentile within 20 days ford and labosier 2017 has been employed as a criterion which ensures that the identified events have the characteristics of both flash and drought in addition several researchers used new drought indicators e g standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index and evaporative stress index and introduce new technologies such as machine learning to analyze flash droughts otkin et al 2013 nguyen et al 2019 hao et al 2020 osman et al 2021 tyagi et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 like all drought flash drought is a phenomenon that evolves simultaneously over space and time most current studies have neglected the synchronous changes of flash drought in spatiotemporal dimensions by simplifying analysis into lower dimensional subspace i e analyzing the rate of change of soil moisture or another relevant variable at discrete sites or grid cells such treatments of descending dimension may miss the temporal and spatial links among drought patches which is essential for understanding drought development and migration behavior at large scales chen et al 2019 feng et al 2021 although the three dimensional drought identification approach proposed by andreadis et al 2005 and improved by lloyd huges 2012 has been widely applied for revisiting global and regional drought events wang et al 2011 xu et al 2015 herrera estrada et al 2017 and characterizing drought propagation zhu et al 2019 studies specific to flash drought are generally rare gou et al 2022 li et al 2022 how to define flash drought e g which parameter are competent for representing the rapid intensification rates of flash drought in the spatiotemporal dimensions is a major obstacle to be addressed before extending the existing three dimensional drought identification approach to flash drought the aim of this study therefore is to develop an approach to identify rapid drought expansion in three dimensions and discuss the connection between such areal expansion and evolution of flash drought in higher dimensions based on the existing three dimensional identification approach liu et al 2019 we moved one step further by introducing additional criteria to distinguish the rapid expansion processes from traditional slowly evolving ones we proposed a new curve that provides an intuitive view of the spatiotemporal evolution of drought combined with the variation of drought severity to assess the potential damage of drought on ecological and hydrological systems the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi wang et al 2022 was employed for analysis as an active factor in modulating the water and carbon cycles of most ecosystems vegetation controls the land atmosphere exchanges of water and energy and responds quickly to the water stresses in the soil wang et al 2014 novick et al 2016 lanning et al 2020 the reminder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the data and methods and section 3 presents the result of three dimensional identification and the application of the proposed curve for distinguishing drought types with varied features such as drought monitoring difficulty and potential drought damages section 4 discusses the findings and some conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 data and methods 2 1 data daily soil moisture data provided by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf reanalysis era product https www ecmwf int en forecasts were used to characterize droughts in china during 1979 2018 the data set supplied soil moisture sm estimates for four layers namely 0 7 cm 7 28 cm 28 100 cm and 100 289 cm albergel et al 2013 in this study we used the top three layers of the sm product at a 0 25 spatial resolution daily volumetric soil water m3 m3 data from 1979 to 2018 were aggregated to weekly values to identify droughts weekly soil moisture percentiles were derived from the eight candidate theoretical distributions including the exponential gamma beta lognormal logic weibull generalized extreme value and generalized pareto distributions the best probability distribution function was chosen according to the kolmogorov smirnov test results and the root mean square error rmse the detailed different theoretical probability distributions were employed for each week according to the goodness of fit test results the detailed steps for selecting the best probability distribution function are provided in the supplementary material section s1 in this way the original soil moisture series were converted to percentile values which further served for flash drought identification the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi 3rd generation dataset used in this study is produced by the global inventory monitoring and modelling studies gimms group https ecocast arc nasa gov da ta pub gimms 3g v1 it is derived from the u s national oceanic and atmospheric administration s advanced very high resolution radiometer satellite record the ndvi data from 1982 to 2015 were collected with a spatial resolution of 0 083 and a temporal interval of 15 days in this study the original data were resampled into a spatial resolution of 0 25 and the values of ndvi nearest to the date of weekly soil moisture percentile were extracted to reflect the vegetation condition a standardized procedure was performed by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation to obtain the anomalous values of ndvi positive anomalies of ndvi indicate good health conditions for vegetation while negative values indicate an inhibitive effect on vegetation growth 2 2 methods drought is an intrinsically three dimensional phenomenon that develops in both temporal and spatial dimensions feng et al 2021 xu et al 2015a lloyd hughes 2012 in this study a three dimensional identification method previously proposed by andreadis et al 2005 and developed by lloyd hughes 2012 was employed for identifying droughts this method acquires three dimensional drought events by spatially identifying and temporally connecting adjacent drought patches into a drought object in this study we build upon this method by further extracting drought events with flash expansion characteristics the superiority of the three dimensional approach lies in comparing to the traditional two dimensional flash drought method which only considers the rate of development of soil moisture deficits at a single site grid both the magnitude of soil moisture deficits and the expansion of affected area are considered in higher spaces which is close to the real development of drought 2 2 1 drought identification in spatiotemporal dimensions the three dimensional drought identification method can be divided into two major parts namely the spatial identification and temporal connection for each week a grid with soil moisture percentile below 0 3 wang and yuan 2018 was considered as under drought then the 3 3 neighborhood of the under drought grid cell is searched and the neighboring grids under drought were grouped into the same drought patch and the clusters with area smaller than the minimum threshold of drought patch area were filtered out given their minor influences for temporal connection the remaining clusters were combined into larger objects according to a predetermined minimum overlapping area in two adjacent weeks the thresholds for the minimum drought patch area and overlapping area are important parameters which can be adjusted according to the area of the study domain following wang et al 2011 a threshold value of 150 000 km2 equivalent to 200 grid cells in this study was employed for the minimum drought patch area details on the sensitive test of the selection of thresholds can be found in supplementary material s2 the definition of drought characteristics is also different from that in lower spaces in the three dimensional continuum drought duration is defined as the temporal span from the initial drought patches to the terminal drought patches which could be in different locations as drought conditions first expand and then contract similar to cases in two dimensions the drought affected area for each week can be extracted to show the areal expansion process the maximum drought affected region i e the chinese region affected by a drought event is calculated as the intersection of the projection of the affected area over whole persistence period of the event drought severity reflects the degree of water deficiency for a drought event and can be calculated by the sum of the differences between the soil moisture percentile and the soil moisture threshold used to identify drought 0 3 summed over all drought affected grid points drought intensity is defined as drought severity per drought area and per drought duration in addition we also extract the geometrical characteristics of drought events including the north south length east west length and perimeter the east west and north south lengths refer to the maximum span lengths of the maximum drought affected area in both directions the perimeter is the length of the maximum drought affected area 2 3 normalized area time accumulation curve with all drought events identified a method was used to determine whether a drought is a drought event with rapid expansion over time and space from a three dimensional perspective since more drought information is incorporated under higher dimensions e g growth of drought area etc additional flash characteristics are necessary to indicate such rapid drought events a new curve named the normalized area time accumulation nata curve was proposed for assessing the spatiotemporal evolution of drought this curve reflects the spatial and temporal evolution of drought thereby making drought events of different shapes comparable under three dimensional identification through this curve increases in drought area over time were used to capture the rapid expansion of drought the accumulated area in each week was normalized by the total accumulated area of the drought event 1 no r area cu m c u r r e n t a r e a cu m t o t a l a r e a where norarea represents the normalized area cumcurrent area represents the accumulated area of this drought in the current period and cumtotal area represents the sum of the accumulated area of this drought in the whole period the duration for the current week was also normalized to match norarea 2 no r time curren t t i m e tota l t i m e where nortime represents the normalized time current time represents the current number of weeks of drought occurrence and total time represents the total number of weeks of drought events fig 1 depicts the spatiotemporal evolution of three drought events using the nata approach the 1 1 line dashed line represents a hypothetical state where the drought area increases uniformly with time if the curve deviates from the 1 1 line it represents a nonuniform variation in the spatiotemporal dimensions as shown in fig 1a the slope of the green curve was close to the 1 1 line throughout the expansion phase indicating a uniform growth of drought area over time in contrast the purple and blue lines in fig 1a suggest that the drought affected area can also grow rapidly and maintain a relatively high affected area i e nortime from 0 02 to 0 43 and from 0 33 to 0 67 which is a substantial rapid development process to emphasize such rapid development and maintenance periods the dash dotted line was used when the slope was substantially higher than 1 the black solid dots also referred to as the inflection point represent the onset time of rapid area expansion in the following weeks for example the purple dash dotted line had a slope of 2 00 from the inflection point to 35 weeks i e nortime from 0 04 to 0 43 the initial drought affected area in this period was 657 680 km2 which rapidly increased to 3 033 973 km2 during the following three weeks i e nortime from 0 04 to 0 07 and then fluctuated around 2 446 487 km2 in the following weeks in this sense the period from 0 02 to 0 43 was recognized as rapid expansion and maintained the period due to the slope of 2 0 the black hollow point in fig 1a represents the termination of the rapid drought expansion with the accumulated drought affected area thereafter increasing at a slower rate the above curves identified the flash characteristics of drought event with rapid expansion the varied drought characteristics of drought event with rapid expansion e g the magnitude of drought and corresponding damages to vegetation are also essential to distinguish droughts with varied damages the blue curve in fig 1a was disassembled into three curves in fig 1b for assessing the magnitude of drought to this end the nata curves of different severity levels were extracted i e moderate drought area yellow line 0 2 soil moisture percentile 0 3 severe drought area red line 0 1 soil moisture percentile 0 2 and extreme drought area dark red line 0 soil moisture percentile 0 1 accordingly the largest slope of the three disassembled nata curves represented the dominant role of the drought process the nata curve provides information on how drought evolves in the three dimensional continuum according to the characteristics of flash expansion and drought severity drought events can be distinguished from aspects of drought monitoring difficulty and potential drought damages a drought event that is rapidly growing in area but not at a high level of drought severity would have minimal effects on agriculture or the environment similarly if a drought event of high severity over a small area fails to expand rapidly in space its damaging effects on associated sectors are generally minor since many areas will remain drought free 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal patterns of drought characteristics following the three dimensional identification method 734 drought events during 1979 2018 in china were recognized and 163 drought events with duration of at least 4 weeks were selected for further analysis fig 2 shows the percentage of weeks under drought in china during 1979 2018 higher values indicated longer persistence of drought while lower values indicated shorter persistence of drought overall the number of weeks under drought mainly showed a decreasing pattern from east to west with the percentage values varying between 24 and 31 for example the northern part of northeast china exhibited a high value with 33 indicating that approximately 686 weeks were under drought from 1979 to 2018 similarly the yellow river basin the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin and the huang huai hai region also experienced long term droughts these regions were mostly agricultural production bases and were more vulnerable to agricultural losses with long lasting exposure under drought in contrast total drought persistence in parts of northwest china was generally short with percentage values less than 14 table 1 shows the drought characteristics of the 10 most severe drought events of different persistence i e short term drought 4 weeks to 12 weeks medium short drought 13 weeks to 26 weeks and long term drought 26 weeks or longer the no 88 drought event occurred from may 1996 to july 1996 8 weeks and swept over 49 6 105 km2 approximately half of china was ranked as the most severe event among short term droughts it can be seen that the intensity of drought was 0 150 and the total cumulative affected area affected reached 125 46 105 km2 within 8 weeks we also used the geometrical characteristics to indicate the spatiotemporal trajectories of such drought events compared to other short term drought events the 1996 summer drought had the largest magnitude in terms of all these features similarly for medium short droughts the 2000 spring drought i e no 105 event also exhibited a rapid increase of affected area and thus was more damaging than the 2018 drought i e no 161 event these findings suggest the magnitude of droughts may reach a high level both in area and severity within a shorter time period 3 2 drought spatiotemporal patterns indicated by nata curve 3 2 1 flash characteristics following the nata curve described above the spatial expansion of each drought event over time can be recognized which provided a visualized image for distinguishing droughts with flash expansion characteristics from those that evolve more slowly as shown in fig 3 the 1987 summer drought in the northeast region is a typical example where the increase in the total drought affected area varies nonuniformly in spatiotemporal dimensions through the nata curve fig 3a we can see that the total drought area curve significantly deviated from the 1 1 line during the early and middle periods nor time from 0 2 to 0 5 with a slope of 1 92 such a rapid increase in drought area was consistent with the changes in the three dimensional drought continuum fig 3b i e the drought area in 4 6 weeks was much larger than that in other weeks to quantify the expansion rate of drought area the spatiotemporal evolution of the 1987 drought from the onset time t 0 to the maximum of drought affected area t 4 was extracted as shown in fig 5 the nonuniformly spatiotemporally evolving event initiated in the western part of northeast china with several patches experiencing severe dry conditions from 4 june to 2 july the dry soil conditions intensified and moved eastward which eventually spread over the majority of northeast china during these five weeks the total drought area increased at a rate of 5 27 i e a 5 27 fold expansion of the maximum drought area relative to the initial drought area the 1997 drought from 9 july to 10 september represented another case where drought also persisted as long as the 1987 drought but its areal expansion was relatively stable as shown in fig 4 a the nata curve of the 1997 drought was relatively close to the 1 1 line which can be viewed as a uniform evolution process in spatiotemporal dimensions this was consistent with the smooth and slow development process of drought events fig 6 presents the projection of affected area for the 1997 drought this drought event began on 9 july covering a small part of northwest china despite this very dry condition the drought affected area did not expand rapidly with an areal growth rate of 1 35 it was evident that the 1997 drought evolved much more slowly than the 1987 drought over space in general the nata curves provided informative images depicting how the total drought affected area varied over time and provide a tool to distinguish droughts with flash expansion characteristics from those that evolve more slowly when the nata curve significantly deviates from the 1 1 line it indicates a nonuniformly spatiotemporal evolution with a rapid expansion of drought area accordingly when the nata curve approached the 1 1 line it indicated a uniformly spatiotemporal evolution with the drought area increasing much more slowly with time 3 2 2 drought severity of expanded area with the nata curve drought events that rapidly expanded over time and space can be recognized i e the time period that nata curve presented a nonuniformly evolved pattern however their impacts and damages to the ecosystem can be different given the varied severity levels of increased area the drought event that occurred from december 1985 to february 1986 is a case that had flash expansion characteristics but the increased drought area for each time interval was of low severity as shown in fig 7 a the slope of nata curve was 1 73 which is a typical nonuniformly evolved process with respect to the behavior of each drought category it can be seen that the curve of moderate drought was generally higher than that of severe and extreme droughts according to fig 7b and 7c it is apparent that the 1986 event was dominated by moderate drought with the corresponding percentage exceeding 40 while the area of extreme drought only accounted for a small proportion during the whole drought process by contrast the 1983 drought event also showed a nonuniformly evolving with a slope of 1 70 pattern but its impacts may be more damaging as shown in fig 8 c this event was dominated by extreme drought with the percentage above 50 in most of the weeks while moderate drought merely accounted for a small proportion to investigate the impacts of these two drought events on vegetation the negative anomalies of ndvi during drought episodes were extracted for each drought affected grid point fig 9 the probability density distribution of the 1983 drought red curve had a more negative mean 0 75 than that of the 1986 drought blue curve 0 57 with respect to the tail characteristics of the probability density distribution i e the upper right corner panel in fig 9 it can be seen that the minimum 5 and 10 values of the 1983 drought event were about 1 5 1 9 and 3 5 respectively which were all lower than those of the 1986 drought event this showed the differentiated influences among droughts of varied severity levels compared to moderate drought dominated events events dominated by extreme drought were more destructive by inducing more severe vegetation impacts 3 3 typology of droughts in three dimensional spaces based on an in depth analysis of the spatiotemporal evolution patterns of drought events a drought typology is proposed with the monitoring difficulty and potential drought impacts as basic principles in section 3 2 1 it was found that the shape of the nata curve had implications for distinguishing events containing flash expansion characteristics from slower evolving events i e a nonuniform pattern of the nata curve suggested a rapid evolution process of drought that is more challenging for drought monitoring the potential drought impacts can be measured by the expanded area of drought severity categories where an extreme drought dominated event was undoubtedly more destructive than events dominated by moderate drought accordingly five drought categories were distinguished in the three dimensional spaces i e uniformly evolving events dominated by moderate drought type ⅰ uniformly evolving events dominated by extreme drought type ⅱ uniformly evolving events dominated by moderate and severe droughts type iii nonuniformly evolving events dominated by moderate drought type ⅳ and nonuniformly evolving events dominated by extreme drought type ⅴ fig 10 exhibits drought events identified in spatiotemporal dimensions and the drought types they belong to given the wide variation of drought duration a logarithmic processing was performed for the horizontal axis meanwhile enveloping curves were added to more clearly identify groups of events with similar drought type for uniformly evolved events i e type i ii and iii the increments of area generally followed constant speed over time with scatters evenly distributed around a straight line representing the average increase rate of drought area by contrast the envelope curves of type ⅳ and type ⅴ were generally slanted upward especially type ⅴ indicating a rapid expansion of drought area within very short time period such rapid expansion of nonuniformly evolving events left less time for preparation and their spatiotemporal migration trajectories were also difficult to capture which made these event difficult to monitor in addition scatter sizes also showed the distinction among drought types in terms of drought occurrences events with flash characteristics i e type iv and type v only accounted for a small proportion of historical drought events but their associated ecological impacts cannot be ignored given their severe magnitude over time and space as shown in fig 11 four metrics including the minimum 5 10 and average values derived from the probability density distribution of ndvi anomalies under drought type i and type v were employed to compare their influences on vegetation health among them the minimum values exhibited the largest distinction between type i and type v with the gaps of ndvi anomalies by 0 9 fig 11a followed by 5 and 10 values while minor differences were found for the average values in addition all four statistical metrics revealed a similar pattern where vegetation conditions under type i exhibited larger variabilities than cases under type v these results suggest that events of drought type v were more destructive to vegetation with potential irrecoverable impacts in some cases with information extracted from the nata curve a drought typology distinguishing events from the aspects of monitoring difficulty and expansion of drought area in varied categories is shown in table 2 with both great difficulty of drought monitoring and deteriorating impacts on vegetation the drought type ⅴ generally met the characteristics of both flash expansion and drought as for events of type iv they evolved more rapidly in three dimensional spaces and whether they severely damage vegetation depends on the proportion of each increased drought severity area for events of types i to iii these are more typical slowly evolving droughts and some preparations can be made to reduce potential drought losses 4 discussion drought is widely recognized as a phenomenon that develops in the spatial and temporal dimensions to improve the understanding of how drought evolves over time and space andreadis et al 2005 first introduced the definition of contiguous drought area cda which can aggregate spatial cells into drought clusters this method has been further applied for analyzing the three dimensional migration patterns of droughts at global and regional scales e g xu et al 2015 herrera estrada et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 verhoeven et al 2022 diaz et al 2020 rakovec et al 2022 meanwhile attempts of improving the three dimensional drought tracking algorithm can be found in recent literature for instance cammalleri and toreti 2023 proposed a new algorithm by introducing a set of six parameters that control both the spatial and the temporal connectivity between cells under drought conditions and also accounting for the local intensity of the drought itself as a newly recognized type of drought the characteristics of flash drought have mostly been analyzed in lower spaces while overlooking its spatiotemporal features in higher dimensions the motivation of this study therefore was to propose a method to fill this gap to do this we employed a three dimensional identification approach to identify historical drought events across china then we proposed the nata curve to distinguish drought events characterized by rapid expansion from other droughts that develop more uniformly with time in particular the expansion of drought area over time was employed to depict the trajectory of space time evolution which is different from previous studies that focus on the behavior at an individual site or grid cell meanwhile the nata curve provided an intuitive image on the evolution characteristics of drought and one can easily judge whether the event has the characteristics of flash expansion and drought or not according to the shape or slope of the curve and the area percentage for different drought severity categories in addition the normalized treatment of accumulated drought area over time made drought events of varied development processes comparable which facilitates recognizing droughts of varied features based on the information extracted from the nata curve a conceptual framework of drought topology was proposed considering the monitoring difficulty and potential drought impacts as two concerned factors compared to slowly evolving drought it is much more difficult to prepare for drought with rapid expansion given the rapid outbreak of drought and the rapid growth of its spatial extent particularly for drought area it is commonly viewed as one of the drought characteristics in lower spaces rather than a criterion for event identification e g ford and labosier 2017 it is necessary to consider the rapid development of drought affected area to acquire a more detailed understanding of drought besides the damages caused by drought are also essential factors to measure the magnitude of drought extreme drought dominated events impose devastating effects on vegetation in general type ⅴ can be mostly close to the rapid intensification of flash drought under the two dimensional definition because of its rapid expansion of drought area and extreme drought levels whether there is a link between these rapid drought events and flash droughts needs to be further verified considering soil moisture of different depths may respond differently to the increased atmospheric water demand shah et al 2022 to verify the applicability and robustness of the proposed framework for flash drought analysis we also analyzed flash drought by using era5 soil moisture of the top two soil layers 0 28 cm as expected minor differences can be found for the characteristics of flash drought but the overall patterns indicated by soil moisture data of top two layers 0 28 cm are generally consistent with those by 0 1 m soil moisture data for example fig s1 shows the percentage of weeks under drought in china during 1979 2018 soil moisture of 0 28 cm depth it can be seen that expect for southwest china where drought also present longer persistence the spatial patterns indicated by soil moisture of top two layers are generally consistent with those identified by soil moisture of 0 1 m depth fig 2 similar to the findings by shah et al 2022 the differences may be related to the different response of soil moisture at different layers to the increased atmospheric water demand previous studies also indicated higher frequency of flash drought in the southwest region in china by using soil moisture data of the top layer e g liu et al 2020 in addition we also selected typical events to analyze their patterns in the nata curve as done with the 0 1 m soil moisture data figs s2 s10 similar to the findings with the 0 1 m soil moisture data the results from the 0 28 cm soil moisture data show that there is still significant discrepancy between drought type ⅰ and type ⅴ in terms of the potential impact to vegetation and drought events which have a rapid expansion and high drought severity are more destructive to vegetation than other types the results confirm the robustness of the proposed normalized area time accumulation curve for flash drought identification with soil moisture data of different depths in the spatiotemporal dimensions it is worth mentioning that the proposal of drought typology is based on the slope of nata curve and dominant severity levels of drought and the boundaries are not sharp between drought types in other words there is no explicit threshold or quantitative value of curve slope or proportion of dominant drought area to distinguish droughts among five types but rather we would like to provide an alternative to understand how drought may proceed in spatiotemporal spaces and their potential damages to the environment this may be beneficial for stakeholders to make timely and effective measures to mitigate the effects of drought and drought risk management ongoing researches on the applicability of nata curve in different regions are necessary 5 conclusions revolving around the issue of flash drought identification in three dimensional spaces this study proposed a nata curve to characterize the evolution of drought we first identified historical drought events and their characteristics in the spatiotemporal dimension and then implemented a normalization procedure for the accumulated area over time both the expansion of drought area and drought severity were incorporated into the nata curve on this basis ndvi anomalies were employed to evaluate the impacts of drought of varied severity and classification of drought events was investigated from aspects of drought monitoring difficulty and potential drought damages results showed that during the past 40 years the percentage of drought episodes in china ranged between 24 and 33 of all weeks with a decreasing pattern from east to west the proposed nata curve combined both the expanded drought area and drought severity and one can easily judge whether the event had the characteristics of flash expansion and drought or not according to the shape or slope of the curve and the area percentage for different drought categories events with a nonuniformly evolving pattern i e the nonuniform expansion of drought area manifested as the nata curve greatly deviated from the 1 1 line indicates a rapid evolution of drought over time and space with information extracted from the nata curve a drought typology considered both the difficulty of drought monitoring and potential drought damages to vegetation was proposed among the five classified drought types drought events with rapid area expansion and high severity namely drought type v were most difficult to monitor with huge damages to vegetation and therefore mostly conformed to the rapidly evolved feature of drought over time and space from a perspective of higher dimension this study showed the necessity of incorporating information on drought area expansion over time for reliable identification results of drought with rapid expansion with the ability to accurately capture the rapid development process of droughts the nata curve is promising to be an alternative for the efficient recognition of droughts with varied features over time and space which also provides valuable information for drought risk management author contributions ruiqc carried out the analyses designed the paper and prepared the figures yl
