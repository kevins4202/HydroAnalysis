15120,climate change is projected to threaten ecological communities through changes in temperature rainfall runoff patterns and mediated changes in other environmental variables their combined effects are difficult to comprehend without the mathematical machinery of causal modelling using piecewise structural equation modelling we aim to predict the responses of aquatic macroinvertebrate total abundance and richness to disturbances generated by climate change our approach involves integrating an existing hydroclimate salinity model for the murray darling basin australia into our recently developed statistical models for macroinvertebrates using long term monitoring data on macroinvertebrates water quality climate and hydrology spanning 2 300 km of the murray river our exercise demonstrates the potential of causal modelling for integrating data and models from different sources as such optimal use of valuable existing data and merits of previously developed models in the field can be made for exploring the effects of future climate change and management interventions keywords biological response global climate change long term monitoring data causal diagram

increase the vulnerability of river systems and their dependant ecosystems which have been under pressure from human activities such as river regulation and water extraction bunn and arthington 2002 gippel and blackham 2002 kingsford 2000 walker 1985 the impacts of global climate change on river ecosystems manifest through magnifying the variability of temperature and precipitation increasing the frequency and intensity of floods and droughts and altering runoff patterns and streamflow regimes kundzewicz et al 2008 milly et al 2005 2002 palmer et al 2008 planning and prioritization of adaptation options to balance the future needs of society and the environment would be facilitated by coupling scenario based models that capture the spectrum of hydrological impacts of climate change palmer et al 2008 with ecohydrological models to predict their ecological consequences poff et al 2010 overall climate change has the potential to affect habitat temperature regimes rates of ecosystem processes and phenological cues johnson and penaluna 2019 not all species or systems are equally vulnerable with assessment finding that systems in good condition daneshvar et al 2017 and species at the top of food webs at greater risk woodward et al 2016 analysis of long term data has revealed that increasing temperatures affect macroinvertebrate distributions durance and ormerod 2007 and community composition chessman 2009 climate change will also affect habitat through its influence on flow regimes with increasingly severe and frequent droughts likely to be a major impact ledger et al 2013 2012 the evidence of multi decadal effects of large floods on macroinvertebrate communities daufresne et al 2007 le et al 2020 2021 indicates that climate change in the form of changes in flood frequency and intensity can considerably impact upon aquatic ecosystems modelling has revealed similar results using a range of approaches including temperature tolerances carr et al 2019 habitat models at reach waddle and holmquist 2013 and continental scales domisch et al 2013 however it remains a key challenge to develop a mechanistic and predictive understanding of the impacts of climate change in a complex natural system across multiple spatiotemporal scales and the potentially important synergetic effects of climate change components and other abiotic biotic and anthropogenic stressors woodward et al 2010 climate change is associated with a range of threats that come on top of existing threats such as land use change river regulation and salinisation paul et al 2018 reid et al 2019 there is considerable uncertainty about the extent to which threats will interact but evidence of synergistic additive and antagonistic interactions has been found jackson et al 2016 it is therefore important to consider these interactions if we are going to sustain environmental values johnson and penaluna 2019 mantyka pringle et al 2016 in response multiple threats have been examined primarily temperature and flow knouft and ficklin 2017 but also land use change flow and water chemistry kath et al 2018 li et al 2018 mantyka pringle et al 2014 and temperature and nutrients spears et al 2022 including multiple threats and their interactions carries with it risks around compounding uncertainty trade offs between complexity and accuracy hernandez suarez and nejadhashemi 2018 the use of ensemble modelling has emerged as one way to integrate models and enhance predictive ability hernandez suarez and nejadhashemi 2018 in australia s murray darling basin climate change is likely to have a major impact on long term average temperatures and river flow as well as increases in the frequency and intensity of adverse climatic events such as heat waves and drought the magnitude of potential changes was illustrated during the millennium drought 1997 2009 which in 2009 saw inflows into the murray river reduced to almost 10 of the long term average prosser et al 2021 saft et al 2016 of longer term interest has been that the system has not rebounded in terms of runoff hughes and prosser 2012 or environmental values mac nally et al 2014 projections of streamflow in the region are generally for a moderate to large reduction prosser et al 2021 these declines are predicted to be in the order of 20 by 2060 compared to a 1976 2005 baseline under a 2 c global warming scenario prosser et al 2021 the murray river is australia s longest river that together with its major tributary the darling river drains the 1 106 km2 murray darling basin mdb after decades of developing the river to support irrigated agriculture transport and hydropower water dependant ecosystems condition began to degrade native fish populations declined salinity increased to levels in the lower murray that were considered unfit for human consumption paul et al 2018 and the condition of long lived floodplain vegetation deteriorated mac nally et al 2014 in recognition of the need for sustainable management australia s commonwealth and state governments collaboratively implemented large scale water reform that culminated in the basin plan hart 2016 australian governments have committed to restoring the mdb including the murray river as part of the long term reform water quality and biological macroinvertebrate and phytoplankton monitoring programs were established by the murray darling basin authority mdba in 1980 to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to manage flows salt and nutrients in the river bennison et al 1989 paul et al 2013 however climate change threatens to undermine their attempts to protect and restore its environmental values it is important that we improve our understanding of the effects of climate change if we are to achieve the basin plan s objectives and manage the risks associated with climate change forecasting the impacts of climate change on murray river invertebrate communities will improve managers capacity to identify and manage the risks using causal modelling such as bayesian networks bns and traditional sem to predict the combined effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities on water quality flow regime and biological communities have been done before e g dyer et al 2011 li et al 2018 mantyka pringle et al 2014 by breaking down complex systems into components that can be addressed separately causal modelling approaches have showed advantages in tracing and communicating the mechanisms underlying the impacts of climate change and or human activities e g dyer et al 2011 li et al 2018 mantyka pringle et al 2014 and facilitating integration of knowledge and data from different sources kelly et al 2013 however there are limitations associated with these approaches including assumptions of linear relationships between and normal error distributions of variables in the causal structures moreover previous studies rarely if at all explicitly represented the impacts of climate change in a system across various spatial and temporal scales our aim here is to use piecewise structural equation modelling sem as an ensemble modelling framework to link models of local scale water quality and biological monitoring with basin scale hydroclimate salinity and global scale climate to predict macroinvertebrate responses to basin scale climate change in the presence of human activities for the murray river piecewise sem evolved from traditional sem lefcheck 2016 has the flexibility that stems from the shift from global estimation and testing i e estimating all parameters of the sem simultaneously from the model implied covariance matrix and testing the sem by comparing the observed and model implied covariance matrices to local estimation and testing i e parameters are estimated separately for each response variable and testing is based on local conditional independencies entailed by the causal structure additionally conditional independence tests are based on the graph theoretic notion of directional separation or d separation pearl 2000 shipley 2000a 2000b these evolutions help relax the usual assumptions of linear relationships and multivariate normal distributions that underpin traditional covariance based sem and enables model building and testing to be done with conventional statistical methods and general purpose statistics packages lefcheck 2016 shipley 2000b this method has been previously applied in the field of ecological risk assessment which can often involve nonlinear models and nonnormal error distributions paul and anderson 2013 paul et al 2016 anticipating the effects that climate change may have on macroinvertebrates is a difficult task given the many indirect effects that climate change can have on macroinvertebrate communities that cross multiple spatiotemporal scales developing a piecewise structural equation model as a framework to integrate recently developed statistical models for macroinvertebrates with the basin scale existing model should make this task more tractable 2 methods 2 1 study sites the five study sites were located in four geomorphically distinct tracts of the murray river including headwaters riverine mallee and lower murray spanning over 2300 km of the river site 801 is situated in the headwaters which is characterized by high bed slope about 16 cm km fast flowing tributaries and a sand riverbed with an underlying gravel layer site 804 is located downstream of the yarrawonga weir in the riverine tract where the river flows slowly across a broad floodplain comprised of fine silt and clays site 808 is situated in the mallee tract with the river generally having a single large channel 10 20 m width medium current velocity and a substrate composed mainly of sand with some silt clay the remaining two sites site 811 and 814 are located below the confluence with the highly turbid darling river in the lower murray which is distinguished by low bed slopes 5 cm km sinuosities slow flows and highly adhesive bank components silt clay contents 12 41 climate conditions range from temperate in the river s headwaters mean annual rainfall of approximately 800 mm and the river s mouth mean annual rainfall of about 400 mm to semi arid with mean annual rainfall of about 260 mm in its mid reach the study sites are illustrated in fig 1 2 2 data 2 2 1 macroinvertebrates as part of the river murray biological monitoring program bennison et al 1989 macroinvertebrates were collected in winter may june and summer october december during the study period from 1980 to 2012 using artificial substrate samplers bennison et al 1989 an artificial substrate sampler was a basket formed from black plastic gutterguard mesh size 10 mm of 180 mm height and 240 mm diameter with one and a quarter commercially available polypropylene leno weave onion bags total area of 0 42 m2 placed inside as substratum and a clean river rock or half a house brick included as ballast bennison et al 1989 five out of ten samplers that were placed on the riverbed at depths less than 1 5 m and retrieved after six weeks were used for each observation i e specific year season and site for each site season year combination the material from five of the samplers was sieved through a 250 μm mesh sieve then the animals were removed and preserved in 70 ethanol before being identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible mostly genus and species some were identified to class and order according to taxa known prior to 1985 and counted bennison et al 1989 macroinvertebrate total abundance and taxa richness were defined as the number of individuals and the number of taxa per observation respectively 2 2 2 water quality flow and local climate water quality data including weekly measurements of ph turbidity electrical conductivity and water temperature at the nearest upstream sites to those of the biological monitoring program were obtained from the river murray water quality monitoring program wqmp biswas and lawrence 2013 for the period 1980 2012 local daily air temperature and rainfall were collected from the bureau of meteorology for the stations nearest to the water quality monitoring sites bureau of meteorology 2012 daily or weekly volumetric flow data from 1961 to 2012 were obtained for nearby hydrologic gauging stations all observations were averaged over 12 weeks for two seasonal periods referred to as winter and summer where the midpoint of each period coincided with the date of deployment of the artificial substrate samplers used to monitor the macroinvertebrate communities 2 2 3 catchment mdb climate monthly temperature and rainfall averages for the mdb from 1895 to 2006 were obtained from the bureau of meteorology 2018 because the deployment period for artificial substrate samplers did not coincide with calendar months it was decided to average monthly climate observations over 6 month periods dec jun for summer and jul nov for winter 2 2 4 models the murray darling sustainable yields project the basin scale hydroclimate salinity model used in this study was developed under the murray darling basin sustainable yields project mdbsyp and will be referred to as mdbsym hereafter the project was a comprehensive basin wide assessment of water availability for the mdb created a framework to integrate global and regional scale climate models a basin scale rainfall runoff model and all of the mdb s river hydrologic models to investigate the impacts of climate change and catchment development on water availability and water use across the basin csiro 2007 09 four scenarios were assessed in the mdbsyp including 1 historical climate defined by 112 years 1985 2006 of daily climate data and current development scenario a 2 recent climate 1997 2006 and current development scenario b 3 future climate and current development scenario c and 4 future climate and future development scenario d future climate conditions around the year 2030 were obtained based on the results of 15 global climate models gcms based on three global warming scenarios i e high medium and low global warming scenarios relative to 1990 the data generated for future climate scenarios were not forecasts for 2030 but time series of 112 year data from 1895 to 2006 obtained by scaling the historical climate data of the same period development scenarios included current development i e the average of 1975 to 2005 land use and small farm dam conditions the dams weirs and license entitlements and future development i e 2030 projected growth in farm dam capacity commercial forestry plantations and groundwater extraction more detailed information on the simulation scenarios are presented in the reports of csiro chiew et al 2008 the results of mdbsym for the future climate scenarios were projected for the period 1895 2006 the hydrologic gauging stations used to develop mdbsym overlap with long term monitoring sites for macroinvertebrates and water quality creating an opportunity to integrate the mdbsym with statistical models that were previously developed for macroinvertebrates in this study only scenario c including cmid median and cwet extremely wet variants of this scenario was considered due to the unavailability of the other scenarios scenario c data consisted of flow and ec the outputs from the mdbsy model including flows and salinity ec for the murray river for the mid and wet climate scenarios i e cmid and cwet were used in the present analysis catchment and local climate the average catchment temperature for 2030 is anticipated to increase by 0 6 to 1 5 c relative to 1990 for the median global warming scenario with projected increases being higher in the northern mdb than the southern mdb chiew et al 2008 timbal et al 2015 noted that projected changes for the murray basin in the southern mdb were similar amongst global warming scenarios and seasons the range of projected increases in mean temperature for the murray basin for all global warming scenarios gcms and seasons was 0 6 to 1 3 c timbal et al 2015 in the present study for simplification an increase of 1 c was used for both the cmid and cwet scenarios to scale the historical catchment and local temperature series annual catchment rainfall for the future climate scenario was projected to decrease by 2 8 for the cmid scenario and increase by 8 for the cwet scenario chiew et al 2008 and historical catchment rainfall was scaled accordingly for the two scenarios rainfall projections differed between the northern and southern mdb local rainfall for the southern mdb including the murray basin was projected to decrease by 5 for cmid and increase by 5 to 10 for cwet in 2030 relative to 1990 chiew et al 2008 an average increase of 7 5 for cwet and decrease of 5 for cmid were used to scale historical local rainfalls at monitoring sites along the murray river macroinvertebrate response using the same monitoring dataset described in sections 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 le et al 2020 modelled macroinvertebrate abundance and richness using a distributed lag nonlinear model dlnm as a function of the delayed effects of flow and the contemporaneous effects of salinity measured as electrical conductivity or ec ph turbidity and water temperature the dlnm used the q90 med hydrological index i e 6 monthly 90th non exceedance percentile flow scaled by the long term median flow to quantify the relationship between macroinvertebrates abundance and richness and flow at different magnitudes and lags taxa richness decreased with increasing ec and ph whereas it varied seasonally with temperature abundance displayed a unimodal response to ec with a peak at about 300 μs cm whereas it decreased with increasing turbidity and varied seasonally with temperature cross validation of the models indicated that predictions were generally very good considering the noisiness of the data le et al 2020 the results of these models in terms of statistically significant variables were used for variable selection in the piecewise sem and for predicting the responses of macroinvertebrates in the final causal models coupling the simulation mdbsym with these statistical models enables accounting for the indirect effects on macroinvertebrates of changes in climate flow and salinity that are mediated by other variables in the macroinvertebrate statistical models i e ph turbidity and water temperature as well as the potential spatiotemporal confounding that could be introduced by natural trends in these other variables 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 building and testing piecewise sems a hypothesized causal diagram for the murray river macroinvertebrates involving the available variables and the mdbsym was developed based on the literature reported in section s1 of the supplemental information and is given in fig 2 in this diagram nodes represent variables that serve as both predictors and responses in the causal structure and arrows represent causal relationships the definitions names and units of the variables are given in table 1 an exploratory analysis was then conducted to build statistical models for each node in the causal diagram and the causal diagram was refined based on the functional relationships defined by this set of models for the analysis generalized additive models gam were fitted to predict each of the environmental variables as a function of their hypothesized predictors using the r package mgcv wood 2006 for example from the causal diagram in fig 2 water temperature is hypothesised to be driven by local temperature local rainfall flow and velocity hence a gam was fitted to predict water temperature as a function of the aforementioned predictors model selection was done by removing statistically non significant variables in the gam models with subsets of predictors were then assessed using the bayesian information criterion bic and akaike information criterion aic to select the optimal models i e a model with lower bic or aic is considered better for discussions of aic and bic in model selection see burnham and anderson 2004 chakrabarti and ghosh 2011 the residuals of each model were also diagnosed to detect any remaining spatiotemporal patterns the causal diagram was then further adapted for each of the community metrics macroinvertebrate total abundance and taxa richness e g different gams were used for total abundance and richness for each community metric the arrows representing the statistically significant relationships between the environmental variables and the macroinvertebrate variable were retained or added in the case that support could be found in the literature for such linkages while those of non significant relationships were removed from the causal diagram the basis set of d separation statements entailed by the causal diagram see shipley 2000b representing the set of conditional independencies to be tested was derived using the r package ggm marchetti 2006 conditional independences were tested based on the methods proposed for additive models by pearl 2000 shipley 2000b and zhang et al 2017 p values from all the conditional independence tests were retained to use later in the fisher s c test the significance level used for the conditional tests was adjusted according to the bonferroni correction for multiple testing to give a family error rate of 0 05 as suggested by bender and lange 2001 miller 1981 rice 1989 shipley 2000b accordingly the adjusted significance level was calculated by dividing 0 05 by the number of conditional independence tests required for each causal diagram the conditional independence between variables was confirmed if the p values of the inferential tests were greater than the adjusted significance level fisher s c test shipley 2000b was used as a global test of all conditional independencies with a significance level of 0 05 the final causal model for each macroinvertebrate metrics was used to predict macroinvertebrate responses in the future climate scenarios i e the simulated data for future climate scenarios projected on the historical data over the period 1895 2006 the process of model building and testing is depicted in detail in section s2 of the supplemental information 2 3 3 predicting the shift in macroinvertebrate communities under climate change scenarios the two final causal models for macroinvertebrate abundance and richness were used to predict the shifts in macroinvertebrate communities under two future climate scenarios cmid and cwet for each scenario we predicted the mean response of each variable node in the causal diagram then added the observed residuals to the predicted means to derive the counterfactual predictions the observed residuals define the context in which the counterfactual predictions were made with an assumption that the error terms for unobserved mediating variables i e variables that are not in the causal model remain unchanged by the intervention the counterfactual predictions describe what the data may have looked like had the climate been different 2 3 4 consideration of equivalent models although the tests of conditional independences may grant plausibility to the postulated relationships amongst variables in the final causal models equivalent models i e alternative causal structures that entail an equivalent set of conditional independencies need to be considered to clarify the strength of evidence for the causal relationships depicted in the causal structures paul and anderson 2013 pearl 2000 to identify the set of equivalent models each arrow in the causal diagrams for macroinvertebrate total abundance and taxa richness was replaced by a reversed arrow e g x y instead of x y or a bi directed arc x y reflecting a latent confounder influencing both x and y the basis set derived from the replacement was then checked for equivalence to the original basis set paul and anderson 2013 pearl 2000 this analytical step was done using the r package ggdag barrett 2018 3 results 3 1 structural equations for the piecewise sem the structural equations for the final sem as the results of the model building and testing described in section s2 of the si are illustrated as follows 3 1 1 environmental variables i wtemp fwtemp temp vel rain

fisher s c test for 43 conditional independences 5 out of 48 tests showed significant results gave a c value of 86 63 with df 86 and p value 0 46 this confirms the data are consistent with the causal structure for taxa richness 3 2 predicting the shift in environmental variables and macroinvertebrate communities under climate change scenarios 3 2 1 environmental variables predictions for future climate scenarios using the final causal model indicated a shift in all environmental variables under the climate change scenarios at each site compared to the actual conditions over the period of 1980 2006 as illustrated in figs 3 and 4 the means of the environmental variables for different scenarios for the period 1980 2006 are provided in table s4 of the si the changes in water temperature were positively correlated with the changes in local temperature for each scenario with an increase of 0 9 c and 0 8 c for cmid and cwet respectively ph exhibited undetectable differences amongst the scenarios velocity was predicted to slightly increase for both climate change scenarios with a higher increase for cwet for the other environmental variables the changes varied in time and space under different climate scenarios specifically non parametric mann whitney u tests showed a significant increase in turbidity at site 814 and site 811 under both cmid and cwet scenarios since 1985 to the end of the investigated period p values 0 05 compared to observed levels being higher at site 814 the other sites upstream showed no to inconsiderable change over time figs 3 g and 4 g the results from mdbsym showed that the average ec across all sites decreased from 290 µs cm under observed conditions to 226 µs cm and 212 µs cm for cmid and cwet respectively the reduction of ec under the two climate change scenarios resulted mainly from the reduction of ec at site 814 which displayed a decreasing trend over the period 1980 2006 with a considerable decline from 1980 to 1990 the predicted values for ec at site 811 and site 808 also displayed lower ec over 10 years from 1980 to 1990 but higher ec from 1990 onwards under both climate change scenarios compared to observed levels on the other hand site 804 and site 801 showed little or no change in ec over the entire investigated period figs 3 f and 4 f the predicted flow exhibited a decrease of approximately 2400 ml day for the cmid scenario and an increase of slightly over 1200 ml day for cwet in comparison with the observed flows the hydrologic index q90 med over the period 1961 2006 was plotted for the observed cmid and cwet scenarios as illustrated in figs 3 h and 4 h in general magnitudes of high flow events decreased for cmid and increased for cwet compared to the observed scenario for cmid flood magnitudes at site 811 were lower than the observed levels between 1961 and the mid 1990s although flood levels showed a decreasing trend from mid 1990s onwards the cmid prediction was higher than the observed scenario over this period at site 811 site 808 exhibited a similar trend for cmid scenario but the higher levels of floods occurred from 1961 to around 1990 floods at site 801 were predicted to have higher magnitudes than the observed scenario during the period of 1961 1970 but getting lower from 1970 onwards site 804 and 814 displayed slight increases in flood levels for the cmid scenario over the whole period flood magnitudes were predicted to increase considerably under cwet scenario at all sites except for site 801 over the studied period compared to the observed levels the highest increase was anticipated for site 814 followed by site 811 it is noted that both climate change scenarios predicted large floods in 1975 and 1993 as occurred historically but with different intensities in particular the magnitudes of the floods in 1975 and 1993 were smaller for both cmid and cwet than the actual flood that occurred except site 811 for the 1993 flood of cwet scenario the comparison of flood magnitudes for three scenarios is given in fig 5 3 2 2 macroinvertebrate total abundance the predictions of macroinvertebrate abundance for future climate scenarios cmid and cwet exhibited different patterns amongst sites comparisons of three scenarios observed cmid and cwet over the period 1994 2006 as limited by the available data are illustrated in fig 6 the uppermost site site 801 was predicted to have higher abundance in cmid scenario and inconsiderable changes in cwet scenarioover 1993 2006 compared to the observed level which showed a generally increasing trend during the same period differently higher abundance was predicted at site 804 for both future climate scenarios over 1994 2003 in comparison to observed level from 2003 onwards total abundance for cmid and cwet scenarios at site 804 was predicted to be lower than the observed values with decreasing rate of cmid being higher than that of cwet scenario site 808 811 and 814 exhibited generally decreasing patterns over time for cmid scenario with higher abundances over 1993 1997 compared to the observed scenario the predicted abundance for cwet at site 808 showed insignificant change i e 95 confidence interval contains 0 while those at sites 811 and 814 were anticipated to dip around 2000 then increase again to converge the observed level in 2006 3 2 3 macroinvertebrate taxa richness macroinvertebrate taxa richness was predicted to generally increase for sites 808 and 811 whereas it remained fairly stable for site 801 decreased at site 804 while dropping before increasing again at site 814 over the period of 1994 2006 for both cmid and cwet scenarios as illustrated in fig 7 at site 801 indiscernible difference was predicted between cmid and observed scenarios whereas higher taxa richness was anticipated for cwet relative to observed level at this site over 1999 2002 except for site 804 where predictions showed higher taxa richness for both cmid and cwet scenarios during 1994 2004 before going under the observed values from 2004 onwards the midstream and downstream sites sites 808 811 and 814 were anticipated to have generally lower taxa richness for both climate change scenarios compared to the observed level and cwet lower than cmid however the predictions of cmid tend to converge the observed values by 2003 for site 808 and 811 and by 2005 for site 814 and the increasing rate of cwet predictions were higher than those of cmid 3 3 consideration of equivalent models the investigation of equivalent models to the presently developed causal models for macroinvertebrate abundance and richness showed that only the arrows in time c rain and time c temp were reversable all the remaining arrows could not be reversed or replaced with a bi directed edge without producing inconsistent d separation statements i e conditional independence implications with those of the pre replacement causal diagrams the graphical results of the tests of equivalent models are shown in figs s7 and s8 in the supplemental information the reversable arrows indicated these links between c rain and time as well as c temp and time had an indetermined status according to pearl 2000 the irreversible and unreplaceable arrows indicated that these conditional independences held which gave tenability to the hypothesized causal relationships in the pre replacement causal diagrams 4 discussion in this study ecohydrological causal models for the murray river were developed to predict the response of macroinvertebrates under different climate scenarios the models demonstrate the potential for using causal modelling principles to integrate long term monitoring data on macroinvertebrates water quality hydrology and climate with an existing hydroclimate salinity model for the mdb as such our study provides a conceptual framework to incorporate different data from different sources in a mechanistic way to track the impacts of climate change on freshwater macroinvertebrates some aspects of the integrated model have been validated but until further validation is undertaken the predicted responses in environmental variables and macroinvertebrates should be treated cautiously two climate change scenarios from the mdbsyp were considered including a 1 c increase in catchment temperature together with a 2 8 decrease in catchment rainfall for the best estimate median of the future climate cmid scenario and 1 c increase in catchment temperature together with an 8 increase in catchment rainfall for the extremely wet estimate of the future climate cwet scenario predicted responses in environmental variables and macroinvertebrates described below must be treated cautiously given the uncertainties in the statistical models le et al 2020 and the gcms and river models used in the mdbsym csiro 2007 09 and the need to validate the integrated causal model at the very least with new data in both future climate scenarios increases were predicted in turbidity and water temperature which followed the increase in local air temperature for both the cmid and cwet scenarios our predictions accord with the projections of gooseff et al 2005 van vliet et al 2013 and mukundan et al 2018 on potential increases in water temperature and turbidity due to climate change on the other hand significant decreases in salinity were predicted especially from the mid to the lowermost sites of the murray river under both climate change scenarios which are possibly related to the effects of the salt interception and drainage diversion schemes incorporated in the msm bigmod of the mdbsym mdbc 2002 high flow events were predicted to be of generally greater magnitudes than the observed ones for cwet and smaller magnitudes for cmid though the changes occurred differently over space and time the significant shifts in the environmental variables were predicted to lead to considerable shifts most negative in macroinvertebrate abundance and richness over the 1994 2006 period macroinvertebrate abundance was predicted to be lower under the climate change scenarios than the observed one at midstream and downstream sites sites 808 811 and 814 for most of the time during the period 1994 2006 only getting slightly higher by the end of the period while the opposite was predicted for the upstream sites 801 and 804 as the variation in macroinvertebrate abundance was mainly associated with the variations in flow and ec the shifts predicted in macroinvertebrate abundance at each site were mainly due to the changes in flow and ec for the cmid and cwet scenarios as ec was nearly unchanged at site 801 and 804 for the future climate scenarios compared to observed values flow regime was the main driver of the changes in abundance at these sites the higher abundance predicted at site 804 for both the cmid and cwet scenarios compared to the observed one may be related to the higher flow at this site under the climate change scenarios however predicted abundance at this site exhibited no or very little increase over time this is possibly due to the flood in 1993 at site 804 being predicted to be much lower for cmid q90 med 4 8 and cwet q90 med 6 4 in comparison with the observed flood with a q90 med of 17 1 site 801 also showed a stable trend over time for abundance which appears to be related to the lack of large floods the changes in abundance from site 808 down were the contributions of both flow regime and ec and it is difficult to apportion their influences without decomposing the total effect of climate change into its component indirect effects similarly lower richness was predicted under the two future climate scenarios relative to the observed scenario for most of the period at most sites except for site 804 taxa richness was governed by flow ec ph water temperature and turbidity while ph showed undetectable change for both climate change scenarios water temperature at all sites was higher in cmid and cwet compared to observed scenario with increases ranging from 0 6 c at sites 801 811 and 814 to 1 5 c at site 804 for both cmid and cwet turbidity at the upstream and mid reach sites including sites 801 808 exhibited indiscernible changes while increases in turbidity were significant at sites 811 and 814 the higher taxa richness at site 804 in both climate change scenarios relative to observed levels therefore appears to be attributable to the higher water temperature and the lack of destructive power of the 1993 flood like the trend of total abundance at site 804 taxa richness at this site was also predicted to be stable for both climate change scenarios and being lower than the observed level from 2004 onwards though macroinvertebrate abundance and richness were predicted to be lower for the cmid and cwet scenarios than the observed one in most of the studied period steady increases were predicted in abundance and richness which led to the convergence of the cmid lines with the observed ones and higher values of cwet by 2006 at downstream sites 808 811 and 814 compared to the observed levels larger floods caused by this scenario may lead to an increase in macroinvertebrate abundance and richness over time this finding appears to be consistent with the observation of van looy et al 2016 who found an increase in macroinvertebrate abundance and richness over 20 years especially an abrupt increase in the community metrics across rivers and streams in france since 2000 which was attributed to climate change but likely related to the widespread floods over france in 1999 2001 vaughan and ormerod 2012 and vaughan and gotelli 2019 also reported an increase in macroinvertebrate richness across england and wales over the period 1991 2008 which was attributable to the climatic debt being offset by the improvement of water quality the work of vaughan and colleagues appear to be in line with our study in acknowledging the importance of taking into account the interactions amongst multiple stressors to explain the change of macroinvertebrate communities the consideration of equivalent models showed that there exist equivalent models to the currently developed causal models which resulted from reversing the arrows connecting time with c rain c temp whilst these equivalent models cannot be statistically distinguished from the hypothesized models the reversed arrows time c rain and time c temp produced illogical relationships implying catchment rainfall catchment temperature was the cause of sampling order i e count of observations the presently developed causal models therefore were still supported however all the causal relationships indicated in these causal models must be regarded as tentative as argued by pearl 2000 and paul and anderson 2013 integrating mdbsym into the causal model for macroinvertebrate communities accounted for the complicated processes that govern flows and ec along the river murray including catchment scale climate change rainfall runoff groundwater recharge river system operation and salinity interception and drainage diversion schemes csiro 2007 09 mdbc 2002 by putting all the available variables in a causal structure showing the paths through which climate change can influence macroinvertebrate communities it sheds light on the ways the ecosystems can be managed or restored it also reveals how river management e g river operation and interception schemes in concert with climate change may affect the aquatic systems limitations are acknowledged regarding the arbitrary method used here to estimate local changes in rainfall and temperature for the climate change scenarios which did not account for seasonal differences however this was due to the unavailability of data at the local scale for the climate simulations used in the mdbsyp additionally while piecewise sem enables the use of non parametric models e g gams to capture non linear abiotic and biotic responses to climate change and the integration of different models and data types it is difficult to quantify uncertainties associated with each node variable in the causal diagram model that were propagated throughout the network of the causal models it is also noteworthy that gams do have limitation in predicting responses to changes that are out of the observed data range this would be improved by using more appropriate theoretical models that account for ecological and environmental processes to predict abiotic and biotic responses or more input data 5 conclusion our results reinforce the potential to use piecewise sem in integrating data from different sources including monitoring data and existing models to predict the responses of biological communities to climate change climate change impacts on macroinvertebrates reflect in the impacts of flow regimes especially floods le et al 2020 and temperature regimes johnson and penaluna 2019 theodoropoulos and karaouzas 2021 but are also mediated by other variables e g water quality which have compounded effects on the aquatic ecosystem dyer et al 2011 2014 li et al 2018 the causal models developed in this study address these compounded effects and the combined effects of climate change and human activities such as land use and river regulation which should be considered for a comprehensive assessment of the ecological impacts of management activities in a changing climate any improvement in data obtaining including future monitoring data data on land use river operation new policy implementation or updated climate change scenario simulations would be easily integrated to the causal models to explore the ecological effects of a richer set of policy and management options although the predictions of climate change effects on macroinvertebrate communities are interesting the real value of these models lies on the ability to answer what if questions related to interventions in any node of the hierarchical causal

15120,climate change is projected to threaten ecological communities through changes in temperature rainfall runoff patterns and mediated changes in other environmental variables their combined effects are difficult to comprehend without the mathematical machinery of causal modelling using piecewise structural equation modelling we aim to predict the responses of aquatic macroinvertebrate total abundance and richness to disturbances generated by climate change our approach involves integrating an existing hydroclimate salinity model for the murray darling basin australia into our recently developed statistical models for macroinvertebrates using long term monitoring data on macroinvertebrates water quality climate and hydrology spanning 2 300 km of the murray river our exercise demonstrates the potential of causal modelling for integrating data and models from different sources as such optimal use of valuable existing data and merits of previously developed models

increase the vulnerability of river systems and their dependant ecosystems which have been under pressure from human activities such as river regulation and water extraction bunn and arthington 2002 gippel and blackham 2002 kingsford 2000 walker 1985 the impacts of global climate change on river ecosystems manifest through magnifying the variability of temperature and precipitation increasing the frequency and intensity of floods and droughts and altering runoff patterns and streamflow regimes kundzewicz et al 2008 milly et al 2005 2002 palmer et al 2008 planning and prioritization of adaptation options to balance the future needs of society and the environment would be facilitated by coupling scenario based models that capture the spectrum of hydrological impacts of climate change palmer et al 2008 with ecohydrological models to predict their ecological consequences poff et al 2010 overall climate change has the potential to affect habitat temperature regimes rates of ecosystem processes and phenological cues johnson and penaluna 2019 not all species or systems are equally vulnerable with assessment finding that systems in good condition daneshvar et al 2017 and species at the top of food webs at greater risk woodward et al 2016 analysis of long term data has revealed that increasing temperatures affect macroinvertebrate distributions durance and ormerod 2007 and community composition chessman 2009 climate change will also affect habitat through its influence on flow regimes with increasingly severe and frequent droughts likely to be a major impact ledger et al 2013 2012 the evidence of multi decadal effects of large floods on macroinvertebrate communities daufresne et al 2007 le et al 2020 2021 indicates that climate change in the form of changes in flood frequency and intensity can considerably impact upon aquatic ecosystems modelling has revealed similar results using a range of approaches including temperature tolerances carr et al 2019 habitat models at reach waddle and holmquist 2013 and continental scales domisch et al 2013 however it remains a key challenge to develop a mechanistic and predictive understanding of the impacts of climate change in a complex natural system across multiple spatiotemporal scales and the potentially important synergetic effects of climate change components and other abiotic biotic and anthropogenic stressors woodward et al 2010 climate change is associated with a range of threats that come on top of existing threats such as land use change river regulation and salinisation paul et al 2018 reid et al 2019 there is considerable uncertainty about the extent to which threats will interact but evidence of synergistic additive and antagonistic interactions has been found jackson et al 2016 it is therefore important to consider these interactions if we are going to sustain environmental values johnson and penaluna 2019 mantyka pringle et al 2016 in response multiple threats have been examined primarily temperature and flow knouft and ficklin 2017 but also land use change flow and water chemistry kath et al 2018 li et al 2018 mantyka pringle et al 2014 and temperature and nutrients spears et al 2022 including multiple threats and their interactions carries with it risks around compounding uncertainty trade offs between complexity and accuracy hernandez suarez and nejadhashemi 2018 the use of ensemble modelling has emerged as one way to integrate models and enhance predictive ability hernandez suarez and nejadhashemi 2018 in australia s murray darling basin climate change is likely to have a major impact on long term average temperatures and river flow as well as increases in the frequency and intensity of adverse climatic events such as heat waves and drought the magnitude of potential changes was illustrated during the millennium drought 1997 2009 which in 2009 saw inflows into the murray river reduced to almost 10 of the long term average prosser et al 2021 saft et al 2016 of longer term interest has been that the system has not rebounded in terms of runoff hughes and prosser 2012 or environmental values mac nally et al 2014 projections of streamflow in the region are generally for a moderate to large reduction prosser et al 2021 these declines are predicted to be in the order of 20 by 2060 compared to a 1976 2005 baseline under a 2 c global warming scenario prosser et al 2021 the murray river is australia s longest river that together with its major tributary the darling river drains the 1 106 km2 murray darling basin mdb after decades of developing the river to support irrigated agriculture transport and hydropower water dependant ecosystems condition began to degrade native fish populations declined salinity increased to levels in the lower murray that were considered unfit for human consumption paul et al 2018 and the condition of long lived floodplain vegetation deteriorated mac nally et al 2014 in recognition of the need for sustainable management australia s commonwealth and state governments collaboratively implemented large scale water reform that culminated in the basin plan hart 2016 australian governments have committed to restoring the mdb including the murray river as part of the long term reform water quality and biological macroinvertebrate and phytoplankton monitoring programs were established by the murray darling basin authority mdba in 1980 to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to manage flows salt and nutrients in the river bennison et al 1989 paul et al 2013 however climate change threatens to undermine their attempts to protect and restore its environmental values it is important that we improve our understanding of the effects of climate change if we are to achieve the basin plan s objectives and manage the risks associated with climate change forecasting the impacts of climate change on murray river invertebrate communities will improve managers capacity to identify and manage the risks using causal modelling such as bayesian networks bns and traditional sem to predict the combined effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities on water quality flow regime and biological communities have been done before e g dyer et al 2011 li et al 2018 mantyka pringle et al 2014 by breaking down complex systems into components that can be addressed separately causal modelling approaches have showed advantages in tracing and communicating the mechanisms underlying the impacts of climate change and or human activities e g dyer et al 2011 li et al 2018 mantyka pringle et al 2014 and facilitating integration of knowledge and data from different sources kelly et al 2013 however there are limitations associated with these approaches including assumptions of linear relationships between and normal error distributions of variables in the causal structures moreover previous studies rarely if at all explicitly represented the impacts of climate change in a system across various spatial and temporal scales our aim here is to use piecewise structural equation modelling sem as an ensemble modelling framework to link models of local scale water quality and biological monitoring with basin scale hydroclimate salinity and global scale climate to predict macroinvertebrate responses to basin scale climate change in the presence of human activities for the murray river piecewise sem evolved from traditional sem lefcheck 2016 has the flexibility that stems from the shift from global estimation and testing i e estimating all parameters of the sem simultaneously from the model implied covariance matrix and testing the sem by comparing the observed and model implied covariance matrices to local estimation and testing i e parameters are estimated separately for each response variable and testing is based on local conditional independencies entailed by the causal structure additionally conditional independence tests are based on the graph theoretic notion of directional separation or d separation pearl 2000 shipley 2000a 2000b these evolutions help relax the usual assumptions of linear relationships and multivariate normal distributions that underpin traditional covariance based sem and enables model building and testing to be done with conventional statistical methods and general purpose statistics packages lefcheck 2016 shipley 2000b this method has been previously applied in the field of ecological risk assessment which can often involve nonlinear models and nonnormal error distributions paul and anderson 2013 paul et al 2016 anticipating the effects that climate change may have on macroinvertebrates is a difficult task given the many indirect effects that climate change can have on macroinvertebrate communities that cross multiple spatiotemporal scales developing a piecewise structural equation model as a framework to integrate recently developed statistical models for macroinvertebrates with the basin scale existing model should make this task more tractable 2 methods 2 1 study sites the five study sites were located in four geomorphically distinct tracts of the murray river including headwaters riverine mallee and lower murray spanning over 2300 km of the river site 801 is situated in the headwaters which is characterized by high bed slope about 16 cm km fast flowing tributaries and a sand riverbed with an underlying gravel layer site 804 is located downstream of the yarrawonga weir in the riverine tract where the river flows slowly across a broad floodplain comprised of fine silt and clays site 808 is situated in the mallee tract with the river generally having a single large channel 10 20 m width medium current velocity and a substrate composed mainly of sand with some silt clay the remaining two sites site 811 and 814 are located below the confluence with the highly turbid darling river in the lower murray which is distinguished by low bed slopes 5 cm km sinuosities slow flows and highly adhesive bank components silt clay contents 12 41 climate conditions range from temperate in the river s headwaters mean annual rainfall of approximately 800 mm and the river s mouth mean annual rainfall of about 400 mm to semi arid with mean annual rainfall of about 260 mm in its mid reach the study sites are illustrated in fig 1 2 2 data 2 2 1 macroinvertebrates as part of the river murray biological monitoring program bennison et al 1989 macroinvertebrates were collected in winter may june and summer october december during the study period from 1980 to 2012 using artificial substrate samplers bennison et al 1989 an artificial substrate sampler was a basket formed from black plastic gutterguard mesh size 10 mm of 180 mm height and 240 mm diameter with one and a quarter commercially available polypropylene leno weave onion bags total area of 0 42 m2 placed inside as substratum and a clean river rock or half a house brick included as ballast bennison et al 1989 five out of ten samplers that were placed on the riverbed at depths less than 1 5 m and retrieved after six weeks were used for each observation i e specific year season and site for each site season year combination the material from five of the samplers was sieved through a 250 μm mesh sieve then the animals were removed and preserved in 70 ethanol before being identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible mostly genus and species some were identified to class and order according to taxa known prior to 1985 and counted bennison et al 1989 macroinvertebrate total abundance and taxa richness were defined as the number of individuals and the number of taxa per observation respectively 2 2 2 water quality flow and local climate water quality data including weekly measurements of ph turbidity electrical conductivity and water temperature at the nearest upstream sites to those of the biological monitoring program were obtained from the river murray water quality monitoring program wqmp biswas and lawrence 2013 for the period 1980 2012 local daily air temperature and rainfall were collected from the bureau of meteorology for the stations nearest to the water quality monitoring sites bureau of meteorology 2012 daily or weekly volumetric flow data from 1961 to 2012 were obtained for nearby hydrologic gauging stations all observations were averaged over 12 weeks for two seasonal periods referred to as winter and summer where the midpoint of each period coincided with the date of deployment of the artificial substrate samplers used to monitor the macroinvertebrate communities 2 2 3 catchment mdb climate monthly temperature and rainfall averages for the mdb from 1895 to 2006 were obtained from the bureau of meteorology 2018 because the deployment period for artificial substrate samplers did not coincide with calendar months it was decided to average monthly climate observations over 6 month periods dec jun for summer and jul nov for winter 2 2 4 models the murray darling sustainable yields project the basin scale hydroclimate salinity model used in this study was developed under the murray darling basin sustainable yields project mdbsyp and will be referred to as mdbsym hereafter the project was a comprehensive basin wide assessment of water availability for the mdb created a framework to integrate global and regional scale climate models a basin scale rainfall runoff model and all of the mdb s river hydrologic models to investigate the impacts of climate change and catchment development on water availability and water use across the basin csiro 2007 09 four scenarios were assessed in the mdbsyp including 1 historical climate defined by 112 years 1985 2006 of daily climate data and current development scenario a 2 recent climate 1997 2006 and current development scenario b 3 future climate and current development scenario c and 4 future climate and future development scenario d future climate conditions around the year 2030 were obtained based on the results of 15 global climate models gcms based on three global warming scenarios i e high medium and low global warming scenarios relative to 1990 the data generated for future climate scenarios were not forecasts for 2030 but time series of 112 year data from 1895 to 2006 obtained by scaling the historical climate data of the same period development scenarios included current development i e the average of 1975 to 2005 land use and small farm dam conditions the dams weirs and license entitlements and future development i e 2030 projected growth in farm dam capacity commercial forestry plantations and groundwater extraction more detailed information on the simulation scenarios are presented in the reports of csiro chiew et al 2008 the results of mdbsym for the future climate scenarios were projected for the period 1895 2006 the hydrologic gauging stations used to develop mdbsym overlap with long term monitoring sites for macroinvertebrates and water quality creating an opportunity to integrate the mdbsym with statistical models that were previously developed for macroinvertebrates in this study only scenario c including cmid median and cwet extremely wet variants of this scenario was considered due to the unavailability of the other scenarios scenario c data consisted of flow and ec the outputs from the mdbsy model including flows and salinity ec for the murray river for the mid and wet climate scenarios i e cmid and cwet were used in the present analysis catchment and local climate the average catchment temperature for 2030 is anticipated to increase by 0 6 to 1 5 c relative to 1990 for the median global warming scenario with projected increases being higher in the northern mdb than the southern mdb chiew et al 2008 timbal et al 2015 noted that projected changes for the murray basin in the southern mdb were similar amongst global warming scenarios and seasons the range of projected increases in mean temperature for the murray basin for all global warming scenarios gcms and seasons was 0 6 to 1 3 c timbal et al 2015 in the present study for simplification an increase of 1 c was used for both the cmid and cwet scenarios to scale the historical catchment and local temperature series annual catchment rainfall for the future climate scenario was projected to decrease by 2 8 for the cmid scenario and increase by 8 for the cwet scenario chiew et al 2008 and historical catchment rainfall was scaled accordingly for the two scenarios rainfall projections differed between the northern and southern mdb local rainfall for the southern mdb including the murray basin was projected to decrease by 5 for cmid and increase by 5 to 10 for cwet in 2030 relative to 1990 chiew et al 2008 an average increase of 7 5 for cwet and decrease of 5 for cmid were used to scale historical local rainfalls at monitoring sites along the murray river macroinvertebrate response using the same monitoring dataset described in sections 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 le et al 2020 modelled macroinvertebrate abundance and richness using a distributed lag nonlinear model dlnm as a function of the delayed effects of flow and the contemporaneous effects of salinity measured as electrical conductivity or ec ph turbidity and water temperature the dlnm used the q90 med hydrological index i e 6 monthly 90th non exceedance percentile flow scaled by the long term median flow to quantify the relationship between macroinvertebrates abundance and richness and flow at different magnitudes and lags taxa richness decreased with increasing ec and ph whereas it varied seasonally with temperature abundance displayed a unimodal response to ec with a peak at about 300 μs cm whereas it decreased with increasing turbidity and varied seasonally with temperature cross validation of the models indicated that predictions were generally very good considering the noisiness of the data le et al 2020 the results of these models in terms of statistically significant variables were used for variable selection in the piecewise sem and for predicting the responses of macroinvertebrates in the final causal models coupling the simulation mdbsym with these statistical models enables accounting for the indirect effects on macroinvertebrates of changes in climate flow and salinity that are mediated by other variables in the macroinvertebrate statistical models i e ph turbidity and water temperature as well as the potential spatiotemporal confounding that could be introduced by natural trends in these other variables 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 building and testing piecewise sems a hypothesized causal diagram for the murray river macroinvertebrates involving the available variables and the mdbsym was developed based on the literature reported in section s1 of the supplemental information and is given in fig 2 in this diagram nodes represent variables that serve as both predictors and responses in the causal structure and arrows represent causal relationships the definitions names and units of the variables are given in table 1 an exploratory analysis was then conducted to build statistical models for each node in the causal diagram and the causal diagram was refined based on the functional relationships defined by this set of models for the analysis generalized additive models gam were fitted to predict each of the environmental variables as a function of their hypothesized predictors using the r package mgcv wood 2006 for example from the causal diagram in fig 2 water temperature is hypothesised to be driven by local temperature local rainfall flow and velocity hence a gam was fitted to predict water temperature as a function of the aforementioned predictors model selection was done by removing statistically non significant variables in the gam models with subsets of predictors were then assessed using the bayesian information criterion bic and akaike information criterion aic to select the optimal models i e a model with lower bic or aic is considered better for discussions of aic and bic in model selection see burnham and anderson 2004 chakrabarti and ghosh 2011 the residuals of each model were also diagnosed to detect any remaining spatiotemporal patterns the causal diagram was then further adapted for each of the community metrics macroinvertebrate total abundance and taxa richness e g different gams were used for total abundance and richness for each community metric the arrows representing the statistically significant relationships between the environmental variables and the macroinvertebrate variable were retained or added in the case that support could be found in the literature for such linkages while those of non significant relationships were removed from the causal diagram the basis set of d separation statements entailed by the causal diagram see shipley 2000b representing the set of conditional independencies to be tested was derived using the r package ggm marchetti 2006 conditional independences were tested based on the methods proposed for additive models by pearl 2000 shipley 2000b and zhang et al 2017 p values from all the conditional independence tests were retained to use later in the fisher s c test the significance level used for the conditional tests was adjusted according to the bonferroni correction for multiple testing to give a family error rate of 0 05 as suggested by bender and lange 2001 miller 1981 rice 1989 shipley 2000b accordingly the adjusted significance level was calculated by dividing 0 05 by the number of conditional independence tests required for each causal diagram the conditional independence between variables was confirmed if the p values of the inferential tests were greater than the adjusted significance level fisher s c test shipley 2000b was used as a global test of all conditional independencies with a significance level of 0 05 the final causal model for each macroinvertebrate metrics was used to predict macroinvertebrate responses in the future climate scenarios i e the simulated data for future climate scenarios projected on the historical data over the period 1895 2006 the process of model building and testing is depicted in detail in section s2 of the supplemental information 2 3 3 predicting the shift in macroinvertebrate communities under climate change scenarios the two final causal models for macroinvertebrate abundance and richness were used to predict the shifts in macroinvertebrate communities under two future climate scenarios cmid and cwet for each scenario we predicted the mean response of each variable node in the causal diagram then added the observed residuals to the predicted means to derive the counterfactual predictions the observed residuals define the context in which the counterfactual predictions were made with an assumption that the error terms for unobserved mediating variables i e variables that are not in the causal model remain unchanged by the intervention the counterfactual predictions describe what the data may have looked like had the climate been different 2 3 4 consideration of equivalent models although the tests of conditional independences may grant plausibility to the postulated relationships amongst variables in the final causal models equivalent models i e alternative causal structures that entail an equivalent set of conditional independencies need to be considered to clarify the strength of evidence for the causal relationships depicted in the causal structures paul and anderson 2013 pearl 2000 to identify the set of equivalent models each arrow in the causal diagrams for macroinvertebrate total abundance and taxa richness was replaced by a reversed arrow e g x y instead of x y or a bi directed arc x y reflecting a latent confounder influencing both x and y the basis set derived from the replacement was then checked for equivalence to the original basis set paul and anderson 2013 pearl 2000 this analytical step was done using the r package ggdag barrett 2018 3 results 3 1 structural equations for the piecewise sem the structural

structure for taxa richness 3 2 predicting the shift in environmental variables and macroinvertebrate communities under climate change scenarios 3 2 1 environmental variables predictions for future climate scenarios using the final causal model indicated a shift in all environmental variables under the climate change scenarios at each site compared to the actual conditions over the period of 1980 2006 as illustrated in figs 3 and 4 the means of the environmental variables for different scenarios for the period 1980 2006 are provided in table s4 of the si the changes in water temperature were positively correlated with the changes in local temperature for each scenario with an increase of 0 9 c and 0 8 c for cmid and cwet respectively ph exhibited undetectable differences amongst the scenarios velocity was predicted to slightly increase for both climate change scenarios with a higher increase for cwet for the other environmental variables the changes varied in time and space under different climate scenarios specifically non parametric mann whitney u tests showed a significant increase in turbidity at site 814 and site 811 under both cmid and cwet scenarios since 1985 to the end of the investigated period p values 0 05 compared to observed levels being higher at site 814 the other sites upstream showed no to inconsiderable change over time figs 3 g and 4 g the results from mdbsym showed that the average ec across all sites decreased from 290 µs cm under observed conditions to 226 µs cm and 212 µs cm for cmid and cwet respectively the reduction of ec under the two climate change scenarios resulted mainly from the reduction of ec at site 814 which displayed a decreasing trend over the period 1980 2006 with a considerable decline from 1980 to 1990 the predicted values for ec at site 811 and site 808 also displayed lower ec over 10 years from 1980 to 1990 but higher ec from 1990 onwards under both climate change scenarios compared to observed levels on the other hand site 804 and site 801 showed little or no change in ec over the entire investigated period figs 3 f and 4 f the predicted flow exhibited a decrease of approximately 2400 ml day for the cmid scenario and an increase of slightly over 1200 ml day for cwet in comparison with the observed flows the hydrologic index q90 med over the period 1961 2006 was plotted for the observed cmid and cwet scenarios as illustrated in figs 3 h and 4 h in general magnitudes of high flow events decreased for cmid and increased for cwet compared to the observed scenario for cmid flood magnitudes at site 811 were lower than the observed levels between 1961 and the mid 1990s although flood levels showed a decreasing trend from mid 1990s onwards the cmid prediction was higher than the observed scenario over this period at site 811 site 808 exhibited a similar trend for cmid scenario but the higher levels of floods occurred from 1961 to around 1990 floods at site 801 were predicted to have higher magnitudes than the observed scenario during the period of 1961 1970 but getting lower from 1970 onwards site 804 and 814 displayed slight increases in flood levels for the cmid scenario over the whole period flood magnitudes were predicted to increase considerably under cwet scenario at all sites except for site 801 over the studied period compared to the observed levels the highest increase was anticipated for site 814 followed by site 811 it is noted that both climate change scenarios predicted large floods in 1975 and 1993 as occurred historically but with different intensities in particular the magnitudes of the floods in 1975 and 1993 were smaller for both cmid and cwet than the actual flood that occurred except site 811 for the 1993 flood of cwet scenario the comparison of flood magnitudes for three scenarios is given in fig 5 3 2 2 macroinvertebrate total abundance the predictions of macroinvertebrate abundance for future climate scenarios cmid and cwet exhibited different patterns amongst sites comparisons of three scenarios observed cmid and cwet over the period 1994 2006 as limited by the available data are illustrated in fig 6 the uppermost site site 801 was predicted to have higher abundance in cmid scenario and inconsiderable changes in cwet scenarioover 1993 2006 compared to the observed level which showed a generally increasing trend during the same period differently higher abundance was predicted at site 804 for both future climate scenarios over 1994 2003 in comparison to observed level from 2003 onwards total abundance for cmid and cwet scenarios at site 804 was predicted to be lower than the observed values with decreasing rate of cmid being higher than that of cwet scenario site 808 811 and 814 exhibited generally decreasing patterns over time for cmid scenario with higher abundances over 1993 1997 compared to the observed scenario the predicted abundance for cwet at site 808 showed insignificant change i e 95 confidence interval contains 0 while those at sites 811 and 814 were anticipated to dip around 2000 then increase again to converge the observed level in 2006 3 2 3 macroinvertebrate taxa richness macroinvertebrate taxa richness was predicted to generally increase for sites 808 and 811 whereas it remained fairly stable for site 801 decreased at site 804 while dropping before increasing again at site 814 over the period of 1994 2006 for both cmid and cwet scenarios as illustrated in fig 7 at site 801 indiscernible difference was predicted between cmid and observed scenarios whereas higher taxa richness was anticipated for cwet relative to observed level at this site over 1999 2002 except for site 804 where predictions showed higher taxa richness for both cmid and cwet scenarios during 1994 2004 before going under the observed values from 2004 onwards the midstream and downstream sites sites 808 811 and 814 were anticipated to have generally lower taxa richness for both climate change scenarios compared to the observed level and cwet lower than cmid however the predictions of cmid tend to converge the observed values by 2003 for site 808 and 811 and by 2005 for site 814 and the increasing rate of cwet predictions were higher than those of cmid 3 3 consideration of equivalent models the investigation of equivalent models to the presently developed causal models for macroinvertebrate abundance and richness showed that only the arrows in time c rain and time c temp were reversable all the remaining arrows could not be reversed or replaced with a bi directed edge without producing inconsistent d separation statements i e conditional independence implications with those of the pre replacement causal diagrams the graphical results of the tests of equivalent models are shown in figs s7 and s8 in the supplemental information the reversable arrows indicated these links between c rain and time as well as c temp and time had an indetermined status according to pearl 2000 the irreversible and unreplaceable arrows indicated that these conditional independences held which gave tenability to the hypothesized causal relationships in the pre replacement causal diagrams 4 discussion in this study ecohydrological causal models for the murray river were developed to predict the response of macroinvertebrates under different climate scenarios the models demonstrate the potential for using causal modelling principles to integrate long term monitoring data on macroinvertebrates water quality hydrology and climate with an existing hydroclimate salinity model for the mdb as such our study provides a conceptual framework to incorporate different data from different sources in a mechanistic way to track the impacts of climate change on freshwater macroinvertebrates some aspects of the integrated model have been validated but until further validation is undertaken the predicted responses in environmental variables and macroinvertebrates should be treated cautiously two climate change scenarios from the mdbsyp were considered including a 1 c increase in catchment temperature together with a 2 8 decrease in catchment rainfall for the best estimate median of the future climate cmid scenario and 1 c increase in catchment temperature together with an 8 increase in catchment rainfall for the extremely wet estimate of the future climate cwet scenario predicted responses in environmental variables and macroinvertebrates described below must be treated cautiously given the uncertainties in the statistical models le et al 2020 and the gcms and river models used in the mdbsym csiro 2007 09 and the need to validate the integrated causal model at the very least with new data in both future climate scenarios increases were predicted in turbidity and water temperature which followed the increase in local air temperature for both the cmid and cwet scenarios our predictions accord with the projections of gooseff et al 2005 van vliet et al 2013 and mukundan et al 2018 on potential increases in water temperature and turbidity due to climate change on the other hand significant decreases in salinity were predicted especially from the mid to the lowermost sites of the murray river under both climate change scenarios which are possibly related to the effects of the salt interception and drainage diversion schemes incorporated in the msm bigmod of the mdbsym mdbc 2002 high flow events were predicted to be of generally greater magnitudes than the observed ones for cwet and smaller magnitudes for cmid though the changes occurred differently over space and time the significant shifts in the environmental variables were predicted to lead to considerable shifts most negative in macroinvertebrate abundance and richness over the 1994 2006 period macroinvertebrate abundance was predicted to be lower under the climate change scenarios than the observed one at midstream and downstream sites sites 808 811 and 814 for most of the time during the period 1994 2006 only getting slightly higher by the end of the period while the opposite was predicted for the upstream sites 801 and 804 as the variation in macroinvertebrate abundance was mainly associated with the variations in flow and ec the shifts predicted in macroinvertebrate abundance at each site were mainly due to the changes in flow and ec for the cmid and cwet scenarios as ec was nearly unchanged at site 801 and 804 for the future climate scenarios compared to observed values flow regime was the main driver of the changes in abundance at these sites the higher abundance predicted at site 804 for both the cmid and cwet scenarios compared to the observed one may be related to the higher flow at this site under the climate change scenarios however predicted abundance at this site exhibited no or very little increase over time this is possibly due to the flood in 1993 at site 804 being predicted to be much lower for cmid q90 med 4 8 and cwet q90 med 6 4 in comparison with the observed flood with a q90 med of 17 1 site 801 also showed a stable trend over time for abundance which appears to be related to the lack of large floods the changes in abundance from site 808 down were the contributions of both flow regime and ec and it is difficult to apportion their influences without decomposing the total effect of climate change into its component indirect effects similarly lower richness was predicted under the two future climate scenarios relative to the observed scenario for most of the period at most sites except for site 804 taxa richness was governed by flow ec ph water temperature and turbidity while ph showed undetectable change for both climate change scenarios water temperature at all sites was higher in cmid and cwet compared to observed scenario with increases ranging from 0 6 c at sites 801 811 and 814 to 1 5 c at site 804 for both cmid and cwet turbidity at the upstream and mid reach sites including sites 801 808 exhibited indiscernible changes while increases in turbidity were significant at sites 811 and 814 the higher taxa richness at site 804 in both climate change scenarios relative to observed levels therefore appears to be attributable to the higher water temperature and the lack of destructive power of the 1993 flood like the trend of total abundance at site 804 taxa richness at this site was also predicted to be stable for both climate change scenarios and being lower than the observed level from 2004 onwards though macroinvertebrate abundance and richness were predicted to be lower for the cmid and cwet scenarios than the observed one in most of the studied period steady increases were predicted in abundance and richness which led to the convergence of the cmid lines with the observed ones and higher values of cwet by 2006 at downstream sites 808 811 and 814 compared to the observed levels larger floods caused by this scenario may lead to an increase in macroinvertebrate abundance and richness over time this finding appears to be consistent with the observation of van looy et al 2016 who found an increase in macroinvertebrate abundance and richness over 20 years especially an abrupt increase in the community metrics across rivers and streams in france since 2000 which was attributed to climate change but likely related to the widespread floods over france in 1999 2001 vaughan and ormerod 2012 and vaughan and gotelli 2019 also reported an increase in macroinvertebrate richness across england and wales over the period 1991 2008 which was attributable to the climatic debt being offset by the improvement of water quality the work of vaughan and colleagues appear to be in line with our study in acknowledging the importance of taking into account the interactions amongst multiple stressors to explain the change of macroinvertebrate communities the consideration of equivalent models showed that there exist equivalent models to the currently developed causal models which resulted from reversing the arrows connecting time with c rain c temp whilst these equivalent models cannot be statistically distinguished from the hypothesized models the reversed arrows time c rain and time c temp produced illogical relationships implying catchment rainfall catchment temperature was the cause of sampling order i e count of observations the presently developed causal models therefore were still supported however all the causal relationships indicated in these causal models must be regarded as tentative as argued by pearl 2000 and paul and anderson 2013 integrating mdbsym into the causal model for macroinvertebrate communities accounted for the complicated processes that govern flows and ec along the river murray including catchment scale climate change rainfall runoff groundwater recharge river system operation and salinity interception and drainage diversion schemes csiro 2007 09 mdbc 2002 by putting all the available variables in a causal structure showing the paths through which climate change can influence macroinvertebrate communities it sheds light on the ways the ecosystems can be managed or restored it also reveals how river management e g river operation and interception schemes in concert with climate change may affect the aquatic systems limitations are acknowledged regarding the arbitrary method used here to estimate local changes in rainfall and temperature for the climate change scenarios which did not account for seasonal differences however this was due to the unavailability of data at the local scale for the climate simulations used in the mdbsyp additionally while piecewise sem enables the use of non parametric models e g gams to capture non linear abiotic and biotic responses to climate change and the integration of different models and data types it is difficult to quantify uncertainties associated with each node variable in the causal diagram model that were propagated throughout the network of the causal models it is also noteworthy that gams do have limitation in predicting responses to changes that are out of the observed data range this would be improved by using more appropriate theoretical models that account for ecological and environmental processes to predict abiotic and biotic responses or more input data 5 conclusion our results reinforce the potential to use piecewise sem in integrating data from different sources including monitoring data and existing models to predict the responses of biological communities to climate change climate change impacts on macroinvertebrates reflect in the impacts of flow regimes especially floods le et al 2020 and temperature regimes johnson and penaluna 2019 theodoropoulos and karaouzas 2021 but are also mediated by other variables e g water quality which have compounded effects on the aquatic ecosystem dyer et al 2011 2014 li et al 2018 the causal models developed in this study address these compounded effects and the combined effects of climate change and human activities such as land use and river regulation which should be considered for a comprehensive assessment of the ecological impacts of management activities in a changing climate any improvement in data obtaining including future monitoring data data on land use river operation new policy implementation or updated climate change scenario simulations would be easily integrated to the causal models to explore the ecological effects of a richer set of policy and management options although the predictions of climate change effects on macroinvertebrate communities are interesting the real value of these models lies on the ability to answer what if questions related to interventions in any node of the hierarchical causal

15121,anaerobic digestion of lipid rich wastewater generally suffers from foaming induced by long chain fatty acid lcfa however a systematic understanding of lcfa inhibition especially the physical inhibition on interfacial interaction still remains unclear here we combined bubble probe atomic force microscope and impinging jet technique to unravel the interfacial interactions controlled by long chain fatty acids in anaerobic digestion we showed that lcfa had a significant inhibition on methane production in anaerobic reactors for the inhibition of the conversion of vfas to methane by measuring the lcfa influence on methanogenic archaea methanosarcina acetivorans c2a the results demonstrated that methanogenesis was limited for substrates utilization but not metabolic pathways the impinging jet technique results indicated that lcfa enhanced bubble separation from anaerobic granules and reduced the bubble bubble coalescence probability in addition the bubble probe atomic force microscope afm revealed that lcfa enhanced the adhesion force between bubbles by enhancing electrical double layer edl repulsion and decreasing hydrophobic interactions overall these results complement framework of lcfa inhibition in anerobic digestion and provide a nanomechanical insight into the fundamental interfacial interactions related to bubbles in anaerobic reactors graphical

will be made available on request 1 introduction to meet the united nations sustainable development goals and reduce dependence on fossil energy anaerobic digestion is needed for resource and energy recovery united nations 2015 zhang et al 2020 however the anaerobic digestion process is sensitive to certain accumulated chemicals such as long chain fatty acid lcfa which are rapidly produced from the hydrolysis of lipids in anaerobic bioreactors treating fat oil and grease rich wastewater jeganathan et al 2006 the accumulation of lcfa in the reactors can lead to foaming in anaerobic digesters with substantial economic losses yang et al 2021 cavaleiro et al 2016 therefore revealing the fundamental mechanisms of lcfa inhibition will help to develop effective methods for improving the yield of methane from anaerobic digestion increased lcfa content extends the lag phase of digestion or inhibits the performance of anaerobic reactors ziels et al 2017 previous results suggest that lcfa inhibition might be related to the limitation of nutrient accessibility due to adsorption onto the surface of microbes to form blocking layers elsamadony et al 2020 in anaerobic reactors multiple microbial trophic groups mainly hydrolyzing and fermenting bacteria syntrophic acetogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea have stable ecological niches ziels et al 2018 these groups are present in the form of microbial aggregates such as anaerobic granular sludge ags to enhance the exchange of hydrogen and electrons degrading complex organic compounds to methane stams et al 2009 however the effect of lcfa on model acidogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea in anaerobic reactors has not been described suitably in addition anaerobic reactor is a complex three phase system consisting of bubbles liquids and solid particles the accumulated lcfa behave as surfactants at neutral ph which can reduce the surface tension of the reactors and alter the hydrodynamic characteristics duan et al 2021 anaerobic reactors can be regarded as biological bubble containing systems where the characteristics of bubbles play a key role in hydrodynamics xie et al 2020 vakarelski et al 2019 qiao et al 2021 bubbles gas pockets dispersed in the liquid phase are the most basic unit of foam generation and gas transport in anaerobic reactors in anaerobic reactors interfacial interactions between bubbles and solid particles are directly correlated to the settlement and washout of anaerobic sludge in addition when two bubbles approach each other in a liquid phase they may bounce back or coalesce which significantly affects the hydrodynamics of reactors and the production of methane liu et al 2019 both interactions can be influenced by the surface tension of the reactors implying their relationship with lcfa bubble probe atomic force microscope a powerful tool for sensitive force measurements in single bubble level feng et al 2020 might provide a new insight into the characteristics of bubbles in anaerobic reactors with lcfa accumulation in the present study the effects of lcfa on the performance of ags model acidogenic bacteria ethanoligenens harbinense yuan 3 and methanogenic archaea methanosarcina acetivorans c2a were comprehensively examined furthermore the impinging jet technique and bubble probe afm technique were used to quantify the interfacial forces involved in bubble ags and bubble bubble interactions these results may complement framework of lcfa inhibition effects from a nanomechanical view which is of significance for reactor stability and optimization 2 materials and methods 2 1 anaerobic sludge and the selected strains ags was collected from an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor treating brewery wastewater qingdao china with total solid and volatile solid of 8 0 and 5 9 based on wet weight respectively an anaerobic bacterium ethanoligenens harbinense yuan 3 was purchased from the china general microbiological culture collection center and cultivated anaerobically in modified peptone yeast extract glucose medium at 37 c with agitation speed of 120 rpm li et al 2019 a methanogenic archaeon methanosarcina acetivorans c2a was purchased from japan collection of microorganisms and cultivated under anaerobic conditions at 37 c in the medium with methanol 0 16 mol l as the substrate feng et al 2021 2 2 influence of lcfa on ags and the selected strains sodium oleate naol a commonly identified lcfa in anaerobic reactors was used to evaluate the effect on ags and the selected strains ags 1 5 g l volatile solid was cultured in 200 ml anerobic wastewater table s1 of supporting information containing 0 0 5 1 0 5 0 and 10 0 g l naol at 37 c and 120 rpm for the selected strains naol was added to serum bottles at final concentrations of 10 50 100 and 500 mg l when the strain reached the logarithmic stage with an od600 of 0 3 volume of gas was measured by u type pressure gage according to previous studies li et al 2019 feng et al 2018 the methane content and methanol concentration were measured by gas chromatography gc 2014 shimadzu japan and the volatile fatty acid vfa and acetic acid were measured by high performance liquid chromatograph ultimate3000 thermo usa the glucose concentration was measured by dns reagent ghose solarbio china the aeration method was used to evaluate the foaming potential of solutions with different concentrations of naol according to duan et al 2021 simply a 30 ml sample was poured into a cone and aerated for 5 min with an air flow rate of 1 l min the foaming tendency was calculated from the volume of the highest foam ml divided by the air flow rate ml min the highest foam in the cone was measured within 5 min the surface tensions of the solutions were measured by a jk99c interfacial tensiometer powereach china fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy nicolet is50 thermo usa and contact angle goniometer jc2000d1 zhongchen co china was applied to analyze the adsorption of sodium oleate to the ags in the anaerobic reactors with 1 0 g l naol the analysis methods about quantification of gene expression and modified gompertz model fitting were described in text s1 s2 and table s2 of supporting information 2 3 the impinging jet experiment the deionized water washed ags was fixed onto glass plates diameter of 6 0 cm with epoxy glue methane bubbles were generated using a capillary tube inner diameter of 3 2 μm with 20 cm s velocity at the capillary outlet under 500 mm nacl solutions with different concentrations of naol all containers and tubing were intensively washed with deionized water before testing the process of bubbles rising to the glass plate was recorded by a high speed camera acuteye ketianjian co china the normalized bubble attachment flux j mm s are obtained based on eqs 1 and 2 detailed calculation is shown in text s3 1 β n t π r s 2 n t δ t π r c 2 u g 2 j d β d t t 0 where β mm 2 is the normalized bubble attachment density nt is the number of attached bubbles rs is the radius of the stagnation region 30 mm rc is the radius of the central circular section which is 100 mm over a given time t s and ug mm s is the rise velocity of the bubbles obtained by image processing 2 4 bubbles coalesce experiment a homemade capillary tube inner diameter of 3 2 μm was placed at the bottom in a column glass vessel 1 3 l methane bubbles radius 20 to 100 μm were generated and released continually in naol solutions the top surface of the trapped bubble was adjusted to approximately 1 cm above the capillary orifice which enabled observation of the complete dynamic process by a high speed camera acuteye ketianjian co china at 25 μm pixel resolution both off center collision and head on collision were considered in the test each probability data point was obtained from more than 100 collisions 2 5 force measurement by bubble probe afm methane bubbles radius 50 μm were generated and immobilized on the glass disk of a petri dish by purging methane through an ultrasharp glass pipet into aqueous solution ags was adhered to a glass disk by epoxy glue the tipless afm cantilever np o10 bruker germany was placed in an electron beam thermal evaporator meb 600 kyky china to coat a film with 5 nm titanium and 30 nm gold then the glass disk and afm cantilever were hydrophobized following an established method feng et al 2020 different concentrations of naol were added to be absorbed at the gas water interface after 5 min force measurements were conducted by afm nanowizard 4 bruker germany the typical force profiles were analyzed by data processing version 6 1 111 jpk 2 6 statistical analysis the statistical differences were analyzed by two tailed t tests the data were considered significant with the following criteria p 0 05 p 0 01 and p 0 001 3 results and discussion 3 1 lcfa cause physical inhibition om anaerobic digestion to investigate the inhibition of lcfa on anaerobic digestion methane production in the ags system with 0 5 10 g l lcfa was first studied fig 1a when the lcfa content was 0 5 1 0 5 0 and 10 0 g l the cumulative methane production after 60 h decreased to 6 31 6 16 4 20 and 0 00 ml compared with 8 26 ml at the control respectively fig 1b in addition when lcfa content increased to 1 0 and 5 0 g l the lag time significantly increased to 15 27 and 14 20 h compared with 13 96 h in the control respectively figs s1a s1b table s3 volatile fatty acids vfas are important intermediate products which could be converted to methane without lcfa the total vfas content decreased from the 12th hour to the 60th hour while that increased with the addition of lcfa fig s1c indicating that lcfa inhibited the conversion of vfas in addition acetic acid accounting for more than 69 0 of the total vfas content fig s1d increased significantly with increasing lcfa content at the 60th hour fig 1c as the main precursor of methane acetic acid conversion was inhibited by lcfa overall these results suggested that lcfa caused the instability of anaerobic digestion through the inhibition of the conversion of vfas especially acetic acid to methane to further explore the inhibition mechanism of lcfa in anaerobic reactors the effect of lcfa on acidogenic bacterium and methanogenic archaeon were investigated fig 1a for m acetivorans c2a methanol substrate degradation ratio significantly decreased from 77 67 to 26 93 33 22 21 17 and 19 68 for lcfa contents of 10 50 100 and 500 mg l respectively with methane production decreasing accordingly fig 1d however the variation in the expression of mcra and mtaa was not significant figs 1e s2 indicating that lcfa did not inhibit the key metabolic pathway of methane production in m acetivorans c2a as an anerobic bacterium e harbinense yuan 3 can catabolize carbohydrates to acetic acids alcohols co2 and h2 fig s3a the addition of lcfa at concentrations from 10 to 500 mg l had no significant effect on metabolism of e harbinense yuan 3 fig s3b d in addition the functional genes hyd a ⅰ and hyd a ii related to hydrogen production also had no significant variation fig s3e these results proved that lcfa may have a physical inhibition on methanogenesis but negligible influence on acetic acids production due to different limitation of nutrient accessibility 3 2 lcfa enhance bubble detachment from ags the foam bubble behaviors in anaerobic reactors were related with bubble ags and bubble bubble interactions fig 2a where inhibiting effects of lcfa were always ignored after the production of biogas the bubbles tend to detach from ags which can contribute to the biogas transport in anaerobic reactors to explore whether lcfa effect the bubble ags interaction lcfa adsorption onto ags surface was studied in the ftir spectrum fig 2b the absorbance of the characteristic peak near 1420 1560 2850 and 2920 cm 1 which belong to naol increased in ags after absorption proving that lcfa absorbed to the ags surface meanwhile significantly increased contact angle showed that ags after lcfa absorption is more hydrophobic than the initial ags fig 2c an impinging jet technique was performed to understand the bubble ags interaction by measuring the bubble attachment flux onto a flat solid surface fig 2d movie s1 simplified solutions have eliminated effect of specific ions and other surface active species as far as possible in fig 2e the mean flux of normalized bubble attachment onto ags decreased from 3 46 μm s to 1 15 1 73 1 98 and 2 45 μm s with lcfa concentrations increased from 0 to 10 50 100 and 500 mg l respectively in fig 2e the minimum bubble attachment flux was gotten at 10 mg l lcfa this may because that the electrical double layer edl force between ags and bubbles get the maximum due to the lcfa adsorption with the increase of lcfa concentration lcfa accumulates on the liquid film surface of bubbles partly forming bilayer and the hydrocarbon chain of outer lcfa decreased edl force these results showed that lcfa enhanced bubble detachment from ags indicating more bubbles rise to the surface of water and aggravate the foaming due to the heterogeneity of ags the bubble probe afm technique was used to semi quantitatively evaluate the adhesion forces between ags and bubbles under the influence of lcfa figs s4 s5a the lcfa significantly influenced the adhesion forces between ags and bubbles figs s5b s5c which may be due to the hydrophobic force edl force and surface roughness of ags wang et al 2020 xie et al 2015 moreover the retraction energy was significantly weakened by increasing the lcfa concentration fig s5d 3 3 lcfa reduce bubble bubble coalescence probability in anaerobic reactors most free bubbles may end its journey upwards at the gas water surface so bubbles collision incident bounce or coalesce are greatly important to the stability of bubbles affecting methane release fig 2a lcfa also induced foam in anaerobic reactors so the foaming tendency was used to evaluate the bubble bubble interaction in the solutions fig 3a in the ags system the foaming tendency increased gradually from 2 00 to 4 00 7 25 7 00 and 13 25 ml foam ml air min when the lcfa increased from 0 0 to 0 5 1 0 5 0 and 10 0 g l respectively fig 3b indicating more bubbles did not rupture and persisted for a long time at air water interface lcfa may reduce the surface tension of the solutions fig 3c contributing to the stable foaming won et al 2014 in addition the bubble coalesce experiment was used to analyze the effect of lcfa on bubbles collision incidents at air water interface fig 2d movie s2 in fig 3d lcfa reduce bubble bubble coalescence probability without lcfa the bubbles merged into a larger one almost immediately 0 4 ms upon collision fig 3e fig 3f movie s2 however bubbles in the 300 mg l lcfa solution bounced away from each other after interacting for a few milliseconds movie s2 initially the freshly released bubble oscillated in bulk and increased in height rapidly to hit the trapped bubble surface upon collision the bubble bounced back slightly a few times during which the kinetic energy was dissipated liu et al 2019 then the bubble rested below the trapped bubble and moved laterally at a slow speed fig 3e fig 3f lcfa significantly reduced the probability of coalescence including both pinch off and rise collisions in reality there is a much higher coalescence probability for off center collisions than for head on collisions fig 3f the relationship between the probability of coalescence and lcfa concentration can be fitted by an inverse cumulative normal distribution fig 3d which was in accordance with the dynamic adsorption of surfactant from the bulk to the air water interface pawliszak et al 2018 3 4 lcfa enhances the adhesion force between bubbles to further investigate the bubble bubble interaction at the single bubble level bubble probe afm was used to measure their forces fig 4a in the lcfa containing solution repulsion was observed when the two bubbles approached and no coalescence occurred even under a maximal load of 1 5 nn fig s6a fig 4b the adhesion force force of pulling the attached bubbles apart suggested that lcfa induced an increasing adhesion force fig 4b from 0 nn to 0 60 0 06 nn for lcfa concentrations of 0 to 500 mg l this result could be confirmed by the broad distribution of forces figs 4c s6b e e g from 0 01 1 64 nn 10 mg l lcfa to 0 04 2 45 nn 100 mg l lcfa moreover the retraction energy showed the same tendency that it was enhanced by the increasing lcfa concentration fig 4d in anaerobic reactors the methanogenic archaea were inhibited physically by lcfa due to limitation of nutrient accessibility then the high aerogenesis activity within cell clusters leads the dissolved co2 ch4 and h2 to supersaturate and to nucleate on the sediment surface into bubbles under appropriate conditions dervaux et al 2015 these bubbles can grow until their buoyancy and suitable turbulence pulls the bubbles away from the surface and rise up to the gas water surface forming foam the bubble bubble and bubble ags interactions are thought to play key roles in the hydrodynamics of anaerobic reactors qiao et al 2021 the main components in solution were rcooh l and rcooh aq under acidic and weakly alkaline conditions which can adsorb on ags surface fig s7 text s4 the sodium oleate acting as a protective shell layer decreased the surface tension gradually within 300 mg l and then reduced the pressure between adjacent bubbles or bubble particle affecting the stability of bubbles with little gas diffusion from the liquid film and slower film drainage in bubbles beneventi et al 2006 for two bubbles approaching each other in an aqueous solution the van der waals vdw interaction and hydrophobic interaction are always attractive while edl repulsion contributes positively to the disjoining pressure qiao et al 2021 the adsorption of negatively charged lcfa generally negatively changed the zeta optional of bubbles and enhanced the edl repulsion creux et al 2009 it could also decrease the hydrophobic interaction which promoted the instability of the liquid film however when the lcfa content is higher than 300 mg l the hydrocarbon chain of oleate ions interacts with each other on the bubble surfaces as part of the surface or the whole surface fills the bilayer hence the adhesion force in 500 mg l lcfa solution was lower than that in 100 mg l lcfa solution at the bounce process polyelectrolytes can lead to a decrease in the viscous dissipation associated with collisions in the related systems vakarelski et al 2019 in addition structural forces and the depletion forces between the surfaces also contributed to the bounce process in the presence of lcfa dervaux et al 2015 browne et al 2015 the development of nanomechanical techniques has enabled the direct quantification of surface interactions of bubbles systems in anaerobic reactors when anaerobic reactors operate in practice bubble size and complex composition of wastewater such as specific ions and surface active species can also affect bubble behaviors cui et al 2020

15121,anaerobic digestion of lipid rich wastewater generally suffers from foaming induced by long chain fatty acid lcfa however a systematic understanding of lcfa inhibition especially the physical inhibition on interfacial interaction still remains unclear here we combined bubble probe atomic force microscope and impinging jet technique to unravel the interfacial interactions controlled by long chain fatty acids in anaerobic digestion we showed that lcfa had a significant inhibition on methane production in anaerobic reactors for the inhibition of the conversion of vfas to methane by measuring the lcfa influence on methanogenic archaea methanosarcina acetivorans c2a the results demonstrated that methanogenesis was limited for substrates utilization but not metabolic pathways the impinging jet technique results indicated that lcfa enhanced bubble separation from anaerobic granules and reduced the bubble bubble coalescence probability in addition the bubble probe atomic force microscope afm revealed that lcfa enhanced the adhesion force between bubbles by enhancing electrical double layer edl repulsion and decreasing hydrophobic interactions overall these results complement framework of lcfa inhibition in anerobic digestion and provide a nanomechanical insight into the fundamental interfacial interactions related to bubbles in anaerobic reactors graphical

will be made available on request 1 introduction to meet the united nations sustainable development goals and reduce dependence on fossil energy anaerobic digestion is needed for resource and energy recovery united nations 2015 zhang et al 2020 however the anaerobic digestion process is sensitive to certain accumulated chemicals such as long chain fatty acid lcfa which are rapidly produced from the hydrolysis of lipids in anaerobic bioreactors treating fat oil and grease rich wastewater jeganathan et al 2006 the accumulation of lcfa in the reactors can lead to foaming in anaerobic digesters with substantial economic losses yang et al 2021 cavaleiro et al 2016 therefore revealing the fundamental mechanisms of lcfa inhibition will help to develop effective methods for improving the yield of methane from anaerobic digestion increased lcfa content extends the lag phase of digestion or inhibits the performance of anaerobic reactors ziels et al 2017 previous results suggest that lcfa inhibition might be related to the limitation of nutrient accessibility due to adsorption onto the surface of microbes to form blocking layers elsamadony et al 2020 in anaerobic reactors multiple microbial trophic groups mainly hydrolyzing and fermenting bacteria syntrophic acetogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea have stable ecological niches ziels et al 2018 these groups are present in the form of microbial aggregates such as anaerobic granular sludge ags to enhance the exchange of hydrogen and electrons degrading complex organic compounds to methane stams et al 2009 however the effect of lcfa on model acidogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea in anaerobic reactors has not been described suitably in addition anaerobic reactor is a complex three phase system consisting of bubbles liquids and solid particles the accumulated lcfa behave as surfactants at neutral ph which can reduce the surface tension of the reactors and alter the hydrodynamic characteristics duan et al 2021 anaerobic reactors can be regarded as biological bubble containing systems where the characteristics of bubbles play a key role in hydrodynamics xie et al 2020 vakarelski et al 2019 qiao et al 2021 bubbles gas pockets dispersed in the liquid phase are the most basic unit of foam generation and gas transport in anaerobic reactors in anaerobic reactors interfacial interactions between bubbles and solid particles are directly correlated to the settlement and washout of anaerobic sludge in addition when two bubbles approach each other in a liquid phase they may bounce back or coalesce which significantly affects the hydrodynamics of reactors and the production of methane liu et al 2019 both interactions can be influenced by the surface tension of the reactors implying their relationship with lcfa bubble probe atomic force microscope a powerful tool for sensitive force measurements in single bubble level feng et al 2020 might provide a new insight into the characteristics of bubbles in anaerobic reactors with lcfa accumulation in the present study the effects of lcfa on the performance of ags model acidogenic bacteria ethanoligenens harbinense yuan 3 and methanogenic archaea methanosarcina acetivorans c2a were comprehensively examined furthermore the impinging jet technique and bubble probe afm technique were used to quantify the interfacial forces involved in bubble ags and bubble bubble interactions these results may complement framework of lcfa inhibition effects from a nanomechanical view which is of significance for reactor stability and optimization 2 materials and methods 2 1 anaerobic sludge and the selected strains ags was collected from an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor treating brewery wastewater qingdao china with total solid and volatile solid of 8 0 and 5 9 based on wet weight respectively an anaerobic bacterium ethanoligenens harbinense yuan 3 was purchased from the china general microbiological culture collection center and cultivated anaerobically in modified peptone yeast extract glucose medium at 37 c with agitation speed of 120 rpm li et al 2019 a methanogenic archaeon methanosarcina acetivorans c2a was purchased from japan collection of microorganisms and cultivated under anaerobic conditions at 37 c in the medium with methanol 0 16 mol l as the substrate feng et al 2021 2 2 influence of lcfa on ags and the selected strains sodium oleate naol a commonly identified lcfa in anaerobic reactors was used to evaluate the effect on ags and the selected strains ags 1 5 g l volatile solid was cultured in 200 ml anerobic wastewater table s1 of supporting information containing 0 0 5 1 0 5 0 and 10 0 g l naol at 37 c and 120 rpm for the selected strains naol was added to serum bottles at final concentrations of 10 50 100 and 500 mg l when the strain reached the logarithmic stage with an od600 of 0 3 volume of gas was measured by u type pressure gage according to previous studies li et al 2019 feng et al 2018 the methane content and methanol concentration were measured by gas chromatography gc 2014 shimadzu japan and the volatile fatty acid vfa and acetic acid were measured by high performance liquid chromatograph ultimate3000 thermo usa the glucose concentration was measured by dns reagent ghose solarbio china the aeration method was used to evaluate the foaming potential of solutions with different concentrations of naol according to duan et al 2021 simply a 30 ml sample was poured into a cone and aerated for 5 min with an air flow rate of 1 l min the foaming tendency was calculated from the volume of the highest foam ml divided by the air flow rate ml min the highest foam in the cone was measured within 5 min the surface tensions of the solutions were measured by a jk99c interfacial tensiometer powereach china fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy nicolet is50 thermo usa and contact angle goniometer jc2000d1 zhongchen co china was applied to analyze the adsorption of sodium oleate to the ags in the anaerobic reactors with 1 0 g l naol the analysis methods about quantification of gene expression and modified gompertz model fitting were described in text s1 s2 and table s2 of supporting information 2 3 the impinging jet experiment the deionized water washed ags was fixed onto glass plates diameter of 6 0 cm with epoxy glue methane bubbles were generated using a capillary tube inner diameter of 3 2 μm with 20 cm s velocity at the capillary outlet under 500 mm nacl solutions with different concentrations of naol all containers and tubing were intensively washed with deionized water before testing the process of bubbles rising to the glass plate was recorded by a high speed camera acuteye ketianjian co china the normalized bubble attachment flux j mm s are obtained based on eqs 1 and 2 detailed calculation is shown in text s3 1 β n t π r s 2 n t δ t π r c 2 u g 2 j d β d t t 0 where β mm 2 is the normalized bubble attachment density nt is the number of attached bubbles rs is the radius of the stagnation region 30 mm rc is the radius of the central circular section which is 100 mm over a given time t s and ug mm s is the rise velocity of the bubbles obtained by image processing 2 4 bubbles coalesce experiment a homemade capillary tube inner diameter of 3 2 μm was placed at the bottom in a column glass vessel 1 3 l methane bubbles radius 20 to 100 μm were generated and released continually in naol solutions the top surface of the trapped bubble was adjusted to approximately 1 cm above the capillary orifice which enabled observation of the complete dynamic process by a high speed camera acuteye ketianjian co china at 25 μm pixel resolution both off center collision and head on collision were considered in the test each probability data point was obtained from more than 100 collisions 2 5 force measurement by bubble probe afm methane bubbles radius 50 μm were generated and immobilized on the glass disk of a petri dish by purging methane through an ultrasharp glass pipet into aqueous solution ags was adhered to a glass disk by epoxy glue the tipless afm cantilever np o10 bruker germany was placed in an electron beam thermal evaporator meb 600 kyky china to coat a film with 5 nm titanium and 30 nm gold then the glass disk and afm cantilever were hydrophobized following an established method feng et al 2020 different concentrations of naol were added to be absorbed at the gas water interface after 5 min force measurements were conducted by afm nanowizard 4 bruker germany the typical force profiles were analyzed by data processing version 6 1 111 jpk 2 6 statistical analysis the statistical differences were analyzed by two tailed t tests the data were considered significant with the following criteria p 0 05 p 0 01 and p 0 001 3 results and discussion 3 1 lcfa cause physical inhibition om anaerobic digestion to investigate the inhibition of lcfa on anaerobic digestion methane production in the ags system with 0 5 10 g l lcfa was first studied fig 1a when the lcfa content was 0 5 1 0 5 0 and 10 0 g l the cumulative methane production after 60 h decreased to 6 31 6 16 4 20 and 0 00 ml compared with 8 26 ml at the control respectively fig 1b in addition when lcfa content increased to 1 0 and 5 0 g l the lag time significantly increased to 15 27 and 14 20 h compared with 13 96 h in the control respectively figs s1a s1b table s3 volatile fatty acids vfas are important intermediate products which could be converted to methane without lcfa the total vfas content decreased from the 12th hour to the 60th hour while that increased with the addition of lcfa fig s1c indicating that lcfa inhibited the conversion of vfas in addition acetic acid accounting for more than 69 0 of the total vfas content fig s1d increased significantly with increasing lcfa content at the 60th hour fig 1c as the main precursor of methane acetic acid conversion was inhibited by lcfa overall these results suggested that lcfa caused the instability of anaerobic digestion through the inhibition of the conversion of vfas especially acetic acid to methane to further explore the inhibition mechanism of lcfa in anaerobic reactors the effect of lcfa on acidogenic bacterium and methanogenic archaeon were investigated fig 1a for m acetivorans c2a methanol substrate degradation ratio significantly decreased from 77 67 to 26 93 33 22 21 17 and 19 68 for lcfa contents of 10 50 100 and 500 mg l respectively with methane production decreasing accordingly fig 1d however the variation in the expression of mcra and mtaa was not significant figs 1e s2 indicating that lcfa did not inhibit the key metabolic pathway of methane production in m acetivorans c2a as an anerobic bacterium e harbinense yuan 3 can catabolize carbohydrates to acetic acids alcohols co2 and h2 fig s3a the addition of lcfa at concentrations from 10 to 500 mg l had no significant effect on metabolism of e harbinense yuan 3 fig s3b d in addition the functional genes hyd a ⅰ and hyd a ii related to hydrogen production also had no significant variation fig s3e these results proved that lcfa may have a physical inhibition on methanogenesis but negligible influence on acetic acids production due to different limitation of nutrient accessibility 3 2 lcfa enhance bubble detachment from ags the foam bubble behaviors in anaerobic reactors were related with bubble ags and bubble bubble interactions fig 2a where inhibiting effects of lcfa were always ignored after the production of biogas the bubbles tend to detach from ags which can contribute to the biogas transport in anaerobic reactors to explore whether lcfa effect the bubble ags interaction lcfa adsorption onto ags surface was studied in the ftir spectrum fig 2b the absorbance of the characteristic peak near 1420 1560 2850 and 2920 cm 1 which belong to naol increased in ags after absorption proving that lcfa absorbed to the ags surface meanwhile significantly increased contact angle showed that ags after lcfa absorption is more hydrophobic than the initial ags fig 2c an impinging jet technique was performed to understand the bubble ags interaction by measuring the bubble attachment flux onto a flat solid surface fig 2d movie s1 simplified solutions have eliminated effect of specific ions and other surface active species as far as possible in fig 2e the mean flux of normalized bubble attachment onto ags decreased from 3 46 μm s to 1 15 1 73 1 98 and 2 45 μm s with lcfa concentrations increased from 0 to 10 50 100 and 500 mg l respectively in fig 2e the minimum bubble attachment flux was gotten at 10 mg l lcfa this may because that the electrical double layer edl force between ags and bubbles get the maximum due to the lcfa adsorption with the increase of lcfa concentration lcfa accumulates on the liquid film surface of bubbles partly forming bilayer and the hydrocarbon chain of outer lcfa decreased edl force these results showed that lcfa enhanced bubble detachment from ags indicating more bubbles rise to the surface of water and aggravate the foaming due to the heterogeneity of ags the bubble probe afm technique was used to semi quantitatively evaluate the adhesion forces between ags and bubbles under the influence of lcfa figs s4 s5a the lcfa significantly influenced the adhesion forces between ags and bubbles figs s5b s5c which may be due to the hydrophobic force edl force and surface roughness of ags wang et al 2020 xie et al 2015 moreover the retraction energy was significantly weakened by increasing the lcfa concentration fig s5d 3 3 lcfa reduce bubble bubble coalescence probability in anaerobic reactors most free bubbles may end its journey upwards at the gas water surface so bubbles collision incident bounce or coalesce are greatly important to the stability of bubbles affecting methane release fig 2a lcfa also induced foam in anaerobic reactors so the foaming tendency was used to evaluate the bubble bubble interaction in the solutions fig 3a in the ags system the foaming tendency increased gradually from 2 00 to 4 00 7 25 7 00 and 13 25 ml foam ml air min when the lcfa increased from 0 0 to 0 5 1 0 5 0 and 10 0 g l respectively fig 3b indicating more bubbles did not rupture and persisted for a long time at air water interface lcfa may reduce the surface tension of the solutions fig 3c contributing to the stable foaming won et al 2014 in addition the bubble coalesce experiment was used to analyze the effect of lcfa on bubbles collision incidents at air water interface fig 2d movie s2 in fig 3d lcfa reduce bubble bubble coalescence probability without lcfa the bubbles merged into a larger one almost immediately 0 4 ms upon collision fig 3e fig 3f movie s2 however bubbles in the 300 mg l lcfa solution bounced away from each other after interacting for a few milliseconds movie s2 initially the freshly released bubble oscillated in bulk and increased in height rapidly to hit the trapped bubble surface upon collision the bubble bounced back slightly a few times during which the kinetic energy was dissipated liu et al 2019 then the bubble rested below the trapped bubble and moved laterally at a slow speed fig 3e fig 3f lcfa significantly reduced the probability of coalescence including both pinch off and rise collisions in reality there is a much higher coalescence probability for off center collisions than for head on collisions fig 3f the relationship between the probability of coalescence and lcfa concentration can be fitted by an inverse cumulative normal distribution fig 3d which was in accordance with the dynamic adsorption of surfactant from the bulk to the air water interface pawliszak et al 2018 3 4 lcfa enhances the adhesion force between bubbles to further investigate the bubble bubble interaction at the single bubble level bubble probe afm was used to measure their forces fig 4a in the lcfa containing solution repulsion was observed when the two bubbles approached and no coalescence occurred even under a maximal load of 1 5 nn fig s6a fig 4b the adhesion force force of pulling the attached bubbles apart suggested that lcfa induced an increasing adhesion force fig 4b from 0 nn to 0 60 0 06 nn for lcfa concentrations of 0 to 500 mg l this result could be confirmed by the broad distribution of forces figs 4c s6b e e g from 0 01 1 64 nn 10 mg l lcfa to 0 04 2 45 nn 100 mg l lcfa moreover the retraction energy showed the same tendency that it was enhanced by the increasing lcfa concentration fig 4d in anaerobic reactors the methanogenic archaea were inhibited physically by lcfa due to limitation of nutrient accessibility then the high aerogenesis activity within cell clusters leads the dissolved co2 ch4 and h2 to supersaturate and to nucleate on the sediment surface into bubbles under appropriate conditions dervaux et al 2015 these bubbles can grow until their buoyancy and suitable turbulence pulls the bubbles away from the surface and rise up to the gas water surface forming foam the bubble bubble and bubble ags interactions are thought to play key roles in the hydrodynamics of anaerobic reactors qiao et al 2021 the main components in solution were rcooh l and rcooh aq under acidic and weakly alkaline conditions which can adsorb on ags surface fig s7 text s4 the sodium oleate acting as a protective shell layer decreased the surface tension gradually within 300 mg l and then reduced the pressure between adjacent bubbles or bubble particle affecting the stability of bubbles with little gas diffusion from the liquid film and slower film drainage in bubbles beneventi et al 2006 for two bubbles approaching each other in an aqueous solution the van der waals vdw interaction and hydrophobic interaction are always attractive while edl repulsion contributes positively to the disjoining pressure qiao et al 2021 the adsorption of negatively charged lcfa generally negatively changed the zeta optional of bubbles and enhanced the edl repulsion creux et al 2009 it could also decrease the hydrophobic interaction which promoted the instability of the liquid film however when the lcfa content is higher than 300 mg l the hydrocarbon chain of oleate ions interacts with each other on the bubble surfaces as part of the surface or the whole surface fills the bilayer hence the adhesion force in 500 mg l lcfa solution was lower than that in 100 mg l lcfa solution at the bounce process polyelectrolytes can lead to a decrease in the viscous dissipation associated with collisions in the related systems vakarelski et al 2019 in addition structural forces and the depletion forces between the surfaces also contributed to the bounce process in the presence of lcfa dervaux et al 2015 browne et al 2015 the development of nanomechanical techniques has enabled the direct quantification of surface interactions of bubbles systems in anaerobic reactors when anaerobic reactors operate in practice bubble size and complex composition of wastewater such as specific ions and surface active species can also affect bubble behaviors cui et al 2020 qiao et al 2021 xing et al 2018 in the future the variety of aqueous interfaces need the implementation and interpretation of experimental measurements 4 conclusions in this study we applied biophysics concepts to elementary environmental process in anaerobic reactors in which lcfa may limit nutrient accessibility of methanogens enhance bubble detachment and reduce bubbles coalescence the impinging jet technique results indicated that lcfa enhanced bubble separation from anaerobic granules and reduced the bubble bubble coalescence probability what s more the bubble probe atomic force microscope revealed that lcfa enhanced the adhesion force between bubbles by enhancing edl repulsion and decreasing hydrophobic interactions given the simplified system we have used further research

15122,the use of surfactants represents a viable strategy to boost the removal yield of dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls from groundwater and to shorten the operational timing of the remediation process surfactants in general help in reducing the interfacial tension at the dnapl water interface and enhance the solubility of the pollutant in the water phase through the formation of dispersed systems such as micelles and emulsions in this paper we show that a suitable choice of a surfactant in this case belonging to the bio degradable class of ethoxylated alcohols allows for the formation of hydrodynamic interfacial instabilities that further enhances the dissolution rate of the organic pollutant into the water phase in a stratified configuration denser organic phase at the bottom and lighter water phase on top the instabilities appear as upward pointing fingers that originate from the inversion of the local density at the interface this inversion stems from the synergetic coupling of two effects promoted by the ethoxylated surfactant i the enhanced co solubility of the dnapl into the water and viceversa and ii the differential diffusion of the dnapl and the surfactant in the aqueous phase by dissolving into the dnapl the surfactant also reduces locally the surface tension at the liquid liquid interface thereby inducing transversal marangoni flows in our work we carefully evaluated the effects of the concentration of different surfactants two different ethoxylated alcohols sodium dodecylsulphate cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide n tetradecyl n n dimethylamine oxide and bis 2 ethylhexyl sulfosuccinate sodium salt on the onset of the instabilities in 3 different dnapls water stratifications namely chloroform trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene with a special emphasis on the trichloroethylene water system by means of a theoretical model and nonlinear simulations supported by surface tension density and diffusivity measurements we could provide a solid explanation to the observed phenomena and we found that the type of the dispersed system the solubility of the dnapl into the water phase the solubility of the surfactant in the organic phase as well as the relative diffusion and density of the surfactant and the dnapl in the aqueous phase are all key parameters for the onset of the instabilities these results can be exploited in the most common remediation techniques graphical abstract keywords dnapl hydrodynamic instabilities surfactant enhanced remediation trichloroethylene surfactant co solvent flushing poly oxyethylene alcohol navier stokes equations data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the remediation of sites polluted by dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls poses several technological and environmental challenges most dnapls are chemically inert and recalcitrant to biological attacks thus in situ transformation or mineralisation is not easily achievable moccia et al 2017 hussain et al 2022 for these reasons the most important remediation strategies rely on the removal of dnapls from the polluted site and their ex situ chemical destruction by means of thermal incineration heterogeneous catalytic mineralisation and advanced redox processes cucciniello et al 2017 intiso et al 2019 ebrahimbabaie and pichtel 2021 hussain et al 2022 however even the removal itself is a demanding task for example due to the scarce solubility of the dnapls in water and their high density the classic pump and treat p t technique is not quite effective to partially overcome the mobility issues of the dnapls p t has been improved by adding surfactants solvents and co solvents to the injected water phase enhanced remediation or co solvent surfactant flushing huo et al 2020 the presence of surfactants in fact lowers the interfacial tension between the dnapls and the aqueous phase and improves the solubility of the organic compounds in water when the concentration of the surfactant is above the critical micellar concentration cmc many amphiphilic molecules have been tested in terms of the molar solubilisation ratio msr and a wide range of alternatives is nowadays available for their employment in remediation processes however the use of surfactants poses new problematics somehow overlooked in the past and related with their partitioning in the organic phase zimmerman et al 1999 such as their potential harmfulness in case of accidental release and the risk of causing a downward mobilisation of dnapls ramsburg and pennell 2002 to mitigate these drawbacks biodegradable surfactants can be harnessed and additional compounds added to the extracting solution thus modulating the density of the dnapls kibbey et al 2002 ramsburg and pennell 2002 yang et al 2022 recently we found that biodegradable ethoxylated alcohols belonging to the synperonic family are effective for increasing the solubility of tce in water intiso et al 2018 garza arévalo et al 2019 and for accelerating the mass transfer during the dissolution processes valletti et al 2021 in this paper we report the effect of two nonionic surface active ethoxylated alcohols synperonic 91 10 and synperonic 91 5 in initially stable stratifications where they are employed in aqueous solutions layered on top of different dnapl chloroform trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene in particular their properties as solubility and density modulators were investigated the presence of the surfactant in the less dense water phase at concentrations above 1 1 0 2 m promoted the onset of hydrodynamic instabilities in the form of upwards plumes that enhance the mixing of the two phases and in particular the dnapl dissolution we conducted our experiments in a hele shaw cell which represents a viable model for porous media saffman and taylor 1958 trevelyan et al 2011 and we compared the results with surfactants belonging to other classes anionic cationic and zwitterionic in our interpretation instabilities stemmed from the inversion of the local density at the interface due to the mutual solubilisation of the dnapl in the upper aqueous phase and the surfactant in the bottom dnapl combined to their differential diffusion in the aqueous phase several model systems have been developed to explore the behaviour of dnapls in subsurface both to understand how the dnapls migrate into the soil or in the groundwater following a spillover and or to characterise the mobilisation of the dnapls during the remediation procedures agaoglu et al 2015 engelmann et al 2019 in general these multiphase flow models aim to predict the mass transfer of dnapls in aqueous solutions as a function of the boundary and environmental conditions porosity temperature etc and the most influential parameters were found to be the flow velocity and the contact time between different phases in the case of remediation applications the lowering of the surface tension and the enhancement of the dnapl solubility due to the presence of surfactants also play a fundamental role most of the experimental models were devised in pseudo 2 dimensional tank reactors where the mass transfer of the dnapls to the water compartments was characterised as a function of the environmental conditions and of the relative flow rate of the liquids luciano et al 2010 2012 2018 liu et al 2014 colombano et al 2021 wang et al 2022 however in this work we did not consider the transversal flow of the water phase at the interface rather we were interested in understanding the spontaneous onset of the instabilities in static conditions therefore we adopted a slightly different modelling approach and we framed the problem in the context of the convective dissolution between partially miscible or immiscible fluids this aspect has been thoroughly investigated due to its relevance for many applied processes ranging from petroleum recovery and co 2 geologic sequestration to materials and pharmaceutical engineering the generation and control of convective flows in such systems is of practical importance because hydrodynamics can sustain a mass transfer from one fluid phase to the other much more intensively than molecular diffusion the theoretical models developed and optimised in this context rely on the general navier stokes equations or related formulation like darcy s equations coupled to fickian diffusion and to chemical terms if any reaction is at play lappa et al 2005 bratsun and de wit 2004 budroni et al 2014 loodts et al 2014 de wit 2016 budroni et al 2017 here we adopted this general framework which supported by experimental measurements of the fluid densities and species diffusivities could provide a solid description and an explanation of the dynamics

spectrophotometer agilent 8453 agilent technologies santa clara ca usa 2 2 monitoring of hydrodynamic instabilities to study the interfacial dynamics between dnapls and surfactant aqueous solutions a quartz cuvette having 1 mm thickness 1 10 50 mm was used as a hele shaw cell in a typical experiment two equal volumes of solutions with different densities were layered in the cell as sketched in fig

dynamics around the interface between the two layers were observed by using the schlieren technique joannes et al 2003 which makes visible changes of the refractive index and gradients of density in otherwise colourless liquids our homemade setup see the scheme illustrated in the supplementary movie did not allow for quantitative measurements of the concentrations however the contrast between areas having different compositions was found qualitatively proportional to the difference of density with darker areas corresponding to denser regions see section 9 and figure s9 in the si images of the interface instabilities have been acquired through a cmos camera imaging source gmbh bremen germany at 1 30 fps collected images were analysed by using the imagej software schneider et al 2012 to understand the role of the intermediate phase m phase which forms across the layer interface by diffusive mixing of the aqueous and organic components before the onset of the instabilities we performed some experiments by stratifying water solutions directly on top of the m phase poured in the hele shaw cell in the place of the pure dnapl m phase was prepared by layering 1 ml of syn 91 10 0 08 m on top of 1 ml of pure tce followed by vigorous stirring for 1 h finally the supernatant m phase was transferred into a vial and used for analysis 2 3 solubility the maximal solubility of pce c s p c e in syn 91 10 solutions was determined through the progressive addition of known amounts of pce to water solutions at a given concentration of surfactant followed by vigorous shaking until a macroscopic phase demixing took place cloudy solutions the last volumetric addition before the demixing process was used to calculate c s p c e more details can be found in intiso et al 2018 garza arévalo et al 2019 where the same technique was employed to measure the maximum solubility of tce c s t c e in syn 91 5 and syn 91 10 aqueous solutions respectively c s t c e for syn 91 10 systems is reported in table 3 by applying the same procedure the maximum solubility of pure syn 91 10 c s s y n 91 10 and syn 91 5 c s s y n 91 5 in the three chlorinated compounds was also assessed see table s7 in the si 2 4 density a thorough characterisation of the tce syn 91 10 system density ρ was conducted for all the concentrations explored in the hele shaw experiments the measurements were carried out at 25 c by using a high precision 5 10 6 g cm 3 anton paar dma 5000 density meter solutions were prepared just before analysis to avoid tce evaporation the density of water and tce solutions of syn 91 10 were analysed in the concentration range 0 01 0 20 m whilst the density of the ternary system water tce syn 91 10 was determined at every c s t c e for each concentration of syn 91 10 see table 3 and si in diluted solutions the density shows a linear relationship with the concentration of a varied species i and the slope of this linear trend i ρ identifies the contribution of that species to the solution density the solutal expansion coefficients i ρ allow us to reconstruct the global density of a multicomponent system through the state equation almarcha et al 2011 lemaigre et al 2013 1 ρ ρ 0 1 1 ρ 0 i i i ρ i th solute ρ 0 being the solvent density the density profiles along the gravitational axis can be used to interpret possible sources of buoyancy driven convection see section 4 and thus i ρ are key parameters for the system modelling i ρ for the main species used in the hele shaw experiments are summarised in tables 1 and 2 2 5 taylor dispersion analysis mutual diffusion coefficients d cm 2 s 1 of syn 91 10 in pure tce and water were measured by using the taylor dispersion technique taylor 1953 alizadeh et al 1980 a hplc apparatus equipped with a refractive index detector infinity 1260 series agilent technologies santa clara ca usa was adapted for the taylor dispersion experiments vanag et al 2008 rossi et al 2010 2011 a 15 m silica glass capillary inner radius r 0 0 016 0 002 cm coiled in a 30 cm diameter helix was used as the dispersion column the capillary was placed in a thermostatted water bath julabo me 16g julabo gmbh seelbach germany between the manual injector rheodyne 7125 idex lake forest il usa and the thermostatted refractive index detector infinity 1260 series agilent technologies santa clara ca usa samples were injected by using a 20 μ l sample loop every 25 min to avoid the overlapping of the peaks being the retention time of the dispersion process 15 min at constant flow 0 1 ml min 1 to determine the diffusivity of syn 91 10 in water d b t aqueous surfactant solutions with a syn 91 10 0 08 m and 0 07 m were injected in an eluent with syn 91 10 0 05 m to measure the diffusivity of syn 91 10 in tce d b b solutions of the surfactant at different concentrations 1 10 3 m syn 91 10 0 1 m were prepared in pure tce the eluent was pure tce the distribution of concentration was monitored by a refractive index detector rid agilent g1362 a and data were stored in a pc for analysis for 2 component systems the mutual coefficient d can be determined by fitting rid experimental signals with the following equation callendar and leaist 2006 valletti et al 2022 2 s t s 0 s 1 t s m a x t r t e x p 12 d t t r 2 r 0 2 t where s t r i u units is the experimental refractive index signal s 0 r i u units and s 1 r i u units are the intercept and the slope of the linear baseline respectively s m a x r i u units is the peak height t r s is the retention time r 0 cm is the inner capillary radius and t s is the time multiple experimental peaks were simultaneously fitted using levenberg marquardt algorithm marquardt 1963 levenberg 1944 to eq 2 the measurements of the surfactant diffusivity in water and in the organic phase tce are further described and reported in the si 2 6 interfacial tension the interfacial tension analysis was carried out using the pendant drop method oca 15 plus by dataphysics the aqueous solutions of the surfactants were analysed in a concentration range of 0 0001 0 0250 m for synperonic 91 10 the measurements were carried out by producing a drop of chloroform as an example of dnapl in a syn 91 10 solution and getting measurements until equilibrium at 25 c using a 0 51 mm diameter capillary 2 7 model we consider a two dimensional two phase system of length l x and height l z in a x z reference frame where the z axis is oriented vertically against the gravitational acceleration g 0 g the system is supposed to be in isothermal conditions the denser organic layer with the pure dnapl tce a is in the bottom b while the less dense aqueous phase containing the surfactant syn 91 10 b is stratified on top t as sketched in fig 2 b and specified by the initial spatial distribution of the species concentrations a b a p 0 for z z 0 l z 2 x a b 0 b 0 for z z 0 x a b a 0 0 for z z 0 x a b a p b 0 for z z 0 x 3 i e just below the interface a p is the concentration of the pure tce and a 0 represents the saturation concentration of tce in an aqueous layer containing the surfactant with concentration b 0 from table 3 the empirical relation a 0 b 0 3 can be inferred in our model we keep a 0 constant at the interface between the two phases to mimic the constant amount of tce coming from the solubilisation of the pure bottom phase which under the hypothesis of local equilibrium rapidly attains the saturation value loodts et al 2014 budroni et al 2014 2017 similarly as the surfactant is highly soluble in tce we assume that the organic phase acts as a sink for the surfactant whose concentrations go locally to zero at z z 0 and to b 0 in the organic layer just below the interface at z z 0 see fig 2 c as the upward drifting of the interface is negligible within the hydrodynamic time scale and the surface tension along the contact line between the two layers is assumed to be high enough to render negligible any deformation of the interface and the layer frames are kept fixed the dynamics around the interface was investigated numerically by solving the sets of dimensionless diffusion convection dc equations which describe the two coupled phases bratsun and de wit 2004 lemaigre et al 2013 budroni et al 2014 2021 top layer 4 t a t z ψ t x a t x ψ t z a t 2 a t 5 t b t z ψ t x b t x ψ t z b t δ b t 2 b t 6 t ω t z ψ t x ω t x ψ t z ω t 7 s c t 2 ω t i a b r i t x i t

chemical species a and b scaled by the saturation concentration of tce in the surfactant aqueous solution a 0 the evolution of the chemical fields described by eq 4 5 and 8 are coupled to fickian diffusion and to incompressible navier stokes eqs 6 7 and 9 10 written in the stream function vorticity ψ ω form according to the boussinesq approximation the vorticity and the stream function describe the hydrodynamics of the system being related to the velocity field v u v via ω v and u z ψ and v x ψ respectively no flux boundary conditions and no slip conditions are used for the chemical concentrations and the stream function at the rigid boundaries of the reactor respectively at the interface between the two phases i e z z 0 we consider 11 a t a a 0 1 12 b t 0 13 ψ t ψ b 0 b b z 0 b t z 0 and the marangoni boundary condition η ω t ω b i a b m i x i s b where i s are the concentrations of the chemical species a and b at z z 0 and η μ t μ b with μ t and μ b representing the dynamic viscosity of the aqueous and organic phases respectively this condition couples the hydrodynamics between the two phases and along with the gravitational force terms i a b r i t x i t and r b t x b b relates the evolution of the chemical fields to the vorticity and the stream function key parameters to control the onset of convective instabilities and related impact in the dissolution dynamics are the solutal rayleigh numbers of the i th species defined as 14 r i t i ρ t a 0 g l 0 3 d a μ t i a b in the top layer and 15 r i b i ρ b a 0 g l 0 3 d a μ b i a b in the bottom phase these parameters weight the specific contribution of each species concentration to the local dimensionless densities ρ t i a b r i t i and ρ b r b b b the rayleigh numbers control the onset and entity of buoyancy driven convection in response to chemical concentration gradients since in the bottom phase we have tce as a pure liquid the rayleigh number for this species can be only defined in the top phase and the dc equation for a is only considered for that layer l 0 is the characteristic spatial scale of the system here corresponding to the width of the hele shaw cell used in the experiments l 0 1 cm the coefficients i ρ t and i ρ b measure the density change due to small variations in the concentration of the i th species in the top and the bottom layer respectively d a is the diffusion coefficient of tce in the upper phase and can be used to define the time scale of the system t 0 l 0 2 d a δ b t d b t d a and δ b b d b b d a are the dimensionless relative diffusivities of the surfactant in the top and bottom layers respectively another important parameter is the solutal marangoni number 16 m i a 0 l 0 μ b d a i γ which quantifies the specific contribution of the i th species to the dimensionless surface tension γ i a b m i i s and controls the entity of transversal flows at the partially miscible interface due to the transfer of chemical species from one phase to the other in our simulations we assume that the surfactant plays the main role in surface tension changes i e we considered m a 0 and m b 0 as b is supposed to decrease the surface tension we also run check simulations by applying no slip boundary conditions to the vorticity and ψ function at the interface in order to have a reference case where surface tension stresses are not at play and evaluate their actual weight in the global dynamics the coupled systems of dc eqs 4 7 and 8 10 are solved numerically by using the alternating direction implicit method adi peaceman and rachford 1955 over the spatial domain of length l x 30 l 0 and height l z 2 l x i e aspect ratio 2 by using a space meshing h x h z 0 1 and the integration time step h t 1 1 0 4 the numerical algorithm is particularly stable for 2 dimensional problems and squared meshings it consists of solving explicitly the derivatives along one spatial dimension for instance along the x axis and implicitly in the second one z the direction along which the implicit and the explicit descriptions are employed is alternated during each successive iteration which corresponds to one half time step at any given iteration the unknowns of each single equation are the implicitly calculated variables solved as a function of the explicitly calculated terms to solve the hydrodynamic field an iterative procedure checks the convergence of ω and ψ over the entire spatial domain requiring the error between the stream function at the n 1 th and n th iterations to be lower than 1 1 0 5 3 results to mimic a stratification of an aqueous solution over a denser organic solvent in a porous medium we employed a vertical hele shaw cell arranged as in fig 2a in a series of experiments the dnapl was poured at the bottom of the cell and a less dense water solution containing an increasing amount of surfactant was gently poured on top of it in general the presence of the surfactant at a concentration larger than the cmc increases the solubility of the dnapl in the upper aqueous layer table 3 and table s6 in the si and at the same time decreases the interfacial tension table s8 and figure s11 in the si for the sake of simplicity in this section we will focus on the system tce syn 91 10 but similar results though for a slightly different interval of concentrations were obtained for the system tce syn 91 5 given the low reciprocal solubility of the two liquids and the surface tension between the two liquids this density stratification is expected to be statically stable in the gravity field in fact up to a threshold concentration of syn 91 10 1 1 0 2 m the interface remained unperturbed and the mass transfer of the tce to the aqueous layer took place by diffusion only interestingly in experiments where the concentration of syn 91 10 was higher than 1 1 0 2 m ascending plumes of tce developed despite the fact that the initial density of the top layer was lower than that of the bottom one these scenarios are illustrated in fig 3 which shows the experimental schlieren images of systems where syn 91 10 aqueous solutions at different concentrations are layered on top of pure tce in the case of syn 91 10 1 1 0 3 m bottom panels in fig 3 the interface remained stable for the entire course of the experiment and the appearance of some blurred dark areas above and below the interface could be noticed the schlieren technique allows to enhance the contrast of transparent fluids according to their refractive index and hence density therefore the darkening of the liquids around the interface tracks the displacement of the chemical species across the contact line between the two phases with a consequent change of the local density the timescale characterising the thickening of the interface an average displacement of 2 mm in 3000 s can be measured from the bottom panels of fig 3 allows to ascribe to fickian diffusion the mixing in these experimental conditions t d 2 2 d where d is the mean square displacement and d is the diffusion coefficient which for small molecules in liquids is generally of the order of 10 6 10 5 cm 2 s when the concentration of syn 91 10 in the water phase was larger than 1 1 0 2 m hydrodynamic instabilities appeared just below and above the liquid liquid interface after a few minutes from the beginning of the experiment the top and the central panels of fig 3 show the formation of tce plumes developing in the less dense water phase and displacing at a constant speed as typically happens in fingering instabilities lemaigre et al 2013 budroni et al 2017 plumes grew linearly in time and the related displacement speed v m could be calculated from experimental space time st plots according to the procedure reported in section 10 of the si the averaged value of v m for each system has been reported in fig 4 a and in table s1 of the si as a function of syn 91 10 interestingly v m also showed a linear dependence on the concentration of the surfactant in the water phase v m m syn 91 10 q m 0 15 0 01 mm m 1 s 1 q 9 47 0 9 1 0 3 mm s 1 and r 2 0 97608 by comparing the speed at which fingers grew from the organic into the aqueous phase the mixing rate resulted from 10 to 40 times depending on syn 91 10 faster than that due to the fickian diffusion average displacement of tce molecules 8 1 0 4 mm s in general plumes and fingering instabilities around an initially stable stratified liquid liquid interface are due to an inversion of the local density almarcha et al 2011 trevelian et al 2011 budroni et al 2014 and we will discuss the mechanism in more details in the next section it has to be noted that in the tce syn 91 10 system the development of the plumes was accompanied by periodic pulsations which took place just below the interface and originated from a marangoni type instability sustained by surfactant induced gradients in the surface tension fig 4b and the supplementary movie shows the development of a pulsation in a tce syn 91 10 system where syn 91 10 0 08 m the pulse nucleated from the sides of the hele shaw cell and developed horizontally towards the centre similar dynamics have been observed at the interface of partially miscible stratifications of alkyl formates layered on top of aqueous solutions budroni et al 2014 2017 the dark colour was certainly due to the surfactant and possibly some water which was partitioned in the dnapl phase marangoni pulses showed a quite regular dynamics with a characteristic period of 500 s as shown in the time series reported in fig 4c the synergy between the plumes and the marangoni pulses transiently favoured the mixing of the two phases resulting in an enhanced dissolution of the dnapl in the aqueous layer in all the systems where instabilities occurred the formation of a new surfactant rich middle phase m phase at the contact zone between the water and the dnapl was observed just before the appearance of the instabilities dark interfacial area at t 1000 s in the top and middle panels of fig 3 the m phase appeared milky and with a high turbidity and it was characterised as a thermodynamically unstable macroemulsion winsor type iii system kang et al 2019 lagzi 2015 the m phase and its role in the onset of the instability have been extensively discussed in the section s7 of the si the convective stability of aqueous surfactant solutions stratified on top of a dnapl was further investigated by changing the organic liquid when chloroform was employed hydrodynamic patterns similar to the tce case were obtained by contrast statically stable stratifications were found for pce at all the concentrations of surfactant monitored see figure s4 in the si finally the presence of plumes and fingers was further explored for other classes of surfactants we tested the anionic sds and aot the cationic ctab and the zwitterionic c14dmao all of them or very similar molecules were reported to enhance the solubility of dnapls in water solutions harendra and vipulanandan 2011 acosta and quraishi 2014 mao et al 2015 the experimental setup was kept fixed and we used tce as the organic phase instabilities with a low intensity were detected only when the water phase contained aot 0 03 m see figure s5 in the si for the rest of the surfactants no clear instabilities could be observed interestingly the formation of an m phase was found also in the tce aot system though it was found denser and less persistent with respect to the m phase generated by the exthoxylated surfactants 4 discussion 4 1 interpretation of the hydrodynamic instability the onset of the fingering instability stems from the inversion of the local density just above the interface between the two layers according to the chemico physical parameters measured for the species at play see details in the si section s2 for density section s3 for diffusivity and section s4 for solubility we envisaged the following mechanism see also the supplementary movie first plumes were always located in the top layer and must be originated from a local density depletion just above the contact line between the two phases in principle this could be provided by the downward migration of the surfactant into the bottom organic layer where it is highly soluble either in the form of micellar aggregates or in the form of monomers the chemical structure of ethoxylated alcohols is in fact known to favour the partition of the surfactant in the dnapl phase zhu and free 2015 as a function of the number of ethylene oxide eo units zimmerman et al 1999 both syn 91 10 and syn 91 5 were found to be largely soluble in tce at 25 c and miscible in all proportions with it the affinity of syn 91 10 for tce was also confirmed by measuring the diffusivity of the surfactant in water and in the organic phase d b t in the aqueous phase was 1 03 10 6 cm 2 s 1 and d b b in tce was 1 30 10 5 cm 2 s 1 as determined by the taylor dispersion technique see section 2 5 and section s3 in the si the organic phase acted thus as a sink for the surfactant see the red profile in fig 2c but the related density depletion was largely compensated by the counter dissolution of tce in fact though ρ t tce ρ t syn 91 10 see tables 1 2 and section 2 of the si tce provided a larger contribution to the density according to eq 1 because its aqueous concentration was higher than that of the surfactant about 3 times and this determined a stable downward increasing density profile of the type shown in the left panel of fig 5 however the local drop of the surfactant concentration at the interface created a concentration gradient which broke de facto the initial convective stability by starting a differential diffusive interplay in the aqueous layer between the fast upwardly diffusing tce d a 8 16 1 0 6 cm 2 s 1 rossi et al 2015 and the slow downward diffusing surfactant d b t 1 03 10 6 cm 2 s 1 in time this developed a non monotonic density profile with a local density minimum as shown in the right panel of fig 5 sustained by a delayed double diffusive mechanism trevelian et al 2011 furthermore the concurrent transfer of tce and surfactant between the two phases modified the interfacial tension between the two liquids and caused transversal marangoni stresses sternling and scriven 1959 bratsun and de wit 2004 as manifested by the periodic pulsations at the interface the dissolution of the syn 91 10 did not create any buoyancy driven instabilities in the lower organic layer because it was characterised by a negative contribution to the density ρ b syn 91 10 0 15 g cm 3 m 1 our interpretation based on the solubility of the surfactant and on the dnapl surfactant differential diffusion can explain the different behaviours observed when other surfactants sds aot ctab and c14dmao replaced the ethoxylated alcohols in the aqueous layer and when other dnapls cf and pce replaced the tce in the case of alternative surfactants instabilities were observed for aot only this was due to the fact that aot has a similar phase behaviour of syn 91 10 and syn 91 5 i e high solubility in the organic phase and it is able to form microemulsion without the need of a co surfactant broze and zoller 1999 mao et al 2015 moreover the other surfactants have a lower molecular weight than syn 91 10 and syn 91 5 see table 1 which is reflected into a higher diffusivity in water that suppressed the differential diffusion mechanism concerning the experiments with alternative dnapls instabilities were found only for cf which in contrast to pce has physico chemical characteristics similar to those of tce density and miscibility with surfactants pce is in fact much denser and by far less miscible both in water and in surfactant solutions than tce see table 2 and table s6 in the si for the saturation concentration of pce c s p c e we finally note that a fingering instability in analogous systems could also be activated without differential diffusion if the contribution to the density of the dnapl in the aqueous phase ρ t dnapl would be much lower than that of the surfactant at hands then a density minimum would simply develop due to the surfactant solubilisation into the underlying organic layer 4 2 nonlinear simulations to support the mechanism proposed for the onset of hydrodynamic instabilities we run numerical simulations by feeding the theoretical model described in section 2 7 with the experimental chemico physical parameters measured in the experiments we set s c t 10000 which is compatible with the water kinematic viscosity ν t μ t ρ 0 0 0089 cm2 s 1 and with the aqueous diffusivity of tce while s c b was fixed to 5000 as ν b 0 5 ν t as mentioned above the coefficients i ρ of tce and syn 91 10 in the aqueous phase extrapolated as described in section 2 4 presented analogous values ρ t tce ρ t syn 91 10 0 0365 g cm 3 m 1 such that we could assume r a t r b t realistic rayleigh numbers given a 0 0 3 m l 0 1 cm and d a 8 16 1 0 6 cm 2 s 1 g 9 8 cm s 2 have an order of magnitude 1 0 6 which is consistent with the appearance of short wavelength convective fingering in the narrow spatial domain used in the experiments 1 cm 2 cm corresponding to 1 2 model space units l 0 however to avoid numerical divergence simulations with such high values would require an extremely refined spatio temporal solving grid and a sensitive reduction of the error tolerance for the stream function computation see section 2 7 which is critically demanding from the computational viewpoint we thus considered a spatial domain of 30 60 l 0 which without loss of generality allowed reproducing convective patterns similar to those of the experiments and to give a qualitatively consistent description of these phenomena even using lower values of the rayleigh numbers after a preliminary exploration we fixed r a t r b t 100 and since in tce ρ b syn 91 10 0 15 g cm 3 m 1 and μ b 0 5 μ t we set r b b 1000 10 r b t the measured values for d a d b t and d b b see tables 1 and 2 and section 3 in the si were used to define the dimensionless relative diffusivities of the surfactant in the top layer δ b t 0 12 and in the bottom layer δ b b 1 51 we finally varied m b 0 50000 to check the relative importance of surface effects in the convective dissolution of tce in fig 6 see also the supplementary movie we illustrate a typical spatio temporal evolution of the dissolution driven convective instability obtained with the parameter set r a t r b t 100 r b b 10 r b t 1000 m b 50000 the snapshots show the vorticity in the top phase and just below the interface at different times after an initial diffusive transient plumes nucleated and grew upwardly above the interface similarly to the experiments the plumes underwent some lateral merging promoted by marangoni flows below z 0 the transfer of surfactant between the two phases in fact generated surface tension driven instabilities in the form of transversal pulses at the interface which distorted the plumes in the top layer and could eventually homogenise them successively plumes formed and rised again affected by surface tension driven stresses in particular they formed at the lateral border of the spatial domain where horizontal short pulses and drifting plumes were observed these dynamics cannot be observed if we run simulations with δ b t 0 35 i e suppressing differential diffusion an overview of the global dynamics could be captured by using the st plots see section 10 of the si obtained by stacking as a function of the time the transversal profile of the vorticity just above and below the interface white dashed lines in the first snapshot of the top panels of fig 6 these plots shown in bottom panels of fig 6 represent the dynamics for 300 time units thus dimension l x 300 t 0 and show the main features of the convective instability plumes started at t 63 time units accompanied by marangoni driven horizontal pulses the latter flows may disrupt the growth of the plumes and start pulsations towards the lateral borders of the spatial domain as described by local zig zag patterns along the borders the dynamics below the interface was characterised by periodic pulsations consistent with the experimental observations st plots allow a direct comparison of the characteristic wavelength and onset time of the instability for different control parameters of the system as reported in section 8 of the si to make a direct comparison with the experiments we characterised in fig 7 the speed of the fingering growth as a function of a 0 which is related to the surfactant concentration b 0 as a 0 b 0 3 a 0 also controls both the rayleigh and the marangoni numbers see definitions 14 15 16 and the impact of the initial surfactant concentration explored in the experiments could thus be reproduced numerically by changing proportionally r i t r b b and m b the system specified by the parameter set r a t r b t 100 r b b 10 r b t 1000 m b 50000 was associated to a relative reference value a 0 a 0 r e f and compared with dissolution driven convective dynamics obtained with decreasing fractions of these reference values st plots built by following the development of the fastest plumes along the vertical axis see the vertical dashed red line in the second snapshot of fig 6 showed that the plumes grew linearly in time with a speed v m that relates linearly with a 0 and in turn with the surfactant concentration b 0 see fig 7a this compares favourably with experimental analysis cfr fig 4a to analyse the impact of the different contributions to convective flows in the dissolution of a we also computed the mean flux j through z z 0 averaged over the horizontal dimension x jotkar et al 2019 17 j 1 l x x 0 l x a z z z 0 d x and we considered how this quantity varied as a function of the time for different values of a 0 in particular in fig 7b we report the temporal profile of δ j t i e the difference between the flux obtained in systems with convection j t and the diffusive reference flux j diff t in all cases there was an initial spike due to the onset of convective instabilities followed by a decline to a rather constant flux around 0 008 0 002 over which all curves converged and fluctuated a faster and stronger divergence from the purely diffusive dynamics was obtained for a 0 a 0 r e f and progressively smooth down when decreasing a 0 to disentangle the role of the main contributions to the flow i e buoyancy vs marangoni driven flows we characterised the instabilities developing with different values of m b 0 500000 with fixed r a i t 100 r a b b 10 r a i t i a b and in the absence of surface stresses at the contact line between the two phases the results reported in section 8 of the si show that while the density driven fingering always enhanced the dissolution process marangoni driven flows due to their orthogonal orientation with respect to the dissolution direction may play either a positive neutral or even unfavourable role with respect to the dissolution process indeed marangoni pulses favoured an initial enhancement of the flux but this was followed by a drop due to the homogenising effect of these transverse flows which suppressed the buoyancy driven plumes the successive formation of new convective plumes reinforced the dissolution flux again in general the most unstable systems from a convective viewpoint which can be achieved by augmenting a 0 may not necessarily enhance the dissolution process as a 0 increases all the contributions to the flow unconditionally including transversal flows this information turns useful to orient the choice and the concentration of the surfactant to be employed similar conclusions were drawn in previous studies on convective dissolution in binary systems with partially miscible components lappa et al 2005 5 conclusion in this paper we reported about hydrodynamic instabilities taking place at the interface of an initially stable stratification of a water solution on top of a denser pure dnapl phase in the case of pure water given the reciprocal low solubility of the two liquids the stratification was stable over time and the mixing between the two phases took place by molecular diffusion until the saturation concentrations were attained this resemble the typical situation happening when a spill of a dnapl from the surface penetrates into the soil until it stratifies below groundwaters to form a permanent source of pollution however further investigations in a vertical hele shaw cell revealed that the presence of suitable surfactants promoted an inversion of the local densities thus allowing for a faster mixing between the two phases in particular surfactants induced a massive transport of the dnapl in the aqueous solution in the form of upward plumes and fingers the surfactant had three main roles i it promoted the solubilisation of the dnapl by forming micelles and microemulsion ii it lowered the surface tension between the two phases to promote marangoni effects and iii it favoured the inversion of the local density at the interface the onset of the hydrodynamic instabilities was initiated by the fast diffusion and the high solubility of the surfactant in the organic phase which combined to a double diffusion mechanism between the surfactant itself and the fast diffusive tce decreased the density of the top aqueous layer in the proximity of the interface at the same time the changes of the surface tension induced periodic marangoni pulsations in the dnapl phase which interacted with the density driven advective motion we thoroughly characterised the chemico physical properties of the investigated systems solubility density diffusivity etc and we employed these parameters to feed a realistic theoretical model based on the navier stokes equations the integration of the nonlinear model reproduced well the dynamical behaviour of the experiments in addition the use of the measured parameters allowed for a semi quantitative interpretation of the chemistry and physics at play in the explored systems the model was also employed to decouple and study parametrically the relative influence of the main contributions to the flow buoyancy vs marangoni driven convection through the characteristic numbers r i and m i directly linked to the experimental conditions surfactant concentration density of the dnapl etc to sum up the proposed model catched all the essential features of the experimental systems and suggested criteria to optimise the interplay between buoyancy and marangoni driven flows to enhance the dnapl dissolution process the model can be further refined to obtain more quantitative results by considering the complex nature of the microemulsion systems and by including cross diffusion phenomena leaist and hao 1995 vanag et al 2008 budroni et al 2015a b budroni 2015 the experimental model system we devised represents a proof of concept to demonstrate that the choice of a proper surfactant could help in designing more effective remediation strategies based on the co solvent surfactant flushing technology given the limitations of our lab scale setup it is difficult to give reliable values for the removal efficiency for in field applications however we obtained an estimation of the dnapl transfer rate to the water phase by measuring the lowering of the liquid liquid interface over time in the tce syn 91 10 system the analysis of the experimental frames yielded for example a velocity of transfer of 1 2 10 4 mm s 1 when syn 91 10 0 2 m a value in line with that found for the mass transfer coefficient determined for spherical tce droplets in surfactant solutions valletti et al 2021 by considering a flat interface the calculated transfer velocity would allow a theoretical removal rate of 10 5 l d 1 of dnapl in the case of a contact area of 1 m 2 if we take the tce saturation concentration c s t c e 0 64 m at syn 91 10 0 2 m table 3 we can roughly estimate a volume 1 8 104 l d 1 of the aqueous surfactant solution employed to have a comparison brown et al 1999 described a 3 day remediation process of a dnapl contaminated aquifer where 5000 l of a dnapl were removed by employing 1 5 109 l of an aqueous solution with sds 0 26 m and isopropanol 0 74 m in another study jawitz and coworkers jawitz et al 2000 reported a remediation case study where 40 l of pce were removed in 3 days by using 80000 l of 95 ethanol in this study we did not consider the effect of a water flow at the interface that would be present in real field applications for the delivery of the surfactant solution to the remediation spot however based on our results we can say that the flow rate of remediating solutions injected in flushing processes should be modulated to make the contact time between the aqueous and the dnapl phases long enough to allow the onset of the fingering instabilities thus the hydraulic residence time of the injected solution should be larger than the mixing time triggered by the hydrodynamic flows in kinetic terms the reciprocal of the residence time has to be of the order of 3 5 h 1 in conclusion our results indicate that hydrodynamic instabilities can be successfully exploited by selecting a suitable hydraulic residence time to improve the removal rate of dnapls from aquifers and groundwater with a possible savings of additional compounds surfactant and or co surfactants declaration of competing interest the authors declare

15122,the use of surfactants represents a viable strategy to boost the removal yield of dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls from groundwater and to shorten the operational timing of the remediation process surfactants in general help in reducing the interfacial tension at the dnapl water interface and enhance the solubility of the pollutant in the water phase through the formation of dispersed systems such as micelles and emulsions in this paper we show that a suitable choice of a surfactant in this case belonging to the bio degradable class of ethoxylated alcohols allows for the formation of hydrodynamic interfacial instabilities that further enhances the dissolution rate of the organic pollutant into the water phase in a stratified configuration denser organic phase at the bottom and lighter water phase on top the instabilities appear as upward pointing fingers that originate from the inversion of the local density at the interface this inversion stems from the synergetic coupling of two effects promoted by the ethoxylated surfactant i the enhanced co solubility of the dnapl into the water and viceversa and ii the differential diffusion of the dnapl and the surfactant in the aqueous phase by dissolving into the dnapl the surfactant also reduces locally the surface tension at the liquid liquid interface thereby inducing transversal marangoni flows in our work we carefully evaluated the effects of the concentration of different surfactants two different ethoxylated alcohols sodium dodecylsulphate cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide n tetradecyl n n dimethylamine oxide and bis 2 ethylhexyl sulfosuccinate sodium salt on the onset of the instabilities in 3 different dnapls water stratifications namely chloroform trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene with a special emphasis on the trichloroethylene water system by means of a theoretical model and nonlinear simulations supported by surface tension density and diffusivity measurements we could provide a solid explanation to the observed phenomena and we found that the type of the dispersed system the solubility of the dnapl into the water phase the solubility of the surfactant in the organic phase as well as the relative diffusion and density of the surfactant and the dnapl in the aqueous phase are all key parameters for the onset of the instabilities these results can be exploited in the most common remediation techniques graphical abstract keywords dnapl hydrodynamic instabilities surfactant enhanced remediation trichloroethylene surfactant co solvent flushing poly oxyethylene alcohol navier stokes equations data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the remediation of sites polluted by dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls poses several technological and environmental challenges most dnapls are chemically inert and recalcitrant to biological attacks thus in situ transformation or mineralisation is not easily achievable moccia et al 2017 hussain et al 2022 for these reasons the most important remediation strategies rely on the removal of dnapls from the polluted site and their ex situ chemical destruction by means of thermal incineration heterogeneous catalytic mineralisation and advanced redox processes cucciniello et al 2017 intiso et al 2019 ebrahimbabaie and pichtel 2021 hussain et al 2022 however even the removal itself is a demanding task for example due to the scarce solubility of the dnapls in water and their high density the classic pump and treat p t technique is not quite effective to partially overcome the mobility issues of the dnapls p t has been improved by adding surfactants solvents and co solvents to the injected water phase enhanced remediation or co solvent surfactant flushing huo et al 2020 the presence of surfactants in fact lowers the interfacial tension between the dnapls and the aqueous phase and improves the solubility of the organic compounds in water when the concentration of the surfactant is above the critical micellar concentration cmc many amphiphilic molecules have been tested in terms of the molar solubilisation ratio msr and a wide range of alternatives is nowadays available for their employment in remediation processes however the use of surfactants poses new problematics somehow overlooked in the past and related with their partitioning in the organic phase zimmerman et al 1999 such as their potential harmfulness in case of accidental release and the risk of causing a downward mobilisation of dnapls ramsburg and pennell 2002 to mitigate these drawbacks biodegradable surfactants can be harnessed and additional compounds added to the extracting solution thus modulating the density of the dnapls kibbey et al 2002 ramsburg and pennell 2002 yang et al 2022 recently we found that biodegradable ethoxylated alcohols belonging to the synperonic family are effective for increasing the solubility of tce in water intiso et al 2018 garza arévalo et al 2019 and for accelerating the mass transfer during the dissolution processes valletti et al 2021 in this paper we report the effect of two nonionic surface active ethoxylated alcohols synperonic 91 10 and synperonic 91 5 in initially stable stratifications where they are employed in aqueous solutions layered on top of different dnapl chloroform trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene in particular their properties as solubility and density modulators were investigated the presence of the surfactant in the less dense water phase at concentrations above 1 1 0 2 m promoted the onset of hydrodynamic instabilities in the form of upwards plumes that enhance the mixing of the two phases and in particular the dnapl dissolution we conducted our experiments in a hele shaw cell which represents a viable model for porous media saffman and taylor 1958 trevelyan et al 2011 and we compared the results with surfactants belonging to other classes anionic cationic and zwitterionic in our interpretation instabilities stemmed from the inversion of the local density at the interface due to the mutual solubilisation of the dnapl in the upper aqueous phase and the surfactant in the bottom dnapl combined to their differential diffusion in the aqueous phase several model systems have been developed to explore the behaviour of dnapls in subsurface both to understand how the dnapls migrate into the soil or in the groundwater following a spillover and or to characterise the mobilisation of the dnapls during the remediation procedures agaoglu et al 2015 engelmann et al 2019 in general these multiphase flow models aim to predict the mass transfer of dnapls in aqueous solutions as a function of the boundary and environmental conditions porosity temperature etc and the most influential parameters were found to be the flow velocity and the contact time between different phases in the case of remediation applications the lowering of the surface tension and the enhancement of the dnapl solubility due to the presence of surfactants also play a fundamental role most of the experimental models were devised in pseudo 2 dimensional tank reactors where the mass transfer of the dnapls to the water compartments was characterised as a function of the environmental conditions and of the relative flow rate of the liquids luciano et al 2010 2012 2018 liu et al 2014 colombano et al 2021 wang et al 2022 however in this work we did not consider the transversal flow of the water phase at the interface rather we were interested in understanding the spontaneous onset of the instabilities in static conditions therefore we adopted a slightly different modelling approach and we framed the problem in the context of the convective dissolution between partially miscible or immiscible fluids this aspect has been thoroughly investigated due to its relevance for many applied processes ranging from petroleum recovery and co 2 geologic sequestration to materials and pharmaceutical engineering the generation and control of convective flows in such systems is of practical importance because hydrodynamics can sustain a mass transfer from one fluid phase to the other much more intensively than molecular diffusion the theoretical models developed and optimised in this context rely on the general navier stokes equations or related formulation like darcy s equations coupled to fickian diffusion and to chemical terms if any reaction is at play lappa et al 2005 bratsun and de wit 2004 budroni et al 2014 loodts et al 2014 de wit 2016 budroni et al 2017 here we adopted this general framework which supported by experimental measurements of the fluid densities and species diffusivities could provide a solid description and an explanation of the dynamics

spectrophotometer agilent 8453 agilent technologies santa clara ca usa 2 2 monitoring of hydrodynamic instabilities to study the interfacial dynamics between dnapls and surfactant aqueous solutions a quartz cuvette having 1 mm thickness 1 10 50 mm was used as a hele shaw cell in a typical experiment two equal volumes of solutions with different densities were layered in the cell as sketched in fig 2 the bottom one consists of the denser organic phase and the top one contains pure water or surfactant aqueous solutions all experiments were carried out at room temperature 25 c the spatiotemporal dynamics around the interface between the two layers were observed by using the schlieren technique joannes et al 2003 which makes visible changes of the refractive index and gradients of density in otherwise colourless liquids our homemade setup see the scheme illustrated in the supplementary movie did not allow for quantitative measurements of the concentrations however the contrast between areas having different compositions was found qualitatively proportional to the difference of density with darker areas corresponding to denser regions see section 9 and figure s9 in the si images of the interface instabilities have been acquired through a cmos camera imaging source gmbh bremen germany at 1 30 fps collected images were analysed by using the imagej software schneider et al 2012 to understand the role of the intermediate phase m phase which forms across the layer interface by diffusive mixing of the aqueous and organic components before the onset of the instabilities we performed some experiments by stratifying water solutions directly on top of the m phase poured in the hele shaw cell in the place of the pure dnapl m phase was prepared by layering 1 ml of syn 91 10 0 08 m on top of 1 ml of pure tce followed by vigorous stirring for 1 h finally the supernatant m phase was transferred into a vial and used for analysis 2 3 solubility the maximal solubility of pce c s p c e in syn 91 10 solutions was determined through the progressive addition of known amounts of pce to water solutions at a given concentration of surfactant followed by vigorous shaking until a macroscopic phase demixing took place cloudy solutions the last volumetric addition before the demixing process was used to calculate c s p c e more details can be found in intiso et al 2018 garza arévalo et al 2019 where the same technique was employed to measure the maximum solubility of tce c s t c e in syn 91 5 and syn 91 10 aqueous solutions respectively c s t c e for syn 91 10 systems is reported in table 3 by applying the same procedure the maximum solubility of pure syn 91 10 c s s y n 91 10 and syn 91 5 c s s y n 91 5 in the three chlorinated compounds was also assessed see table s7 in the si 2 4 density a thorough characterisation of the tce syn 91 10 system density ρ was conducted for all the concentrations explored in the hele shaw experiments the measurements were carried out at 25 c by using a high precision 5 10 6 g cm 3 anton paar dma 5000 density meter solutions were prepared just before analysis to avoid tce evaporation the density of water and tce solutions of syn 91 10 were analysed in the concentration range 0 01 0 20 m whilst the density of the ternary system water tce syn 91 10 was determined at every c s t c e for each concentration of syn 91 10 see table 3 and si in diluted solutions the density shows a linear relationship with the concentration of a varied species i and the slope of this linear trend i ρ identifies the contribution of that species to the solution density the solutal expansion coefficients i ρ allow us to reconstruct the global density of a multicomponent system through the state equation almarcha et al 2011 lemaigre et al 2013 1 ρ ρ 0 1 1 ρ 0 i i i ρ i th solute ρ 0 being the solvent density the density profiles along the gravitational axis can be used to interpret possible sources of buoyancy driven convection see section 4 and thus i ρ are key parameters for the system modelling i ρ for the main species used in the hele shaw experiments are summarised in tables 1 and 2 2 5 taylor dispersion analysis mutual diffusion coefficients d cm 2 s 1 of syn 91 10 in pure tce and water were measured by using the taylor dispersion technique taylor 1953 alizadeh et al 1980 a hplc apparatus equipped with a refractive index detector infinity 1260 series agilent technologies santa clara ca usa was adapted for the taylor dispersion experiments vanag et al 2008 rossi et al 2010 2011 a 15 m silica glass capillary inner radius r 0 0 016 0 002 cm coiled in a 30 cm diameter helix was used as the dispersion column the capillary was placed in a thermostatted water bath julabo me 16g julabo gmbh seelbach germany between the manual injector rheodyne 7125 idex lake forest il usa and the thermostatted refractive index detector infinity 1260 series agilent technologies santa clara ca usa samples were injected by using a 20 μ l sample loop every 25 min to avoid the overlapping of the peaks being the retention time of the dispersion process 15 min at constant flow 0 1 ml min 1 to determine the diffusivity of syn 91 10 in water d b t aqueous surfactant solutions with a syn 91 10 0 08 m and 0 07 m were injected in an eluent with syn 91 10 0 05 m to measure the diffusivity of syn 91 10 in tce d b b solutions of the surfactant at different concentrations 1 10 3 m syn 91 10 0 1 m were prepared in pure tce the eluent was pure tce the distribution of concentration was monitored by a refractive index detector rid agilent g1362 a and data were stored in a pc for analysis for 2 component systems the mutual coefficient d can be determined by fitting rid experimental signals with the following equation callendar and leaist 2006 valletti et al 2022 2 s t s 0 s 1 t s m a x t r t e x p 12 d t t r 2 r 0 2 t where s t r i u units is the experimental refractive index signal s 0 r i u units and s 1 r i u units are the intercept and the slope of the linear baseline respectively s m a x r i u units is the peak height t r s is the retention time r 0 cm is the inner capillary radius and t s is the time multiple experimental peaks were simultaneously fitted using levenberg marquardt algorithm marquardt 1963 levenberg 1944 to eq 2 the measurements of the surfactant diffusivity in water and in the organic phase tce are further described and reported in the si 2 6 interfacial tension the interfacial tension analysis was carried out using the pendant drop method oca 15 plus by dataphysics the aqueous solutions of the surfactants were analysed in a concentration range of 0 0001 0 0250 m for synperonic 91 10 the measurements were carried out by producing a drop of chloroform as an example of dnapl in a syn 91 10 solution and getting measurements until equilibrium at 25 c using a 0 51 mm diameter capillary 2 7 model we consider a two dimensional two phase system of length l x and height l z in a x z reference frame where the z axis is oriented vertically against the gravitational acceleration g 0 g the system is supposed to be in isothermal conditions the denser organic layer with the pure dnapl tce a is in the bottom b while the less dense aqueous phase containing the surfactant syn 91 10 b is stratified on top t as sketched in fig 2 b and specified by the initial spatial distribution of the species concentrations a b a p 0 for z z 0 l z 2 x a b 0 b 0 for z z 0 x a b a 0 0 for z z 0 x a b a p b 0 for z z 0 x 3 i e just below the interface a p is the concentration of the pure tce and a 0 represents the saturation concentration of tce in an aqueous layer containing the surfactant with concentration b 0 from table 3 the empirical relation a 0 b 0 3 can be inferred in our model we keep a 0 constant at the interface between the two phases to mimic the constant amount of tce coming from the solubilisation of the pure bottom phase which under the hypothesis of local equilibrium rapidly attains the saturation value loodts et al 2014 budroni et al 2014 2017 similarly as the surfactant is highly soluble in tce we assume that the organic phase acts as a sink for the surfactant whose concentrations go locally to zero at z z 0 and to b 0 in the organic layer just below the interface at z z 0 see fig 2 c as the upward drifting of the interface is negligible within the hydrodynamic time scale and the surface tension along the contact line between the two layers is assumed to be high enough to render negligible any deformation of the interface and the layer frames are kept fixed the dynamics around the interface was investigated numerically by solving the sets of dimensionless diffusion convection dc equations which describe the two coupled phases bratsun and de wit 2004 lemaigre et al 2013 budroni et al 2014 2021 top layer 4 t a t z ψ t x a t x ψ t z a t 2 a t 5 t b t z ψ t x b t x ψ t z b t δ b t 2 b t 6 t ω t z ψ t x ω t x ψ t z ω t 7 s c t 2 ω t i a b r i t x i t

chemical species a and b scaled by the saturation concentration of tce in the surfactant aqueous solution a 0 the evolution of the chemical fields described by eq 4 5 and 8 are coupled to fickian diffusion and to incompressible navier stokes eqs 6 7 and 9 10 written in the stream function vorticity ψ ω form according to the boussinesq approximation the vorticity and the stream function describe the hydrodynamics of the system being related to the velocity field v u v via ω v and u z ψ and v x ψ respectively no flux boundary conditions and no slip conditions are used for the chemical concentrations and the stream function at the rigid boundaries of the reactor respectively at the interface between the two phases i e z z 0 we consider 11 a t a a 0 1 12 b t 0 13 ψ t ψ b 0 b b z 0 b t z 0 and the marangoni boundary condition η ω t ω b i a b m i x i s b where i s are the concentrations of the chemical species a and b at z z 0 and η μ t μ b with μ t and μ b representing the dynamic viscosity of the aqueous and organic phases respectively this condition couples the hydrodynamics between the two phases and along with the gravitational force terms i a b r i t x i t and r b t x b b relates the evolution of the chemical fields to the vorticity and the stream function key parameters to control the onset of convective instabilities and related impact in the dissolution dynamics are the solutal rayleigh numbers of the i th species defined as 14 r i t i ρ t a 0 g l 0 3 d a μ t i a b in the top layer and 15 r i b i ρ b a 0 g l 0 3 d a μ b i a b in the bottom phase these parameters weight the specific contribution of each species concentration to the local dimensionless densities ρ t i a b r i t i and ρ b r b b b the rayleigh numbers control the onset and entity of buoyancy driven convection in response to chemical concentration gradients since in the bottom phase we have tce as a pure liquid the rayleigh number for this species can be only defined in the top phase and the dc equation for a is only considered for that layer l 0 is the characteristic spatial scale of the system here corresponding to the width of the hele shaw cell used in the experiments l 0 1 cm the coefficients i ρ t and i ρ b measure the density change due to small variations in the concentration of the i th species in the top and the bottom layer respectively d a is the diffusion coefficient of tce in the upper phase and can be used to define the time scale of the system t 0 l 0 2 d a δ b t d b t d a and δ b b d b b d a are the dimensionless relative diffusivities of the surfactant in the top and bottom layers respectively another important parameter is the solutal marangoni number 16 m i a 0 l 0 μ b d a i γ which quantifies the specific contribution of the i th species to the dimensionless surface tension γ i a b m i i s and controls the entity of transversal flows at the partially miscible interface due to the transfer of chemical species from one phase to the other in our simulations we assume that the surfactant plays the main role in surface tension changes i e we considered m a 0 and m b 0 as b is supposed to decrease the surface tension we also run check simulations by applying no slip boundary conditions to the vorticity and ψ function at the interface in order to have a reference case where surface tension stresses are not at play and evaluate their actual weight in the global dynamics the coupled systems of dc eqs 4 7 and 8 10 are solved numerically by using the alternating direction implicit method adi peaceman and rachford 1955 over the spatial domain of length l x 30 l 0 and height l z 2 l x i e aspect ratio 2 by using a space meshing h x h z 0 1 and the integration time step h t 1 1 0 4 the numerical algorithm is particularly stable for 2 dimensional problems and squared meshings it consists of solving explicitly the derivatives along one spatial dimension for instance along the x axis and implicitly in the second one z the direction along which the implicit and the explicit descriptions are employed is alternated during each successive iteration which corresponds to one half time step at any given iteration the unknowns of each single equation are the implicitly calculated variables solved as a function of the explicitly calculated terms to solve the hydrodynamic field an iterative procedure checks the convergence of ω and ψ over the entire spatial domain requiring the error between the stream function at the n 1 th and n th iterations to be lower than 1 1 0 5 3 results to mimic a stratification of an aqueous solution over a denser organic solvent in a porous medium we employed a vertical hele shaw cell arranged as in fig 2a in a series of experiments the dnapl was poured at the bottom of the cell and a less dense water solution containing an increasing amount of surfactant was gently poured on top of it in general the presence of the surfactant at a concentration larger than the cmc increases the solubility of the dnapl in the upper aqueous layer table 3 and table s6 in the si and at the same time decreases the interfacial tension table s8 and figure s11 in the si for the sake of simplicity in this section we will focus on the system tce syn 91 10 but similar results though for a slightly different interval of concentrations were obtained for the system tce syn 91 5 given the low reciprocal solubility of the two liquids and the surface tension between the two liquids this density stratification is expected to be statically stable in the gravity field in fact up to a threshold concentration of syn 91 10 1 1 0 2 m the interface remained unperturbed and the mass transfer of the tce to the aqueous layer took place by diffusion only interestingly in experiments where the concentration of syn 91 10 was higher than 1 1 0 2 m ascending plumes of tce developed despite the fact that the initial density of the top layer was lower than that of the bottom one these scenarios are illustrated in fig 3 which shows the experimental schlieren images of systems where syn 91 10 aqueous solutions at different concentrations are layered on top of pure tce in the case of syn 91 10 1 1 0 3 m bottom panels in fig 3 the interface remained stable for the entire course of the experiment and the appearance of some blurred dark areas above and below the interface could be noticed the schlieren technique allows to enhance the contrast of transparent fluids according to their refractive index and hence density therefore the darkening of the liquids around the interface tracks the displacement of the chemical species across the contact line between the two phases with a consequent change of the local density the timescale characterising the thickening of the interface an average displacement of 2 mm in 3000 s can be measured from the bottom panels of fig 3 allows to ascribe to fickian diffusion the mixing in these experimental conditions t d 2 2 d where d is the mean square displacement and d is the diffusion coefficient which for small molecules in liquids is generally of the order of 10 6 10 5 cm 2 s when the concentration of syn 91 10 in the water phase was larger than 1 1 0 2 m hydrodynamic instabilities appeared just below and above the liquid liquid interface after a few minutes from the beginning of the experiment the top and the central panels of fig 3 show the formation of tce plumes developing in the less dense water phase and displacing at a constant speed as typically happens in fingering instabilities lemaigre et al 2013 budroni et al 2017 plumes grew linearly in time and the related displacement speed v m could be calculated from experimental space time st plots according to the procedure reported in section 10 of the si the averaged value of v m for each system has been reported in fig 4 a and in table s1 of the si as a function of syn 91 10 interestingly v m also showed a linear dependence on the concentration of the surfactant in the water phase v m m syn 91 10 q m 0 15 0 01 mm m 1 s 1 q 9 47 0 9 1 0 3 mm s 1 and r 2 0 97608 by comparing the speed at which fingers grew from the organic into the aqueous phase the mixing rate resulted from 10 to 40 times depending on syn 91 10 faster than that due to the fickian diffusion average displacement of tce molecules 8 1 0 4 mm s in general plumes and fingering instabilities around an initially stable stratified liquid liquid interface are due to an inversion of the local density almarcha et al 2011 trevelian et al 2011 budroni et al 2014 and we will discuss the mechanism in more details in the next section it has to be noted that in the tce syn 91 10 system the development of the plumes was accompanied by periodic pulsations which took place just below the interface and originated from a marangoni type instability sustained by surfactant induced gradients in the surface tension fig 4b and the supplementary movie shows the development of a pulsation in a tce syn 91 10 system where syn 91 10 0 08 m the pulse nucleated from the sides of the hele shaw cell and developed horizontally towards the centre similar dynamics have been observed at the interface of partially miscible stratifications of alkyl formates layered on top of aqueous solutions budroni et al 2014 2017 the dark colour was certainly due to the surfactant and possibly some water which was partitioned in the dnapl phase marangoni pulses showed a quite regular dynamics with a characteristic period of 500 s as shown in the time series reported in fig 4c the synergy between the plumes and the marangoni pulses transiently favoured the mixing of the two phases resulting in an enhanced dissolution of the dnapl in the aqueous layer in all the systems where instabilities occurred the formation of a new surfactant rich middle phase m phase at the contact zone between the water and the dnapl was observed just before the appearance of the instabilities dark interfacial area at t 1000 s in the top and middle panels of fig 3 the m phase appeared milky and with a high turbidity and it was characterised as a thermodynamically unstable macroemulsion winsor type iii system kang et al 2019 lagzi 2015 the m phase and its role in the onset of the instability have been extensively discussed in the section s7 of the si the convective stability of aqueous surfactant solutions stratified on top of a dnapl was further investigated by changing the organic liquid when chloroform was employed hydrodynamic patterns similar to the tce case were obtained by contrast statically stable stratifications were found for pce at all the concentrations of surfactant monitored see figure s4 in the si finally the presence of plumes and fingers was further explored for other classes of surfactants we tested the anionic sds and aot the cationic ctab and the zwitterionic c14dmao all of them or very similar molecules were reported to enhance the solubility of dnapls in water solutions harendra and vipulanandan 2011 acosta and quraishi 2014 mao et al 2015 the experimental setup was kept fixed and we used tce as the organic phase instabilities with a low intensity were detected only when the water phase contained aot 0 03 m see figure s5 in the si for the rest of the surfactants no clear instabilities could be observed interestingly the formation of an m phase was found also in the tce aot system though it was found denser and less persistent with respect to the m phase generated by the exthoxylated surfactants 4 discussion 4 1 interpretation of the hydrodynamic instability the onset of the fingering instability stems from the inversion of the local density just above the interface between the two layers according to the chemico physical parameters measured for the species at play see details in the si section s2 for density section s3 for diffusivity and section s4 for solubility we envisaged the following mechanism see also the supplementary movie first plumes were always located in the top layer and must be originated from a local density depletion just above the contact line between the two phases in principle this could be provided by the downward migration of the surfactant into the bottom organic layer where it is highly soluble either in the form of micellar aggregates or in the form of monomers the chemical structure of ethoxylated alcohols is in fact known to favour the partition of the surfactant in the dnapl phase zhu and free 2015 as a function of the number of ethylene oxide eo units zimmerman et al 1999 both syn 91 10 and syn 91 5 were found to be largely soluble in tce at 25 c and miscible in all proportions with it the affinity of syn 91 10 for tce was also confirmed by measuring the diffusivity of the surfactant in water and in the organic phase d b t in the aqueous phase was 1 03 10 6 cm 2 s 1 and d b b in tce was 1 30 10 5 cm 2 s 1 as determined by the taylor dispersion technique see section 2 5 and section s3 in the si the organic phase acted thus as a sink for the surfactant see the red profile in fig 2c but the related density depletion was largely compensated by the counter dissolution of tce in fact though ρ t tce ρ t syn 91 10 see tables 1 2 and section 2 of the si tce provided a larger contribution to the density according to eq 1 because its aqueous concentration was higher than that of the surfactant about 3 times and this determined a stable downward increasing density profile of the type shown in the left panel of fig 5 however the local drop of the surfactant concentration at the interface created a concentration gradient which broke de facto the initial convective stability by starting a differential diffusive interplay in the aqueous layer between the fast upwardly diffusing tce d a 8 16 1 0 6 cm 2 s 1 rossi et al 2015 and the slow downward diffusing surfactant d b t 1 03 10 6 cm 2 s 1 in time this developed a non monotonic density profile with a local density minimum as shown in the right panel of fig 5 sustained by a delayed double diffusive mechanism trevelian et al 2011 furthermore the concurrent transfer of tce and surfactant between the two phases modified the interfacial tension between the two liquids and caused transversal marangoni stresses sternling and scriven 1959 bratsun and de wit 2004 as manifested by the periodic pulsations at the interface the dissolution of the syn 91 10 did not create any buoyancy driven instabilities in the lower organic layer because it was characterised by a negative contribution to the density ρ b syn 91 10 0 15 g cm 3 m 1 our interpretation based on the solubility of the surfactant and on the dnapl surfactant differential diffusion can explain the different behaviours observed when other surfactants sds aot ctab and c14dmao replaced the ethoxylated alcohols in the aqueous layer and when other dnapls cf and pce replaced the tce in the case of alternative surfactants instabilities were observed for aot only this was due to the fact that aot has a similar phase behaviour of syn 91 10 and syn 91 5 i e high solubility in the organic phase and it is able to form microemulsion without the need of a co surfactant broze and zoller 1999 mao et al 2015 moreover the other surfactants have a lower molecular weight than syn 91 10 and syn 91 5 see table 1 which is reflected into a higher diffusivity in water that suppressed the differential diffusion mechanism concerning the experiments with alternative dnapls instabilities were found only for cf which in contrast to pce has physico chemical characteristics similar to those of tce density and miscibility with surfactants pce is in fact much denser and by far less miscible both in water and in surfactant solutions than tce see table 2 and table s6 in the si for the saturation concentration of pce c s p c e we finally note that a fingering instability in analogous systems could also be activated without differential diffusion if the contribution to the density of the dnapl in the aqueous phase ρ t dnapl would be much lower than that of the surfactant at hands then a density minimum would simply develop due to the surfactant solubilisation into the underlying organic layer 4 2 nonlinear simulations to support the mechanism proposed for the onset of hydrodynamic instabilities we run numerical simulations by feeding the theoretical model described in section 2 7 with the experimental chemico physical parameters measured in the experiments we set s c t 10000 which is compatible with the water kinematic viscosity ν t μ t ρ 0 0 0089 cm2 s 1 and with the aqueous diffusivity of tce while s c b was fixed to 5000 as ν b 0 5 ν t as mentioned above the coefficients i ρ of tce and syn 91 10 in the aqueous phase extrapolated as described in section 2 4 presented analogous values ρ t tce ρ t syn 91 10 0 0365 g cm 3 m 1 such that we could assume r a t r b t realistic rayleigh numbers given a 0 0 3 m l 0 1 cm and d a 8 16 1 0 6 cm 2 s 1 g 9 8 cm s 2 have an order of magnitude 1 0 6 which is consistent with the appearance of short wavelength convective fingering in the narrow spatial domain used in the experiments 1 cm 2 cm corresponding to 1 2 model space units l 0 however to avoid numerical divergence simulations with such high values would require an extremely refined spatio temporal solving grid and a sensitive reduction of the error tolerance for the stream function computation see section 2 7 which is critically demanding from the computational viewpoint we thus considered a spatial domain of 30 60 l 0 which without loss of generality allowed reproducing convective patterns similar to those of the experiments and to give a qualitatively consistent description of these phenomena even using lower values of the rayleigh numbers after a preliminary exploration we fixed r a t r b t 100 and since in tce ρ b syn 91 10 0 15 g cm 3 m 1 and μ b 0 5 μ t we set r b b 1000 10 r b t the measured values for d a d b t and d b b see tables 1 and 2 and section 3 in the si were used to define the dimensionless relative diffusivities of the surfactant in the top layer δ b t 0 12 and in the bottom layer δ b b 1 51 we finally varied m b 0 50000 to check the relative importance of surface effects in the convective dissolution of tce in fig 6 see also the supplementary movie we illustrate a typical spatio temporal evolution of the dissolution driven convective instability obtained with the parameter set r a t r b t 100 r b b 10 r b t 1000 m b 50000 the snapshots show the vorticity in the top phase and just below the interface at different times after an initial diffusive transient plumes nucleated and grew upwardly above the interface similarly to the experiments the plumes underwent some lateral merging promoted by marangoni flows below z 0 the transfer of surfactant between the two phases in fact generated surface tension driven instabilities in the form of transversal pulses at the interface which distorted the plumes in the top layer and could eventually homogenise them successively plumes formed and rised again affected by surface tension driven stresses in particular they formed at the lateral border of the spatial domain where horizontal short pulses and drifting plumes were observed these dynamics cannot be observed if we run simulations with δ b t 0 35 i e suppressing differential diffusion an overview of the global dynamics could be captured by using the st plots see section 10 of the si obtained by stacking as a function of the time the transversal profile of the vorticity just above and below the interface white dashed lines in the first snapshot of the top panels of fig 6 these plots shown in bottom panels of fig 6 represent the dynamics for 300 time units thus dimension l x 300 t 0 and show the main features of the convective instability plumes started at t 63 time units accompanied by marangoni driven horizontal pulses the latter flows may disrupt the growth of the plumes and start pulsations towards the lateral borders of the spatial domain as described by local zig zag patterns along the borders the dynamics below the interface was characterised by periodic pulsations consistent with the experimental observations st plots allow a direct comparison of the characteristic wavelength and onset time of the instability for different control parameters of the system as reported in section 8 of the si to make a direct comparison with the experiments we characterised in fig 7 the speed of the fingering growth as a function of a 0 which is related to the surfactant concentration b 0 as a 0 b 0 3 a 0 also controls both the rayleigh and the marangoni numbers see definitions 14 15 16 and the impact of the initial surfactant concentration explored in the experiments could thus be reproduced numerically by changing proportionally r i t r b b and m b the system specified by the parameter set r a t r b t 100 r b b 10 r b t 1000 m b 50000 was associated to a relative reference value a 0 a 0 r e f and compared with dissolution driven convective dynamics obtained with decreasing fractions of these reference values st plots built by following the development of the fastest plumes along the vertical axis see the vertical dashed red line in the second snapshot of fig 6 showed that the plumes grew linearly in time with a speed v m that relates linearly with a 0 and in turn with the surfactant concentration b 0 see fig 7a this compares favourably with experimental analysis cfr fig 4a to analyse the impact of the different contributions to convective flows in the dissolution of a we also computed the mean flux j through z z 0 averaged over the horizontal dimension x jotkar et al 2019 17 j 1 l x x 0 l x a z z z 0 d x and we considered how this quantity varied as a function of the time for different values of a 0 in particular in fig 7b we report the temporal profile of δ j t i e the difference between the flux obtained in systems with convection j t and the diffusive reference flux j diff t in all cases there was an initial spike due to the onset of convective instabilities followed by a decline to a rather constant flux around 0 008 0 002 over which all curves converged and fluctuated a faster and stronger divergence from the purely diffusive dynamics was obtained for a 0 a 0 r e f and progressively smooth down when decreasing a 0 to disentangle the role of the main contributions to the flow i e buoyancy vs marangoni driven flows we characterised the instabilities developing with different values of m b 0 500000 with fixed r a i t 100 r a b b 10 r a i t i a b and in the absence of surface stresses at the contact line between the two phases the results reported in section 8 of the si show that while the density driven fingering always enhanced the dissolution process marangoni driven flows due to their orthogonal orientation with respect to the dissolution direction may play either a positive neutral or even unfavourable role with respect to the dissolution process indeed marangoni pulses favoured an initial enhancement of the flux but this was followed by a drop due to the homogenising effect of these transverse flows which suppressed the buoyancy driven plumes the successive formation of new convective plumes reinforced the dissolution flux again in general the most unstable systems from a convective viewpoint which can be achieved by augmenting a 0 may not necessarily enhance the dissolution process as a 0 increases all the contributions to the flow unconditionally including transversal flows this information turns useful to orient the choice and the concentration of the surfactant to be employed similar conclusions were drawn in previous studies on convective dissolution in binary systems with partially miscible components lappa et al 2005 5 conclusion in this paper we reported about hydrodynamic instabilities taking place at the interface of an initially stable stratification of a water solution on top of a denser pure dnapl phase in the case of pure water given the reciprocal low solubility of the two liquids the stratification was stable over time and the mixing between the two phases took place by molecular diffusion until the saturation concentrations were attained this resemble the typical situation happening when a spill of a dnapl from the surface penetrates into the soil until it stratifies below groundwaters to form a permanent source of pollution however further investigations in a vertical hele shaw cell revealed that the presence of suitable surfactants promoted an inversion of the local densities thus allowing for a faster mixing between the two phases in particular surfactants induced a massive transport of the dnapl in the aqueous solution in the form of upward plumes and fingers the surfactant had three main roles i it promoted the solubilisation of the dnapl by forming micelles and microemulsion ii it lowered the surface tension between the two phases to promote marangoni effects and iii it favoured the inversion of the local density at the interface the onset of the hydrodynamic instabilities was initiated by the fast diffusion and the high solubility of the surfactant in the organic phase which combined to a double diffusion mechanism between the surfactant itself and the fast diffusive tce decreased the density of the top aqueous layer in the proximity of the interface at the same time the changes of the surface tension induced periodic marangoni pulsations in the dnapl phase which interacted with the density driven advective motion we thoroughly characterised the chemico physical properties of the investigated systems solubility density diffusivity etc and we employed these parameters to feed a realistic theoretical model based on the navier stokes equations the integration of the nonlinear model reproduced well the dynamical behaviour of the experiments in addition the use of the measured parameters allowed for a semi quantitative interpretation of the chemistry and physics at play in the explored systems the model was also employed to decouple and study parametrically the relative influence of the main contributions to the flow buoyancy vs marangoni driven convection through the characteristic numbers r i and m i directly linked to the experimental conditions surfactant concentration density of the dnapl etc to sum up the proposed model catched all the essential features of the experimental systems and suggested criteria to optimise the interplay between buoyancy and marangoni driven flows to enhance the dnapl dissolution process the model can be further refined to obtain more quantitative results by considering the complex nature of the microemulsion systems and by including cross diffusion phenomena leaist and hao 1995 vanag et al 2008 budroni et al 2015a b budroni 2015 the experimental model system we devised represents a proof of concept to demonstrate that the choice of a proper surfactant could help in designing more effective remediation strategies based on the co solvent surfactant flushing technology given the limitations of our lab scale setup it is difficult to give reliable values for the removal efficiency for in field applications however we obtained an estimation of the dnapl transfer rate to the water phase by measuring the lowering of the liquid liquid interface over time in the tce syn 91 10 system the analysis of the experimental frames yielded for example a velocity of transfer of 1 2 10 4 mm s 1 when syn 91 10 0 2 m a value in line with that found for the mass transfer coefficient determined for spherical tce droplets in surfactant solutions valletti et al 2021 by considering a flat interface the calculated transfer velocity would allow a theoretical removal rate of 10 5 l d 1 of dnapl in the case of a contact area of 1 m 2 if we take the tce saturation concentration c s t c e 0 64 m at syn 91 10 0 2 m table 3 we can roughly estimate a volume 1 8 104 l d 1 of the aqueous surfactant solution employed to have a comparison brown et al 1999 described a 3 day remediation process of a dnapl contaminated aquifer where 5000 l of a dnapl were removed by employing 1 5 109 l of an aqueous solution with sds 0 26 m and isopropanol 0 74 m in another study jawitz and coworkers jawitz et al 2000 reported a remediation case study where 40 l of pce were removed in 3 days by using 80000 l of 95 ethanol in this study we did not consider the effect of a water flow at the interface that would be present in real field applications for the delivery of the surfactant solution to the remediation spot however based on our results we can say that the flow rate of remediating solutions injected in flushing processes should be modulated to make the contact time between the aqueous and the dnapl phases long enough to allow the onset of the fingering instabilities thus the hydraulic residence time of the injected solution should be larger than the mixing time triggered by the hydrodynamic flows in kinetic terms the reciprocal of the residence time has to be of the order of 3 5 h 1 in conclusion our results indicate that hydrodynamic instabilities can be successfully exploited by selecting a suitable hydraulic residence time to improve the removal rate of dnapls from aquifers and groundwater with a possible savings of additional compounds surfactant and or co surfactants declaration of competing interest the authors declare

15123,ph is a crucial factor of microbial nitrification which often combines with high strength ammonium to influence nitrogen removal pathway in wastewater treatment however the detailed inhibitory mechanisms of ph stress are not sufficiently disclosed yet in this study the ph stress effect on nitrification was comprehensively studied by a set of experiments which identified the reactivity of nitrification processes and activity of nitrifiers the time dependence of inhibition effect and the hybrid ph stress effect with ammonium the results revealed two distinct inhibitory mechanisms dominating in alkaline and acid ranges in alkaline range ph 8 ph stress causes physiological damages on microorganisms which is named as microbial inhibition it has the features of less recoverability of nitrifiers time dependent inhibition effect and low ph tolerance of nitrite oxidation bacteria free ammonia enhanced microbial inhibition and greatly promoted nitrite accumulation a novel reactive inhibition mechanism dominated in acid range ph 7 was disclosed it only impedes ammonia oxidation process aop but not impair microbial activity obviously and the effect is time independent the mechanism was clarified from h transport because aop involved h production the h transport was impeded under acid stress owing to the decrease of ph gradient across cell membrane the two mechanisms formed a panoramic view of ph stress effect on nitrification advancing the understanding of nitrifier adaptability and nitritation regulation in wastewater treatment processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrification ph stress effect reactive inhibition microbial inhibition free ammonia data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrification is an indispensable process for biological nitrogen removal bnr and its product distribution no3 no2 determines the categories of bnr such as conventional nitrification denitrification nitritation denitritation and partial nitritation anammox li et al 2020a ronan et al 2021 wang et al 2021b ph is a key factor of nitrification which not only influences nitrifying rates and product distribution zheng et al 2018 but also changes microbial community in a long term operation tripathi et al 2018 wang et al 2021a it often varies severely in wastewater treatment process and oversteps the ph range of 7 8 because of the h oh productions involved in nitrification denitrification fermentation and hydrolysis khin and annachhatre 2004 yu et al 2021 zhang et al 2007 therefore understanding the adaptability of nitrifiers and the inhibition effect under ph stress is crucial to ph manipulation for avoiding or stimulating nitrite accumulations in bnr this is also of interest in geochemical nitrogen cycle in soil and ecology baggs et al 2010 jeschke et al 2013 levy booth et al 2014 despite great efforts the comprehensive view about ph stress effect on nitrification has not been adequately formed yet nitrification is commonly treated as a two step process including ammonia oxidation process to nitrite aop implemented by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and the subsequent nitrite oxidation process nop implemented by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob one problem is that the reaction rates reactivities of aop and nop are not equivalent to the activities of aob and nob generally the inhibition effects on nitrifiers are evaluated by measuring aop and nop reactivities antoniou et al 1990 bae et al 2001 park et al 2007 which may lead to diverse conclusions for the common bnr processes le et al 2019 reported that aob was completely inhibited at ph 5 0 however nitrification was completely ceased at ph below 6 0 fumasoli et al 2017 ruiz et al 2003 zhang et al 2015 reported that both aob and nob were strongly inhibited with the ph decrease to ph 6 5 cytryn et al 2012 found that aob was more sensitive to acidification than nob the cessation of aop and nop does not imply inactivation of aob and nob in some particular cases we think that the activities of aob and nob should be further evaluated by restoring ph stresses to neutral conditions namely recovery experiments if ph stress does not obviously impair the activity of nitrifiers they will react immediately in the recovery experiments and show high recoverability the time dependence of inhibition effect is another key problem of ph stress effect on nitrifications typically the inhibition effect on microorganisms is time dependent because the variations of physiological function microbial community and adaptability require time it can be divided into three time scales the transient inhibition indicating the effect on reaction occurrence grunditz and dalhammar 2001 the short term inhibition few days revealing the effect on microbes and the long term inhibition showing the adaptations of nitrifiers daebeler et al 2020 in this regard we designed steady state inhibition experiments and transient inhibition experiments to reveal the time dependence free ammonia fa and free nitrous acid fna are two well known inhibition factors of microorganisms duan et al 2019 li et al 2020b wei et al 2017 zhou et al 2011 of them ammonium rich wastewaters are frequently encountered in bnr such as the livestock wastewater and landfill leachate nagarajan et al 2019 ren et al 2022 ren et al 2021 since fa concentration depends on ph and increases fast at a ph range of 8 10 liu et al 2019 ph stress effect in alkaline range usually couples with fa inhibition which has been an important approach for nitritation start up sun et al 2021 vadivelu et al 2007 in accordance with the above problems we designed a set of experiments to comprehensively investigate the ph stress effect on nitrification from i reactivities of aop and nop under ph stress ii recoverability of aob and nob iii time dependence of inhibition effect and iv hybrid ph stress effect with ammonium the reactivities of aop and nop were investigated by both the full nitrification experiments beginning with ammonium and the stepwise experiments to accurately determine the reaction rate of nop recoverability was evaluated by comparing the reaction rates under ph stress and after restoring to neutral ph the dependence on time was investigated from the transient inhibition and steady state inhibition hybrid ph stress effect with ammonium was investigated by comparing the inhibition effect under low and high ammonia loads these comprehensive investigations finally uncovered two inhibitory mechanisms namely the reactive and microbial inhibitions dominating in acid and alkaline ranges respectively they formed a panoramic view of ph stress effect illustrating the observed inhibition features of common nitrification processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 nitrifying sludge cultivation in a pilot scale reactor to maintain nitrifying sludge homogeneity all batch tests fetched the sludge from a continuous flow pilot scale reactor 4 6 l operated for more than six months the inoculation sludge of this pilot scale reactor was taken from a real wwtps the synthetic wastewater applied for cultivation contains per liter 200 mg nh4 n 761 mg nh4cl 1000 mg na2hpo4 800 mg k2co3 and 1 ml trace element solution table s1 wang et al 2017 the influent flow was 12 ml min resulting in 1 43 0 54 mg l nh4 n 166 17 4 mg l no3 n and 0 96 1 17 mg l no2 n in effluent the reactor was maintained at ph 7 5 0 5 and temperature between 25 and 30 c 2 2 batch tests investigating ph stress effect on nitrification the ph stress effect on nitrification was performed by the batch tests using the glass bottles with a volume of 1 l the batch tests include four experiments steady state inhibition recovery experiments transient inhibition and stepwise experiments the reactivity of nitrification for all the experiments were measured with the same procedures as introduced below 2 2 1 measurments of nitrification process reactivity before the measurements the sludge in bottle reactors was washed twice using tap water to exclude the initial substrates the detailed washing procedures were in supporting information fig s1 then 500 ml nutrient solution containing 48 mg l nh4 n and buffer was added to the bottles the buffer concentrations were 0 04 m nah2po4 if applied for ph 8 0 and 0 02 m nahco3 and 0 02 m h3bo3 for ph 8 0 after that the total solution volume was diluted to 800 ml immediately resulting in an initial nh4 n concentration about 30 mg l and nitrification reaction began the bottles continuously aerated using an air pump to maintain dissolved oxygen do above 2 mg l and were stirred by a magnetic mixer at 1500 rpm the temperature was maintained at 30 1 in an incubator at the sampling times of 1 20 40 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 and 300 min 5 ml supernatants were sampled from the bottles and filtered with 0 45 μm membrane the solutions were conserved by adding 25 μl h3po4 1 1 for measuring nh4 n no3 n and no2 n concentrations the ph of bottle solutions was monitored and adjusted after every sampling operation the sludge concentrations at the beginning and end of the batch tests were measured and their averaged values were applied for kinetic parameter calculations the measured sludge concentrations were summarized in table s3 2 2 2 steady state inhibition experiments at low and high ammonium loads for each experiment 800 ml sludge taken from the pilot scale reactor was added to the glass bottles and was washed twice using tap water the detailed procedures were in supporting information fig s1 then the sludge was holded in the ph stress conditions for two days the nutrient solution was replaced every 24 h and the nitrogen source ammonium sulfate was added at 12th hours ph was adjusted every two hours from 8 00 to 23 00 the nutrient solution was the same with that in 2 2 1 except for the ammonium concentration the ammonium concentration at low load was 30 mg l nh4 n and at high load was 200 mg l nh4 n after the steady state inhibition period the nitrification reactivity under the ph stress conditions was measured acocrding to the method in 2 2 1 the inhibition experiments at low and high ammonium loads were investigated in a wide ph range where nitrifiers retain activity 2 2 3 recovery experiments after the steady state inhibition experiments above the reactivity was measured again on the next day by restoring ph to normal ph levels namely 7 0 for acid stress conditioins and 8 0 for alkaline stress conditions recoverability of aob and nob was evaluated by comparing the reactivities measured from the steady state inhibition experiments and the recovery experiments after the recovery experiments 5 ml sludge mixture was collected and stored at 80 c for further high throughput sequencing analysis 2 2 4 transient inhibition experiments at low ammonia load in this experiment 800 ml sludge taken from the pilot scale reactor was added to the glass bottles and was washed twice using tap water then the nitrification reactivity under a ph stress condition was measured immediately according to the method in 2 2 1 the dependence of inhibition effect on time was evaluated by comparing the reactivities measured from transient and steady state inhibition experiments 2 2 5 stepwise experiments the reactivity of nop is underestimated in full nitrification experiments when aop is the rate limiting step because the reaction rate of nop is limited by that of aop kowalchuk and stephen 2001 the real nop reactivity can be measured from the nitrification beginning with nitrite and hence we proposed the stepwise experiments the preparation procedures of this experiment was the same as those of transient inhibition experiments the reactivities of aop and nop were seperately measrued at first sodium nitrite was added to the bottle reactors to attain a intial no2 n concentration of 20 mg l only nop occurred in this stage and so the reactivity of nop can be accurately measrued after no2 n was completely depleted ammonium sulfate was added to attain 30 mg l nh4 n and then full nitrification prcoess occurred the reactivity of aop was determined in this stage 2 3 kinetic parameter determinations the reaction rates of aop and nop can be expressed by eqs 1 and 2 because no3 n is the only product of nop the reaction rate of nop equals the concentration variation of no3 n namely d s no 3 d t do is considered to be sufficient and its term is treated as a constant 1 d s nh 3 d t k nh 3 s nh 3 k nh 3 s nh 3 x a 2 d s no 3 d t k no 2 s no 2 k no 2 s no 2 x a where x a is the sludge concentration measured as suspended solid ss mg l s denotes the concentration of nitrogen species mgn l k denotes rate constant mgn gss h k denotes half saturation constant mg l and the subscripts nh3 no2 and no3 represent the species of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n to linearize eqs 1 and 2 we assumed that k nh3 and k no2 are negligible since they are very small typically smaller than 2 mg l daebel et al 2007 shaw et al 2013 the rate constants are expressed as follows after linearization 3 k nh 3 d s nh 3 d t x a 4 k no 2 d s no 3 d t x a for the full nitrifications beginning with nh4 n k nh3 and k no2 can be determined from the linear slopes of ammonium degradation curve vs time and nitrate accumulation curves vs time respectively in the case that aop is the rate limiting step namly no2 n accumulation is negligible the k no2 value determined by this way is a pseudo value because the reaction rate of nop is limited by that of aop note that k no2 is impossible to be accurately determined in this case even if the nonlinear fitting methods based on nitrification model is adopted so the k no2 values determined from full nitrification experiments are expressed as k no 2 to determine the exact k no2 values in this case partial nitrifications beginning with no2 n see stepwise experiments was conducted in accodance with eq 5 k no2 is determined from the linear slope of nitrite degradation curve vs time 5 k no 2 d s no 2 d t x a the nitrite accumulation rate nar at a

reactivity measured from the steady state inhibition experiments under low ammonia load 30 mg l nh4 n was used to evaluate single ph stress effect and the results are shown in fig 1 the nh4 n concentration variations in acid conditions fig 1a showed a fast decrease of ammonia oxidation rate from ph 7 0 to 6 4 finally nitrification ceased completely at ph below 6 0 this observation was consistent with the previous reports kim et al 2007 zheng et al 2018 in alkaline conditions fig 1b the ammonia oxidation rate presented a sudden drop before ph 8 5 and a succedent slow attenuation trend as ph increased this ph dependent relationship of aop rate can be quantified as k nh3 vs ph in fig 1c where the k nh3 values were determined from the slopes of nh4 n concentration curves it was obvious that the aop had a wider working ph range in alkaline condition up to 9 7 than in acid condition only to 6 0 the no3 n concentration variations in fig 1d and e showed that no3 n accumulation trends were basically consistent with the nh4 n consuming trends in these full nitrification experiments pseudo rate constants of nop k no 2 can be determined from the slopes of no3 n concentration curves due to the equivalence between no3 n accumulation and no2 n oxidation the k no 2 vs ph relationship in fig 1f was similar to that of aop in fig 1c however the working ph range shrank to 9 5 revealing that nop was more sensitive to alkaline stress daebeler et al 2020 park et al 2007 overall under single ph stress nitrification had a working ph range of 6 0 9 7 ph 8 0 was the optimal condition and nop was more sensitive to alkaline stress 3 2 reactivity under hybrid ph stress the hybrid ph stress effect with ammonium were revealed by comparing the nitrification reactivity under low and high ammonia loads the results of steady state inhibition experiments under high ammonia load 200 mg l are shown in fig 2 following the methods in fig 1 k nh3 values were determined from the linear fittings in fig 2a and b and k no 2 values were determined from fig 2d and e the obtained ph dependent relationships of k nh3 and k no 2 were compared to those under single ph stress in fig 2c and f it showed that fa plays its role at ph above 7 0 where differences arose the fa concentration at ph 7 0 reached 1 6 mg l which has exhibited a detectable inhibition effect on nitrification vadivelu et al 2007 the fa concentration corresponding to all the experimental ph conditions were listed in table s2 in the near neutral range of 7 0 8 0 k nh3 and k no 2 increased obviously with ph in both single and hybrid ph stress conditions indicating that ph was a positive factor in this range nevertheless the promotion effect was relatively weaker than that under single ph stress the difference between them was due to the inhibition effect of fa zhang et al 2015 once ph larger than 8 0 ph turned into a negative factor too which together with fa presented a co inhibition effect on nitrification as shown by the enhanced inhibition effect at ph above 8 0 fig 2c and f accordingly the working ph range shrank to 9 4 from 9 7 in single ph stress importantly k no 2 dropped faster than k nh3 revealing that fa had a stronger inhibition effect on nop this is beneficial to short cut nitrogen removal via nitrite accumulations qian et al 2017 wang et al 2017 ph 8 0 was invariably the optimal condition for nitrification under both low and high ammonium loads which divided ph stress effect into two distinct parts 3 3 inhibition effect on nitrifiers revealing two inhibitory mechanisms after steady state inhibition experiments the remaining activity of nitrifiers was measured on the next day by restoring ph to normal ph levels recovery experiments the measured nh4 n and no3 n concentration curves are shown in fig s2 and s3 the recoverability of aob and nob was evaluated by comparing the rate constants of the two experiments as shown in fig 3 it was obviously different in the acid and alkaline ranges in alkaline range the reactivity of recovery experiments had similar decline trends to those of steady state experiments it indicated a relatively irreversible inhibition effect on microbial activity which may due to the physiological damage on microorganisms daebeler et al 2020 vadivelu et al 2007 under high ammonia load microbial activity impaired more severely than that in low ammonia load revealing that fa enhanced such microbial inhibition interestingly in acid range the reactivities of both aop and nop between 5 5 6 8 basically recovered to the normal levels at ph 7 0 the microbial activity was obviously inhibited only after ph decreased to 5 0 this phenomenon indicated a surprising conclusion that the inhibition effect in acid stress was highly reversible as long as the ph is not too acid to kill the microbes it referred that acid stress only hindered the reaction occurrence but not severely impaired the activity of nitrifiers to further verify the distinct inhibition effect in acid and alkaline ranges the sludge after the recovery experiments was collected for dominant bacteria community analysis the distributions and proportions of bacteria at genus level fig 4a showed that nitrospria and nitrosomonas were the predominant nitrifying bacteria in our experimental systems and their abundances varied with ph conditions the total proportions of nitrospria and nitrosomonas fig 4b in acid conditions 5 5 and 6 4 were almost identical or even higher than that of raw sludge samples reaching up to 18 1 41 7 it gave direct evidence that the acid stress had no obvious inhibition effect on nitrifiers themselves by contrast their proportions in alkaline conditions decreased to a low level about 3 3 7 5 this confirmed the physiological damage on nitrifiers caused by alkaline stress finally two distinct ph stress effects are uncovered namely the reactive inhibition on nitrification processes and the microbial inhibition on nitrifiers 3 4 transient inhibition effects of the two inhibitory mechanisms dependence of inhibition effect on time was investigated from the transient inhibition and steady state inhibition experiments the reactivity of transient inhibition experiemnts was measured immediately after regulating to a ph stress without extra exposure time the transient inhibition experiments in alkaline range ph 8 0 9 5 performed the full nitrification beginning with nh4 n fig s4 in fig 5a and b the determined rate constants k nh3 and k no 2 did not decreased remarkably under transient inhibition which had obvious difference comparing to those under steady state inhibition this supported that alkaline stress caused physiological damages on microorganisms and thus microbial inhibition effect was time dependent the transient inhibition effect in acid range ph 5 0 8 0 was investigated by stepwise experiments the reactivity of nop was measured first by only adding no2 and the results were shown in fig 5c after no2 was depleted the reactivity of aop was measured by adding nh4 and the results were shown in fig s5 this method enabled to determine the exact k no2 values from the slopes of no2 n concentration curves as shown in fig 5d k no2 maintained at a consistent level between ph 5 5 8 0 while k nh3 decreased fast with ph and approached zero at ph 6 0 the ph dependent relationship of k nh3 was highly consistent with that under steady state inhibition experiments fig 2c this indicated that the reactive inhibition effect was independent of time and verified that reactive inhibition influenced nitrification processes rather than nitrifiers furthermore it is surprising to find that nop was free from the effect of acid stress until ph 5 0 where microbial inhibition emerged the reactive inhibition only influenced the occurrence of aop therefore aop was the rate limiting step in acid stress conditions illustrating why nitrite accumulation was negligible gieseke et al 2006 tarre and green 2004 the mechanism that reactive inhibition only impedes aop can be reasonably explained by the proton transport within activated sludge flocs picone et al 2021 suzuki et al 1974 two moles of proton are produced from the oxidation of per ammonia eq 8 whilst proton is not involved in nop eq 9 thus proton transport was indispensable for aop to continually transfer h from microbial cells to extracellular matrix ciudad et al 2006 the ph gradient across the cell membrane was the driving force which decreased with ph this reasonably illustrates the fast drop of aop reactivity in acid range accordingly the phenomena that aop ceased completely at ph below 6 0 can be attributed to the reverse ph gradient formed in this ph range 8 nh 4 1 5 o 2 n o 2 2 h h 2 o 9 no 2 0 5 o 2 n o 3 3 5 ph stress effect on nitrite accumulation fig 6 shows the no2 n concentration curves under single and hybrid ph stress conditions no visible no2 n accumulation was observed in acid range fig 6a and d this was because nop was free from acid stress as illustrated in the stepwise experiments by contrast obvious no2 n accumulations were observed in alkaline range as shown by the 1 3 mg l no2 n at ph 8 5 in single ph stress fig 6b and by the 8 5 mg l no2 n at ph 8 8 in hybrid ph stress fig 6 e this was due to that nob was more sensitive to the inhibition effect than aob and fa enhanced this inhibition effect liu et al 2015 park et al 2007 furthermore nar was quantified from eq 6 as shown in fig 6c and f nar 1 denotes the nitritation from nh4 n to no2 n in comparison to single ph stress hybrid ph stress with fa greatly promoted nitrite accumulation nar dramatically increased at ph above 8 6 and reached maximum 1 0 at ph 9 0 which was namely the optimal condition for partial nitrification besides nar was shown to be time dependent and reached maximum at the time about 40 90 min revealing that retention time was also a key parameter regulating partial nitrification finally in terms of the ph stress effect on nitrite accumulation we learn that i the hybrid ph stress with fa at ph 8 8 9 0 is the optimal condition and ii controlling a small retention time of nitrification is necessary 3 6 a panoramic view of ph stress effect on nitrification based on the two inhibitory mechanisms a panoramic view of ph stress effect on nitrification was schemed in fig 7 microbial inhibition is due to the physiological damages on nitrifiers resulting from ph stress nitrifiers have a very wide ph tolerance range that ph is no less than 5 0 and no more than 9 7 low load and 9 4 high load as shown by the green line arrows beyond this range nitrifiers are killed the microbial inhibition dominates in alkaline range and has the features of i poor recoverability ii time dependent inhibition effect iii lower ph tolerance of nob than aob and iv hybrid ph stress effect with fa the microbial inhibition is crucial to nitrite accumulation as illustrated in inset b in fig 7 it enlarges the activity discrepancy between aob and nob for mainstream nitritation li et al 2020b ren et al 2021 and enriches aob in long term operations for sidestream treatment cogert et al 2019 yang et al 2018 reactive inhibition becomes dominant in acid range it only impedes the occurrence of aop and will not impair the activity of aob and nob obviously and its inhibition effect is time independent we formulate a novel mechanism for reactive inhibition inset a in fig 7 occurrence of aop is impeded due to the block of h transport from intracellular cell to outer solution in acid stress conditions nop is free from the effect as it involves no h production dependence of reactive inhibition effect on ph is relevant to the ph gradient across cell membrane because it is the driving force of h transport the inhibition effect grows fast before ph 6 0 as shown by the yellow line arrow since h transport is completely blocked by forming a reverse ph gradient the microbial inhibition in the acid range larger than ph 5 0 is insignificant thus the inhibition effect arises instantaneously under acid stress and is shown to be reversible for the activity of nitrifiers 5 conclusions in this study the ph stress effect on nitrification was comprehensively studied by steady state and recovery experiments under low and high ammonia loads transient inhibition experiments and stepwise experiments this allowed us to identify two distinct inhibitory mechanisms dominating in acid and alkaline range respectively an interesting reactive inhibition was disclosed which has rarely been recognized before nitrifiers had a wide ph tolerance range about 5 0 9 7 microbial inhibition dominated in alkaline range ph 8 and caused physiological damage on microorganisms which was time dependent nitrifier activity failed to recover after restoring to neutral ph fa enhanced microbial inhibition and greatly promoted nitrite accumulation reactive inhibition dominated in acid range ph 7 which only impeded the occurrence of aop but not impaired the activity of nitrifiers its effect was time independent and reversible the mechanism was reasonably clarified from h transport because aop produced h whilst nop involved no h production the h transport was impeded under acid stress because the ph gradient across cell membrane decreased with ph the two inhibitory mechanisms formed a

15123,ph is a crucial factor of microbial nitrification which often combines with high strength ammonium to influence nitrogen removal pathway in wastewater treatment however the detailed inhibitory mechanisms of ph stress are not sufficiently disclosed yet in this study the ph stress effect on nitrification was comprehensively studied by a set of experiments which identified the reactivity of nitrification processes and activity of nitrifiers the time dependence of inhibition effect and the hybrid ph stress effect with ammonium the results revealed two distinct inhibitory mechanisms dominating in alkaline and acid ranges in alkaline range ph 8 ph stress causes physiological damages on microorganisms which is named as microbial inhibition it has the features of less recoverability of nitrifiers time dependent inhibition effect and low ph tolerance of nitrite oxidation bacteria free ammonia enhanced microbial inhibition and greatly promoted nitrite accumulation a novel reactive inhibition mechanism dominated in acid range ph 7 was disclosed it only impedes ammonia oxidation process aop but not impair microbial activity obviously and the effect is time independent the mechanism was clarified from h transport because aop involved h production the h transport was impeded under acid stress owing to the decrease of ph gradient across cell membrane the two mechanisms formed a panoramic view of ph stress effect on nitrification advancing the understanding of nitrifier adaptability and nitritation regulation in wastewater treatment processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrification ph stress effect reactive inhibition microbial inhibition free ammonia data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrification is an indispensable process for biological nitrogen removal bnr and its product distribution no3 no2 determines the categories of bnr such as conventional nitrification denitrification nitritation denitritation and partial nitritation anammox li et al 2020a ronan et al 2021 wang et al 2021b ph is a key factor of nitrification which not only influences nitrifying rates and product distribution zheng et al 2018 but also changes microbial community in a long term operation tripathi et al 2018 wang et al 2021a it often varies severely in wastewater treatment process and oversteps the ph range of 7 8 because of the h oh productions involved in nitrification denitrification fermentation and hydrolysis khin and annachhatre 2004 yu et al 2021 zhang et al 2007 therefore understanding the adaptability of nitrifiers and the inhibition effect under ph stress is crucial to ph manipulation for avoiding or stimulating nitrite accumulations in bnr this is also of interest in geochemical nitrogen cycle in soil and ecology baggs et al 2010 jeschke et al 2013 levy booth et al 2014 despite great efforts the comprehensive view about ph stress effect on nitrification has not been adequately formed yet nitrification is commonly treated as a two step process including ammonia oxidation process to nitrite aop implemented by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and the subsequent nitrite oxidation process nop implemented by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob one problem is that the reaction rates reactivities of aop and nop are not equivalent to the activities of aob and nob generally the inhibition effects on nitrifiers are evaluated by measuring aop and nop reactivities antoniou et al 1990 bae et al 2001 park et al 2007 which may lead to diverse conclusions for the common bnr processes le et al 2019 reported that aob was completely inhibited at ph 5 0 however nitrification was completely ceased at ph below 6 0 fumasoli et al 2017 ruiz et al 2003 zhang et al 2015 reported that both aob and nob were strongly inhibited with the ph decrease to ph 6 5 cytryn et al 2012 found that aob was more sensitive to acidification than nob the cessation of aop and nop does not imply inactivation of aob and nob in some particular cases we think that the activities of aob and nob should be further evaluated by restoring ph stresses to neutral conditions namely recovery experiments if ph stress does not obviously impair the activity of nitrifiers they will react immediately in the recovery experiments and show high recoverability the time dependence of inhibition effect is another key problem of ph stress effect on nitrifications typically the inhibition effect on microorganisms is time dependent because the variations of physiological function microbial community and adaptability require time it can be divided into three time scales the transient inhibition indicating the effect on reaction occurrence grunditz and dalhammar 2001 the short term inhibition few days revealing the effect on microbes and the long term inhibition showing the adaptations of nitrifiers daebeler et al 2020 in this regard we designed steady state inhibition experiments and transient inhibition experiments to reveal the time dependence free ammonia fa and free nitrous acid fna are two well known inhibition factors of microorganisms duan et al 2019 li et al 2020b wei et al 2017 zhou et al 2011 of them ammonium rich wastewaters are frequently encountered in bnr such as the livestock wastewater and landfill leachate nagarajan et al 2019 ren et al 2022 ren et al 2021 since fa concentration depends on ph and increases fast at a ph range of 8 10 liu et al 2019 ph stress effect in alkaline range usually couples with fa inhibition which has been an important approach for nitritation start up sun et al 2021 vadivelu et al 2007 in accordance with the above problems we designed a set of experiments to comprehensively investigate the ph stress effect on nitrification from i reactivities of aop and nop under ph stress ii recoverability of aob and nob iii time dependence of inhibition effect and iv hybrid ph stress effect with ammonium the reactivities of aop and nop were investigated by both the full nitrification experiments beginning with ammonium and the stepwise experiments to accurately determine the reaction rate of nop recoverability was evaluated by comparing the reaction rates under ph stress and after restoring to neutral ph the dependence on time was investigated from the transient inhibition and steady state inhibition hybrid ph stress effect with ammonium was investigated by comparing the inhibition effect under low and high ammonia loads these comprehensive investigations finally uncovered two inhibitory mechanisms namely the reactive and microbial inhibitions dominating in acid and alkaline ranges respectively they formed a panoramic view of ph stress effect illustrating the observed inhibition features of common nitrification processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 nitrifying sludge cultivation in a pilot scale reactor to maintain nitrifying sludge homogeneity all batch tests fetched the sludge from a continuous flow pilot scale reactor 4 6 l operated for more than six months the inoculation sludge of this pilot scale reactor was taken from a real wwtps the synthetic wastewater applied for cultivation contains per liter 200 mg nh4 n 761 mg nh4cl 1000 mg na2hpo4 800 mg k2co3 and 1 ml trace element solution table s1 wang et al 2017 the influent flow was 12 ml min resulting in 1 43 0 54 mg l nh4 n 166 17 4 mg l no3 n and 0 96 1 17 mg l no2 n in effluent the reactor was maintained at ph 7 5 0 5 and temperature between 25 and 30 c 2 2 batch tests investigating ph stress effect on nitrification the ph stress effect on nitrification was performed by the batch tests using the glass bottles with a volume of 1 l the batch tests include four experiments steady state inhibition recovery experiments transient inhibition and stepwise experiments the reactivity of nitrification for all the experiments were measured with the same procedures as introduced below 2 2 1 measurments of nitrification process reactivity before the measurements the sludge in bottle reactors was washed twice using tap water to exclude the initial substrates the detailed washing procedures were in supporting information fig s1 then 500 ml nutrient solution containing 48 mg l nh4 n and buffer was added to the bottles the buffer concentrations were 0 04 m nah2po4 if applied for ph 8 0 and 0 02 m nahco3 and 0 02 m h3bo3 for ph 8 0 after that the total solution volume was diluted to 800 ml immediately resulting in an initial nh4 n concentration about 30 mg l and nitrification reaction began the bottles continuously aerated using an air pump to maintain dissolved oxygen do above 2 mg l and were stirred by a magnetic mixer at 1500 rpm the temperature was maintained at 30 1 in an incubator at the sampling times of 1 20 40 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 and 300 min 5 ml supernatants were sampled from the bottles and filtered with 0 45 μm membrane the solutions were conserved by adding 25 μl h3po4 1 1 for measuring nh4 n no3 n and no2 n concentrations the ph of bottle solutions was monitored and adjusted after every sampling operation the sludge concentrations at the beginning and end of the batch tests were measured and their averaged values were applied for kinetic parameter calculations the measured sludge concentrations were summarized in table s3 2 2 2 steady state inhibition experiments at low and high ammonium loads for each experiment 800 ml sludge taken from the pilot scale reactor was added to the glass bottles and was washed twice using tap water the detailed procedures were in supporting information fig s1 then the sludge was holded in the ph stress conditions for two days the nutrient solution was replaced every 24 h and the nitrogen source ammonium sulfate was added at 12th hours ph was adjusted every two hours from 8 00 to 23 00 the nutrient solution was the same with that in 2 2 1 except for the ammonium concentration the ammonium concentration at low load was 30 mg l nh4 n and at high load was 200 mg l nh4 n after the steady state inhibition period the nitrification reactivity under the ph stress conditions was measured acocrding to the method in 2 2 1 the inhibition experiments at low and high ammonium loads were investigated in a wide ph range where nitrifiers retain activity 2 2 3 recovery experiments after the steady state inhibition experiments above the reactivity was measured again on the next day by restoring ph to normal ph levels namely 7 0 for acid stress conditioins and 8 0 for alkaline stress conditions recoverability of aob and nob was evaluated by comparing the reactivities measured from the steady state inhibition experiments and the recovery experiments after the recovery experiments 5 ml sludge mixture was collected and stored at 80 c for further high throughput sequencing analysis 2 2 4 transient inhibition experiments at low ammonia load in this experiment 800 ml sludge taken from the pilot scale reactor was added to the glass bottles and was washed twice using tap water then the nitrification reactivity under a ph stress condition was measured immediately according to the method in 2 2 1 the dependence of inhibition effect on time was evaluated by comparing the reactivities measured from transient and steady state inhibition experiments 2 2 5 stepwise experiments the reactivity of nop is underestimated in full nitrification experiments when aop is the rate limiting step because the reaction rate of nop is limited by that of aop kowalchuk and stephen 2001 the real nop reactivity can be measured from the nitrification beginning with nitrite and hence we proposed the stepwise experiments the preparation procedures of this experiment was the same as those of transient inhibition experiments the reactivities of aop and nop were seperately measrued at first sodium nitrite was added to the bottle reactors to attain a intial no2 n concentration of 20 mg l only nop occurred in this stage and so the reactivity of nop can be accurately measrued after no2 n was completely depleted ammonium sulfate was added to attain 30 mg l nh4 n and then full nitrification prcoess occurred the reactivity of aop was determined in this stage 2 3 kinetic parameter determinations the reaction rates of aop and nop can be expressed by eqs 1 and 2 because no3 n is the only product of nop the reaction rate of nop equals the concentration variation of no3 n namely d s no 3 d t do is considered to be sufficient and its term is treated as a constant 1 d s nh 3 d t k nh 3 s nh 3 k nh 3 s nh 3 x a 2 d s no 3 d t k no 2 s no 2 k no 2 s no 2 x a where x a is the sludge concentration measured as suspended solid ss mg l s denotes the concentration of nitrogen species mgn l k denotes rate constant mgn gss h k denotes half saturation constant mg l and the subscripts nh3 no2 and no3 represent the species of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n to linearize eqs 1 and 2 we assumed that k nh3 and k no2 are negligible since they are very small typically smaller than 2 mg l daebel et al 2007 shaw et al 2013 the rate constants are expressed as follows after linearization 3 k nh 3 d s nh 3 d t x a 4 k no 2 d s no 3 d t x a for the full nitrifications beginning with nh4 n k nh3 and k no2 can be determined from the linear slopes of ammonium degradation curve vs time and nitrate accumulation curves vs time respectively in the case that aop is the rate limiting step namly no2 n accumulation is negligible the k no2 value determined by this way is a pseudo value because the reaction rate of nop is limited by that of aop note that k no2 is impossible to be accurately determined in this case even if the nonlinear fitting methods based on nitrification model is adopted so the k no2 values determined from full nitrification experiments are expressed as k no 2 to determine the exact k no2 values in this case partial nitrifications beginning with no2 n see stepwise experiments was conducted in accodance with eq 5 k no2 is determined from the linear slope of nitrite degradation curve vs time 5 k no 2 d s no 2 d t x a the nitrite accumulation rate nar at a sampling time t i was calculated using eq 6 to characterize the nitrifying degree and product distribution where t 0 denotes the first sampling time 6 nar t i s no 2 t i s no 2 t 0 s nh 3 t 0 s nh 3 t i fa concentration mgn l was calculated using eq 7 anthonisen et al 1976 where c tan is the total ammonium concentration mgn l 7 fa c tan 10 ph exp 6344 273 t 10 ph 2 4 analytical methods nh4 n no3 n no2 n and ss were measured according to standard methods library 2013 ph and temperature were measured using a multi parameter meter mettler toledo china do was monitored by a portable meter hq30d hach microbial communities and functional genes were investigated using the high throughput sequencing technology majorbio company shanghai china microbial samples were conducted to amplify the v4 and v5 regions of bacterial 16srrna genes using the primers 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcgg 3 and 907r 5 ccgtcaattcmtttragttt 3 yusoff et al 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactivity under single ph stress the reactivity measured from the steady state inhibition experiments under low ammonia load 30 mg l nh4 n was used to evaluate single ph stress effect and the results are shown in fig 1 the nh4 n concentration variations in acid conditions fig 1a showed a fast decrease of ammonia oxidation rate from ph 7 0 to 6 4 finally nitrification ceased completely at ph below 6 0 this observation was consistent with the previous reports kim et al 2007 zheng et al 2018 in alkaline conditions fig 1b the ammonia oxidation rate presented a sudden drop before ph 8 5 and a succedent slow attenuation trend as ph increased this ph dependent relationship of aop rate can be quantified as k nh3 vs ph in fig 1c where the k nh3 values were determined from the slopes of nh4 n concentration curves it was obvious that the aop had a wider working ph range in alkaline condition up to 9 7 than in acid condition only to 6 0 the no3 n concentration variations in fig 1d and e showed that no3 n accumulation trends were basically consistent with the nh4 n consuming trends in these full nitrification experiments pseudo rate constants of nop k no 2 can be determined from the slopes of no3 n concentration curves due to the equivalence between no3 n accumulation and no2 n oxidation the k no 2 vs ph relationship in fig 1f was similar to that of aop in fig 1c however the working ph range shrank to 9 5 revealing that nop was more sensitive to alkaline stress daebeler et al 2020 park et al 2007 overall under single ph stress nitrification had a working ph range of 6 0 9 7 ph 8 0 was the optimal condition and nop was more sensitive to alkaline stress 3 2 reactivity under hybrid ph stress the hybrid ph stress effect with ammonium were revealed by comparing the nitrification reactivity under low and high ammonia loads the results of steady state inhibition experiments under high ammonia load 200 mg l are shown in fig 2 following the methods in fig 1 k nh3 values were determined from the linear fittings in fig 2a and b and k no 2 values were determined from fig 2d and e the obtained ph dependent relationships of k nh3 and k no 2 were compared to those under single ph stress in fig 2c and f it showed that fa plays its role at ph above 7 0 where differences arose the fa concentration at ph 7 0 reached 1 6 mg l which has exhibited a detectable inhibition effect on nitrification vadivelu et al 2007 the fa concentration corresponding to all the experimental ph conditions were listed in table s2 in the near neutral range of 7 0 8 0 k nh3 and k no 2 increased obviously with ph in both single and hybrid ph stress conditions indicating that ph was a positive factor in this range nevertheless the promotion effect was relatively weaker than that under single ph stress the difference between them was due to the inhibition effect of fa zhang et al 2015 once ph larger than 8 0 ph turned into a negative factor too which together with fa presented a co inhibition effect on nitrification as shown by the enhanced inhibition effect at ph above 8 0 fig 2c and f accordingly the working ph range shrank to 9 4 from 9 7 in single ph stress importantly k no 2 dropped faster than k nh3 revealing that fa had a stronger inhibition effect on nop this is beneficial to short cut nitrogen removal via nitrite accumulations qian et al 2017 wang et al 2017 ph 8 0 was invariably the optimal condition for nitrification under both low and high ammonium loads which divided ph stress effect into two distinct parts 3 3 inhibition effect on nitrifiers revealing two inhibitory mechanisms after steady state inhibition experiments the remaining activity of nitrifiers was measured on the next day by restoring ph to normal ph levels recovery experiments the measured nh4 n and no3 n concentration curves are shown in fig s2 and s3 the recoverability of aob and nob was evaluated by comparing the rate constants of the two experiments as shown in fig 3 it was obviously different in the acid and alkaline ranges in alkaline range the reactivity of recovery experiments had similar decline trends to those of steady state experiments it indicated a relatively irreversible inhibition effect on microbial activity which may due to the physiological damage on microorganisms daebeler et al 2020 vadivelu et al 2007 under high ammonia load microbial activity impaired more severely than that in low ammonia load revealing that fa enhanced such microbial inhibition interestingly in acid range the reactivities of both aop and nop between 5 5 6 8 basically recovered to the normal levels at ph 7 0 the microbial activity was obviously inhibited only after ph decreased to 5 0 this phenomenon indicated a surprising conclusion that the inhibition effect in acid stress was highly reversible as long as the ph is not too acid to kill the microbes it referred that acid stress only hindered the reaction occurrence but not severely impaired the activity of nitrifiers to further verify the distinct inhibition effect in acid and alkaline ranges the sludge after the recovery experiments was collected for dominant bacteria community analysis the distributions and proportions of bacteria at genus level fig 4a showed that nitrospria and nitrosomonas were the predominant nitrifying bacteria in our experimental systems and their abundances varied with ph conditions the total proportions of nitrospria and nitrosomonas fig 4b in acid conditions 5 5 and 6 4 were almost identical or even higher than that of raw sludge samples reaching up to 18 1 41 7 it gave direct evidence that the acid stress had no obvious inhibition effect on nitrifiers themselves by contrast their proportions in alkaline conditions decreased to a low level about 3 3 7 5 this confirmed the physiological damage on nitrifiers caused by alkaline stress finally two distinct ph stress effects are uncovered namely the reactive inhibition on nitrification processes and the microbial inhibition on nitrifiers 3 4 transient inhibition effects of the two inhibitory mechanisms dependence of inhibition effect on time was investigated from the transient inhibition and steady state inhibition experiments the reactivity of transient inhibition experiemnts was measured immediately after regulating to a ph stress without extra exposure time the transient inhibition experiments in alkaline range ph 8 0 9 5 performed the full nitrification beginning with nh4 n fig s4 in fig 5a and b the determined rate constants k nh3 and k no 2 did not decreased remarkably under transient inhibition which had obvious difference comparing to those under steady state inhibition this supported that alkaline stress caused physiological damages on microorganisms and thus microbial inhibition effect was time dependent the transient inhibition effect in acid range ph 5 0 8 0 was investigated by stepwise experiments the reactivity of nop was measured first by only adding no2 and the results were shown in fig 5c after no2 was depleted the reactivity of aop was measured by adding nh4 and the results were shown in fig s5 this method enabled to determine the exact k no2 values from the slopes of no2 n concentration curves as shown in fig 5d k no2 maintained at a consistent level between ph 5 5 8 0 while k nh3 decreased fast with ph and approached zero at ph 6 0 the ph dependent relationship of k nh3 was highly consistent with that under steady state inhibition experiments fig 2c this indicated that the reactive inhibition effect was independent of time and verified that reactive inhibition influenced nitrification processes rather than nitrifiers furthermore it is surprising to find that nop was free from the effect of acid stress until ph 5 0 where microbial inhibition emerged the reactive inhibition only influenced the occurrence of aop therefore aop was the rate limiting step in acid stress conditions illustrating why nitrite accumulation was negligible gieseke et al 2006 tarre and green 2004 the mechanism that reactive inhibition only impedes aop can be reasonably explained by the proton transport within activated sludge flocs picone et al 2021 suzuki et al 1974 two moles of proton are produced from the oxidation of per ammonia eq 8 whilst proton is not involved in nop eq 9 thus proton transport was indispensable for aop to continually transfer h from microbial cells to extracellular matrix ciudad et al 2006 the ph gradient across the cell membrane was the driving force which decreased with ph this reasonably illustrates the fast drop of aop reactivity in acid range accordingly the phenomena that aop ceased completely at ph below 6 0 can be attributed to the reverse ph gradient formed in this ph range 8 nh 4 1 5 o 2 n o 2 2 h h 2 o 9 no 2 0 5 o 2 n o 3 3 5 ph stress effect on nitrite accumulation fig 6 shows the no2 n concentration curves under single and hybrid ph stress conditions no visible no2 n accumulation was observed in acid range fig 6a and d this was because nop was free from acid stress as illustrated in the stepwise experiments by contrast obvious no2 n accumulations were observed in alkaline range as shown by the 1 3 mg l no2 n at ph 8 5 in single ph stress fig 6b and by the 8 5 mg l no2 n at ph 8 8 in hybrid ph stress fig 6 e this was due to that nob was more sensitive to the inhibition effect than aob and fa enhanced this inhibition effect liu et al 2015 park et al 2007 furthermore nar was quantified from eq 6 as shown in fig 6c and f nar 1 denotes the nitritation from nh4 n to no2 n in comparison to single ph stress hybrid ph stress with fa greatly promoted nitrite accumulation nar dramatically increased at ph above 8 6 and reached maximum 1 0 at ph 9 0 which was namely the optimal condition for partial nitrification besides nar was shown to be time dependent and reached maximum at the time about 40 90 min revealing that retention time was also a key parameter regulating partial nitrification finally in terms of the ph stress effect on nitrite accumulation we learn that i the hybrid ph stress with fa at ph 8 8 9 0 is the optimal condition and ii controlling a small retention time of nitrification is necessary 3 6 a panoramic view of ph stress effect on nitrification based on the two inhibitory mechanisms a panoramic view of ph stress effect on nitrification was schemed in fig 7 microbial inhibition is due to the physiological damages on nitrifiers resulting from ph stress nitrifiers have a very wide ph tolerance range that ph is no less than 5 0 and no more than 9 7 low load and 9 4 high load as shown by the green line arrows beyond this range nitrifiers are killed the microbial inhibition dominates in alkaline range and has the features of i poor recoverability ii time dependent inhibition effect iii lower ph tolerance of nob than aob and iv hybrid ph stress effect with fa the microbial inhibition is crucial to nitrite accumulation as illustrated in inset b in fig 7 it enlarges the activity discrepancy between aob and nob for mainstream nitritation li et al 2020b ren et al 2021 and enriches aob in long term operations for sidestream treatment cogert et al 2019 yang et al 2018 reactive inhibition becomes dominant in acid range it only impedes the occurrence of aop and will not impair the activity of aob and nob obviously and its inhibition effect is time independent we formulate a novel mechanism for reactive inhibition inset a in fig 7 occurrence of aop is impeded due to the block of h transport from intracellular cell to outer solution in acid stress conditions nop is free from the effect as it involves no h production dependence of reactive inhibition effect on ph is relevant to the ph gradient across cell membrane because it is the driving force of h transport the inhibition effect grows fast before ph 6 0 as shown by the yellow line arrow since h transport is completely blocked by forming a reverse ph gradient the microbial inhibition in the acid range larger than ph 5 0 is insignificant thus the inhibition effect arises instantaneously under acid stress and is shown to be reversible for the activity of nitrifiers 5 conclusions in this study the ph stress effect on nitrification was comprehensively studied by steady state and recovery experiments under low and high ammonia loads transient inhibition experiments and stepwise experiments this allowed us to identify two distinct inhibitory mechanisms dominating in acid and alkaline range respectively an interesting reactive inhibition was disclosed which has rarely been recognized before nitrifiers had a wide ph tolerance range about 5 0 9 7 microbial inhibition dominated in alkaline range ph 8 and caused physiological damage on microorganisms which was time dependent nitrifier activity failed to recover after restoring to neutral ph fa enhanced microbial inhibition and greatly promoted nitrite accumulation reactive inhibition dominated in acid range ph 7 which only impeded the occurrence of aop but not impaired the activity of nitrifiers its effect was time independent and reversible the mechanism was reasonably clarified from h transport because aop produced h whilst nop involved no h production the h transport was impeded under acid stress because the ph gradient across cell membrane decreased with ph the two inhibitory mechanisms formed a panoramic view of ph stress effect and advanced our understanding of nitrifier adaptability and nitritation regulation in conventional bnr technologies credit authorship contribution statement xuehai

15124,residual flotation reagents in mineral processing wastewater can trigger severe ecological threats to the local groundwater if they are discharged without treatment metal free biochar induced persulfate advanced oxidation processes kcbc ps were used in this study to elucidate the degradation of aniline aerofloat aaf a typical flotation reagent in kcbc ps system aaf can be removed at low doses of catalyst kcbc 0 05 g l and oxidant ps 0 3 mm additions with high efficiency the analysis revealed the dominance of o2 among the identified reactive oxygen species ros which achieved deeper mineralization for the aaf degradation in the kcbc ps system the role of the electron transfer mechanism was equally important the importance was corroborated by the chemical quenching experiments electron spin resonance esr detection probe experiments and electrochemical analysis it benefited from the electron transfer mechanism in the kcbc ps system and exhibited a wide ph adaptation 3 5 11 and high resistance to inorganic anions for real mining wastewater treatment combined with theoretical calculations and other analyses the carbonyl group was deemed to be the active site of the non radical pathway of biochar while the site of the conversion of so4 to superoxide radicals by biochar activation represented a defect these findings revealed a synergistic effect of multiple active sites on ps activation in biochar based materials moreover the intermediate degradation products of aaf from mass spectrometry indicated a possible pathway through the density functional theory dft method which was effective in reducing the environmental toxicity of pollutants for the first time according to the t e s t software and seed germination experiments overall our study proposed a novel modification strategy for cost effective and environmentally friendly biochar based catalysts while also deepening our understanding of the mechanism of activation of persulfate by metal free carbon based materials graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biochar persulfate aniline aerofloat reactive oxygen species toxicity dft data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the total volume of non ferrous metal industry wastewater associated with mining industry arguably account for 30 of the global discharged wastewater it contains a large amount of excess organic reagents for collecting foaming activating inhibiting and dispersing etc kang et al 2017 li et al 2021a lin et al 2016 meng et al 2018 and must be therefore effectively treated given its extremely adverse impacts on the technical parameters of the flotation process or poses a serious threat to the ecosystem huang et al 2021 kang et al 2017 aniline aerofloat aaf dianilinodithiophosphoric acid c6h5nh 2pssh is a typical organic flotation collector used in mineral processing processes deng et al 2019 lin et al 2016 aaf is difficult to degrade naturally and is prone to generate toxic secondary pollutants posing high ecological risks given their high degradation efficiency and convenient operation in the treatment of organic polluted water persulfate ps based advanced oxidation processes aops are widely used in water treatment processes liang et al 2021 wu et al 2021 however the decomposition rate of persulfate ps is slow and must be accelerated by catalysts to produce reactive oxygen species cai et al 2021 wang and wang 2018 ye et al 2020 metal free carbon materials stand out with no metal leaching acid and alkali resistance and biocompatibility moreover they have been deemed as excellent catalysts for ps activation which are not inferior to traditional metal based catalysts sun et al 2012 yu et al 2020a yu et al 2020b of such materials biochar based materials clearly stand out with carbon sequestration potential which made them popular for achieving carbon neutralization and environmental pollution remediation although previous studies have unveiled the potential of biochar in ps activation for the treatment of polluted water ye et al 2020 yu et al 2020b the formation and transformation of reactive oxygen species ros in metal free biochar persulfate systems both remain unclear moreover the studies on the application potential of biochar ps systems in the remediation of polluted groundwater in mining areas are scanty in this light the biological toxicity and persistence of their intermediate products in the degradation process remained unexplored therefore the degradation mechanisms of aaf in metal free biochar ps systems and their pathways require thorough examination and evaluation this study mainly aimed to develop a metal free biochar ps system for the degradation of aaf in mining wastewater to this end we 1 evaluated the degradation pathway and the ross in the kcbc ps system 2 investigated the active sites of kcbc metal free biochar in our study in ps activation and their effects on ros formation 3 identified the oxidation products of aaf by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms and proposing the degradation pathways evaluated by dft calculation and 4 assessed the toxicity of degradation intermediates of aaf by seed germination experiments and t e s t software simulations 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of catalyst сoffee grounds were collected from a coffee chain brand they were subsequent dried and pyrolyzed at 300 c in a tube furnace the resulting black powders were mashed and shifted through 100 mesh and named coffee biochar the biochar modification method from previous studies was used in this study chen et al 2021 qu et al 2021 with some improvements in brief the koh and coffee biochar were mixed fully using a ball grinding mill droide pm 0 4 l shanghai while the mixture was pyrolyzed at 800 c for 2 h under n2 atmosphere the obtained powders were washed several times with 1 m hcl and deionized water to remove residual alkali the obtained biochar is hereafter referred to as kcbc detailed in text s1 for comparison the operation of coffee biochar except for koh modification is denoted as cbc 2 2 experimental procedures the catalytic degradation of kcbc or cbc was performed in a 100 ml flask in a thermostatic shaker at the shaking rate of 150 rpm the typical process was followed according to which the catalyst was 0 05 g l and the initial concentration of aaf was 20 mg l the final ps concentration in the system was 0 3 mm with the addition of a certain amount of ps stock solution to trigger the degradation reaction following the set sampling time the samples were subsequently filtered using 0 22 μm polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf disposable filters sodium thiosulfate was utilized for the termination reaction all experiments repeated at least three times 2 3 chemical reagents and analytical methods specific information on the materials and chemicals used is summarized in text s2 while the characterization methods are summarized in text s3 the residual concentration of aniline aerofloat aaf in solution was detected by high performance liquid chromatography hplc text s4 the degradation intermediates of aaf in kcbc ps system were pretreated text s5 and subsequently observed with gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms text s6 and ultra high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms text s7 electrochemical tests and galvanic oxidation processes were both utilized to elucidate the existence of the non radical pathway of the system text s8 the toxicity evaluation of aaf and its degradation products in the kcbc ps system were both performed using the toxicity estimation software tool t e s t program t e s t v 4 2 1 text s9 and phytotoxicity test text s10 2 4 theoretical calculation quantum chemistry related calculations were performed in gaussian 16 based on the density functional theory dft grimme et al 2011 hariharan and pople 1973 the geometry optimizations were conducted using the b3lyp functional with a 6 31g d basis set for all the atoms the transition states were performed using the same method and basis set they were also conducted to ensure that the transition state could connect two related minimums the structures were optimized and the high precision single point energies were evaluated using the m06 2x functional with a 6 311 g d p basis set for all atoms binkley et al 1980 yan and truhlar 2008 zhao and truhlar 2008 solvation effects were considered and the pcm implicit solvation model was applied to this end barone and cossi 1998 moreover the fukui function f r was introduced to analyze the vulnerable sites of the aaf these data were used to predict aaf sites during oxidation for post processing and visualization multiwfn 3 8 gaussview 6 0 and visual molecular dynamics vmd 1 9 3 were used humphrey et al 1996 lu and chen 2012 lu and chen 2020 the first principles calculations were performed using the vienna ab initio simulation package vasp within the generalized gradient approximation gga using the perdew burke ernzerhof functional note that the details of the theoretical calculations are summarized in text 11 12 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterizations first sem was used to characterize the morphology and structure of the kcbc and cbc as shown in supplementary fig s s1 as observed the surface of the cbc was smooth with few folds and nearly no holes the koh modification caused an apparent change in the microstructure of the kcbc while the pores of irregular sizes were identified in kcbc and their surfaces became rough the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and porosity distributions of cbc and kcbc are shown in supplementary fig s s2 as observed kcbc sbet 870 62 m2 g with abundant micropore and mesoporous structure supplementary fig s s2d exhibited a higher porosity than cbc sbet 235 20 m2 g which can be ascribed to the koh inserted and fixed in the pores after ball milling which further corroded the biochar thus expanding the surface area the gasses produced during pyrolysis including co and co2 played a pore forming role thereby inducing the replacement of the original mesopores and macropores with micropores the possible reactions are as follows 1 koh c biochar k h2 k2co3 2 k2co3 c biochar k2o 2co 3 k2o c biochar 2 k co 4 k2co3 k2o co2 5 k co2 k2o co supplementary fig s s2c shows that the adsorption desorption curve of kcbc matched that of the type i which corroborates its microporous structure the cbc curve revealed the type ii stemming from mesopores and macropore structures the pore distributions of the kcbc and cbc are presented in supplementary fig s s2d after the modification with koh the pore size of kcbc was mainly below 5 nm and the average pore size was 2 08 nm as indicated by table s1 moreover the micropore and mesopore volumes and areas of kcbc were 3 4 times that of cbc being driven by the koh corrosion during pyrolysis notably these findings are in line with the adsorption desorption curve moreover previous studies and the current results both indicate the koh activation can produce biochar with a high surface area and large micropores volume cai et al 2021 qu et al 2021 the results of elemental analysis and xps full spectra shown in supplementary fig s s3 indicate that the main elements of biochar derived from coffee grounds pyrolysis at high temperatures were c h and o accompanied by negligible n this pattern was further corroborated by the elemental analysis results table s2 fig 1 illustrates the analysis of the specific peak information of kcbc and cbc as observed four fitted peaks in the high resolution spectrum of c1s in kcbc were discerned fig 1a they were observed at 284 8 286 3 288 5 and 290 6 ev thus corresponding to c graphite c c c h c o epoxy and alkoxy bonds c o and π π shake up in the biochar structure respectively however no c o bonds were identified in the high resolution xps spectra of c1s and o1s of cbc the ftir spectra also indicated the low content of c o in cbc and its relative abundance in kcbc supplementary fig s s4 as carbonyl and ketone groups have demonstrated to be the active sites for triggering advanced oxidation processes the poorer catalytic performance of cbc with fewer functional groups than kcbc can be attributed to this pattern moreover koh modification during pyrolysis significantly enhanced the oxygen content and carbonyl ratio of the biochar fig 1 also shows that the decreased c o content in kcbc after ps activation progressed in the system thus suggesting that c o represented a potential active site for ps activation li et al 2021b liu et al 2020 xiao et al 2022 ps obtained electrons by approaching c o liu et al 2020 thus crossing the energy barrier to achieve activation eqs 6 8 furthermore the slightly increasing proportion of π π shake up in kcbc after the reaction may have stemmed from the small adsorption amount of aaf and the intermediate products they could be removed by simple ethanol washing to restore the catalytic degradation efficiency of kcbc supplementary fig s s5 the xrd results are shown in supplementary fig s s2a the broad diffraction peak at 20 25 was attributed to the amorphous carbon of biochar zhang et al 2019 after the modification the characteristic peak of amorphous carbon in biochar was slightly inconspicuous thus indicating that the crystal shape of the biochar became more prominent after the modification furthermore the carbon skeleton of the biochar was unveiled by the raman spectra the peaks located at 1350 cm 1 and 1585 cm 1 represented typical d and g bands respectively these peaks were attributed to the defect sites or disordered carbons and were associated with the in plane stretching vibration of the honeycomb like sp2 hybridized carbon moreover the 2d band 2680 cm 1 could signify a graphitic carbon the id ig and 2d band intensities of kcbc were found higher than those of cbc were highly porous kcbc may be obtained at the expense of graphitization in the biochar structure the id ig value is the proportion of the number and clusters of aromatic rings rather than the ratio of sp3 to sp2 components the increased intensity of the d peak can be attributed to the abundant pores of kcbc which are generally terminated by hydrogen bonds or hanging with other functional groups yu et al 2020b moreover no prominent difference between the id ig values of kcbc and cbc was discerned the high resolution transmission electron microscope hrtem supplementary fig s s6 further unveiled distinct lattice fringes with an interlayer spacing of 0 34 nm image of kcbc supplementary fig s s6b these results are consistent that of the 002 plane of graphite compared with cbc supplementary fig ss s6c and d the regular lattice arrangement further corroborated the high degree of graphitization of kcbc 3 2 evaluation of ps activation performance fig 2 c shows that only a negligible aaf removal proportion was discerned in the individual cbc ps and their combination systems furthermore kcbc exhibited a strong activation ability for ps decomposition with a weak adsorption ability with low material and ps contents the kcbc ps system exhibited high aaf degradation efficiency a slightly difference between the final degradation efficiency of adding the catalyst and oxidant to an aaf solution simultaneously was observed fig 2a ps was added to an aaf system with adsorption saturated kcbc fig 2b this may be attributed to the common active sites for adsorption and degradation of the kcbc ps system moreover the decreasing reaction rate of aaf in the cycling experiments confirmed the active site competition and irreversible structural changes in kcbc this can be attributed to the strong adsorption of some intermediates by kcbc which was further confirmed by the new peaks of n and p in the xps spectra of kcbc after the reaction supplementary fig s s3 aaf is a type of mining trapping agent for lead zinc sulfide ore it is usually utilized under weak alkalinity conditions with good selectivity the kcbc ps system exhibited good aaf degradation efficiency over a wide ph range as shown by fig 2d the pka of the aaf was calculated using acd labs acd percepta 14 52 0 table s3 shows that the amidogen nh and sulfhydryl sh of aaf were potential hydrogen ion donors thereby suggesting that the aaf molecule in the system at the initial ph is deprotonated and the aaf anion represented the main form supplementary fig s s7 illustrates the results of the zeta potentials of kcbc tested at different ph values as observed the isoelectric point value of kcbc was 8 7 thereby implying that kcbc was positively charged at ph 8 7 and negatively charged at ph 8 7 in the reaction system kcbc and aaf exhibited opposite electric properties and the accumulation of pollutants and persulfate ions from the solution to the surface of the material was beneficial to the reaction the slightly weakened degradation efficiency and kobs of the kcbc ps system at low ph initial ph 3 5 which decreased with the reaction was potentially driven by the lack of electrostatic attraction between the aaf molecule and kcbc because aaf is neutral the isoelectric point value of cbc 3 4 can be another reason for the low degradation efficiency of cbc ps system for aaf supplementary fig s s7 the actual oxidation capacity of sr aops is generally affected by the coexistence of substances such as anions and organic matter common anions in groundwater including h2po4 hpo4 2 hco3 and co3 2 and humic acid as the typical natural organic matter were selected to measure the anti interference ability for further evaluation given the configuration conditions of the simulated pollutant solution 300 mm na and cl were identified thereby implying that additional cl was not required the influence of other ions and matter on the anti jamming capability of the kcbc ps system was examined under these conditions it was found that all anions scarcely weakened the aaf degradation efficiency in the kcbc ps system which exhibited superior potential for application in highly saline water the degradation efficiency degradation rate and apparent rate constant kobs in kcbc ps with different conditions were further analyzed by spss the result shown in supplementary fig s s8 different initial ph of aaf solution or with the additional of anions influence the kcbc ps system has little effect on the degradation rate of kcbc ps system and has influence on the apparent rate constant the degradation efficiency of the kcbc ps system was significantly affected by the aaf solution deviation from the neutral ph supplementary fig s s9 but at the same initial ph of aaf kcbc ps system no significant difference results were found between the presence or absence of anions the suppression effect of humic acid can be attributed to the competition between ha and aaf on the kcbc surface 3 3 identification of ros to further elucidate the contributed ros in the kcbc ps system for aaf degradation meoh and ipa propan 2 ol two quenching scavengers were first applied for the quenching of so4 e so4 so4 2 2 60 v vs nhe and oh e oh oh 2 80 v vs nhe fig 3 a shows that a high proportion of meoh and ipa quenching agent ps 1000 1 only negligibly affected the kcbc ps system for aaf degradation analysis with the epr detection results and ultimately indicating the possible no effect of so4 and oh for aaf removal for contract there were nearly no free radicals so4 oh and o2 formation in cbc ps system supplementary fig s s13 the addition of dmso which had been used for surface bound radicals had no influence on the kcbc ps system to elucidate the possible non radical pathway of the kckc ps system l histidine was applied for the quenching of singlet oxygen 1o2 and 20 inhibition suggested that 1o2 played a limited role in the kcbc ps system the associated intermediate o2 which was quenched by 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 1 piperidinyloxy tempo was considered the predominant active substance in the quenching experiments fig 3a generally despite the formation of o2 was strongly correlated with that of 1o2 the inhibition by tempo was substantially stronger than that by l histidine or nan3 at the same molar concentration in the kcbc ps system furthermore a very weak three peak signal with equal intensity was ascribed to the generation of 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp however no distinct presence of o2 was observed by the nitro blue tetrazolium nbt colorimetric method text s13 and supplementary fig s s11 the esr capture experiment demonstrated that the formation of o2 in the kcbc ps system was rapid during the initial reaction stage supplementary fig s s12c as o2 is generally regarded as generated from excited oxygen molecules the kcbc ps aaf system may have significantly affected the atmospheric environment of the reaction system xiao et al 2022 supplementary fig s12a being a free radical o2 can act as an electron acceptor thus implying that and slight inhibition with the addition of nh4 2c2o4 may result from the capture of o2 in the reaction system wen et al 2022 unexpectedly there no distinct difference in the apparent rate constant and final removal efficiency was discerned between the n2 and o2 injection systems thus indicating that o2 did not participate in the ps activation process these findings further suggest that an oxidizing agent acted as a source of o2 rather than dissolved oxygen in the solution while non radical pathways still existed in the kcbc ps aaf system delocalized electrons are fundamentally closely related to o2 formation li et al 2021c massive carbon defects on the biochar were exacerbated by the koh activation process thus facilitating the generation of delocalized electrons at the defective sites the latter was attributed to o2 formation previous studies have confirmed that s2o8 2 can be adsorbed onto the carbonyl groups on the carbon surface to generate 1o2 after several reactions and there is a transformation between 1o2 and o2 cheng et al 2017 tian et al 2022 the contribution of o2 the main free radical for aaf degradation in kcbc ps system was calculated based on the research of zhang et al 2021 detailed in text s14 15 alternatively o2 can be formed by the hydrolysis of ps or monovalent reduction of o2 the o2 formation pathway may be based on the following reaction 6 c o s 2 o 8 2 c o s o 4 2 o 2 7 s 2 o 8 2 2 h 2 o h o 2 2 s o 4 2 3 h 8 h o 2 o 2 h 9 s 2 o 8 2 2 s o 4 10 s o 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 h o h 11 s 2 o 8 2 2 o h 2 s o 4 2 2 h o 2 12 o 2 o h 1 o 2 o h the consumption of ps in the different systems was monitored for a deeper understanding of kcbc ps mechanism fig 4 for the kcbc ps system the ps conversion rate was enhanced by the introduction of aaf which may have stemmed from the aaf acting as an electron acceptor and thus effectively initiating the electron transfer process moreover the difference in stoichiometric amounts between ps decomposition and so4 2 generation further unveiled the formation of kcbc ps complexes fig 4a wang et al 2019 overall these results indicate a non radical pathway in the kcbc ps aaf system 3 4 electron transfer pathway several researches demonstrated that the possibility relationship between the low effect of anions and water matrix and the existence of the nonradical pathway in ps based advanced oxidation system dou et al 2022 duan et al 2018 ho et al 2019 peng et al 2021 ye et al 2020 nonradical pathway in kcbc ps system contribute to for aaf degradation calculated based on the method which detailed in text s15 which is consistent with the result of the limit effect of anions to kcbc ps system for aaf degradation to evaluate the electron transfer pathway in the kcbc ps system given its highly oxidizing properties k2cro4 was used as an electron trapping agent in the photocatalytic field ye et al 2019 consequently a quenching effect has been proven in persulfate based advanced oxidation systems similar to that from a previous study yu et al 2020b an inhibitory effect on the kcbc ps aaf system somewhat indicated the possible existence of electron transport processes a mixing experiment on delayed pollutant addition was further conducted for investigation supplementary fig s s14b shows that the removal rate of aaf was slightly weakened with the increase of the time interval of delayed contaminant addition even after the addition time of the pollutants was extended to 10 min the removal rate of aaf remained at 50 thus indicating that the bridging mediation of the kcbc ps system was the main contributor to aaf degradation and biochar coordinated the direct transfer of electrons from pollutants to oxidant molecules the ps electrophilic molecules were pre adsorbed on the carbon skeleton of the biochar based catalyst to form a carbon ps complex thus causing the electronic rearrangement while subsequently prolonging and weakening the o o bond on the ps molecule and ultimately activating it to a metastable state fig 3c g h once an electron rich pollutant was added the pollutant molecule as the electron donor directly reacted with the metastable ps as the electron acceptor under the mediation of kcbc the radical quenching experiment indicated that non radical degradation pathways with enhanced electron transfer could occur in this kcbc ps aaf system a series of electrochemical experiments was further performed to identify and measure the electron transfer capacity of kcbc fig 3d illustrates that a smaller arc radius in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis detection was discerned for kcbc instead of cbc thereby revealing the reduced charge transfer resistance and improved electronic conductivity for kcbc moreover the interaction and electron rearrangement between ps and the biochar based catalyst were further evaluated by the i t curves fig 3e the addition of ps or aaf only slightly affected the chronoamperometric current output of the cbc electrode significant current responses were discerned in the kcbc system after the injection of ps and aaf they can be attributed to the strong interactions between the catalyst oxidizing agent and aaf thereby resonating with the linear sweep voltammetry lsv results shown in fig 3f the increased current in the binary and ternary systems implies the formation of a metastable reactive complex during the reaction moreover an electronic flow occurred from the aaf to the surface of kcbc in the kcbc ps aaf system thereby indicating an accelerated oxidation reaction and fast electron transfer on kcbc and the importance of a coexisting reaction during this process the addition of aaf provided some electrons to accelerate the oxidation reaction thus inducing the current increase in situ raman spectra were used to reveal the presence or absence of surface confined species described above chen et al 2019 dou et al 2022 ren et al 2019 the peaks of s2o8 2 were identified at 837 and 1076 cm 1 and the peak centered at 820 cm 1 stemmed from the vibration of the prolonged o o bonds denoted as s2o8 2 virtually the only peaks discerned in the ps the peak at 982 cm 1 can be ascribed to so4 2 fig 3c thus indicating a certain self decomposition phenomenon moreover the intensity increased with the addition of kcbc into the ps solution and the kcbc ps aaf system while the peak intensity of s2o8 2 was the weakest and the metastable kcbc ps intermediate was relatively strong in the presence of aaf in the kcbc ps system however the intensity of the so4 2 peak increased and that of the s2o8 2 peak decreased being potentially driven by the consumption of ps for aaf degradation during the electron transfer in this process the activated ps with a prolonged peroxide o o bond exhibited a higher activity to subtract electrons from the electron donor aaf thereby yielding the breakup of the o o bond and decomposition into so4 2 ren et al 2019 furthermore kcbc mediated electron transfer from aaf to ps may also contribute to aaf oxidation the galvanic oxidation process gop device consisted of two half cells connected by an agarose bridge and an ammeter was applied to connect two graphite electrodes loaded with kcbc thus elucidating the current during the reaction in this way fig 3g two half cells were used to separate the ps and aaf solutions whereas the electron transfer pathway rather than other radical pathways was further confirmed fig 3h and i revealed no distinct current or aaf degradation in the control system without ps however a significant increase in the current was discerned in the kcbc and aaf coexisting systems furthermore the current value quickly reached a maximum and then gradually declined throughout the reaction these findings agree well with the competition kinetics experiments namely with the addition of kcro4 in which the kcbc enhanced the non radical electron transfer pathway although a similar result was obtained from the ps only system the maximum current of the kcbc and aaf coexisting system was six times higher than that of the ps system alone at the same time the aaf oxidation efficiency in the gop system was found to be 70 with few adsorption phenomena observed thereby indicating that aaf can be oxidized by direct electron transfer to further evaluate the potential reactive sites and key ros formation progress in the kcbc ps system the vienna ab initio simulation package vasp was used and the structure of biochar was simplified in further discussion momma and izumi 2011 note that the detailed computational method is summarized in text s12 the conversion pathways of sulfate radicals into other reactive oxygen species ros especially oh and ooh were investigated to this end the gibbs free energies of the reactions were calculated under different conditions the reaction occurring on the surface of the catalyst can be divided into the following successive reactions 13 o 2 h 2 o e o o h o h 14 o o h e o o h 15 o h 2 o e o h o h 16 o 2 2 h 2 o 4 e 4 o h by considering the electron transfer efficiency in the simplified biochar structure the system work function decreased in the presence of sulfate radicals this indicates the enhanced electron conductivity which promoted the electron transfer during the activation of ps fig 5 c and d the gibbs free energies calculated for the reaction processed described in eq s 13 16 were used to elucidate the effect of the conversion and catalytic process of reactive oxygen species in the presence or absence of so4 at the two active sites carbonyl or vacant sites on the simplified biochar structure the presence of sulfate radicals can significantly reduce the energy of the system thereby weakening the energy barrier of the decisive step and play a role in promoting the reaction fig 5 as shown in fig 5b the presence of so4 facilitated the formation of other reactive oxygen species around the vacancies of the simplified biochar structure and promotes the above reaction processes these results indicate that biochar based materials can provide abundant active sites not only for persulfate activation but also for the transformation of ros furthermore ps assisted in the formation of oxygen intermediates and also weakened the energy barrier of the catalytic reaction cycle these active sites exhibited combined effects on ros formation and conversion in the kcbc ps system 3 5 identification of degradation products and possible pathways total organic carbon toc measurements were further analyzed to estimate the mineralization efficiency of the aaf kcbc ps system supplementary fig s s15 shows that the aaf mineralization efficiency was 75 thereby indicating that the kcbc ps system demonstrated excellent mineralization ability for aaf degradation this also suggests that some intermediates were generated alongside the mineralization into co2 and h2o in the advanced oxidation process furthermore the generated anions po4 3 and no3 can also indicate the complete mineralization of some aaf in the kcbc ps system supplementary fig s s16 on this basis the intermediate degradation of aaf in the kcbc ps system was analyzed using gc ms fu et al 2021 given the possible thermal decomposition of aaf from the injection port of the gc ms at high temperature lc ms was used for the following analysis as well the intermediate byproducts that were detected are summarized in table s5 theoretical calculations were used to unveil the aaf degradation pathways in the kcbc ps system fundamentally the fukui function is an efficient widely used method that relies on the gaussian software to predict reactive sites for different radicals the optimized chemical structure of the aaf is shown in fig 6 a as seen the electrophilic f radical f0 and nucleophilic f values theoretically revealed the relative activity of each atom in an aaf molecule the fukui function value of f which can be used to predict the molecular reactivity to radicals attacked by o2 was the only electrophilic species detected in this study the highest f electrophilic attack values of aaf were 2s 0 2252 being followed by 3s 0 698 and 6 n 0 0686 they were susceptible to attack by o2 a specific atom with a high condensed dual descriptors cdd value generally exhibits the higher reactivity at the molecular sites as depicted in fig 6d the 2s atom 0 0795 and 6 n 0 0568 exhibited lower cdd value and were closely surrounded by the negative isosurface of the fukui index which indicates that they are priority sites which is consistent with the conclusion of the fukui function therefore in our study the most probable reaction sites of aaf in the kcbc ps system were around the 1p atom fig 6b and c also illustrate the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo and highest occupied molecular orbital homo of the aaf molecule this pattern implies that the regions that can easily lose add electrons for attack by electrophilic nucleophilic species as clearly presented the homo of aaf was mainly located on the n atom of the piperazine ring s atom and c atoms in the benzene ring associated with n and s in our study aniline tp1 is supposed to be the initial decomposition product of aaf in kckc ps system with the formation of some low molecular weight intermediates containing phosphorus or sulfur tp8 subsequent oxidation was carried out to form the intermediates which are benzene ring substitutes tp2 5 furthermore some of them were subsequently mineralized and anions were formed through subsequent oxidation forms straight chain products tp7 the possible degradation pathways of aaf using the kcbc ps system are demonstrated in supplementary fig s s16 by benefiting from the narrow energy gap of kcbc the electrons localized at the highest occupied molecular orbital homo 6 355 ev of aaf can be readily transferred to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo 1 096 ev of the metastable ps complex via the carbon tunnel driven by a potential energy difference this in turn triggers the ps decomposition during which the ps abstracts two electrons from the aaf instead of acting as a one electron oxidant to generate so4 these findings in synergy with the aforementioned results from previous sections point on a possible mechanism for aff oxidation in the kcbc ps system more specifically the possible activation pathways are 17 s 2 o 8 2 2 e f r o m a a f 2 s o 4 2 the toxicity estimation software tool t e s t shown in fig 7 a f is based on the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar t e s t was further used to evaluate the degradation intermediates of aaf in the kcbc ps system and demonstrated that nearly all the degradation intermediates were not harmful to acute toxicity in aquatic organisms fathead minnow lc50 96 h daphnia magna lc50 48 h and t pyriformis igc50 48 h moreover there no bioaccumulation or genotoxicity of the assessed degradation intermediates was discerned where only some intermediates exhibited developmental toxicity furthermore chinese cabbage seed germination and radicle length shown in fig 7g h were applied evaluate the toxicity of the intermediates in the kcbc ps system the kcbc ps system can eliminate the toxicity of aaf on the seed germination rate base on the statistical analysis using spss statistics 26 4 conclusion to conclude this study proposed the large scale preparation of metal free biochar based materials that activate persulfate for the degradation of aaf the kcbc ps system exhibited high removal efficiency of aaf at low doses of catalyst kcbc 0 05 g l and oxidant ps 0 3 mm additions in the kcbc ps system o2 was found the dominant reactive oxygen species which yielded high mineralization rates of 70 moreover the existing electron transfer mechanism provided a good resistance to co existing ions in the environment koh activation endows the biochar with abundant carbonyl functional groups and defective structures as effective active sites for electron transfer pathways and superoxide radical formation respectively moreover it highlights their role in the reactive oxygen species formation and conversion according to the characterization analyses results including xps electrochemistry electrooxidation and in situ raman testing and theoretical calculations the intermediate degradation products and possible degradation pathways of aaf were inferred by calculating the attacked sites of aaf in the system using dft combined with mass spectrometry analysis we further combined the software and seed the germination experiments to elucidate the efficiency in reducing the environmental toxicity of pollutants our study proposed a modification strategy for cost effective and environmentally friendly biochar based catalysts while also broadening the

15124,residual flotation reagents in mineral processing wastewater can trigger severe ecological threats to the local groundwater if they are discharged without treatment metal free biochar induced persulfate advanced oxidation processes kcbc ps were used in this study to elucidate the degradation of aniline aerofloat aaf a typical flotation reagent in kcbc ps system aaf can be removed at low doses of catalyst kcbc 0 05 g l and oxidant ps 0 3 mm additions with high efficiency the analysis revealed the dominance of o2 among the identified reactive oxygen species ros which achieved deeper mineralization for the aaf degradation in the kcbc ps system the role of the electron transfer mechanism was equally important the importance was corroborated by the chemical quenching experiments electron spin resonance esr detection probe experiments and electrochemical analysis it benefited from the electron transfer mechanism in the kcbc ps system and exhibited a wide ph adaptation 3 5 11 and high resistance to inorganic anions for real mining wastewater treatment combined with theoretical calculations and other analyses the carbonyl group was deemed to be the active site of the non radical pathway of biochar while the site of the conversion of so4 to superoxide radicals by biochar activation represented a defect these findings revealed a synergistic effect of multiple active sites on ps activation in biochar based materials moreover the intermediate degradation products of aaf from mass spectrometry indicated a possible pathway through the density functional theory dft method which was effective in reducing the environmental toxicity of pollutants for the first time according to the t e s t software and seed germination experiments overall our study proposed a novel modification strategy for cost effective and environmentally friendly biochar based catalysts while also deepening our understanding of the mechanism of activation of persulfate by metal free carbon based materials graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biochar persulfate aniline aerofloat reactive oxygen species toxicity dft data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the total volume of non ferrous metal industry wastewater associated with mining industry arguably account for 30 of the global discharged wastewater it contains a large amount of excess organic reagents for collecting foaming activating inhibiting and dispersing etc kang et al 2017 li et al 2021a lin et al 2016 meng et al 2018 and must be therefore effectively treated given its extremely adverse impacts on the technical parameters of the flotation process or poses a serious threat to the ecosystem huang et al 2021 kang et al 2017 aniline aerofloat aaf dianilinodithiophosphoric acid c6h5nh 2pssh is a typical organic flotation collector used in mineral processing processes deng et al 2019 lin et al 2016 aaf is difficult to degrade naturally and is prone to generate toxic secondary pollutants posing high ecological risks given their high degradation efficiency and convenient operation in the treatment of organic polluted water persulfate ps based advanced oxidation processes aops are widely used in water treatment processes liang et al 2021 wu et al 2021 however the decomposition rate of persulfate ps is slow and must be accelerated by catalysts to produce reactive oxygen species cai et al 2021 wang and wang 2018 ye et al 2020 metal free carbon materials stand out with no metal leaching acid and alkali resistance and biocompatibility moreover they have been deemed as excellent catalysts for ps activation which are not inferior to traditional metal based catalysts sun et al 2012 yu et al 2020a yu et al 2020b of such materials biochar based materials clearly stand out with carbon sequestration potential which made them popular for achieving carbon neutralization and environmental pollution remediation although previous studies have unveiled the potential of biochar in ps activation for the treatment of polluted water ye et al 2020 yu et al 2020b the formation and transformation of reactive oxygen species ros in metal free biochar persulfate systems both remain unclear moreover the studies on the application potential of biochar ps systems in the remediation of polluted groundwater in mining areas are scanty in this light the biological toxicity and persistence of their intermediate products in the degradation process remained unexplored therefore the degradation mechanisms of aaf in metal free biochar ps systems and their pathways require thorough examination and evaluation this study mainly aimed to develop a metal free biochar ps system for the degradation of aaf in mining wastewater to this end we 1 evaluated the degradation pathway and the ross in the kcbc ps system 2 investigated the active sites of kcbc metal free biochar in our study in ps activation and their effects on ros formation 3 identified the oxidation products of aaf by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms and proposing the degradation pathways evaluated by dft calculation and 4 assessed the toxicity of degradation intermediates of aaf by seed germination experiments and t e s t software simulations 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of catalyst сoffee grounds were collected from a coffee chain brand they were subsequent dried and pyrolyzed at 300 c in a tube furnace the resulting black powders were mashed and shifted through 100 mesh and named coffee biochar the biochar modification method from previous studies was used in this study chen et al 2021 qu et al 2021 with some improvements in brief the koh and coffee biochar were mixed fully using a ball grinding mill droide pm 0 4 l shanghai while the mixture was pyrolyzed at 800 c for 2 h under n2 atmosphere the obtained powders were washed several times with 1 m hcl and deionized water to remove residual alkali the obtained biochar is hereafter referred to as kcbc detailed in text s1 for comparison the operation of coffee biochar except for koh modification is denoted as cbc 2 2 experimental procedures the catalytic degradation of kcbc or cbc was performed in a 100 ml flask in a thermostatic shaker at the shaking rate of 150 rpm the typical process was followed according to which the catalyst was 0 05 g l and the initial concentration of aaf was 20 mg l the final ps concentration in the system was 0 3 mm with the addition of a certain amount of ps stock solution to trigger the degradation reaction following the set sampling time the samples were subsequently filtered using 0 22 μm polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf disposable filters sodium thiosulfate was utilized for the termination reaction all experiments repeated at least three times 2 3 chemical reagents and analytical methods specific information on the materials and chemicals used is summarized in text s2 while the characterization methods are summarized in text s3 the residual concentration of aniline aerofloat aaf in solution was detected by high performance liquid chromatography hplc text s4 the degradation intermediates of aaf in kcbc ps system were pretreated text s5 and subsequently observed with gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms text s6 and ultra high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms text s7 electrochemical tests and galvanic oxidation processes were both utilized to elucidate the existence of the non radical pathway of the system text s8 the toxicity evaluation of aaf and its degradation products in the kcbc ps system were both performed using the toxicity estimation software tool t e s t program t e s t v 4 2 1 text s9 and phytotoxicity test text s10 2 4 theoretical calculation quantum chemistry related calculations were performed in gaussian 16 based on the density functional theory dft grimme et al 2011 hariharan and pople 1973 the geometry optimizations were conducted using the b3lyp functional with a 6 31g d basis set for all the atoms the transition states were performed using the same method and basis set they were also conducted to ensure that the transition state could connect two related minimums the structures were optimized and the high precision single point energies were evaluated using the m06 2x functional with a 6 311 g d p basis set for all atoms binkley et al 1980 yan and truhlar 2008 zhao and truhlar 2008 solvation effects were considered and the pcm implicit solvation model was applied to this end barone and cossi 1998 moreover the fukui function f r was introduced to analyze the vulnerable sites of the aaf these data were used to predict aaf sites during oxidation for post processing and visualization multiwfn 3 8 gaussview 6 0 and visual molecular dynamics vmd 1 9 3 were used humphrey et al 1996 lu and chen 2012 lu and chen 2020 the first principles calculations were performed using the vienna ab initio simulation package vasp within the generalized gradient approximation gga using the perdew burke ernzerhof functional note that the details of the theoretical calculations are summarized in text 11 12 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterizations first sem was used to characterize the morphology and structure of the kcbc and cbc as shown in supplementary fig s s1 as observed the surface of the cbc was smooth with few folds and nearly no holes the koh modification caused an apparent change in the microstructure of the kcbc while the pores of irregular sizes were identified in kcbc and their surfaces became rough the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and porosity distributions of cbc and kcbc are shown in supplementary fig s s2 as observed kcbc sbet 870 62 m2 g with abundant micropore and mesoporous structure supplementary fig s s2d exhibited a higher porosity than cbc sbet 235 20 m2 g which can be ascribed to the koh inserted and fixed in the pores after ball milling which further corroded the biochar thus expanding the surface area the gasses produced during pyrolysis including co and co2 played a pore forming role thereby inducing the replacement of the original mesopores and macropores with micropores the possible reactions are as follows 1 koh c biochar k h2 k2co3 2 k2co3 c biochar k2o 2co 3 k2o c biochar 2 k co 4 k2co3 k2o co2 5 k co2 k2o co supplementary fig s s2c shows that the adsorption desorption curve of kcbc matched that of the type i which corroborates its microporous structure the cbc curve revealed the type ii stemming from mesopores and macropore structures the pore distributions of the kcbc and cbc are presented in supplementary fig s s2d after the modification with koh the pore size of kcbc was mainly below 5 nm and the average pore size was 2 08 nm as indicated by table s1 moreover the micropore and mesopore volumes and areas of kcbc were 3 4 times that of cbc being driven by the koh corrosion during pyrolysis notably these findings are in line with the adsorption desorption curve moreover previous studies and the current results both indicate the koh activation can produce biochar with a high surface area and large micropores volume cai et al 2021 qu et al 2021 the results of elemental analysis and xps full spectra shown in supplementary fig s s3 indicate that the main elements of biochar derived from coffee grounds pyrolysis at high temperatures were c h and o accompanied by negligible n this pattern was further corroborated by the elemental analysis results table s2 fig 1 illustrates the analysis of the specific peak information of kcbc and cbc as observed four fitted peaks in the high resolution spectrum of c1s in kcbc were discerned fig 1a they were observed at 284 8 286 3 288 5 and 290 6 ev thus corresponding to c graphite c c c h c o epoxy and alkoxy bonds c o and π π shake up in the biochar structure respectively however no c o bonds were identified in the high resolution xps spectra of c1s and o1s of cbc the ftir spectra also indicated the low content of c o in cbc and its relative abundance in kcbc supplementary fig s s4 as carbonyl and ketone groups have demonstrated to be the active sites for triggering advanced oxidation processes the poorer catalytic performance of cbc with fewer functional groups than kcbc can be attributed to this pattern moreover koh modification during pyrolysis significantly enhanced the oxygen content and carbonyl ratio of the biochar fig 1 also shows that the decreased c o content in kcbc after ps activation progressed in the system thus suggesting that c o represented a potential active site for ps activation li et al 2021b liu et al 2020 xiao et al 2022 ps obtained electrons by approaching c o liu et al 2020 thus crossing the energy barrier to achieve activation eqs 6 8 furthermore the slightly increasing proportion of π π shake up in kcbc after the reaction may have stemmed from the small adsorption amount of aaf and the intermediate products they could be removed by simple ethanol washing to restore the catalytic degradation efficiency of kcbc supplementary fig s s5 the xrd results are shown in supplementary fig s s2a the broad diffraction peak at 20 25 was attributed to the amorphous carbon of biochar zhang et al 2019 after the modification the characteristic peak of amorphous carbon in biochar was slightly inconspicuous thus indicating that the crystal shape of the biochar became more prominent after the modification furthermore the carbon skeleton of the biochar was unveiled by the raman spectra the peaks located at 1350 cm 1 and 1585 cm 1 represented typical d and g bands respectively these peaks were attributed to the defect sites or disordered carbons and were associated with the in plane stretching vibration of the honeycomb like sp2 hybridized carbon moreover the 2d band 2680 cm 1 could signify a graphitic carbon the id ig and 2d band intensities of kcbc were found higher than those of cbc were highly porous kcbc may be obtained at the expense of graphitization in the biochar structure the id ig value is the proportion of the number and clusters of aromatic rings rather than the ratio of sp3 to sp2 components the increased intensity of the d peak can be attributed to the abundant pores of kcbc which are generally terminated by hydrogen bonds or hanging with other functional groups yu et al 2020b moreover no prominent difference between the id ig values of kcbc and cbc was discerned the high resolution transmission electron microscope hrtem supplementary fig s s6 further unveiled distinct lattice fringes with an interlayer spacing of 0 34 nm image of kcbc supplementary fig s s6b these results are consistent that of the 002 plane of graphite compared with cbc supplementary fig ss s6c and d the regular lattice arrangement further corroborated the high degree of graphitization of kcbc 3 2 evaluation of ps activation performance fig 2 c shows that only a negligible aaf removal proportion was discerned in the individual cbc ps and their combination systems furthermore kcbc exhibited a strong activation ability for ps decomposition with a weak adsorption ability with low material and ps contents the kcbc ps system exhibited high aaf degradation efficiency a slightly difference between the final degradation efficiency of adding the catalyst and oxidant to an aaf solution simultaneously was observed fig 2a ps was added to an aaf system with adsorption saturated kcbc fig 2b this may be attributed to the common active sites for adsorption and degradation of the kcbc ps system moreover the decreasing reaction rate of aaf in the cycling experiments confirmed the active site competition and irreversible structural changes in kcbc this can be attributed to the strong adsorption of some intermediates by kcbc which was further confirmed by the new peaks of n and p in the xps spectra of kcbc after the reaction supplementary fig s s3 aaf is a type of mining trapping agent for lead zinc sulfide ore it is usually utilized under weak alkalinity conditions with good selectivity the kcbc ps system exhibited good aaf degradation efficiency over a wide ph range as shown by fig 2d the pka of the aaf was calculated using acd labs acd percepta 14 52 0 table s3 shows that the amidogen nh and sulfhydryl sh of aaf were potential hydrogen ion donors thereby suggesting that the aaf molecule in the system at the initial ph is deprotonated and the aaf anion represented the main form supplementary fig s s7 illustrates the results of the zeta potentials of kcbc tested at different ph values as observed the isoelectric point value of kcbc was 8 7 thereby implying that kcbc was positively charged at ph 8 7 and negatively charged at ph 8 7 in the reaction system kcbc and aaf exhibited opposite electric properties and the accumulation of pollutants and persulfate ions from the solution to the surface of the material was beneficial to the reaction the slightly weakened degradation efficiency and kobs of the kcbc ps system at low ph initial ph 3 5 which decreased with the reaction was potentially driven by the lack of electrostatic attraction between the aaf molecule and kcbc because aaf is neutral the isoelectric point value of cbc 3 4 can be another reason for the low degradation efficiency of cbc ps system for aaf supplementary fig s s7 the actual oxidation capacity of sr aops is generally affected by the coexistence of substances such as anions and organic matter common anions in groundwater including h2po4 hpo4 2 hco3 and co3 2 and humic acid as the typical natural organic matter were selected to measure the anti interference ability for further evaluation given the configuration conditions of the simulated pollutant solution 300 mm na and cl were identified thereby implying that additional cl was not required the influence of other ions and matter on the anti jamming capability of the kcbc ps system was examined under these conditions it was found that all anions scarcely weakened the aaf degradation efficiency in the kcbc ps system which exhibited superior potential for application in highly saline water the degradation efficiency degradation rate and apparent rate constant kobs in kcbc ps with different conditions were further analyzed by spss the result shown in supplementary fig s s8 different initial ph of aaf solution or with the additional of anions influence the kcbc ps system has little effect on the degradation rate of kcbc ps system and has influence on the apparent rate constant the degradation efficiency of the kcbc ps system was significantly affected by the aaf solution deviation from the neutral ph supplementary fig s s9 but at the same initial ph of aaf kcbc ps system no significant difference results were found between the presence or absence of anions the suppression effect of humic acid can be attributed to the competition between ha and aaf on the kcbc surface 3 3 identification of ros to further elucidate the contributed ros in the kcbc ps system for aaf degradation meoh and ipa propan 2 ol two quenching scavengers were first applied for the quenching of so4 e so4 so4 2 2 60 v vs nhe and oh e oh oh 2 80 v vs nhe fig 3 a shows that a high proportion of meoh and ipa quenching agent ps 1000 1 only negligibly affected the kcbc ps system for aaf degradation analysis with the epr detection results and ultimately indicating the possible no effect of so4 and oh for aaf removal for contract there were nearly no free radicals so4 oh and o2 formation in cbc ps system supplementary fig s s13 the addition of dmso which had been used for surface bound radicals had no influence on the kcbc ps system to elucidate the possible non radical pathway of the kckc ps system l histidine was applied for the quenching of singlet oxygen 1o2 and 20 inhibition suggested that 1o2 played a limited role in the kcbc ps system the associated intermediate o2 which was quenched by 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 1 piperidinyloxy tempo was considered the predominant active substance in the quenching experiments fig 3a generally despite the formation of o2 was strongly correlated with that of 1o2 the inhibition by tempo was substantially stronger than that by l histidine or nan3 at the same molar concentration in the kcbc ps system furthermore a very weak three peak signal with equal intensity was ascribed to the generation of 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp however no distinct presence of o2 was observed by the nitro blue tetrazolium nbt colorimetric method text s13 and supplementary fig s s11 the esr capture experiment demonstrated that the formation of o2 in the kcbc ps system was rapid during the initial reaction stage supplementary fig s s12c as o2 is generally regarded as generated from excited oxygen molecules the kcbc ps aaf system may have significantly affected the atmospheric environment of the reaction system xiao et al 2022 supplementary fig s12a being a free radical o2 can act as an electron acceptor thus implying that and slight inhibition with the addition of nh4 2c2o4 may result from the capture of o2 in the reaction system wen et al 2022 unexpectedly there no distinct difference in the apparent rate constant and final removal efficiency was discerned between the n2 and o2 injection systems thus indicating that o2 did not participate in the ps activation process these findings further suggest that an oxidizing agent acted as a source of o2 rather than dissolved oxygen in the solution while non radical pathways still existed in the kcbc ps aaf system delocalized electrons are fundamentally closely related to o2 formation li et al 2021c massive carbon defects on the biochar were exacerbated by the koh activation process thus facilitating the generation of delocalized electrons at the defective sites the latter was attributed to o2 formation previous studies have confirmed that s2o8 2 can be adsorbed onto the carbonyl groups on the carbon surface to generate 1o2 after several reactions and there is a transformation between 1o2 and o2 cheng et al 2017 tian et al 2022 the contribution of o2 the main free radical for aaf degradation in kcbc ps system was calculated based on the research of zhang et al 2021 detailed in text s14 15 alternatively o2 can be formed by the hydrolysis of ps or monovalent reduction of o2 the o2 formation pathway may be based on the following reaction 6 c o s 2 o 8 2 c o s o 4 2 o 2 7 s 2 o 8 2 2 h 2 o h o 2 2 s o 4 2 3 h 8 h o 2 o 2 h 9 s 2 o 8 2 2 s o 4 10 s o 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 h o h 11 s 2 o 8 2 2 o h 2 s o 4 2 2 h o 2 12 o 2 o h 1 o 2 o h the consumption of ps in the different systems was monitored for a deeper understanding of kcbc ps mechanism fig 4 for the kcbc ps system the ps conversion rate was enhanced by the introduction of aaf which may have stemmed from the aaf acting as an electron acceptor and thus effectively initiating the electron transfer process moreover the difference in stoichiometric amounts between ps decomposition and so4 2 generation further unveiled the formation of kcbc ps complexes fig 4a wang et al 2019 overall these results indicate a non radical pathway in the kcbc ps aaf system 3 4 electron transfer pathway several researches demonstrated that the possibility relationship between the low effect of anions and water matrix and the existence of the nonradical pathway in ps based advanced oxidation system dou et al 2022 duan et al 2018 ho et al 2019 peng et al 2021 ye et al 2020 nonradical pathway in kcbc ps system contribute to for aaf degradation calculated based on the method which detailed in text s15 which is consistent with the result of the limit effect of anions to kcbc ps system for aaf degradation to evaluate the electron transfer pathway in the kcbc ps system given its highly oxidizing properties k2cro4 was used as an electron trapping agent in the photocatalytic field ye et al 2019 consequently a quenching effect has been proven in persulfate based advanced oxidation systems similar to that from a previous study yu et al 2020b an inhibitory effect on the kcbc ps aaf system somewhat indicated the possible existence of electron transport processes a mixing experiment on delayed pollutant addition was further conducted for investigation supplementary fig s s14b shows that the removal rate of aaf was slightly weakened with the increase of the time interval of delayed contaminant addition even after the addition time of the pollutants was extended to 10 min the removal rate of aaf remained at 50 thus indicating that the bridging mediation of the kcbc ps system was the main contributor to aaf degradation and biochar coordinated the direct transfer of electrons from pollutants to oxidant molecules the ps electrophilic molecules were pre adsorbed on the carbon skeleton of the biochar based catalyst to form a carbon ps complex thus causing the electronic rearrangement while subsequently prolonging and weakening the o o bond on the ps molecule and ultimately activating it to a metastable state fig 3c g h once an electron rich pollutant was added the pollutant molecule as the electron donor directly reacted with the metastable ps as the electron acceptor under the mediation of kcbc the radical quenching experiment indicated that non radical degradation pathways with enhanced electron transfer could occur in this kcbc ps aaf system a series of electrochemical experiments was further performed to identify and measure the electron transfer capacity of kcbc fig 3d illustrates that a smaller arc radius in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis detection was discerned for kcbc instead of cbc thereby revealing the reduced charge transfer resistance and improved electronic conductivity for kcbc moreover the interaction and electron rearrangement between ps and the biochar based catalyst were further evaluated by the i t curves fig 3e the addition of ps or aaf only slightly affected the chronoamperometric current output of the cbc electrode significant current responses were discerned in the kcbc system after the injection of ps and aaf they can be attributed to the strong interactions between the catalyst oxidizing agent and aaf thereby resonating with the linear sweep voltammetry lsv results shown in fig 3f the increased current in the binary and ternary systems implies the formation of a metastable reactive complex during the reaction moreover an electronic flow occurred from the aaf to the surface of kcbc in the kcbc ps aaf system thereby indicating an accelerated oxidation reaction and fast electron transfer on kcbc and the importance of a coexisting reaction during this process the addition of aaf provided some electrons to accelerate the oxidation reaction thus inducing the current increase in situ raman spectra were used to reveal the presence or absence of surface confined species described above chen et al 2019 dou et al 2022 ren et al 2019 the peaks of s2o8 2 were identified at 837 and 1076 cm 1 and the peak centered at 820 cm 1 stemmed from the vibration of the prolonged o o bonds denoted as s2o8 2 virtually the only peaks discerned in the ps the peak at 982 cm 1 can be ascribed to so4 2 fig 3c thus indicating a certain self decomposition phenomenon moreover the intensity increased with the addition of kcbc into the ps solution and the kcbc ps aaf system while the peak intensity of s2o8 2 was the weakest and the metastable kcbc ps intermediate was relatively strong in the presence of aaf in the kcbc ps system however the intensity of the so4 2 peak increased and that of the s2o8 2 peak decreased being potentially driven by the consumption of ps for aaf degradation during the electron transfer in this process the activated ps with a prolonged peroxide o o bond exhibited a higher activity to subtract electrons from the electron donor aaf thereby yielding the breakup of the o o bond and decomposition into so4 2 ren et al 2019 furthermore kcbc mediated electron transfer from aaf to ps may also contribute to aaf oxidation the galvanic oxidation process gop device consisted of two half cells connected by an agarose bridge and an ammeter was applied to connect two graphite electrodes loaded with kcbc thus elucidating the current during the reaction in this way fig 3g two half cells were used to separate the ps and aaf solutions whereas the electron transfer pathway rather than other radical pathways was further confirmed fig 3h and i revealed no distinct current or aaf degradation in the control system without ps however a significant increase in the current was discerned in the kcbc and aaf coexisting systems furthermore the current value quickly reached a maximum and then gradually declined throughout the reaction these findings agree well with the competition kinetics experiments namely with the addition of kcro4 in which the kcbc enhanced the non radical electron transfer pathway although a similar result was obtained from the ps only system the maximum current of the kcbc and aaf coexisting system was six times higher than that of the ps system alone at the same time the aaf oxidation efficiency in the gop system was found to be 70 with few adsorption phenomena observed thereby indicating that aaf can be oxidized by direct electron transfer to further evaluate the potential reactive sites and key ros formation progress in the kcbc ps system the vienna ab initio simulation package vasp was used and the structure of biochar was simplified in further discussion momma and izumi 2011 note that the detailed computational method is summarized in text s12 the conversion pathways of sulfate radicals into other reactive oxygen species ros especially oh and ooh were investigated to this end the gibbs free energies of the reactions were calculated under different conditions the reaction occurring on the surface of the catalyst can be divided into the following successive reactions 13 o 2 h 2 o e o o h o h 14 o o h e o o h 15 o h 2 o e o h o h 16 o 2 2 h 2 o 4 e 4 o h by considering the electron transfer efficiency in the simplified biochar structure the system work function decreased in the presence of sulfate radicals this indicates the enhanced electron conductivity which promoted the electron transfer during the activation of ps fig 5 c and d the gibbs free energies calculated for the reaction processed described in eq s 13 16 were used to elucidate the effect of the conversion and catalytic process of reactive oxygen species in the presence or absence of so4 at the two active sites carbonyl or vacant sites on the simplified biochar structure the presence of sulfate radicals can significantly reduce the energy of the system thereby weakening the energy barrier of the decisive step and play a role in promoting the reaction fig 5 as shown in fig 5b the presence of so4 facilitated the formation of other reactive oxygen species around the vacancies of the simplified biochar structure and promotes the above reaction processes these results indicate that biochar based materials can provide abundant active sites not only for persulfate activation but also for the transformation of ros furthermore ps assisted in the formation of oxygen intermediates and also weakened the energy barrier of the catalytic reaction cycle these active sites exhibited combined effects on ros formation and conversion in the kcbc ps system 3 5 identification of degradation products and possible pathways total organic carbon toc measurements were further analyzed to estimate the mineralization efficiency of the aaf kcbc ps system supplementary fig s s15 shows that the aaf mineralization efficiency was 75 thereby indicating that the kcbc ps system demonstrated excellent mineralization ability for aaf degradation this also suggests that some intermediates were generated alongside the mineralization into co2 and h2o in the advanced oxidation process furthermore the generated anions po4 3 and no3 can also indicate the complete mineralization of some aaf in the kcbc ps system supplementary fig s s16 on this basis the intermediate degradation of aaf in the kcbc ps system was analyzed using gc ms fu et al 2021 given the possible thermal decomposition of aaf from the injection port of the gc ms at high temperature lc ms was used for the following analysis as well the intermediate byproducts that were detected are summarized in table s5 theoretical calculations were used to unveil the aaf degradation pathways in the kcbc ps system fundamentally the fukui function is an efficient widely used method that relies on the gaussian software to predict reactive sites for different radicals the optimized chemical structure of the aaf is shown in fig 6 a as seen the electrophilic f radical f0 and nucleophilic f values theoretically revealed the relative activity of each atom in an aaf molecule the fukui function value of f which can be used to predict the molecular reactivity to radicals attacked by o2 was the only electrophilic species detected in this study the highest f electrophilic attack values of aaf were 2s 0 2252 being followed by 3s 0 698 and 6 n 0 0686 they were susceptible to attack by o2 a specific atom with a high condensed dual descriptors cdd value generally exhibits the higher reactivity at the molecular sites as depicted in fig 6d the 2s atom 0 0795 and 6 n 0 0568 exhibited lower cdd value and were closely surrounded by the negative isosurface of the fukui index which indicates that they are priority sites which is consistent with the conclusion of the fukui function therefore in our study the most probable reaction sites of aaf in the kcbc ps system were around the 1p atom fig 6b and c also illustrate the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo and highest occupied molecular orbital homo of the aaf molecule this pattern implies that the regions that can easily lose add electrons for attack by electrophilic nucleophilic species as clearly presented the homo of aaf was mainly located on the n atom of the piperazine ring s atom and c atoms in the benzene ring associated with n and s in our study aniline tp1 is supposed to be the initial decomposition product of aaf in kckc ps system with the formation of some low molecular weight intermediates containing phosphorus or sulfur tp8 subsequent oxidation was carried out to form the intermediates which are benzene ring substitutes tp2 5 furthermore some of them were subsequently mineralized and anions were formed through subsequent oxidation forms straight chain products tp7 the possible degradation pathways of aaf using the kcbc ps system are demonstrated in supplementary fig s s16 by benefiting from the narrow energy gap of kcbc the electrons localized at the highest occupied molecular orbital homo 6 355 ev of aaf can be readily transferred to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo 1 096 ev of the metastable ps complex via the carbon tunnel driven by a potential energy difference this in turn triggers the ps decomposition during which the ps abstracts two electrons from the aaf instead of acting as a one electron oxidant to generate so4 these findings in synergy with the aforementioned results from previous sections point on a possible mechanism for aff oxidation in the kcbc ps system more specifically the possible activation pathways are 17 s 2 o 8 2 2 e f r o m a a f 2 s o 4 2 the toxicity estimation software tool t e s t shown in fig 7 a f is based on the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar t e s t was further used to evaluate the degradation intermediates of aaf in the kcbc ps system and demonstrated that nearly all the degradation intermediates were not harmful to acute toxicity in aquatic organisms fathead minnow lc50 96 h daphnia magna lc50 48 h and t pyriformis igc50 48 h moreover there no bioaccumulation or genotoxicity of the assessed degradation intermediates was discerned where only some intermediates exhibited developmental toxicity furthermore chinese cabbage seed germination and radicle length shown in fig 7g h were applied evaluate the toxicity of the intermediates in the kcbc ps system the kcbc ps system can eliminate the toxicity of aaf on the seed germination rate base on the statistical analysis using spss statistics 26 4 conclusion to conclude this study proposed the large scale preparation of metal free biochar based materials that activate persulfate for the degradation of aaf the kcbc ps system exhibited high removal efficiency of aaf at low doses of catalyst kcbc 0 05 g l and oxidant ps 0 3 mm additions in the kcbc ps system o2 was found the dominant reactive oxygen species which yielded high mineralization rates of 70 moreover the existing electron transfer mechanism provided a good resistance to co existing ions in the environment koh activation endows the biochar with abundant carbonyl functional groups and defective structures as effective active sites for electron transfer pathways and superoxide radical formation respectively moreover it highlights their role in the reactive oxygen species formation and conversion according to the characterization analyses results including xps electrochemistry electrooxidation and in situ raman testing and theoretical calculations the intermediate degradation products and possible degradation pathways of aaf were inferred by calculating the attacked sites of aaf in the system using dft combined with mass spectrometry analysis we further combined the software and seed the germination experiments to elucidate the efficiency in reducing the environmental toxicity of pollutants our study proposed a modification strategy for cost effective and environmentally friendly biochar based catalysts while also broadening the
