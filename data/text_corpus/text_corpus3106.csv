15530,biofouling of membrane surfaces poses significant operational challenges and costs for desalination and wastewater reuse applications ultraviolet uv light can control biofilms while reducing chemical usage and disinfection by products but light deliveries to membrane surfaces in spiral wound geometries has been a daunting challenge thin and flexible nano enabled side emitting optical fibers seofs are novel light delivery devices that enable disinfection or photocatalytic oxidation by radiating uv light from light emitting diodes leds we envision seofs as an active membrane spacer to mitigate biofilm formation on reverse osmosis ro membranes a lab scale ro membrane apparatus equipped with seofs allowed comparison of uv a photocatalysis enabled versus uv c direct photolysis disinfection compared against systems without any light exposure systems with uv c light formed thinner but denser biofilms prevented permeate flux declines due to biofouling and maintained the highest salt rejection results were corroborated by in situ optical coherence tomography and ex situ measurements of biofilm growth on the membranes transcriptomic analysis showed that uv c seofs down regulated quorum sensing and surface attachment genes in contrast uv a seofs upregulated quorum sensing surface attachment and oxidative stress genes resulting in higher extracellular polymeric substances eps accumulation on membrane surfaces overall seofs that deliver a low fluence of uv c light onto membrane surfaces are a promising non chemical approach for mitigating biofouling formation on ro membranes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords side emitting optical fibers ultraviolet disinfection biofouling reverse osmosis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction reverse osmosis ro desalination of seawater brackish ground water municipal wastewater effluents industrial wastewater and other water sources is central to increasing the water supply for high quality water park et al 2016 shannon et al 2009 a major challenge for ro technology is the decline in performance i e permeate water flux and solute rejection and increase in energy requirements due to fouling by organic matter inorganic scalants and or bacterial biofilms on the membrane surface jafari et al 2021 mo et al 2012 rana and matsuura 2010 biofouling is a major contributor to increases in ro membrane operational cost because it increases pressure requirements decreases water fluxes and increases chemical use bar zeev et al 2015a mansouri et al 2010 matin et al 2011 numerous strategies have been explored to mitigate biofilm formations including pretreatment to remove biodegradable organic matter adding chemicals to disinfect biofilms or modifying membrane materials for antifouling however their use alone or in combination has yet to eliminate biofilm formation on ro membranes to avoid the formation of by products e g nitrosamines associated with adding chemical disinfectants e g chloramines during ro treatment non chemical strategies are needed to mitigate biofouling and reduce the operational costs associated with ro treatment bar zeev et al 2015b biofilms are surface bound complex microbial aggregates encased in self produced extracellular polymeric substances eps that are primarily composed of polysaccharides and proteins herzberg and elimelech 2007 herzberg et al 2009 rosenberg and delong 2013 because of protection provided by the eps matrix once established biofilms have a strong resistance to chemical penetration and hydraulic cleaning cycles flemming and wingender 2010 bacteria reportedly produce more eps under stress conditions thus requiring excessive cleaning agents to control biofouling in ro membrane processes which leads to secondary environmental pollution and periodic shut down of the processes freire gormaly and bilton 2019 soule et al 2016 additionally polyamide membranes inevitably degrade during chlorine based cleaning cycles and require more frequent replacement therefore there is a need to understand how new biofouling control technologies influence biological processes and or the degradation of membrane materials germicidal ultraviolet uv light is a proven viable non chemical disinfection strategy for water treatment beck et al 2016 dotson et al 2012 linden et al 2019 traditionally ultraviolet uv lamps use low pressure lp monochromatic uv light or medium pressure mp polychromatic uv light generated from mercury sources bolton and cotton 2011 ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv led are emerging for specialty disinfection applications because they are mercury free and compact require low power and have long life expectancy linden et al 2019 muramoto et al 2014 sholtes et al 2016 led wavelengths can be selected to disinfect bacteria through different mechanisms beck et al 2018 beck et al 2017 sholtes et al 2016 or be used to initiate photocatalysis in the presence of titanium dioxide tio2 or other photocatalysts chen et al 2017 ling et al 2017 loeb et al 2019 a challenge for uv leds is their relatively low power and ability to deliver light in different reactor configurations delivering light is particularly challenging for spiral wound ro membranes that have water flowing through narrow channels flexible plastic spacers are used in ro systems to maintain the channels and induce surface turbulence which helps mitigates membrane fouling a potential strategy to deliver uv light to membrane surfaces could involve replacing or integrating the flexible spacers with small diameter 250 1000 μm flexible side emitting optical fibers seofs coupled with uv leds seofs have been developed to deliver light to surfaces or create high surface area photocatalysis processes lanzarini lopes et al 2019 lanzarini lopes et al 2020 o neal tugaoen et al 2018 song et al 2021 uv a wavelengths delivered into optical fibers ofs coated with tio2 nanoparticles effectively generate reactive oxygen species ros ling et al 2017 song et al 2021 which can degrade organic matter and contribute to microbial inactivation uv b and uv c wavelengths are more effective for disinfection than uv a because of the action spectra of dna and proteins in bacteria beck et al 2016 beck et al 2017 while modest levels of uv irradiation slightly oxidizes ro membranes to increase water flux while maintaining high salt rejections it is important to acknowledge that excessive amounts of ros and uv irradiation can degrade polymeric membrane materials nasrollahi et al 2021 rho et al 2021 therefore we envision that seofs can replace or be integrated with inert plastic membrane spacers that are used in all spiral wound ro membrane modules to deliver low uv fluence levels sufficient to inactivate bacteria or produce ros for disinfection plus oxidation of soluble microbial products that accumulate on the membrane although a few studies have reported using uv irradiation on a membrane module to reduce fouling in membrane processes molinari et al 2019 mozia 2010 song et al 2012 wei et al 2019 these have all relied on irradiating flat sheet membranes by a point source of light including single or multiple leds placed at a distance from the membrane surface however such designs are not scalable to the spiral wound modules that dominate most full scale ro membrane processes as such we designed a ro membrane apparatus equipped with seofs to investigate and compare how uv a photocatalysis enabled versus uv c direct photolysis disinfection influenced ro surface biofouling and associated membrane performance i e water flux and salt rejection the design integrated seofs in a cross flow membrane apparatus allowing in situ monitoring by optical coherence tomography oct of biofilm density over time and at the end of the experiment ex situ monitoring and analysis of biofilm composition eps proteins and transcriptomic analysis of gene expression in response to uv light first we characterized the side emission of light and photocatalytic capabilities of the uv c versus uv a seofs second we measured and compared the water flux salt rejection and biofilm surface density for membranes without light versus membranes enabled by uv c versus uv a seofs third we quantified the changes in membrane properties after exposure to uv c or uv a light by seofs finally we used cell counts chemical analysis of membrane foulants and transcriptomic analysis of the biofilms to discuss potential mechanisms for how the two different wavelength seofs influenced biofilm mitigation on ro membrane surfaces this study provides valuable insights into novel biofouling mitigation strategies for membrane based processes which will ultimately enhance the sustainability of desalination and water reuse efforts 2 materials and methods 2 1 seof enabled ro membrane apparatus fig 1 shows a custom ro membrane apparatus equipped with two seofs fig 1a shows a fully enclosed membrane cell that allows water cross flow through the chamber which is equipped with a quartz window to enable in situ oct measurements of biofilm density on the membrane surface the photograph in fig 1b shows two seofs that are glowing i e side emitting light when connected to a functioning led which is located outside the membrane cell seofs are positioned less than 1 mm from the ro membrane surface fig 1c shows the membrane cell configured within a temperature controlled recirculating system while the current experiment utilizes flat sheet membranes fig 1d shows one concept that could be explored to integrate flexible seofs as spacers within spiral wound ro membrane modules the membrane cell included three primary components first membrane coupons with dimensions of 50 cm2 were cut from a commercial brackish water reverse osmosis bwro membrane element mpd based thin film composite pa applied membrane inc m t1812a24 prior to all experiments the chemical coatings on the active layer of the ro membrane coupons were completely removed by soaking overnight in deionized di water second seofs were fabricated see below and placed within a 1 mm thick spacer fig 1b and connected outside the cell to different leds third uv leds uv c 60 mw crystal is ny uv a 1 w nvsu233b nichia corporation japan at 265 nm and 365 nm were used for uv c and uv a seofs respectively the same electric current 0 45 amp was applied to leds with different wavelengths during all experiments separate parallel membrane cells were operated using a common feed tank such that both the control i e seof without led illumination and treated i e seof with led illumination received the same bacterial concentrations over the 8 day experiment 2 2 performance test of ro membrane equipped with uv seofs the biofouling propensity and salt rejection of ro membrane systems were separately evaluated using a lab scale cross flow ro unit at a cross flow velocity of 0 35 cm s 1 using 10 l of synthetic wastewater as feed water under recirculation mode with 5 bar pressure for 8 d table si 1 shows the characteristics of the feed water i e synthetic wastewater which has an ionic strength of 15 9 mm and 40 mg l 1 of organic carbon substrate glucose rice et al 2018 analytical grade nacl mgso4 7h2o nahco3 cacl2 2h2o kh2po4 nh4cl and na3c6h5o7 2h2o were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa the initial bacteria inoculum was 5 108 colony forming units cfu ml 1 using a culture of pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 15692 p aeruginosa was selected as a model microorganism because it is among the most common biofilm producing bacteria herzberg et al 2009 miller et al 2012 rice et al 2018 working with a single culture also facilitates interpretation of transcriptomic analysis this proof of concept study i e technology readiness level trl 3 4 was designed to demonstrate viability and elucidate biofilm inhibition mechanisms using by uv c and uv a seofs deionized di water was added to the membrane coupon for 2 h before applying feed water to ensure membrane compaction continuous flux rates were measured gravimetrically using a scale ms3002s 03 mettler toledo oh usa and real time fouling layer formation was monitored by oct thorlabs germany using the fourier domain scanning technique at a relatively high scanning rate 30 khz im et al 2021 to calculate salt rejection the ion concentrations in the feed and permeate were measured using a conductance meter orion versa star pro advanced electrochemistry meter thermo wa permeate water flux jw and rejection were calculated as follows 1 p e r m e a t e f l u x j w l m 2 h 1 v a 2 r e j e c t i o n 1 c p c f 100 where v is the permeate flow l h 1 a is the membrane surface area m2 and cf and cp are the salt concentrations in the feed and permeate respectively the fouled ro membranes were collected after 8 d of cross flow and further analyzed using various techniques described below 2 3 materials and fabrication method for seofs multimode optical fibers diameter 1 mm numerical aperture 0 39 core refractive index ri 1 5 high oh 300 1200 nm model ft1000umt were purchased from thorlabs newton nj usa aminated silica sphere nanoparticles sio2 suspended in 99 99 ethanol were obtained from nanocomposix san diego ca usa and used as scattering centers cytop was used as a low uv c absorbing polymer cytop bellex international corp wilmington de usa the fabrication steps of the uv c and uv a seofs for disinfection and photocatalytic oxidation are illustrated in fig si 1 detailed fabrication steps for the seofs were reported in our previous studies lanzarini lopes et al 2019 lanzarini lopes et al 2020 o neal tugaoen et al 2018 briefly fiber optic segments 9 cm were cut with a ceramic blade to obtain a smooth and flat cut surface the polymer cladding on the fibers was manually removed using a specialized microstripper the stripped fibers were then soaked in acetone for 15 min to dissolve the polymeric cladding which is a thin coating that maintains the total internal light reflection the uncoated fibers were subsequently rinsed and cleaned with nanopure water the optical fiber segments were individually fixed to metallic led connectors smo5sma thorlabs using the heat shrink wrap the fibers were mounted on a fiber support d50sma thorlabs and the cut surface was polished with optical polishing paper lf30p lf5p and lf03p until a specular surface was obtained both ends of each optical fiber were polished to maximize light entrance from the led into the fiber these fibers were then coated to enable side emission of uv c or uv c light plus ros production by surface activation when tio2 was present as a photocatalysts following prior detailed seof fabrication methodologies published elsewhere uv c seofs were prepared by aminated silica nanoparticles sio2 coating onto stripped optical fibers through electrostatic attraction using dip coating for 60 s followed by air drying for 5 min zhao et al 2021 the fibers were then dipped in polymer solution and dried in air for 2 h a previous study confirmed that cytop has negligible attenuation light scattering and reflection lanzarini lopes et al 2019 for uv a seofs the tio2 p90 photocatalyst sigma aldrich was deposited on the fiber surface using a dip coating method ling et al 2017 a 1 0 tio2 p90 dispersion 10 g l 1 was prepared according to a previously published protocol tantra et al 2015 the dispersion solution was prepared in nanopure water and sonicated using a qsonica misonix immersion sonicator for 15 min the optical fibers were immersed in the dispersion solution for 60 s and then slowly removed from the dispersion solution subsequently the coated fibers were heat dried at 100 c for 5 min to ensure tio2 adhesion to the optical fiber surface 2 4 analytical methods to confirm side emission the light intensity 265 nm and 365 nm along the seofs was analyzed using a spectrophoto radiometer calibration 200 1100 nm avantes louisville co avaspec 2048 l at different lengths along the fiber l 1 9 cm following previously described methods zhao et al 2021 to confirm hydroxyl radical oh production from uv a seofs experiments were performed using a solution para hydroxybenzoic acid p hba from 1 µm benzoic acid klein et al 1975 because the benzoic acid reacts with oh to form three hydroxybenzoic acid isomers ortho meta and para hydroxybenzoic acid in a ratio of 1 7 2 3 1 2 the hydroxyl radical production was confirmed by quantifying p hba membrane surface properties of the virgin and fouled ro membranes were determined zeta potential was measured using the streaming potential mcr 102 anton paar gmbh graz austria in a 10 mm kcl electrolyte solution and contact angle i e hydrophobicity was measured using a goniometer attension theta by biolin scientific gothenburg sweden at the end of each membrane test the biofilms were characterized first bacterial deposition on the fouled ro membranes was quantified using a cfu assay to detach bacteria from the surface the fouled membranes were gently washed in synthetic wastewater placed in 15 ml falcon tubes filled with 5 ml of synthetic wastewater and bath sonicated for 6 min to remove cells without compromising viability frank et al 2017 a 0 1 ml volume of the solution in the falcon tube was withdrawn and diluted with distilled di water at 1 100 the 1 100 solution was plated on lb agar plates in 50 μl aliquots placed in an incubator and allowed to grow overnight cfu counts were determined the following day second live dead cell viability was determined using a leica dm6 fluorescence microscope leica microsystems inc buffalo grove il after the injection of 3 ml of 3 34 mm syto9 and 3 ml of 4 67 mm propidium iodide molecular probes carlsbad ca into each flow channel to stain live and dead cells in green and red respectively images were analyzed using imagej software national institutes of health md usa to determine live cell viability third the phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 and a micro bcatm protein assay kit thermo scientific waltham ma usa was used to determine eps concentration e g polysaccharides and proteins from the supernatants based on the calibration curves between concentration and uv absorbance fig si 2 fourth quantifying the gene expression of

response i e msrb sodm and ospr real time quantitative pcr rt qpcr was performed in 15 μl of reaction mixture composed of 2 ng of cdna sybr green master mix 7 5 μl each primer at 0 3 μm and water using the housekeeping gene reca as an internal standard dietrich et al 2006 livak and schmittgen 2001 ma et al 2006 winsor et al 2010 yang and alvarez 2015 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of side emission and photocatalytic activity of uv c versus uv a seofs homogeneous distribution of sio2 and tio2 on the surfaces of the uv c and uv a seofs respectively was confirmed using scanning electron microscopy images shown in fig si 3 x ray diffraction xrd spectra of tio2 p90 powder the pristine optical fiber and uv a seofs confirmed tio2 was present on the coated fiber and that anatase was the dominant phase anatase is photocatalytic when exposed to 365 nm light as shown in fig si 4 light was uniformly emitted from the side of the optical fibers along their length fig 2 a shows side emitted light fluence thus the nanoparticle coatings were effective at delivering light to the surface of the seofs despite applying the same current 0 45 amp to the 265 nm and 365 nm leds the side scattered light for the uv a seof averaged 100 μw cm 2 89 200 μw cm 2 and was higher than the 10 μw cm 2 average 6 10 μw cm 2 from the uv c seof this is because the uv a leds have higher wattage and because the longer wavelength leds are more efficient at producing light rather than heat loeb et al 2018 light fluence was slightly higher at the proximal end of seofs because it was nearer to the led and because of back refracted light still being transmitted within the seof prior research showed that 2 μw cm 2 of uv c light delivered by seofs inactivates pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli even on very nutrient rich surfaces lanzarini lopes et al 2019 additionally our prior research showed that flux and salt rejection of ro membranes are not compromised until uv doses much above 25 j cm 2 i e potentially years of operation in our envisioned system rho et al 2021 therefore uv c light is not expected to impact the ro membrane performance over the duration of the current experiments in the absence of bacteria further discussed later for the 365 nm led and tio2 coated seof the photocatalytic behavior was demonstrated by oxidation by oh of benzoic acid ba to p hba fig 2b shows no p hba for a non coated optical fiber attached to the uv a led whereas p hba formation increased gradually over time for the tio2 coated seof the previous study clearly revealed that ba acts as an oh scavenger but not as a hole scavenger kim et al 2015 therefore ba can only be transformed to p hba by the oh and this result validated the potential for the tio2 coated seof to produce oh 3 2 mitigation of biofilm induced flux decline using uv c versus uv a seofs fig 3 shows water flux and salt rejection during control and uv irradiation experiments over 8 d with a recirculating feed solution containing p aeruginosa the control experiment had seofs in the membrane cell but no leds were attached i e no irradiation on seofs and thus only hydrodynamic influences the aim was to study surface mitigation of biofouling by using a common large volume of recirculating feed water containing bacteria for both control and uv irradiated membrane cells any inactivation or stress to planktonic bacteria would be experienced by both membrane cells planktonic bacteria were expected to be continuously deposited onto the membrane surfaces even in the presence of uv irradiation from the seofs control and uv irradiation experiments each had the same initial permeate flux 11 5 l m 2 h 1 fig 3a shows the normalized permeate flux of all three ro experiments decreased over time indicating that some biofouling likely occurred on the ro membrane surfaces herzberg and elimelech 2007 control experiments showed the fastest and largest flux decline consistent with many other similar membrane cell studies that attribute flux decline to surface biofilm formation the decline in permeate flux was slower when seofs were connected to leds the results were highly reproducible as evident by small error bars on flux decline tests from duplicate experiments the uv c seof exhibited a faster initial flux decline compared against the uv a seof experiment but then the uv c seof showed a slower rate of flux decline over the remaining 8 d this suggests a steady state surface biofilm formation a continuous flux decline over time was observed with the uv a seof after 8 d the uv a and uv c seof experiments both had similar flux declines jw j0 0 4 that indicated less biofouling than the control jw j0 0 1 because planktonic bacteria were present in the recirculating nutrient rich feed solution we did not expect to sterilize the membrane surfaces with the seofs rather we expected only to achieve less decline in permeate flux associated with somewhat constant attachment detachment of bacteria from the membrane surface reid et al 2014 this appeared to be attained for the uv c seof based on permeate fluxes fig 3b shows changes in salt rejection over time for control and the seof experiments similar losses in salt rejection were observed over the first few days after which the uv c seof maintained higher salt rejection than the control or uv a seof two possible reasons explain the decreased salt rejection i ros generated by uv a seofs can pass through the biofouling layer damage the membrane surface and thereby lead to detrimental effects on membrane performance nasrollahi et al 2021 or ii the surface charge of the ro membrane can be reduced by bacterial deposition leading to decreased donnan exclusion effects rho et al 2020 rho et al 2019 the loss in salt rejection was greatest for the uv a seofs slightly more so than the membrane cell without any uv light exposure the highest permeate water production was observed with uv a seofs when compared to uv c seofs and control experiments accordingly it can be postulated that the ro membrane surface was slightly compromised by ros generated from uv a seofs passing through a loosely formed fouling layer additional control experiments performed using an ro membrane equipped with uv a seofs tio2 was conducted using 10 mm of nacl solution as a feed water without bacteria to investigate the membrane could be damaged by ros generated from uv a seofs results showed that permeate water flux and conductivity rejection of ro membrane gradually increased and decreased respectively at rates above those observed in the presence of biofilms on the membrane surface as shown in fig si 5 rt r0 with biofouling 81 6 rt r0 without biofouling 21 4 thus these results imply that the loosely attached biomass on the fouled ro membrane equipped with uv a tio2 soefs produce allows ros to pass through biofouling layers reach the membrane surface and adversely impact ro membrane performances the biofouling layers was monitored in real time by oct during the ro membrane operation fig si 6 and the biofilm layer thickness was estimated from the oct images fortunato et al 2017 fig 3c shows changes throughout each experiment it was expected that uv irradiation would decrease the biofilm thickness unexpectedly the biofilm layer after 8 d was thicker on the membrane with the uv a photocatalytic seofs 287 95 7 μm compared against the control membrane without uv irradiation 217 19 6 μm however the thinnest biofilm layer was observed in the membrane cells equipped with uv c seofs 103 31 7 μm furthermore fig 3d shows 3 dimensional oct images of the ro membrane surface after 8 d with a relatively loose low density rough biofilm layer observed for the uv a seofs compared against a more compact biofilm layer on the control and uv c seof membrane cells overall biofouling was significantly influenced by the photocatalytic oxidation or disinfection from uv a and uv c seofs uv a seofs promoted formation of a less dense but thicker biofouling layer and the ros generated from uv a seofs may have passed through the less dense biofouling layer and degraded the polymeric ro membrane surface uv c seofs had less loss of permeate flux i e less biofouling than the control and retained the highest salt rejection uv c seofs also performed the most consistently i e least change in permeate flux or salt rejection over 8 d which corresponds logically to the membrane cell with the least influence from biofilms i e thinnest biofilm layer fig 3c moreover seofs are stable under 5 bar of pressure in ro unit over 8 d because glass optical fiber basically has a high tensile strength of 5 103 n mm2 approximately 53 000 bar indicating that seofs have very strong mechanical properties additionally seofs are flexible enough due to their transparent polymer coating as shown in fig si 7 3 3 characterization of changes in ro membrane surfaces after exposures using uv c versus uv a seofs fig 4 a shows zeta potential of virgin and fouled membranes from control or uv seof experiments the virgin and fouled ro membranes showed negatively zeta potentials over most of the ph range the amphoteric curves are associated with the carboxyl and amine functional groups attached to the ro membranes as generally observed in previous studies rho et al 2018 furthermore the surface zeta potentials of the ro membrane became less negatively charged as the biofouling layer formed on the membranes uv a without led uv c without led at ph 7 was 7 3 1 5 mv uv c at ph 7 was 9 1 2 2 mv and uv a at ph 7 was 3 4 1 3 mv this likely indicates larger biofoulant accumulation on ro membrane equipped with uv a seofs than the control the oh generated by uv a seofs may be promoting biofoulant accumulation near the membrane surface cai and liu 2016 pemmaraju et al 2016 surface contact angles of the virgin and fouled ro membrane surfaces are shown in fig 4b virgin ro membrane shows the highest contact angles 40 3 consistent with prior measurements rho et al 2021 in the control tests biofouling rendered the ro membrane surface more hydrophilic i e 29 4 uv c seofs resulted in a surface contact angle 35 2 closer to the virgin membrane 40 3 than the control membrane system 29 4 uv a seofs resulted in a surface with the lowest contact angle 25 2 1 9 some biofilms existed in both control no light and experiments with uv irradiation experiments membrane surface characterization provides additional insights into the nature of foulants lee et al 2010 but in both causes after 8 days of operation both the underlying membrane and surface biofilms influence surface properties changes in zeta potential and surface contact angle measures fig 4 coincided with biofilm thickness fig 3c the presence of thicker biofilms resulted in larger changes in these surface measurements because the biofilms themselves exerted a stronger effect on the measurements relative to the native surface properties of the underlying ro membrane 3 4 biological and chemical composition of membrane foulants to support in situ oct measurements of biofilm density over time after 8 d the membrane cell was opened and biomass was collected from nine regions distributed across the membrane surface fig si 8 schematically illustrates sample locations that were then used to create surface contour plots fig 5 for various measurements by assigning a measured concentration to each of these nine regions on the membrane surface i e length and width plotted on x and y axis fig 5a c show differences in cfu for the control uv c seof and uv a seof experiments respectively across all nine regions fig 6 bacterial counts averaged 1 6 106 0 8 104 and 1 3 106 cfu cm 2 for the control uv c seof and uv a seof experiments respectively bacterial counts were not uniform across the membrane surface but were less than 1 log difference in cfu ml across the membrane consistent with oct measurements uv c seof experiments showed the lowest biofilm accumulation and had a maximum cfu ml of 2 104 ml which is 2 log lower than the maximum bacterial counts for the control or uv a seof systems 2 5 106 ml based on staining and confocal images obtained from the fluorescence microscope fig si 9 fig 6 shows that uv c seof experiments exhibited the lowest live cell viability 18 followed by 60 viability for uv a seofs and 71 viability in control experiments these results are consistent with cfu ml data showing the largest impact by uv c seofs using the same 9 sample locations as for bacteria concentrations cfu cm 2 fig 5d f and 5g i show data for eps components polysaccharides and proteins respectively eps concentrations were lowest for the control and highest for the uv a seofs with uv c seofs in the middle polysaccharide and protein concentrations had similar orders of magnitude 0 1 to 1 mg cm 2 and exhibited similar spatial patterns across the membrane surface as shown in fig 6c the amounts of eps per unit cell were highest for the uv a seofs compared to others implying that ros generated from uv a seofs promote to bacterial cells to secrete eps data in fig 5 suggest different spatial patterns in biofilm growth for the control versus uv irradiated membranes control experiments appeared to have highest biofilm density around the outside walls of the membrane cell whereas the irradiated membranes had the highest density in the center of the membrane cell control experiments had seofs without irradiation so these patterns are unlikely associated with differences in hydrodynamics within the membrane cells instead we postulate that the spatial patterns were associated with bacterial responses to uv c light or uv a photocatalytically produced ros to investigate how bacteria are responding to uv c irradiation or oh generated by uv a biofilm samples were subjected to transcriptomic analysis yang and alvarez 2015 overall uv c and uv a seofs induced the expression of p aeruginosa genes associated with biofouling formation on ro membranes p aeruginosa generally contains two quorum sensing qs systems las and rhl and either system consists of one transcriptional activator lasr or rhlr and an autoinducer synthase lasi or rhli the las system dominates and controls the rhl system whereas the two systems are linked fig 7 shows up or down regulation of several genes relative to control experiments i e without uv irradiation uv c seofs induced lasi 4 2 1 6 fold lasr 6 4 1 2 fold rhli 0 3 0 7 fold and rhlr 1 0 1 3 fold while lasi 3 3 1 2 fold lasr 1 1 1 1 fold rhli 2 9 2 5 fold and rhlr 2 7 1 6 fold were down regulated by uv c seofs separately uv a seofs upregulated expression of polysaccharides synthesis gene pela 4 2 1 1 fold and psla 2 1 0 6 fold and induced expression of surface attachment gene cdra 3 4 1 3 fold and sags 4 1 1 0 fold while both expressions of polysaccharides synthesis and surface attachment genes were down regulated by uv c seofs pela 0 7 0 7 fold psla 0 3 1 6 fold cdra 1 1 0 9 fold sags 3 2 1 3 fold both uv c and uv a seofs induced expression of oxidative stress response for uv c seofs the responses were as follows msrb 2 7 0 5 fold sodm 1 8 0 3 fold ospr 3 4 0 8 fold for uv a seofs the responses were as follows msrb 4 8 1 7 fold sodm 5 5 1 4 fold ospr 4 1 1 1 fold the photocatalytic uv a seofs had significantly more effect on the oxidative stress response stimulation of qs polysaccharide synthesis surface attachment and oxidative stress response corroborates the observation that a low level of oh generated by the uv a seofs may promote formation of biofilm secretion of more eps to protect microorganism growth and resistance to oxidative stress chen et al 2022 pezzoni et al 2018 higher oh generation may be more effective for microbial inactivation wang et al 2015 however uv c seofs that directly deliver germicidal irradiation 2 to 10 μw cm 2 to the membrane surface are sufficient to inhibit biofouling formation affecting the expression of qs regulation and surface attachment genes this is because aromatic heterocyclic pyrimidine bases in dna are dominant absorbers of uv light while ros generated by photocatalysis are non selective oxidizing whole cell constitutes overall these results suggest superior performance of uv c seofs relative to uv a seofs to mitigate the detrimental effects of biofouling on membrane performance 4 conclusions we demonstrated that an ro membrane unit equipped with uv c seofs effectively inhibited p aeruginosa growth on membrane surfaces mitigating adverse performance decline in water flux otherwise associated with biofouling the thin and flexible uv c seofs resulted in some but relatively thin and less dense biofilms on the membranes compared to parallel systems that did not launch uv c light into the seofs of significant importance is that uv c seofs resulted in more constant performance i e slower rate of change over time in permeate flux or salt rejection than control experiments where biofilms grew on the membrane surface uv a irradiated tio2 coated seofs continuously generated oh concentrations that were insufficient to prevent inhibit bacterial growth on ro membrane surfaces in fact oh generated from uv a seofs coated with tio2 promoted microorganism attachment to the membrane surface resulting in thick fouling layers with significant amounts of eps possibly as a hermetic response to sublethal stress it is possible that the oh oxidized organics in the feed water or within the biofilm matrix into more readily biodegradable materials which promoted biofilm growth oct imaging of biofilm density on the membranes showed biofilms were loosely attached on the fouled ro membrane equipped with uv a seofs compared to the others allowing ros to pass through biofouling layers reach the membrane surface degrade the polymer and adversely impact sustainable ro membrane performances transcriptomic analysis results revealed that uv c seofs down regulated quorum sensing and surface attachment genes in contrast uv a seofs upregulated quorum sensing surface attachment and oxidative stress genes resulting in higher eps accumulation on membrane surfaces this occurred because aromatic heterocyclic pyrimidine bases in dna are dominant absorbers of uv light while ros generated by photocatalysis are non selective oxidizing whole cell constitutes apparently oh concentrations within the reactors promoted biofilm formation by producing more eps in response to the oxidative stress conditions in an attempt to protect p aeruginosa consequently the best performing wavelengths were uv c wherein the seofs resulted in less loss of permeate flux than the control and maintained the highest salt rejection while there is potential for uv c light to damage polyamide ro membranes ongoing experiments in our laboratory suggests continuous irradiation may not be required to control biofilm growth if the uv exposure or dose μw cm 2 time achieve surface bacterial inactivation rates greater than bacterial growth rates then biofilm growth may be inhibited therefore we are exploring duty cycling wherein leds are cycled on for a short period of time and then off for 5 to 50 times longer than the on cycle this lengthens the operation time to several years before accumulated doses even approach levels i e 25 j cm 2 previously found to cause membrane defects to polymer surfaces rho et al 2021 uv seofs represent an emerging non chemical strategy to mitigate biofouling and reduce operational costs associated with ro treatment and demonstrated its potential to improvement membrane performance thin and flexible seofs may incrementally increase in capital costs of ro modules e g as ro membrane spaces and require very low powered 100 mw uv light from leds attached to the seofs the tradeoff against increase pressure to maintain water flux and or down time plus chemical usage is likely to be reduces through integration of uv seofs into ro modules our experiments applied relatively high bacterial and nutrient concentration in the feed solution relative to pretreated water in wastewater reuse facilities while future research on such wastewaters will be needed the model feed waters and organisms used in our study are commonly used to elucidate biofouling inhibition jiang et al 2022 liu et

15530,biofouling of membrane surfaces poses significant operational challenges and costs for desalination and wastewater reuse applications ultraviolet uv light can control biofilms while reducing chemical usage and disinfection by products but light deliveries to membrane surfaces in spiral wound geometries has been a daunting challenge thin and flexible nano enabled side emitting optical fibers seofs are novel light delivery devices that enable disinfection or photocatalytic oxidation by radiating uv light from light emitting diodes leds we envision seofs as an active membrane spacer to mitigate biofilm formation on reverse osmosis ro membranes a lab scale ro membrane apparatus equipped with seofs allowed comparison of uv a photocatalysis enabled versus uv c direct photolysis disinfection compared against systems without any light exposure systems with uv c light formed thinner but denser biofilms prevented permeate flux declines due to biofouling and maintained the highest salt rejection results were corroborated by in situ optical coherence tomography and ex situ measurements of biofilm growth on the membranes transcriptomic analysis showed that uv c seofs down regulated quorum sensing and surface attachment genes in contrast uv a seofs upregulated quorum sensing surface attachment and oxidative stress genes resulting in higher extracellular polymeric substances eps accumulation on membrane surfaces overall seofs that deliver a low fluence of uv c light onto membrane surfaces are a promising non chemical approach for mitigating biofouling formation on ro membranes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords side emitting optical fibers ultraviolet disinfection biofouling reverse osmosis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction reverse osmosis ro desalination of seawater brackish ground water municipal wastewater effluents industrial wastewater and other water sources is central to increasing the water supply for high quality water park et al 2016 shannon et al 2009 a major challenge for ro technology is the decline in performance i e permeate water flux and solute rejection and increase in energy requirements due to fouling by organic matter inorganic scalants and or bacterial biofilms on the membrane surface jafari et al 2021 mo et al 2012 rana and matsuura 2010 biofouling is a major contributor to increases in ro membrane operational cost because it increases pressure requirements decreases water fluxes and increases chemical use bar zeev et al 2015a mansouri et al 2010 matin et al 2011 numerous strategies have been explored to mitigate biofilm formations including pretreatment to remove biodegradable organic matter adding chemicals to disinfect biofilms or modifying membrane materials for antifouling however their use alone or in combination has yet to eliminate biofilm formation on ro membranes to avoid the formation of by products e g nitrosamines associated with adding chemical disinfectants e g chloramines during ro treatment non chemical strategies are needed to mitigate biofouling and reduce the operational costs associated with ro treatment bar zeev et al 2015b biofilms are surface bound complex microbial aggregates encased in self produced extracellular polymeric substances eps that are primarily composed of polysaccharides and proteins herzberg and elimelech 2007 herzberg et al 2009 rosenberg and delong 2013 because of protection provided by the eps matrix once established biofilms have a strong resistance to chemical penetration and hydraulic cleaning cycles flemming and wingender 2010 bacteria reportedly produce more eps under stress conditions thus requiring excessive cleaning agents to control biofouling in ro membrane processes which leads to secondary environmental pollution and periodic shut down of the processes freire gormaly and bilton 2019 soule et al 2016 additionally polyamide membranes inevitably degrade during chlorine based cleaning cycles and require more frequent replacement therefore there is a need to understand how new biofouling control technologies influence biological processes and or the degradation of membrane materials germicidal ultraviolet uv light is a proven viable non chemical disinfection strategy for water treatment beck et al 2016 dotson et al 2012 linden et al 2019 traditionally ultraviolet uv lamps use low pressure lp monochromatic uv light or medium pressure mp polychromatic uv light generated from mercury sources bolton and cotton 2011 ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv led are emerging for specialty disinfection applications because they are mercury free and compact require low power and have long life expectancy linden et al 2019 muramoto et al 2014 sholtes et al 2016 led wavelengths can be selected to disinfect bacteria through different mechanisms beck et al 2018 beck et al 2017 sholtes et al 2016 or be used to initiate photocatalysis in the presence of titanium dioxide tio2 or other photocatalysts chen et al 2017 ling et al 2017 loeb et al 2019 a challenge for uv leds is their relatively low power and ability to deliver light in different reactor configurations delivering light is particularly challenging for spiral wound ro membranes that have water flowing through narrow channels flexible plastic spacers are used in ro systems to maintain the channels and induce surface turbulence which helps mitigates membrane fouling a potential strategy to deliver uv light to membrane surfaces could involve replacing or integrating the flexible spacers with small diameter 250 1000 μm flexible side emitting optical fibers seofs coupled with uv leds seofs have been developed to deliver light to surfaces or create high surface area photocatalysis processes lanzarini lopes et al 2019 lanzarini lopes et al 2020 o neal tugaoen et al 2018 song et al 2021 uv a wavelengths delivered into optical fibers ofs coated with tio2 nanoparticles effectively generate reactive oxygen species ros ling et al 2017 song et al 2021 which can degrade organic matter and contribute to microbial inactivation uv b and uv c wavelengths are more effective for disinfection than uv a because of the action spectra of dna and proteins in bacteria beck et al 2016 beck et al 2017 while modest levels of uv irradiation slightly oxidizes ro membranes to increase water flux while maintaining high salt rejections it is important to acknowledge that excessive amounts of ros and uv irradiation can degrade polymeric membrane materials nasrollahi et al 2021 rho et al 2021 therefore we envision that seofs can replace or be integrated with inert plastic membrane spacers that are used in all spiral wound ro membrane modules to deliver low uv fluence levels sufficient to inactivate bacteria or produce ros for disinfection plus oxidation of soluble microbial products that accumulate on the membrane although a few studies have reported using uv irradiation on a membrane module to reduce fouling in membrane processes molinari et al 2019 mozia 2010 song et al 2012 wei et al 2019 these have all relied on irradiating flat sheet membranes by a point source of light including single or multiple leds placed at a distance from the membrane surface however such designs are not scalable to the spiral wound modules that dominate most full scale ro membrane processes as such we designed a ro membrane apparatus equipped with seofs to investigate and compare how uv a photocatalysis enabled versus uv c direct photolysis disinfection influenced ro surface biofouling and associated membrane performance i e water flux and salt rejection the design integrated seofs in a cross flow membrane apparatus allowing in situ monitoring by optical coherence tomography oct of biofilm density over time and at the end of the experiment ex situ monitoring and analysis of biofilm composition eps proteins and transcriptomic analysis of gene expression in response to uv light first we characterized the side emission of light and photocatalytic capabilities of the uv c versus uv a seofs second we measured and compared the water flux salt rejection and biofilm surface density for membranes without light versus membranes enabled by uv c versus uv a seofs third we quantified the changes in membrane properties after exposure to uv c or uv a light by seofs finally we used cell counts chemical analysis of membrane foulants and transcriptomic analysis of the biofilms to discuss potential mechanisms for how the two different wavelength seofs influenced biofilm mitigation on ro membrane surfaces this study provides valuable insights into novel biofouling mitigation strategies for membrane based processes which will ultimately enhance the sustainability of desalination and water reuse efforts 2 materials and methods 2 1 seof enabled ro membrane apparatus fig 1 shows a custom ro membrane apparatus equipped with two seofs fig 1a shows a fully enclosed membrane cell that allows water cross flow through the chamber which is equipped with a quartz window to enable in situ oct measurements of biofilm density

positioned less than 1 mm from the ro membrane surface fig 1c shows the membrane cell configured within a temperature controlled recirculating system while the current experiment utilizes flat sheet membranes fig 1d shows one concept that could be explored to integrate flexible seofs as spacers within spiral wound ro membrane modules the membrane cell included three primary components first membrane coupons with dimensions of 50 cm2 were cut from a commercial brackish water reverse osmosis bwro membrane element mpd based thin film composite pa applied membrane inc m t1812a24 prior to all experiments the chemical coatings on the active layer of the ro membrane coupons were completely removed by soaking overnight in deionized di water second seofs were fabricated see below and placed within a 1 mm thick spacer fig 1b and connected outside the cell to different leds third uv leds uv c 60 mw crystal is ny uv a 1 w nvsu233b nichia corporation japan at 265 nm and 365 nm were used for uv c and uv a seofs respectively the same electric current 0 45 amp was applied to leds with different wavelengths during all experiments separate parallel membrane cells were operated using a common feed tank such that both the control i e seof without led illumination and treated i e seof with led illumination received the same bacterial concentrations over the 8 day experiment 2 2 performance test of ro membrane equipped with uv seofs the biofouling propensity and salt rejection of ro membrane systems were separately evaluated using a lab scale cross flow ro unit at a cross flow velocity

of transcriptomic analysis this proof of concept study i e technology readiness level trl 3 4 was designed to demonstrate viability and elucidate biofilm inhibition mechanisms using by uv c and uv a seofs deionized di water was added to the membrane coupon for 2 h before applying feed water to ensure membrane compaction continuous flux rates were measured gravimetrically using a scale ms3002s 03 mettler toledo oh usa and real time fouling layer formation was monitored by oct thorlabs germany using the fourier domain scanning technique at a relatively high scanning rate 30 khz im et al 2021 to calculate salt rejection the ion concentrations in the feed and permeate were measured using a conductance meter orion versa star pro advanced electrochemistry meter thermo wa permeate water flux jw

newton nj usa aminated silica sphere nanoparticles sio2 suspended in 99 99 ethanol were obtained from nanocomposix san diego ca usa and used as scattering centers cytop was used as a low uv c absorbing polymer cytop bellex international corp wilmington de usa the fabrication steps of the uv c and uv a seofs for disinfection and photocatalytic oxidation are illustrated in fig si 1 detailed fabrication steps for the seofs were reported in our previous studies lanzarini lopes et al 2019 lanzarini lopes et al 2020 o neal tugaoen et al 2018 briefly fiber optic segments 9 cm were cut with a ceramic blade to obtain a smooth and flat cut surface the polymer cladding on the fibers was manually removed using a specialized microstripper the stripped fibers were then soaked in acetone for 15 min to dissolve the polymeric cladding which is a thin coating that maintains the total internal light reflection the uncoated fibers were subsequently rinsed and cleaned with nanopure water the optical fiber segments were individually fixed to metallic led connectors smo5sma thorlabs using the heat shrink wrap the fibers were mounted on a fiber support d50sma thorlabs and the cut surface was polished with optical polishing paper lf30p lf5p and lf03p until a specular surface was obtained both ends of each optical fiber were polished to maximize light entrance from the led into the fiber these fibers were then coated to enable side emission of uv c or uv c light plus ros production by surface activation when tio2 was present as a photocatalysts following prior detailed seof fabrication methodologies published elsewhere uv c seofs were prepared by aminated silica nanoparticles sio2 coating onto stripped optical fibers through electrostatic attraction using dip coating for 60 s followed by air drying for 5 min zhao et al 2021 the fibers were then dipped in polymer solution and dried in air for 2 h a previous study confirmed that cytop has negligible attenuation light scattering and reflection lanzarini lopes et al 2019 for uv a seofs the tio2 p90 photocatalyst sigma aldrich was deposited on the fiber surface using a dip coating method ling et al 2017 a 1 0 tio2 p90 dispersion 10 g l 1 was prepared according to a previously published protocol tantra et al 2015 the dispersion solution was prepared in nanopure water and sonicated using a qsonica misonix immersion sonicator for 15 min the optical fibers were immersed in the dispersion solution for 60 s and then slowly removed from the dispersion solution subsequently the coated fibers were heat dried at 100 c for 5 min to ensure tio2 adhesion to the optical fiber surface 2 4 analytical methods to confirm side emission the light intensity 265 nm and 365 nm along the seofs was analyzed using a spectrophoto radiometer calibration 200 1100 nm avantes louisville co avaspec 2048 l at different lengths along the fiber l 1 9 cm following previously described methods zhao et al 2021 to confirm hydroxyl radical oh production from uv a seofs experiments were performed using a solution para hydroxybenzoic acid p hba from 1 µm benzoic acid klein et al 1975 because the benzoic acid reacts with oh to form three hydroxybenzoic acid isomers ortho meta and para hydroxybenzoic acid in a ratio of 1 7 2 3 1 2 the hydroxyl radical production was confirmed by quantifying p hba membrane surface properties of the virgin and fouled ro membranes were determined zeta potential was measured using the streaming potential mcr 102 anton paar gmbh graz austria in a 10 mm kcl electrolyte solution and contact angle i e hydrophobicity was measured using a goniometer attension theta by biolin scientific gothenburg sweden at the end of each membrane test the biofilms were characterized first bacterial deposition on the fouled ro membranes was quantified using a cfu assay to detach bacteria from the surface the fouled membranes were gently washed in synthetic wastewater placed in 15 ml falcon tubes filled with 5 ml of synthetic wastewater and bath sonicated for 6 min to remove cells without compromising viability frank et al 2017 a 0 1 ml volume of the solution in the falcon tube was withdrawn and diluted with distilled di water at 1 100 the 1 100 solution was plated on lb agar plates in 50 μl aliquots placed in an incubator and allowed to grow overnight cfu counts were determined the following day second live dead cell viability was determined using a leica dm6 fluorescence microscope leica microsystems inc buffalo grove il after the injection of 3 ml of 3 34 mm syto9 and 3 ml of 4 67 mm propidium iodide molecular probes carlsbad ca into each flow channel to stain live and dead cells in green and red respectively images were analyzed using imagej software national institutes

using the housekeeping gene reca as an internal standard dietrich et al 2006 livak and schmittgen 2001 ma et al 2006 winsor et al 2010 yang and alvarez 2015 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of side emission and photocatalytic activity of uv c versus uv a seofs homogeneous distribution of sio2 and tio2 on the surfaces of the uv c and uv a seofs respectively was confirmed using scanning electron microscopy images shown in fig si 3 x ray diffraction xrd spectra of tio2 p90 powder the pristine optical fiber and uv a seofs confirmed tio2 was present on the coated fiber and that anatase was the dominant phase anatase is photocatalytic when exposed to 365 nm light as shown in fig si 4 light was uniformly emitted from the side of the optical fibers along their length fig 2 a shows side emitted light fluence thus the nanoparticle coatings were effective at delivering light to the surface of the seofs despite applying the same current 0 45 amp to the 265 nm and 365 nm leds the side scattered light for the uv a seof averaged 100 μw cm 2 89 200 μw cm 2 and was higher than the 10 μw cm 2 average 6 10 μw cm 2 from the uv c seof this is because the uv a leds have higher wattage and because the longer wavelength leds are more efficient at producing light rather than heat loeb et al 2018 light fluence was slightly higher at the proximal end of seofs because it was nearer to the led and because of back refracted light still being transmitted within the seof prior research showed that 2 μw cm 2 of uv c light delivered by seofs inactivates pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli even on very nutrient rich surfaces lanzarini lopes et al 2019 additionally our prior research showed that flux and salt rejection of ro membranes are not compromised until uv doses much above 25 j cm 2 i e potentially years of operation in our envisioned system rho et al 2021 therefore uv c light is not expected to impact the ro membrane performance over the duration of the current experiments in the absence of bacteria further discussed later for the 365 nm led and tio2 coated seof the photocatalytic behavior was demonstrated by oxidation by oh of benzoic acid ba to p hba fig 2b shows no p hba for a non coated optical fiber attached to the uv a led whereas p hba formation increased gradually over time for the tio2 coated seof the previous study clearly revealed that ba acts as an oh scavenger but not as a hole scavenger kim et al 2015 therefore ba can only be transformed to p hba by the oh and this result validated the potential for the tio2 coated seof to produce oh 3 2 mitigation of biofilm induced flux decline using uv c versus uv a seofs fig 3 shows water flux and salt rejection during control and uv irradiation experiments over 8 d with a recirculating feed solution containing p aeruginosa the control experiment had seofs in the membrane cell but no leds were attached i e no irradiation on seofs and thus only hydrodynamic influences the aim was to study surface mitigation of biofouling by using a common large volume of recirculating feed water containing bacteria for both control and uv irradiated membrane cells any inactivation or stress to planktonic bacteria would be experienced by both membrane cells planktonic bacteria were expected to be continuously deposited onto the membrane surfaces even in the presence of uv irradiation from the seofs control and uv irradiation experiments each had the same initial permeate flux 11 5 l m 2 h 1 fig 3a shows the normalized permeate flux of all three ro experiments decreased over time indicating that some biofouling likely occurred on the ro membrane surfaces herzberg and elimelech 2007 control experiments showed the fastest and largest flux decline consistent with many other similar membrane cell studies that attribute flux decline to surface biofilm formation the decline in permeate flux was slower when seofs were connected to leds the results were highly reproducible as evident by small error bars on flux decline tests from duplicate experiments the uv c seof exhibited a faster initial flux decline compared against the uv a seof experiment but then the uv c seof showed a slower rate of flux decline over the remaining 8 d this suggests a steady state surface biofilm formation a continuous flux decline over time was observed with the uv a seof after 8 d the uv a and uv c seof experiments both had similar flux declines jw j0 0 4 that indicated less biofouling than the control jw j0 0 1 because planktonic bacteria were present in the recirculating nutrient rich feed solution we did not expect to sterilize the membrane surfaces with the seofs rather we expected only to achieve less decline in permeate flux associated with somewhat constant attachment detachment of bacteria from the membrane surface reid et al 2014 this appeared to be attained for the uv c seof based on permeate fluxes fig 3b shows changes in salt rejection over time for control and the seof experiments similar losses in salt rejection were observed over the first few days after which the uv c seof maintained higher salt rejection than the control or uv a seof two possible reasons explain the decreased salt rejection i ros generated by uv a seofs can pass through the biofouling layer damage the membrane surface and thereby lead to detrimental effects on membrane performance nasrollahi et al 2021 or ii the surface charge of the ro membrane can be reduced by bacterial deposition leading to decreased donnan exclusion effects rho et al 2020 rho et al 2019 the loss in salt rejection was greatest for the uv a seofs slightly more so than the membrane cell without any uv light exposure the highest permeate water production was observed with uv a seofs when compared to uv c seofs and control experiments accordingly it can be postulated that the ro membrane surface was slightly compromised by ros generated from uv a seofs passing through a loosely formed fouling layer additional control experiments performed using an ro membrane equipped with uv a seofs tio2 was conducted using 10 mm of nacl solution as a feed water without bacteria to investigate the membrane could be damaged by ros generated from uv a seofs results showed that permeate water flux and conductivity rejection of ro membrane gradually increased and decreased respectively at rates above those observed in the presence of biofilms on the membrane surface as shown in fig si 5 rt r0 with biofouling 81 6 rt r0 without biofouling 21 4 thus these results imply that the loosely attached biomass on the fouled ro membrane equipped with uv a tio2 soefs produce allows ros to pass through biofouling layers reach the membrane surface and adversely impact ro membrane performances the biofouling layers was monitored in real time by oct during the ro membrane operation fig si 6 and the biofilm layer thickness was estimated from the oct images fortunato et al 2017 fig 3c shows changes throughout each experiment it was expected that uv irradiation would decrease the biofilm thickness unexpectedly the biofilm layer after 8 d was thicker on the membrane with the uv a photocatalytic seofs 287 95 7 μm compared against the control membrane without uv irradiation 217 19 6 μm however the thinnest biofilm layer was observed in the membrane cells equipped with uv c seofs 103 31 7 μm furthermore fig 3d shows 3 dimensional oct images of the ro membrane surface after 8 d with a relatively loose low density rough biofilm layer observed for the uv a seofs compared against a more compact biofilm layer on the control and uv c seof membrane cells overall biofouling was significantly influenced by the photocatalytic oxidation or disinfection from uv a and uv c seofs uv a seofs promoted formation of a less dense but thicker biofouling layer and the ros generated from uv a seofs may have passed through the less dense biofouling layer and degraded the polymeric ro membrane surface uv c seofs had less loss of permeate flux i e less biofouling than the control and retained the highest salt rejection uv c seofs also performed the most consistently i e least change in permeate flux or salt rejection over 8 d which corresponds logically to the membrane cell with the least influence from biofilms i e thinnest biofilm layer fig 3c moreover seofs are stable under 5 bar of pressure in ro unit over 8 d because glass optical fiber basically has a high tensile strength of 5 103 n mm2 approximately 53 000 bar indicating that seofs have very strong mechanical properties additionally seofs are flexible enough due to their transparent polymer coating as shown in fig si 7 3 3 characterization of changes in ro membrane surfaces after exposures using uv c versus uv a seofs fig 4 a shows zeta potential of virgin and fouled membranes from control or uv seof experiments the virgin and fouled ro membranes showed negatively zeta potentials over most of the ph range the amphoteric curves are associated with the carboxyl and amine functional groups attached to the ro membranes as generally observed in previous studies rho et al 2018 furthermore the surface zeta potentials of the ro membrane became less negatively charged as the biofouling layer formed on the membranes uv a without led uv c without led at ph 7 was 7 3 1 5 mv uv c at ph 7 was 9 1 2 2 mv and uv a at ph 7 was 3 4 1 3 mv this likely indicates larger biofoulant accumulation on ro membrane equipped with uv a seofs than the control the oh generated by uv a seofs may be promoting biofoulant accumulation near the membrane surface cai and liu 2016 pemmaraju et al 2016 surface contact angles of the virgin and fouled ro membrane surfaces are shown in fig 4b virgin ro membrane shows the highest contact angles 40 3 consistent with prior measurements rho et al 2021 in the control tests biofouling rendered the ro membrane surface more hydrophilic i e 29 4 uv c seofs resulted in a surface contact angle 35 2 closer to the virgin membrane 40 3 than the control membrane system 29 4 uv a seofs resulted in a surface with the lowest contact angle 25 2 1 9 some biofilms existed in both control no light and experiments with uv irradiation experiments membrane surface characterization provides additional insights into the nature of foulants lee et al 2010 but in both causes after 8 days of operation both the underlying membrane and surface biofilms influence surface properties changes in zeta potential and surface contact angle measures fig 4 coincided with biofilm thickness fig 3c the presence of thicker biofilms resulted in larger changes in these surface measurements because the biofilms themselves exerted a stronger effect on the measurements relative to the native surface properties of the underlying ro membrane 3 4 biological and chemical composition of membrane foulants to support in situ oct measurements of biofilm density over time after 8 d the membrane cell was opened and biomass was collected from nine regions distributed across the membrane surface fig si 8 schematically illustrates sample locations that were then used to create surface contour plots fig 5 for various measurements by assigning a measured concentration to each of these nine regions on the membrane surface i e length and width plotted on x and y axis fig 5a c show differences in cfu for the control uv c seof and uv a seof experiments respectively across all nine regions fig 6 bacterial counts averaged 1 6 106 0 8 104 and 1 3 106 cfu cm 2 for the control uv c seof and uv a seof experiments respectively bacterial counts were not uniform across the membrane surface but were less than 1 log difference in cfu ml across the membrane consistent with oct measurements uv c seof experiments showed the lowest biofilm accumulation and had a maximum cfu ml of 2 104 ml which is 2 log lower than the maximum bacterial counts for the control or uv a seof systems 2 5 106 ml based on staining and confocal images obtained from the fluorescence microscope fig si 9 fig 6 shows that uv c seof experiments exhibited the lowest live cell viability 18 followed by 60 viability for uv a seofs and 71 viability in control experiments these results are consistent with cfu ml data showing the largest impact by uv c seofs using the same 9 sample locations as for bacteria concentrations cfu cm 2 fig 5d f and 5g i show data for eps components polysaccharides and proteins respectively eps concentrations were lowest for the control and highest for the uv a seofs with uv c seofs in the middle polysaccharide and protein concentrations had similar orders of magnitude 0 1 to 1 mg cm 2 and exhibited similar spatial patterns across the membrane surface as shown in fig 6c the amounts of eps per unit cell were highest for the uv a seofs compared to others implying that ros generated from uv a seofs promote to bacterial cells to secrete eps data in fig 5 suggest different spatial patterns in biofilm growth for the control versus uv irradiated membranes control experiments appeared to have highest biofilm density around the outside walls of the membrane cell whereas the irradiated membranes had the highest density in the center of the membrane cell control experiments had seofs without irradiation so these patterns are unlikely associated with differences in hydrodynamics within the membrane cells instead we postulate that the spatial patterns were associated with bacterial responses to uv c light or uv a photocatalytically produced ros to investigate how bacteria are responding to uv c irradiation or oh generated by uv a biofilm samples were subjected to transcriptomic analysis yang and alvarez 2015 overall uv c and uv a seofs induced the expression of p aeruginosa genes associated with biofouling formation on ro membranes p aeruginosa generally contains two quorum sensing qs systems las and rhl and either system consists of one transcriptional activator lasr or rhlr and an autoinducer synthase lasi or rhli the las system dominates and controls the rhl system whereas the two systems are linked fig 7 shows up or down regulation of several genes relative to control experiments i e without uv irradiation uv c seofs induced lasi 4 2 1 6 fold lasr 6 4 1 2 fold rhli 0 3 0 7 fold and rhlr 1 0 1 3 fold while lasi 3 3 1 2 fold lasr 1 1 1 1 fold rhli 2 9 2 5 fold and rhlr 2 7 1 6 fold were down regulated by uv c seofs separately uv a seofs upregulated expression of polysaccharides synthesis gene pela 4 2 1 1 fold and psla 2 1 0 6 fold and induced expression of surface attachment gene cdra 3 4 1 3 fold and sags 4 1 1 0 fold while both expressions of polysaccharides synthesis and surface attachment genes were down

had significantly more effect on the oxidative stress response stimulation of qs polysaccharide synthesis surface attachment and oxidative stress response corroborates the observation that a low level of oh generated by the uv a seofs may promote formation of biofilm secretion of more eps to protect microorganism growth and resistance to oxidative stress chen et al 2022 pezzoni et al 2018 higher oh generation may be more effective for microbial inactivation wang et al 2015 however uv c seofs that directly deliver germicidal irradiation 2 to 10 μw cm 2 to the membrane surface are sufficient to inhibit biofouling formation affecting the expression of qs regulation and surface attachment genes this is because aromatic heterocyclic pyrimidine bases in dna are dominant absorbers of uv light while ros generated by photocatalysis are non selective oxidizing whole cell constitutes overall these results suggest superior performance of uv c seofs relative to uv a seofs to mitigate the detrimental effects of biofouling on membrane performance 4 conclusions we demonstrated that an ro membrane unit equipped with uv c seofs effectively inhibited p aeruginosa growth on membrane surfaces mitigating adverse performance decline in water flux otherwise associated with biofouling the thin and flexible uv c seofs resulted in some but relatively thin and less dense biofilms on the membranes compared to parallel systems that did not launch uv c light into the seofs of significant importance is that uv c seofs resulted in more constant performance i e slower rate of change over time in permeate flux or salt rejection than control experiments where biofilms grew on the membrane surface uv a irradiated tio2 coated seofs continuously generated oh concentrations that were insufficient to prevent inhibit bacterial growth on ro membrane surfaces in fact oh generated from uv a seofs coated with tio2 promoted microorganism attachment to the membrane surface resulting in thick fouling layers with significant amounts of eps possibly as a hermetic response to sublethal stress it is possible that the oh oxidized organics in the feed water or within the biofilm matrix into more readily biodegradable materials which promoted biofilm growth oct imaging of biofilm density on the membranes showed biofilms were loosely attached on the fouled ro membrane equipped with uv a seofs compared to the others allowing ros to pass through biofouling layers reach the membrane surface degrade the polymer and adversely impact sustainable ro membrane performances transcriptomic analysis results revealed that uv c seofs down regulated quorum sensing and surface attachment genes in contrast uv a seofs upregulated quorum sensing surface attachment and oxidative stress genes resulting in higher eps accumulation on membrane surfaces this occurred because aromatic heterocyclic pyrimidine bases in dna are dominant absorbers of uv light while ros generated by photocatalysis are non selective oxidizing whole cell constitutes apparently oh concentrations within the reactors promoted biofilm formation by producing more eps in response to the oxidative stress conditions in an attempt to protect p aeruginosa consequently the best performing wavelengths were uv c wherein the seofs resulted in less loss of permeate flux than the control and maintained the highest salt rejection while there is potential for uv c light to damage polyamide ro membranes ongoing experiments in our laboratory suggests continuous irradiation may not be required to control biofilm growth if the uv exposure or dose μw cm 2 time achieve surface bacterial inactivation rates greater than bacterial growth rates then biofilm growth may be inhibited therefore we are exploring duty cycling wherein leds are cycled on for a short period of time and then off for 5 to 50 times longer than the on cycle this lengthens the operation time to several years before accumulated doses even approach levels i e 25 j cm 2 previously found to cause membrane defects to polymer surfaces rho et al 2021 uv seofs represent an emerging non chemical strategy to mitigate biofouling and reduce operational costs associated with ro treatment and demonstrated its potential to improvement membrane performance thin and flexible seofs may incrementally increase in capital costs of ro modules e g as ro membrane spaces and require very low powered 100 mw uv light from leds attached to the seofs the tradeoff against increase pressure to maintain water flux and or down time plus chemical usage is likely to be reduces through integration of uv seofs into ro modules our experiments applied relatively high bacterial and nutrient concentration in the feed solution relative to pretreated water in wastewater reuse facilities while future research on such wastewaters will be needed the model feed waters and organisms used in our study are commonly used to elucidate biofouling inhibition jiang et al 2022 liu et

15531,ion exchange technology removes ionic compounds from waters effectively but treatment of the spent regenerant is expensive the bioregeneration of sulfate laden strong base anion exchange resin was successfully tested using both pure and mixed sulfate reducing bacterial cultures the resin was first used for removal of sulfate from neutral ph 6 7 0 5 synthetic sodium sulfate solutions after which the spent resin was regenerated by incubating with a viable sulfate reducing bacterial culture in batch and column modes in the batch bioregeneration tests the achieved bioregeneration was 36 95 of the original capacity of the fresh resin 112 mg so4 2 g and it increased with regeneration time 1 14 days the capacity achieved in the column tests during 24 hours of bioregeneration was 107 mg so4 2 g after the first regeneration cycle during the bioregeneration sulfate was mainly reduced by the sulfate reducing bacteria approx 60 but part of it was only detached from the resins approx 30 the resin attached sulfate was most likely replaced with ions present in the liquid sulfate reducing bacterial culture e g hco3 hs and cl during the subsequent exhaustion cycles with the bioregenerated resin the ph of the treated sodium sulfate solution increased from the original 6 7 0 5 to around 9 the study showed that biological sulfate reduction could be used for sulfate removal in combination with ion exchange and that the exhausted ion exchange resins could be regenerated using a liquid sulfate reducing bacterial culture without producing any brine graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bioregeneration bioremediation ion exchange column sulfate reducing bacteria sulfate removal data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction leakage of sulfate containing mining impacted waters miws into the environment has taken place repeatedly around the world causing salinization of natural water bodies and affecting aquatic ecosystems sulfate dissolves readily from crushed sulfide minerals via chemical and microbial reactions e g in open pits waste rock piles mine shafts and tailings ponds in both operational and closed mine sites naidu et al 2019 in finland limits for sulfate discharge are specific to each mine and range from 1000 to 4000 mg l aluehallintovirasto 2017 2016 2015 2013 however environmental permits have become stricter in recent years and more attention is being paid to the environmental impacts of mining conventionally sulfate is removed from industrial wastewaters by chemical precipitation with lime however due to the solubility of calcium sulfate caso4 it can result in sulfate concentrations of only 1500 2000 mg l tolonen et al 2016 thus additional treatment methods are often necessary lower sulfate concentrations can be achieved with membrane filtration processes ion exchange or biological sulfate reduction for example runtti et al 2018 membrane processes i e nanofiltration and reverse osmosis can remove over 95 of sulfate even from feed water sulfate concentrations of several grams per liter bódalo et al 2004 mullett et al 2014 however these methods incur high energy consumption and operational costs biological sulfate reduction is a widely studied method but there are only a couple of commercial scale bioreactor applications available johnson and santos 2020 sulfate reducing bacteria srb convert soluble sulfate to sulfide sulfur while oxidizing organic carbon sources especially organic acids the sulfide s formed usually occurs as hydrogen sulfide h2s at ph values below 6 9 and as hydrosulfide hs between ph 7 and 13 and combines with many mono and divalent metals forming insoluble sulfide phases lewis 2010 thus one of the advantages of biological sulfate reduction as a water treatment method is the possibility to utilize the sulfide s formed for precipitating the transition metals present in the water in active bioreactor systems precipitation can be performed before the water is fed into the bioreactor so that the inhibitory effect of the metals is avoided and recovery of metal sulfides is easier boonstra et al 1999 bratty et al 2006 however biological sulfate reduction is more commonly used in passive processes for treatment of miws at closed mine sites ali et al 2019 ion exchange is a commercially used method for removing contaminants from water based on the electronic charges of the ions anionic compounds such as sulfate so4 2 are removed with weak or strong base anion exchangers containing positively charged functional groups and metal cations are removed with weak or strong acid cation exchangers containing negatively charged functional groups commercial ion exchangers are usually petroleum based resins but many novel bio based materials have also been proposed gogoi et al 2021 keränen et al 2013 exhausted selective resins are usually incinerated after disposal as they cannot be effectively regenerated and non selective resins are reused after regeneration with brine or concentrated acid or base solutions sharbatmaleki et al 2015 for example for non selective strong base anion exchange sba resins usually 0 50 1 25 m naoh is used as the regenerant regeneration however results in waste brine which needs to be further treated or disposed of ebrahimi and roberts 2013 sharbatmaleki et al 2015 to increase the sustainability of ion exchange biological regeneration has been proposed as a solution to overcome the disadvantages in biological regeneration microbial metabolism is exploited either for the oxidation or reduction of the contaminants attached to ion exchange resins or adsorbents bioregeneration has previously been tested for nitrate sulfate and perchlorate laden materials macroporous and gel type resins as well as lignocellulose based biosorbents bae and nam 2014 ebrahimi and roberts 2013 ren et al 2017 2015 sharbatmaleki and batista 2012 venkatesan et al 2010 and for activated carbon exhausted with fenolic compounds ha et al 2000 vinitnantharat et al 2001 or trichloroethylene nakano et al 2000 in the reported studies bioregeneration based on microbial reduction was efficient for several cycles but some biofouling causing minor losses in exchange or adsorption capacities was detected biological oxidation of organic compounds adsorbed to activated carbon have resulted in more variable efficiencies due to the difficulty of desorption and degradation of the adsorbates formation of degradation products and biofouling gamal et al 2018 nath and bhakhar 2011 bioregeneration of sulfate and nitrate laden nitrate selective sba resin has been successfully tested using a mixed consortium of denitrifying and sulfate reducing bacteria bae and nam 2014 in the present research bioregeneration of sulfate laden non selective anion exchange resin was studied using srb alone srb can be cultivated either as pure cultures consisting of a single srb strain or as more diverse mixed cultures the use of mixed cultures also containing microbes other than srb has some advantages compared to the use of pure cultures such as a lower risk of contamination by other organisms enhanced adaptation to changes in growth conditions and more comprehensive utilization of substrates boothman et al 2006 white et al 1998 the effect of both mixed and pure srb cultures on bioregeneration efficiency was investigated whereas most of the studies regarding bioregeneration of ion exchange resins have exploited only mixed bacterial cultures in addition valuable information on the surface properties of bioregenerated resins was gained by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem 2 materials and methods 2 1 sulfate reducing bacterial cultures the mixed srb consortium was enriched from a sediment sample from the lapland region of finland described in a previous study virpiranta et al 2019 the consortium was acclimatized to a

bioregeneration experiments were enriched by incubating the mixed or pure cultures as batch cultivations for 2 6 or 3 7 weeks respectively at 6 c in the modified postgate medium with succinate as a

6 c sodium succinate solution was added aseptically to give a succinate concentration of 2 65 g l the bottles were then inoculated with the pure and mixed srb cultures the initial so4 2 concentration in the cultivation medium was approximately 1 6 g l all the chemicals used in the media were of analytical grade 2 2 batch tests a commercial gel type amberjet 4200 cl sba resin rohm and haas u s was used in all the ion exchange and bioregeneration tests this resin consists of a styrene divinylbenzene copolymer matrix and has trimethyl ammonium as a functional group at the beginning of the experiments the fresh resin was in chloride cl form three cycles of batch ion exchange and bioregeneration tests were conducted in sterile 50 ml centrifuge tubes to test the bioregeneration efficiency into each tube 0 225 g 5 g l of amberjet 4200 cl resin was weighed followed by the addition of 45 ml of sterile synthetic na2so4 solution containing 1 g l so4 2 the initial ph of the na2so4 solution was 6 2 7 2 the tubes were shaken in a horizontally rotating shaker 18 rpm for 1 h at room temperature rt approx 22 c the treated na2so4 solution was decanted out of the tubes and the spent resins were washed twice with 12 5 ml of sterile milli q water merck millipore u s the hach lange sulfate cuvette tests lck 353 or lck 153 and a uv vis spectrophotometer dr 2800 were used for determining the residual so4 2 concentrations the concentration of so4 2 in the wash water was considered in the mass balance calculations the initial and final ph values of the solutions were measured using a hanna

bioregeneration of the spent resins was initiated by anaerobically adding 45 ml of a viable pure or mixed liquid srb culture to the test tubes in addition sodium succinate solution 100 mg ml was added to achieve a succinate concentration of 927 mg l in the tubes one cycle of abiotic control tests was performed using 45 ml of sterile modified postgate medium supplemented with sodium succinate the required succinate concentration was calculated according to eq 2 assuming that all the added succinate was utilized for the reduction of the so4 2 attached to the resins however some of the succinate was consumed for biomass formation bounaga et al 2022 according to eq 3 and some was utilized by microbes other than srb in the mixed culture to minimize the growth of other microbes the amount of

three times with n2 gas the filled tubes were sealed and incubated in a shaker incubator at 22 c and 50 rpm for 1 2 3 4 or 7 days three parallel test tubes containing the same bacterial inoculum or the sterile medium were incubated for each period the ph and redox potential eh of the liquid srb cultures and the sterile medium were measured before and after the bioregeneration an iq150 ph dual technology meter equipped with a phenomenal orp220 ag agcl 3 m kcl electrode was used for measuring the eh for reference to a standard hydrogen electrode 208 mv agcl ag potential at 20 c was added to the recorded eh values sawyer et al 1995 in addition the concentration of so4 2 was measured from the sterile modified postgate medium used in the abiotic control tests before and after the regeneration cycles once the target regeneration time was reached the regenerated resins were soaked several times in sterile milli q water and used again for the removal of so4 2 from the sterile synthetic na2so4 solution the achieved so4 2 exchange capacities were calculated using eq 1 and the rates of so4 2 removal from resin were calculated by dividing the capacity reached by the regeneration time used after the third bioregeneration cycle resins incubated with the srb cultures for 7 days were soaked in milli q water dried at 60 c overnight and analyzed by xps and fesem resins bioregenerated for 1 day were tested for 14 day bioregeneration to investigate the maximal bioregeneration efficiency finally all the bioregenerated resins excluding resins analyzed by xps and fesem were chemically regenerated by mixing them for 1 h in 5 ml of 0 5 m naoh to confirm the residual amount of so4 2 attached to the resins the contact time and the concentration of naoh were selected according to the manufacturer s recommendation the residual so4 2 amount was measured from the spent naoh solution using the cuvette test method 2 3 column tests ion exchange and bioregeneration with the pure srb culture were tested in two parallel column set ups for three exhaustion bioregeneration cycles both columns were 30 cm long and had an inner diameter of 1 9 cm resulting in a volume of 83 6 cm3 the columns were sealed with pieces of cotton wool at both ends and filled with quartz sand up to a height of 13 cm particle size 0 5 1 mm in the middle of the columns 3 5 cm of amberjet 4200 cl resin was added resulting in a bed volume of 9 9 cm3 pieces of cotton wool were added to the top and bottom of the resin bed to avoid the resin mixing with the quartz sand the mass of the resin was 6 65 g in both columns the columns were used for removing so4 2 from 500 ml of sterile synthetic na2so4 solution containing 2 g l so4 2 initial ph 6 2 7 2 the service flow was downflow a flow rate of 2 ml min was used for both columns resulting in an empty bed contact time of approximately 5 min the effluent solution was collected in 20 ml fractions until saturation capacity was reached the exhausted columns were rinsed with 200 ml of sterile milli q water the so4 2 concentration of the wash water was analyzed and considered in the mass balance calculations the residual so4 2

columns with a mixture of a viable pure srb culture and sodium succinate solution for 24 hours referred to as column test 1 or by circulating 200 ml of a viable srb culture supplemented with succinate as an electron donor through the columns at a flow rate of 1 ml min for 24 hours referred to as column test 2 bioregeneration was conducted at rt inside an atmosbag sigma aldrich u s flushed with n2 gas to maintain anaerobic conditions in addition one cycle of abiotic control tests was performed using the sterile modified postgate medium instead of the srb culture after the bioregeneration columns were backwashed with 200 ml of sterile milli q water to remove the srb solution or the modified postgate medium with 250 ml of 10 mm hcl to dissolve and remove any iron sulfide precipitates originating from the cultivation medium and with 1 l of 1 mm naoh to return the ph to a neutral level the so4 2 concentration was measured from the srb preculture before bioregeneration and from the

the batch tests 2 4 characterization of the resins x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem were used for examining the surface properties of the fresh and regenerated anion exchange resins the xps spectra were recorded with a thermo fisher scientific escalab 250xi spectrometer waltham u s using monochromatic al kα radiation 1486 6 ev the

batch bioregeneration tests the genomic dna of the microbial strains was isolated from the cell pellets using the standard protocol qiagen 2017 the srb cultures were characterized by 16s rrna sequencing at the biocenter oulu sequencing center as described previously by virpiranta et al 2019 the obtained sequences were compared with those present in genbank using a blast tool national center for biotechnology information u s national library of medicine u s 3 results and discussion 3 1 batch tests the original so4 2 exchange capacity of the amberjet 4200 cl resin determined in batch ion exchange tests was 112 4 mg g which is of the same order of magnitude as the theoretical capacity of 1 30 eq l 93 mg g for so4 2 reported by the manufacturer however the original capacity was not achieved in the batch bioregeneration test and some loss in resin capacity was detected even with the longest bioregeneration time of 14 days table 1 after 14 days of bioregeneration with pure or mixed srb cultures the so4 2 exchange capacities achieved were 103 4 mg g and 94 4 mg g respectively bioregeneration efficiency clearly increased with the bioregeneration time the same effect was also detected by ren et al 2017 when a perchlorate laden biosorbent was regenerated by a perchlorate reducing bacterial culture in the case of the abiotic control tests 16 4 mg g of the resin capacity was regenerated and the regeneration time did not have any effect on the regeneration efficiency the amount of residual so4 2 attached to the resins after the last bioregeneration cycle decreased when the bioregeneration time increased as expected after two days of bioregeneration with pure and mixed cultures 24 1 mg g and 24 3 mg g of residual so4 2 were attached to the resins 41 2 and 43 6 of the so4 2 exchange capacity respectively after 14 days of bioregeneration the amounts of residual so4 2 were only 2 1 mg g 2 1 with the pure culture and 12 9 mg g 13 10 with the mixed culture however the removal of so4 2 from resin was fastest during the first day of bioregeneration after which the removal rate decreased significantly table 1 bioregeneration is controlled by the mass transfer of so4 2 ions from the resin and by the sulfate reduction kinetics venkatesan et al 2010 the decrease in the bioregeneration rate was probably a consequence of the slower detachment of ions attached deeper inside the resin venkatesan and batista 2011 the so4 2 ions present on the resin surface were readily detached from the resin and easily available for the srb but once the detached ions had been reduced the removal of the remaining ions was slower the microbial sulfate reduction rate srr is dependent on the so4 2 concentration venkatesan et al 2010 reduction is faster with the higher initial so4 2 concentrations and slows down with decreasing concentrations in addition one reason for the decreasing srr might be the bacterial inhibition caused by the increasing concentration of h2s kushkevych et al 2019 the so4 2 removal capacities achieved after 1 4 7 and 14 days of bioregeneration are shown in fig 1 when the pure srb culture was used for bioregeneration somewhat higher bioregeneration efficiency was achieved and the loss in capacity was smaller after 14 days of bioregeneration than when using the mixed culture table 1 fig 1 in the pure culture the available carbon source was utilized only by srb which increased the efficiency of sulfate reduction however the bioregeneration efficiency notably decreased after the third bioregeneration cycle with the pure culture probably due to the clogging of the resin pores by iron sulfide precipitates and organics e g bacterial debris sharbatmaleki and batista 2012 the accumulation of iron sulfide on the resin beads was visually observed when using the mixed srb culture there was some variation between the bioregeneration efficiencies in the second bioregeneration cycle the variation between the bioregeneration efficiencies of the different cycles might also have been caused by the difference in incubation time of the srb precultures the longer incubation time of the preculture used in the second bioregeneration cycle might have increased the relative abundancy of bacteria other than srb in the mixed culture in the case of the pure culture the growth of srb might not yet have been in the exponential phase in the third cycle when a shorter preculture incubation time was used with both srb cultures the best bioregeneration was achieved after the longest bioregeneration time the ph of the treated na2so4 solution increased in the exhaustion cycles with the bioregenerated resin from 6 7 0 5 to around 9 fig 1 when the pure srb culture was used for bioregeneration the ph of the treated solution was clearly the highest when the bioregeneration time was the longest and thus the majority of the resin attached so4 2 was most probably exchanged for ions present in the liquid srb culture fig 1a for example the hs formed in so4 2 reduction might have attached to the resin in the bioregeneration cycle and been exchanged for so4 2 in the anion exchange cycle at neutral ph approximately half of sulfide was in the form of h2s thus association of hs with h might have resulted in the increase in ph in addition hco3 was formed in so4 2 reduction and might have attached to the resin in the case of the abiotic control tests no change in the ph was detected and it is likely that the resin attached so4 2 was partly exchanged for the cl ions present in the modified postgate medium the selectivity of an ion exchange resin is highly dependent on the functional group of the resin the trimethyl ammonium groups of the amberjet 4200 cl resin favor divalent ions such as so4 2 the uptake of which requires two closely spaced positively charged groups clifford and weber 1983 the order of the sba resin affinity for ions is so4 2 cl hco3 acetate oh dupont 2019a the sba resin affinity for hs has not been reported however as a divalent ion it is likely that so4 2 is selected over hs but the selectivity is also dependent on the concentration of ions since an equilibrium state between the ions in solution and the ions on the resin is reached ghurye et al 1999 moreover cotrino 2006 achieved successful removal of hs together with so4 2 from groundwater using a macroporous sba resin in cl form which indicates a higher affinity towards hs than cl in contrast with the mixed srb culture there was not such a clear association but the ph of the treated na2so4 solution increased close to 9 regardless of the bioregeneration time fig 1b during the batch bioregeneration experiment there was also a slight but not significant increase in the ph of the srb solutions and the eh decreased significantly in both the pure and mixed srb cultures table 2 the changes in ph and eh indicate the activity of srb as the microbial sulfidogenesis eq 2 consumes proton acidity h and produces hs which acts as a reducing agent delaune and reddy 2005 during the abiotic control tests no change was detected in ph eh or so4 2 concentration of the modified postgate medium 3 2 column tests the original saturation capacity of the anion exchange columns containing 6 65 g of amberjet 4200 cl resin for so4 2 2 g l was 60 10 mg g which is somewhat lower than the reported theoretical capacity of 1 30 eq l 93 mg g for so4 2 however after the second anion exchange bioregeneration cycle the saturation capacity increased to 111 4 mg g without circulation of the srb solution through the columns column test 1 and to 102 5 0 2 mg g with circulation of the srb solution column test 2 after the third cycle saturation capacities stood at 104 7 0 6 mg g column test 1 and 70 0 0 2 mg g column test 2 in the case of the abiotic control tests the saturation capacities were 63 1 mg g column test 1 and 52 7 mg g column test 2 after one anion exchange regeneration cycle according to the results of the naoh regeneration of the bioregenerated resins there was 6 mg g and 14 mg g of residual so4 2 attached to the resins after the third cycle in column tests 1 and 2 respectively however as only resin from one column was chemically regenerated in both column tests 1 and 2 the other column was sampled for characterization the repeatability of the result cannot be evaluated the amount of reduced so4 2 in bioregeneration decreased after the second cycle and even more radically in column test 2 fig 2 during bioregeneration with circulation of the srb solution column test 2 the ph of the srb solution increased from 7 6 0 2 to 8 2 0 2 and the eh decreased from 70 30 to 77 12 which refers to srb activity however in the third bioregeneration cycle the so4 2 attached to the resins was not reduced but only detached into the srb solution fig 2 since there is a notable difference in size between the bacterial cells approx 1 µm and the pores of gel type resins approx 1 nm bacteria do not enter the resin pores during bioregeneration but the ions are likely to be detached from the functional groups of the resins and biodegraded in the liquid dupont 2019b sharbatmaleki et al 2015 venkatesan and batista 2011 as mentioned in section 3 1 bioregeneration is controlled by the mass transfer of so4 2 ions from the resin and by the sulfate reduction kinetics in the third bioregeneration cycle in column test 2 the sulfate reduction was negligible and thus the mass transfer of resin attached so4 2 also decreased the bioregeneration efficiency was similar to the efficiency in the abiotic control tests as expected sulfate reduction is affected by the relative quantity of srb and the presence of h2s kushkevych et al 2019 2015 a different srb preculture was used in each bioregeneration cycle the precultivation time varied from five to six weeks and the amount of liquid culture contacting the resin was larger when the culture was circulated through the column in column test 2 all of which affected the number of active srb cells and concentration of so4 2 and h2s in the culture during bioregeneration the so4 2 ions present in the liquid srb culture interfered with the mass transfer and reduction of resin attached so4 2 ions which was probably the main reason for the better performance in column test 1 a slightly higher regeneration efficiency was also achieved in column test 1 in the case of the abiotic control tests the sulfate breakthrough curves in the ion exchange stage are shown in fig 3 and s1 with the fresh amberjet 4200 cl resin no so4 2 was detected in the initial fractions of the column experiment the breakthrough curve is an ideal s shaped curve which is due to a rapid and effective anion exchange during the initial phase with the bioregenerated resins the breakthrough is achieved earlier and the curves ascend more gently however with the fresh resin the saturation point was achieved much faster than with the bioregenerated resins and the bioregeneration increased the total saturation capacity of the resin the reason for this might be that the fresh resin was not fully hydrated in the case of the abiotic control tests the breakthrough started immediately but the saturation point was not achieved as quickly as with the fresh resin fig s1 the form of the resin probably affected the so4 2 exchange performance the fresh resin was in cl form whereas after bioregeneration the resin contained ions from so4 2 reduction e g hco3 and hs and the cultivation medium e g cl the ions were further replaced with cl ions from the hcl rinse and partly with hydroxide oh ions from naoh rinse although the concentrations of hcl and naoh solutions were remarkably low some differences were observed in the exhaustion cycles of the bioregenerated resins in column test 1 the plateau of so4 2 concentration occurred at approximately the same time in cycles 2 and 3 while in column test 2 it occurred much earlier for cycle 3 than for cycle 2 in column test 2 the amount of residual so4 2 had probably increased after the second bioregeneration cycle resulting in the earlier plateau in cycle 3 however this could not be confirmed as the residual so4 2 was analyzed from the resins only after the third bioregeneration cycle as in the batch experiments the ph of the treated na2so4 solution increased when so4 2 was removed and started to slowly decrease after the breakthrough of the column fig 4 the high increase in ph at the beginning of the exhaustion cycle was also detected in the abiotic control tests fig s2 which probably indicates the presence of oh ions in the regenerated resins resulting from the naoh rinse however in column test 1 there was a large difference between the ph of the two columns at the beginning of cycle 2 fig 4a 3 3 characterization of the resins the surface composition of the fresh and bioregenerated resins analyzed by eds and xps are summarized in table 3 and table s1 respectively the sampling depth of eds was approximately 1 µm whereas the xps signal was collected from the top 1 10 nm from the sample surface which explains the differences between the surface composition results a clear increase in the proportion of oxygen on the surface of resin beads were detected by eds after bioregeneration when compared to the fresh resin according to xps the proportion of o increased in the column tests and the proportion of c increased in the batch tests in the column experiments the ions attached to the resins during bioregeneration were probably further exchanged for cl and partly for oh during the rinse with 10 mm hcl and 1 mm naoh eds detected small proportions of cl in all the bioregenerated samples and in the sulfate laden resin according to both eds and xps cl was present especially in the fresh resin which was originally in cl form according to the xps survey spectrum the fresh resin also contained fluorine nitrogen present in the trimethyl ammonium groups was not detected by eds due to the low energy x rays produced by n atoms heath and taylor 2015 xps detected n in all the samples and the proportion was largest in the resins bioregenerated in batch tests some of the n might have originated from the modified postgate medium used as a cultivation medium for the microbes according to the eds results s was present in all the bioregenerated samples as expected since not all of the so4 2 was removed in the bioregeneration also the soluble hs formed via so4 2 reduction might have partly attached to the resins the smallest proportion of s was detected in the resins from column test 1 in which the bioregeneration was most successful xps clearly detected s in the resins bioregenerated in the batch tests but only a small s2p peak was observed in the high resolution s2p spectrum of the resins from the column tests the high resolution s2p xps spectra of the batch test samples indicate the presence of three sulfur species fig s3 the s2p3 2 peaks at 167 5 ev pure srb culture or 167 6 ev mixed srb culture probably correspond to sulfite al abed et al 2017 the sulfide peak at the lower binding energy is wide and shows two different sulfide species with s2p3 2 peaks at 161 4 ev and 163 3 ev fantauzzi et al 2015 both phosphorus and iron were detected by eds analysis in the resins bioregenerated in the batch tests p and fe originated from the modified postgate medium in the column tests the p and fe attached to the resins during bioregeneration were most likely rinsed out with hcl however xps also detected fe in the fresh resin and resins bioregenerated in the column experiments according to xps the batch test sample bioregenerated with the pure srb culture contained a small proportion of sodium originating from the cultivation medium both eds and xps detected aluminum in all the samples probably originating from the fresh resin the silicon present in all the resin samples is most likely to be contamination originating from several different sources e g storage containers as si is commonly found in the surface agents used in the manufacture of plastic items r d editors 2004 an unexpected presence of silica sio2 detected in styrene divinylbenzene resin was previously reported by riley et al 2021 the proportion of si was highest in resins bioregenerated in the column experiments some of which could have originated from the quartz sand used for filling up the columns the surface morphologies of the fresh and bioregenerated resins are shown in fig 5 the surfaces of the bioregenerated resins clearly contain small particles most probably consisting of bacterial debris and iron sulfide the resins bioregenerated in column mode contain more particles probably since the resin beads were tightly packed in the columns and the bacterial debris was not so easily rinsed out whereas in the batch tests resins were soaked in sterile milli q water after bioregeneration also the surface of the resin bioregenerated with the mixed srb culture had more particles than the resin bioregenerated with pure culture in the batch tests in the mixed culture more biofilm consisting of microbial cells and extracellular polymeric substances eps might have formed and attached to the resin surface due to the greater diversity of the microbial culture 3 4 16s rrna sequencing the mixed srb consortium consisted mostly of firmicutes proteobacteria and bacteroidetes after seven day bioregeneration the relative abundance of srb was 22 3 0 2 of the total bacteria in three parallel bioregeneration experiments most of the srb were characterized as desulfobulbus sp deltaproteobacteria although some desulfovibrio mexicanus deltaproteobacteria and peptococcaceae firmicutes were also present other significantly abundant bacteria in the culture were macellibacteroides fermentans 4 0 0 9 lactic acid bacteria carnobacteriaceae 57 5 and clostridia 12 5 compared to the original enrichment culture the abundance of srb mainly desulfobulbus sp somewhat increased and the abundance of the family carnobacteriaceae increased significantly during the seven day bioregeneration in the original culture trichococcus sp belonging to the family carnobacteriaceae was present trichococcus sp is known to hydrolyze macromolecular organic compounds jin et al 2018 wang et al 2018 in addition trichococcus shcherbakoviae was isolated from a propionate oxidizing bacterial consortium growing in a low temperature anaerobic bioreactor parshina et al 2019 it is very likely that propionate was produced from succinate during the bioregeneration by other bacteria present in the culture as was also supposed in previous studies virpiranta et al 2022 2021 2019 which further supported the growth of carnobacteriaceae no significant change was detected in the abundance of clostridia nor that of macellibacteroides fermentans both of which were also present in the original enrichment culture the abundance of bacteria other than srb involved in the sulfur cycle namely halothiobacillus sp geobacter sp arcobacter sp and sulfurospirillum sp was not significant after the seven day bioregeneration 1 8 1 1 whereas halothiobacillus sp and arcobacter sp in particular were abundant in the original culture halothiobacillus spp and arcobacter sulfidicus are known to oxidize sulfide to elemental sulfur whaley martin et al 2019 wirsen et al 2002 their abundance was also high in reactor experiments when soluble hs was available for oxidation virpiranta et al 2022 consequently the low abundance of these bacteria is attributable to the limited availability of soluble hs in the bacterial solution during bioregeneration the pure srb culture isolated from the mixed culture was identified as belonging to the family desulfobulbaceae the only bacterial species belonging to desulfobulbaceae present in the mixed culture was desulfobulbus sp during the seven day bioregeneration experiment the bacterial distribution did not change in the pure culture 3 5 implications of the study it has been suggested that microbial products and eps attached to the resin during bioregeneration decrease the exchange capacity of the resin in the subsequent ion exchange stage ren et al 2017 contamination of the resin is one of the biggest challenges in bioregeneration in several studies organics clogging the resin pores have been removed by soaking the bioregenerated resin with hypochlorite clo solution ren et al 2017 sharbatmaleki and batista 2012 venkatesan et al 2010 in the column experiments the resins were rinsed in tightly packed columns and thus removal of bacterial debris might have been insufficient biofouling was successfully removed with a more intense procedure by venkatesan et al 2010 who rinsed the bioregenerated column several times with 2 m nacl 0 5 m naoh and deionized water to remove organics and further disinfected the column with naocl solution ebrahimi and roberts 2013 avoided biofouling of the resin by enclosing the resin in a membrane to prevent direct contact with the bacterial culture during bioregeneration however it was concluded that in practice this application could only be used for resins sold in membrane cartridges a small amount of sulfate accumulated in the resins in the column experiments which might be due to some of the ions being attached to resins at a depth which is beyond the reach of the microbes ren et al 2017 sharbatmaleki and batista 2012 nevertheless in column test 1 the capacity loss after the third anion exchange bioregeneration cycle was only around 6 and according to previous bioregeneration studies it can be assumed that the capacity loss would not significantly increase even after several bioregeneration cycles bae and nam 2014 tested four cycles of bioregeneration for nitrate and sulfate laden sba resin and the exchange capacity decreased only 5 9 12 and 19 after the bioregeneration cycles ebrahimi and roberts 2013 bioregenerated nitrate laden sba resin four times without any capacity loss and after six bioregeneration cycles only 6 loss in capacity was detected sharbatmaleki and batista 2012 reported a loss of approximately 15 in the capacity of bioregenerated perchlorate laden sba resin the resin was bioregenerated for five cycles and the accumulation of perchlorate was significant during the first two cycles after which the accumulation somewhat stabilized it is recommended to use 0 50 1 25 m naoh solution for the regeneration of amberjet 4200 cl resin in this study solutions with much lower concentration 10 mm hcl and 1 mm naoh were used for cleaning the resin after bioregeneration in column mode in the batch tests the bioregenerated resins were soaked in water only to gently remove bacteria from the surfaces of the resin beads the amount of hcl and naoh used for washing the bioregenerated column should be optimized in further studies one benefit of biological regeneration is that no actual waste brine is produced since so4 2 is detached from the resin and partly reduced in the column and the remainder would be circulated to a sulfidogenic bioreactor after the bioregeneration cycle however regeneration with naoh is clearly faster since according to the manufacturer the minimum contact time with the resin is only 20 minutes in this study a bioregeneration time of 24 h was used in the column tests and the contact time should be further optimized on the other hand the time used for regeneration is not often that critical since another batch can be utilized for water purification during the regeneration of one resin batch use of naoh might also be more cost efficient than feeding srb with easily utilizable carbon sources e g organic acids however sufficient srrs can be achieved by feeding the bacteria with low cost carbon sources e g conditioned sewage sludge virpiranta et al 2021 as a next step the bioregeneration of exhausted resins could be tested in a hybrid process comprising a continuously operated sulfidogenic bioreactor and an ion exchange column the hybrid process should also be tested with actual miws to ensure the performance of the process dissolved metals in the miws could be precipitated using h2s gas produced in the bioreactor virpiranta et al 2022 before feeding the water to the ion exchange column the exhausted column could be further regenerated by feeding the reactor liquid through the column in the actual process hcl and naoh solutions used for cleaning the bioregenerated resin could be partially circulated through the column to minimize consumption 4 conclusions sulfate laden gel type strong base anion exchange resin was bioregenerated using a viable pure or mixed sulfate reducing bacterial culture in batch mode bioregeneration was slightly more effective with the pure sulfate reducing bacterial culture in column mode bioregeneration the sulfate attached to the resin was mainly reduced by the bacteria but part of it was only detached from the resins the reduction of the resin attached sulfate was more efficient when the column was filled with liquid sulfate reducing bacterial culture and the culture was not circulated through the column when the bioregenerated resins were used for sulfate removal the ph of the treated solution increased significantly which is probably attributed to the replacement of the resin attached sulfate with the ions present in the liquid sulfate reducing bacterial culture and hydroxide ions resulting from naoh rinsing in column mode the hypothesis is also supported by the increase in the amount of oxygen on the surface of the resin beads detected by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy bioregeneration of sulfate laden resins could be further tested for treatment of actual mining impacted waters in a hybrid process comprising a sulfidogenic bioreactor and an ion exchange column credit authorship contribution statement hanna virpiranta data curation

15531,ion exchange technology removes ionic compounds from waters effectively but treatment of the spent regenerant is expensive the bioregeneration of sulfate laden strong base anion exchange resin was successfully tested using both pure and mixed sulfate reducing bacterial cultures the resin was first used for removal of sulfate from neutral ph 6 7 0 5 synthetic sodium sulfate solutions after which the spent resin was regenerated by incubating with a viable sulfate reducing bacterial culture in batch and column modes in the batch bioregeneration tests the achieved bioregeneration was 36 95 of the original capacity of the fresh resin 112 mg so4 2 g and it increased with regeneration time 1 14 days the capacity achieved in the column tests during 24 hours of bioregeneration was 107 mg so4 2 g after the first regeneration cycle during the bioregeneration sulfate was mainly reduced by the sulfate reducing bacteria approx 60 but part of it was only detached from the resins approx 30 the resin attached sulfate was most likely replaced with ions present in the liquid sulfate reducing bacterial culture e g hco3 hs and cl during the subsequent exhaustion cycles with the bioregenerated resin the ph of the treated sodium sulfate solution increased from the original 6 7 0 5 to around 9 the study showed that biological sulfate reduction could be used for sulfate removal in combination with ion exchange and that the exhausted ion exchange resins could be regenerated using a liquid sulfate reducing bacterial culture without producing any brine graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bioregeneration bioremediation ion exchange column sulfate reducing bacteria sulfate removal data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction leakage of sulfate containing mining impacted waters miws into the environment has taken place repeatedly around the world causing salinization of natural water bodies and affecting aquatic ecosystems sulfate dissolves readily from crushed sulfide minerals via chemical and microbial reactions e g in open pits waste rock piles mine shafts and tailings ponds in both operational and closed mine sites naidu et al 2019 in finland limits for sulfate discharge are specific to each mine and range from 1000 to 4000 mg l aluehallintovirasto 2017 2016 2015 2013 however environmental permits have become stricter in recent years and more attention is being paid to the environmental impacts of mining conventionally sulfate is removed from industrial wastewaters by chemical precipitation with lime however due to the solubility of calcium sulfate caso4 it can result in sulfate concentrations of only 1500 2000 mg l tolonen et al 2016 thus additional treatment methods are often necessary lower sulfate concentrations can be achieved with membrane filtration processes ion exchange or biological sulfate reduction for example runtti et al 2018 membrane processes i e nanofiltration and reverse osmosis can remove over 95 of sulfate even from feed water sulfate concentrations of several grams per liter bódalo et al 2004 mullett et al 2014 however these methods incur high energy consumption and operational costs biological sulfate reduction is a widely studied method but there are only a couple of commercial scale bioreactor applications available johnson and santos 2020 sulfate reducing bacteria srb convert soluble sulfate to sulfide sulfur while oxidizing organic carbon sources especially organic acids the sulfide s formed usually occurs as hydrogen sulfide h2s at ph values below 6 9 and as hydrosulfide hs between ph 7 and 13 and combines with many mono and divalent metals forming insoluble sulfide phases lewis 2010 thus one of the advantages of biological sulfate reduction as a water treatment method is the possibility to utilize the sulfide s formed for precipitating the transition metals present in the water in active bioreactor systems precipitation can be performed before the water is fed into the bioreactor so that the inhibitory effect of the metals is avoided and recovery of metal sulfides is easier boonstra et al 1999 bratty et al 2006 however biological sulfate reduction is more commonly used in passive processes for treatment of miws at closed mine sites ali et al 2019 ion exchange is a commercially used method for removing contaminants from water based on the electronic charges of the ions anionic compounds such as sulfate so4 2 are removed with weak or strong base anion exchangers containing positively charged functional groups and metal cations are removed with weak or strong acid cation exchangers containing negatively charged functional groups commercial ion exchangers are usually petroleum based resins but many novel bio based materials have also been proposed gogoi et al 2021 keränen et al 2013 exhausted selective resins are usually incinerated after disposal as they cannot be effectively regenerated and non selective resins are reused after regeneration with brine or concentrated acid or base solutions sharbatmaleki et al 2015 for example for non selective strong base anion exchange sba resins usually 0 50 1 25 m naoh is used as the regenerant regeneration however results in waste brine which needs to be further treated or disposed of ebrahimi and roberts 2013 sharbatmaleki et al 2015 to increase the sustainability of ion exchange biological regeneration has been proposed as a solution to overcome the disadvantages in biological regeneration microbial metabolism is exploited either for the oxidation or reduction of the contaminants attached to ion exchange resins or adsorbents bioregeneration has previously been tested for nitrate sulfate and perchlorate laden materials macroporous and gel type resins as well as lignocellulose based biosorbents bae and nam 2014 ebrahimi and roberts 2013 ren et al 2017 2015 sharbatmaleki and batista 2012 venkatesan et al 2010 and for activated carbon exhausted with fenolic compounds ha et al 2000 vinitnantharat et al 2001 or trichloroethylene nakano et al 2000 in the reported studies bioregeneration based on microbial reduction was efficient for several cycles but some biofouling causing minor losses in exchange or adsorption capacities was detected biological oxidation of organic compounds adsorbed to activated carbon have resulted in more variable efficiencies due to the difficulty of desorption and degradation of the adsorbates formation of degradation products and biofouling gamal et al 2018 nath and bhakhar 2011 bioregeneration of sulfate and nitrate laden nitrate selective sba resin has been successfully tested using a mixed consortium of denitrifying and sulfate reducing bacteria bae and nam 2014 in the present research bioregeneration of sulfate laden non selective anion exchange resin was studied using srb alone srb can be cultivated either as pure cultures consisting of a single srb strain or as more diverse mixed cultures the use of mixed cultures also containing microbes other than srb has some advantages compared to the use of pure cultures such as a lower risk of contamination by other organisms enhanced adaptation to changes in growth conditions and more comprehensive utilization of substrates boothman et al 2006 white et al 1998 the effect of both mixed and pure srb cultures on bioregeneration efficiency was investigated whereas most of the studies regarding bioregeneration of ion exchange resins have exploited only mixed bacterial cultures in addition valuable information on the surface properties of bioregenerated resins was gained by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem 2 materials and methods 2 1 sulfate reducing bacterial

6 c sodium succinate solution was added aseptically to give a succinate concentration of 2 65 g l the bottles were then inoculated with the pure and mixed srb cultures the initial so4 2 concentration in the cultivation medium was approximately 1 6 g l all the chemicals used in the media were of analytical grade 2 2 batch tests a commercial gel type amberjet 4200 cl sba resin rohm and haas u s was used in all the ion exchange and bioregeneration tests this resin consists of a styrene divinylbenzene copolymer matrix and has trimethyl ammonium as a functional group at the beginning of the experiments the fresh resin was in chloride cl form three cycles of batch ion exchange and bioregeneration tests were conducted in sterile 50 ml centrifuge tubes to test the bioregeneration efficiency into each tube 0 225 g 5 g l of amberjet 4200 cl resin was weighed followed by the addition of 45 ml of sterile synthetic na2so4 solution containing 1 g l so4 2 the initial ph of the na2so4 solution was 6 2 7 2 the tubes were shaken in a horizontally rotating shaker 18 rpm for 1 h at room temperature rt approx 22 c the treated na2so4 solution was decanted out of the tubes and the spent resins

bioregeneration of the spent resins was initiated by anaerobically adding 45 ml of a viable pure or mixed liquid srb culture to the test tubes in addition sodium succinate solution 100 mg ml was added

required succinate concentration was calculated according to eq 2 assuming that all the added succinate was utilized for the reduction of the so4 2 attached to the resins however some of the succinate was consumed for biomass formation bounaga et al 2022 according to eq 3 and some was utilized by microbes other than srb in the mixed culture to minimize the growth of other microbes the amount of

the sterile medium were incubated for each period the ph and redox potential eh of the liquid srb cultures and the sterile medium were measured before and after the bioregeneration an iq150 ph dual technology meter equipped with a phenomenal orp220 ag agcl 3 m kcl electrode was used for measuring the eh for reference to a standard hydrogen electrode 208 mv agcl ag potential at 20 c was added to the recorded eh values sawyer et al 1995 in addition the concentration of so4 2 was measured from the sterile modified postgate medium used in the abiotic control tests before and after the regeneration cycles once the target regeneration time was reached the regenerated resins were soaked several times in sterile milli q water and used again for the removal of so4 2 from the sterile synthetic na2so4 solution the achieved so4 2 exchange capacities were calculated using eq 1 and the rates of so4 2 removal from resin were calculated by dividing the capacity reached by the regeneration time used after the third bioregeneration cycle resins incubated with the srb cultures for 7 days were soaked in milli q water dried at 60 c overnight and analyzed by xps and fesem resins bioregenerated for 1 day were tested for 14 day bioregeneration to investigate the maximal bioregeneration efficiency finally all the bioregenerated resins excluding resins analyzed by xps and fesem were chemically regenerated by mixing them for 1 h in 5 ml of 0 5 m naoh to confirm the residual amount of so4 2 attached to the resins the contact time and the concentration of naoh were selected according to the manufacturer s recommendation the residual so4 2 amount was measured from the spent naoh solution using the cuvette test method 2 3 column tests ion exchange and bioregeneration with the pure srb culture were tested in two parallel column set ups for three exhaustion bioregeneration cycles both columns were 30 cm long and had an inner diameter of 1 9 cm resulting in a volume of 83 6 cm3 the columns were sealed with pieces of cotton wool at both ends and filled with quartz sand up to a height of 13 cm particle size 0 5 1 mm in the middle of the columns 3 5 cm of amberjet 4200 cl resin was added resulting in a bed volume of 9 9 cm3 pieces of cotton wool were added to the top and bottom of the resin bed to avoid the resin mixing with the quartz sand the mass of the resin was 6

ml min was used for both columns resulting in an empty bed contact time of approximately 5 min the effluent solution was collected in 20 ml fractions until saturation capacity was reached the exhausted columns were rinsed with 200 ml of sterile milli q water the so4 2 concentration of the wash water was analyzed and considered in the mass balance calculations the residual so4 2

gas to maintain anaerobic conditions in addition one cycle of abiotic control tests was performed using the sterile modified postgate medium instead of the srb culture after the bioregeneration

originating from the cultivation medium and with 1 l of 1 mm naoh to return the ph to a neutral level the so4 2 concentration was measured from the srb preculture before bioregeneration and from the

the batch tests 2 4 characterization of the resins x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem were used for examining the surface properties of the

batch bioregeneration tests the genomic dna of the microbial strains was isolated from the cell pellets using the standard protocol qiagen 2017 the srb cultures were characterized by 16s rrna sequencing at the biocenter oulu sequencing center as described previously by virpiranta et al 2019 the obtained sequences were compared with those present in genbank using a blast tool national center for biotechnology information u s national library of medicine u s 3 results and discussion 3 1 batch tests the original so4 2 exchange capacity of the amberjet 4200 cl resin determined in batch ion exchange tests was 112 4 mg g which is of the same order of magnitude as the theoretical capacity of 1 30 eq l 93 mg g for so4 2 reported by the manufacturer however the original capacity was not achieved in the batch bioregeneration test and some loss in resin capacity was detected even with the longest bioregeneration time of 14 days table 1 after 14 days of bioregeneration with pure or mixed srb cultures the so4 2 exchange capacities achieved were 103 4 mg g and 94 4 mg g respectively bioregeneration efficiency clearly increased with the bioregeneration time the same effect was also detected by ren et al 2017 when a perchlorate laden biosorbent was regenerated by a perchlorate reducing bacterial culture in the case of the abiotic control tests 16 4 mg g of the resin capacity was regenerated and the regeneration time did not have any effect on the regeneration efficiency the amount of residual so4 2 attached to the resins after the last bioregeneration cycle decreased when the bioregeneration time increased as expected after two days of bioregeneration with pure and mixed cultures 24 1 mg g and 24 3 mg g of residual so4 2 were attached to the resins 41 2 and 43 6 of the so4 2 exchange capacity respectively after 14 days of bioregeneration the amounts of residual so4 2 were only 2 1 mg g 2 1 with the pure culture and 12 9 mg g 13 10 with the mixed culture however the removal of so4 2 from resin was fastest during the first day of bioregeneration after which the removal rate decreased significantly table 1 bioregeneration is controlled by the mass transfer of so4 2 ions from the resin and by the sulfate reduction kinetics venkatesan et al 2010 the decrease in the bioregeneration rate was probably a consequence of the slower detachment of ions attached deeper inside the resin venkatesan and batista 2011 the so4 2 ions present on the resin surface were readily detached from the resin and easily available for the srb but once the detached ions had been reduced the removal of the remaining ions was slower the microbial sulfate reduction rate srr is dependent on the so4 2 concentration venkatesan et al 2010 reduction is faster with the higher initial so4 2 concentrations and slows down with decreasing concentrations in addition one reason for the decreasing srr might be the bacterial inhibition caused by the increasing concentration of h2s kushkevych et al 2019 the so4 2 removal capacities achieved after 1 4 7 and 14 days of bioregeneration are shown in fig 1 when the pure srb culture was used for bioregeneration somewhat higher bioregeneration efficiency was achieved and the loss in capacity was smaller after 14 days of bioregeneration than when using the mixed culture table 1 fig 1 in the pure culture the available carbon source was utilized only by srb which increased the efficiency of sulfate reduction however the bioregeneration efficiency notably decreased after the third bioregeneration cycle with the pure culture probably due to the clogging of the resin pores by iron sulfide precipitates and organics e g bacterial debris sharbatmaleki and batista 2012 the accumulation of iron sulfide on the resin beads was visually observed when using the mixed srb culture there was some variation between the bioregeneration efficiencies in the second bioregeneration cycle the variation between the bioregeneration efficiencies of the different cycles might also have been caused by the difference in incubation time of the srb precultures the longer incubation time of the preculture used in the second bioregeneration cycle might have increased the relative abundancy of bacteria other than srb in the mixed culture in the case of the pure culture the growth of srb might not yet have been in the exponential phase in the third cycle when a shorter preculture incubation time was used with both srb cultures the best bioregeneration was achieved after the longest bioregeneration time the ph of the treated na2so4 solution increased in the exhaustion cycles with the bioregenerated resin from 6 7 0 5 to around 9 fig 1 when the pure srb culture was used for bioregeneration the ph of the treated solution was clearly the highest when the bioregeneration time was the longest and thus the majority of the resin attached so4 2 was most probably exchanged for ions present in the liquid srb culture fig 1a for example the hs formed in so4 2 reduction might have attached to the resin in the bioregeneration cycle and been exchanged for so4 2 in the anion exchange cycle at neutral ph approximately half of sulfide was in the form of h2s thus association of hs with h might have resulted in the increase in ph in addition hco3 was formed in so4 2 reduction and might have attached to the resin in the case of the abiotic control tests no change in the ph was detected and it is likely that the resin attached so4 2 was partly exchanged for the cl ions present in the modified postgate medium the selectivity of an ion exchange resin is highly dependent on the functional group of the resin the trimethyl ammonium groups of the amberjet 4200 cl resin favor divalent ions such as so4 2 the uptake of which requires two closely spaced positively charged groups clifford and weber 1983 the order of the sba resin affinity for ions is so4 2 cl hco3 acetate oh dupont 2019a the sba resin affinity for hs has not been reported however as a divalent ion it is likely that so4 2 is selected over hs but the selectivity is also dependent on the concentration of ions since an equilibrium state between the ions in solution and the ions on the resin is reached ghurye et al 1999 moreover cotrino 2006 achieved successful removal of hs together with so4 2 from groundwater using a macroporous sba resin in cl form which indicates a higher affinity towards hs than cl in contrast with the mixed srb culture there was not such a clear association but the ph of the treated na2so4 solution increased close to 9 regardless of the bioregeneration time fig 1b during the batch bioregeneration experiment there was also a slight but not significant increase in the ph of the srb solutions and the eh decreased significantly in both the pure and mixed srb cultures table 2 the changes in ph and eh indicate the activity of srb as the microbial sulfidogenesis eq 2 consumes proton acidity h and produces hs which acts as a reducing agent delaune and reddy 2005 during the abiotic control tests no change was detected in ph eh or so4 2 concentration of the modified postgate medium 3 2 column tests the original saturation capacity of the anion exchange columns containing 6 65 g of amberjet 4200 cl resin for so4 2 2 g l was 60 10 mg g which is somewhat lower than the reported theoretical capacity of 1 30 eq l 93 mg g for so4 2 however after the second anion exchange bioregeneration cycle the saturation capacity increased to 111 4 mg g without circulation of the srb solution through the columns column test 1 and to 102 5 0 2 mg g with circulation of the srb solution column test 2 after the third cycle saturation capacities stood at 104 7 0 6 mg g column test 1 and 70 0 0 2 mg g column test 2 in the case of the abiotic control tests the saturation capacities were 63 1 mg g column test 1 and 52 7 mg g column test 2 after one anion exchange regeneration cycle according to the results of the naoh regeneration of the bioregenerated resins there was 6 mg g and 14 mg g of residual so4 2 attached to the resins after the third cycle in column tests 1 and 2 respectively however as only resin from one column was chemically regenerated in both column tests 1 and 2 the other column was sampled for characterization the repeatability of the result cannot be evaluated the amount of reduced so4 2 in bioregeneration decreased after the second cycle and even more radically in column test 2 fig 2 during bioregeneration with circulation of the srb solution column test 2 the ph of the srb solution increased from 7 6 0 2 to 8 2 0 2 and the eh decreased from 70 30 to 77 12 which refers to srb activity however in the third bioregeneration cycle the so4 2 attached to the resins was not reduced but only detached into the srb solution fig 2 since there is a notable difference in size between the bacterial cells approx 1 µm and the pores of gel type resins approx 1 nm bacteria do not enter the resin pores during bioregeneration but the ions are likely to be detached from the functional groups of the resins and biodegraded in the liquid dupont 2019b sharbatmaleki et al 2015 venkatesan and batista 2011 as mentioned in section 3 1 bioregeneration is controlled by the mass transfer of so4 2 ions from the resin and by the sulfate reduction kinetics in the third bioregeneration cycle in column test 2 the sulfate reduction was negligible and thus the mass transfer of resin attached so4 2 also decreased the bioregeneration efficiency was similar to the efficiency in the abiotic control tests as expected sulfate reduction is affected by the relative quantity of srb and the presence of h2s kushkevych et al 2019 2015 a different srb preculture was used in each bioregeneration cycle the precultivation time varied from five to six weeks and the amount of liquid culture contacting the resin was larger when the culture was circulated through the column in column test 2 all of which affected the number of active srb cells and concentration of so4 2 and h2s in the culture during bioregeneration the so4 2 ions present in the liquid srb culture interfered with the mass transfer and reduction of resin attached so4 2 ions which was probably the main reason for the better performance in column test 1 a slightly higher regeneration efficiency was also achieved in column test 1 in the case of the abiotic control tests the sulfate breakthrough curves in the ion exchange stage are shown in fig 3 and s1 with the fresh amberjet 4200 cl resin no so4 2 was detected in the initial fractions of the column experiment the breakthrough curve is an ideal s shaped curve which is due to a rapid and effective anion exchange during the initial phase with the bioregenerated resins the breakthrough is achieved earlier and the curves ascend more gently however with the fresh resin the saturation point was achieved much faster than with the bioregenerated resins and the bioregeneration increased the total saturation capacity of the resin the reason for this might be that the fresh resin was not fully hydrated in the case of the abiotic control tests the breakthrough started immediately but the saturation point was not achieved as quickly as with the fresh resin fig s1 the form of the resin probably affected the so4 2 exchange performance the fresh resin was in cl form whereas after bioregeneration the resin contained ions from so4 2 reduction e g hco3 and hs and the cultivation medium e g cl the ions were further replaced with cl ions from the hcl rinse and partly with hydroxide oh ions from naoh rinse although the concentrations of hcl and naoh solutions were remarkably low some differences were observed in the exhaustion cycles of the bioregenerated resins in column test 1 the plateau of so4 2 concentration occurred at approximately the same time in cycles 2 and 3 while in column test 2 it occurred much earlier for cycle 3 than for cycle 2 in column test 2 the amount of residual so4 2 had probably increased after the second bioregeneration cycle resulting in the earlier plateau in cycle 3 however this could not be confirmed as the residual so4 2 was analyzed from the resins only after the third bioregeneration cycle as in the batch experiments the ph of the treated na2so4 solution increased when so4 2 was removed and started to slowly decrease after the breakthrough of the column fig 4 the high increase in ph at the beginning of the exhaustion cycle was also detected in the abiotic control tests fig s2 which probably indicates the presence of oh ions in the regenerated resins resulting from the naoh rinse however in column test 1 there was a large difference between the ph of the two columns at the beginning of cycle 2 fig 4a 3 3 characterization of the resins the surface composition of the fresh and bioregenerated resins analyzed by eds and xps are summarized in table 3 and table s1 respectively the sampling depth of eds was approximately 1 µm whereas the xps signal was collected from the top 1 10 nm from the sample surface which explains the differences between the surface composition results a clear increase in the proportion of oxygen on the surface of resin beads were detected by eds after bioregeneration when compared to the fresh resin according to xps the proportion of o increased in the column tests and the proportion of c increased in the batch tests in the column experiments the ions attached to the resins during bioregeneration were probably further exchanged for cl and partly for oh during the rinse with 10 mm hcl and 1 mm naoh eds detected small proportions of cl in all the bioregenerated samples and in the sulfate laden resin according to both eds and xps cl was present especially in the fresh resin which was originally in cl form according to the xps survey spectrum the fresh resin also contained fluorine nitrogen present in the trimethyl ammonium groups was not detected by eds due to the low energy x rays produced by n atoms heath and taylor 2015 xps detected n in all the samples and the proportion was largest in the resins bioregenerated in batch tests some of the n might have originated from the modified postgate medium used as a cultivation medium for the microbes according to the eds results s was present in all the bioregenerated samples as expected since not all of the so4 2 was removed in the bioregeneration also the soluble hs formed via so4 2 reduction might have partly attached to the resins the smallest proportion of s was detected in the resins from column test 1 in which the bioregeneration was most successful xps clearly detected s in the resins bioregenerated in the batch tests but only a small s2p peak was observed in the high resolution s2p spectrum of the resins from the column tests the high resolution s2p xps spectra of the batch test samples indicate the presence of three sulfur species fig s3 the s2p3 2 peaks at 167 5 ev pure srb culture or 167 6 ev mixed srb culture probably correspond to sulfite al abed et al 2017 the sulfide peak at the lower binding energy is wide and shows two different sulfide species with s2p3 2 peaks at 161 4 ev and 163 3 ev fantauzzi et al 2015 both phosphorus and iron were detected by eds analysis in the resins bioregenerated in the batch tests p and fe originated from the modified postgate medium in the column tests the p and fe attached to the resins during bioregeneration were most likely rinsed out with hcl however xps also detected fe in the fresh resin and resins bioregenerated in the column experiments according to xps the batch test sample bioregenerated with the pure srb culture contained a small proportion of sodium originating from the cultivation medium both eds and xps detected aluminum in all the samples probably originating from the fresh resin the silicon present in all the resin samples is most likely to be contamination originating from several different sources e g storage containers as si is commonly found in the surface agents used in the manufacture of plastic items r d editors 2004 an unexpected presence of silica sio2 detected in styrene divinylbenzene resin was previously reported by riley et al 2021 the proportion of si was highest in resins bioregenerated in the column experiments some of which could have originated from the quartz sand used for filling up the columns the surface morphologies of the fresh and bioregenerated resins are shown in fig 5 the surfaces of the bioregenerated resins clearly contain small particles most probably consisting of bacterial debris and iron sulfide the resins bioregenerated in column mode contain more particles probably since the resin beads were tightly packed in the columns and the bacterial debris was not so easily rinsed out whereas in the batch tests resins were soaked in sterile milli q water after bioregeneration also the surface of the resin bioregenerated with the mixed srb culture had more particles than the resin bioregenerated with pure culture in the batch tests in the mixed culture more biofilm consisting of microbial cells and extracellular polymeric substances eps might have formed and attached to the resin surface due to the greater diversity of the microbial culture 3 4 16s rrna sequencing the mixed srb consortium consisted mostly of firmicutes proteobacteria and bacteroidetes after seven day bioregeneration the relative abundance of srb was 22 3 0 2 of the total bacteria in three parallel bioregeneration experiments most of the srb were characterized as desulfobulbus sp deltaproteobacteria although some desulfovibrio mexicanus deltaproteobacteria and peptococcaceae firmicutes were also present other significantly abundant bacteria in the culture were macellibacteroides fermentans 4 0 0 9 lactic acid bacteria carnobacteriaceae 57 5 and clostridia 12 5 compared to the original enrichment culture the abundance of srb mainly desulfobulbus sp somewhat increased and the abundance of the family carnobacteriaceae increased significantly during the seven day bioregeneration in the original culture trichococcus sp belonging to the family carnobacteriaceae was present trichococcus sp is known to hydrolyze macromolecular organic compounds jin et al 2018 wang et al 2018 in addition trichococcus shcherbakoviae was isolated from a propionate oxidizing bacterial consortium growing in a low temperature anaerobic bioreactor parshina et al 2019 it is very likely that propionate was produced from succinate during the bioregeneration by other bacteria present in the culture as was also supposed in previous studies virpiranta et al 2022 2021 2019 which further supported the growth of carnobacteriaceae no significant change was detected in the abundance of clostridia nor that of macellibacteroides fermentans both of which were also present in the original enrichment culture the abundance of bacteria other than srb involved in the sulfur cycle namely halothiobacillus sp geobacter sp arcobacter sp and sulfurospirillum sp was not significant after the seven day bioregeneration 1 8 1 1 whereas halothiobacillus sp and arcobacter sp in particular were abundant in the original culture halothiobacillus spp and arcobacter sulfidicus are known to oxidize sulfide to elemental sulfur whaley martin et al 2019 wirsen et al 2002 their abundance was also high in reactor experiments when soluble hs was available for oxidation virpiranta et al 2022 consequently the low abundance of these bacteria is attributable to the limited availability of soluble hs in the bacterial solution during bioregeneration the pure srb culture isolated from the mixed culture was identified as belonging to the family desulfobulbaceae the only bacterial species belonging to desulfobulbaceae present in the mixed culture was desulfobulbus sp during the seven day bioregeneration experiment the bacterial distribution did not change in the pure culture 3 5 implications of the study it has been suggested that microbial products and eps attached to the resin during bioregeneration decrease the exchange capacity of the resin in the subsequent ion exchange stage ren et al 2017 contamination of the resin is one of the biggest challenges in bioregeneration in several studies organics clogging the resin pores have been removed by soaking the bioregenerated resin with hypochlorite clo solution ren et al 2017 sharbatmaleki and batista 2012 venkatesan et al 2010 in the column experiments the resins were rinsed in tightly packed columns and thus removal of bacterial debris might have been insufficient biofouling was successfully removed with a more intense procedure by venkatesan et al 2010 who rinsed the bioregenerated column several times with 2 m nacl 0 5 m naoh and deionized water to remove organics and further disinfected the column with naocl solution ebrahimi and roberts 2013 avoided biofouling of the resin by enclosing the resin in a membrane to prevent direct contact with the bacterial culture during bioregeneration however it was concluded that in practice this application could only be used for resins sold in membrane cartridges a small amount of sulfate accumulated in the resins in the column experiments which might be due to some of the ions being attached to resins at a depth which is beyond the reach of the microbes ren et al 2017 sharbatmaleki and batista 2012 nevertheless in column test 1 the capacity loss after the third anion exchange bioregeneration cycle was only around 6 and according to previous bioregeneration studies it can be assumed that the capacity loss would not significantly increase even after several bioregeneration cycles bae and nam 2014 tested four cycles of bioregeneration for nitrate and sulfate laden sba resin and the exchange capacity decreased only 5 9 12 and 19 after the bioregeneration cycles ebrahimi and roberts 2013 bioregenerated nitrate laden sba resin four times without any capacity loss and after six bioregeneration cycles only 6 loss in capacity was detected sharbatmaleki and batista 2012 reported a loss of approximately 15 in the capacity of bioregenerated perchlorate laden sba resin the resin was bioregenerated for five cycles and the accumulation of perchlorate was significant during the first two cycles after which the accumulation somewhat stabilized it is recommended to use 0 50 1 25 m naoh solution for the regeneration of amberjet 4200 cl resin in this study solutions with much lower concentration 10 mm hcl and 1 mm naoh were used for cleaning the resin after bioregeneration in column mode in the batch tests the bioregenerated resins were soaked in water only to gently remove bacteria from the surfaces of the resin beads the amount of hcl and naoh used for washing the bioregenerated column should be optimized in further studies one benefit of biological regeneration is that no actual waste brine is produced since so4 2 is detached from the resin and partly reduced in the column and the remainder would be circulated to a sulfidogenic bioreactor after the bioregeneration cycle however regeneration with naoh is clearly faster since according to the manufacturer the minimum contact time with the resin is only 20 minutes in this study a bioregeneration time of 24 h was used in the column tests and the contact time should be further optimized on the other hand the time used for regeneration is not often that critical since another batch can be utilized for water purification during the regeneration of one resin batch use of naoh might also be more cost efficient than feeding srb with easily utilizable carbon sources e g organic acids however sufficient srrs can be achieved by feeding the bacteria with low cost carbon sources e g conditioned sewage sludge virpiranta et al 2021 as a next step the bioregeneration of exhausted resins could be tested in a hybrid process comprising a continuously operated sulfidogenic bioreactor and an ion exchange column the hybrid process should also be tested with actual miws to ensure the performance of the process dissolved metals in the miws could be precipitated using h2s gas produced in the bioreactor virpiranta et al 2022 before feeding the water to the ion exchange column the exhausted column could be further regenerated by feeding the reactor liquid through the column in the actual process hcl and naoh solutions used for cleaning the bioregenerated resin could be partially circulated through the column to minimize consumption 4 conclusions sulfate laden gel type strong base anion exchange resin was bioregenerated using a viable pure or mixed sulfate reducing bacterial culture in batch mode bioregeneration was slightly more effective with the pure sulfate reducing bacterial culture in column mode bioregeneration the sulfate attached to the resin was mainly reduced by the bacteria but part of it was only detached from the resins the reduction of the resin attached sulfate was more efficient when the column was filled with liquid sulfate reducing bacterial culture and the culture was not circulated through the column when the bioregenerated resins were used for sulfate removal the ph of the treated solution increased significantly which is probably attributed to the replacement of the resin attached sulfate with the ions present in the liquid sulfate reducing bacterial culture and hydroxide ions resulting from naoh rinsing in column mode the hypothesis is also supported by the increase in the amount of oxygen on the surface of the resin beads detected by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy bioregeneration of sulfate laden resins could be further tested for treatment of actual mining impacted waters in a hybrid process comprising a sulfidogenic bioreactor and an ion exchange column credit authorship contribution statement hanna virpiranta data curation

15532,it was shown that dissimilatory arsenate as v respiring prokaryotes darps play important roles in driving the formation of arsenic contaminated groundwater however because it is tough to isolate cultivable darps the physiological and functional features of darps have not been fully elucidated yet this impedes a deep understanding of the mechanisms for the dynamic fluctuations of as concentrations in contaminated groundwater here four new darps were isolated from as contaminated aquifers using the microbial enrichment technique which were referred to as bacillus sp z01 bacillus sp z02 achromobacter sp z03 and intrasporangium sp z04 we found that the presence of as v significantly inhibited the growth of z03 and z04 but promoted the growth of z01 and z02 the four strains possess significant as v no3 and fe iii respiring activities however their activities and preferred electron donors differ greatly no3 was finally reduced to no2 by z01 and z02 and to n2o and n2 by z03 and z04 the optimal ph value for their as v respiring activity was 5 for z01 and 4 for z02 z03 and z04 whereas their optimal temperature varied between 30 and 37 c microcosm assays with as contaminated sediments and scorodite suggested that the four darp strains had highly differential activities to reduce and mobilize solid as v under anaerobic conditions although the four darps have high soluble as v respiring activities their activities to mobilize solid as are negligibly low accounting for only 0 006 0 484 of their each corresponding soluble as v respiring activity moreover extreme inconsistency between the size orders of their activities to respire soluble as v and to catalyze as reductive mobilization was observed it is interesting to see that z04 had high as v respiring activity but had little ability to catalyze the reductive mobilization of as and fe these observations suggest that as v respiring activity is required but not enough to catalyze the reductive mobilization of solid as v these findings provide new knowledge about the physiological and functional features of darps and are helpful for a better understanding of the roles of darps in reductive mobilization and release of as from solid phase into groundwater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords groundwater aquifer and sediment arsenic contamination dissimilatory

earth with an average content of 2 3 mg kg singh et al 2015 originally most as in the crust is immobile and almost nontoxic existing as components of minerals or being adsorbed on the surfaces of minerals soils and other sorbents goldberg et al 2002 clancy et al 2013 however under the effects of microbial chemical and physical factors as well as human activities as in solid phase would be mobilized and released to the environment leading to the contaminations of groundwater nath et al 2009 duan et al 2019 jiang et al 2013 wang et al 2019 islam et al 2004 pi et al 2018 although many factors are involved dissimilatory as v respiring prokaryotes darps were shown to be one of the main players in driving the reductive mobilization and release of as from solid phase into groundwater yin et al 2022 zhu et al 2014 some studies suggest that darps are able to directly reduce as v present in solid phase and thus promote the releases of as to liquid phase cai et al 2020 kudo et al 2013 kawa et al 2019 under anaerobic conditions darps are able to reduce as v coupled to oxidation of some electron donors including small organic acids glucose sulfide and hydrogen hollibaugh et al 2006

huang et al 2011 cn 32 was also capable of reducing fe iii huang et al 2018 although a number of darps were isolated and characterized little is known about the functional and physiological features of different darps from the environment so far this markedly impedes a deep understanding of the roles of darps in the mobilization and release of arsenic from solid phase moreover we found that microbial community in the environment had extremely strong activity to catalyze arsenic mobilization chen et al 2020 however darps only account for less than 1 of the total microbes xu et al unpublished data this suggests that some microbes other than darps may also have the activity to catalyze arsenic mobilization we thus proposed that the activities of darps to respire soluble as v cannot be used to predict their activities to mobilize solid as v and the relationship between the two kinds of activities of darps should be re evaluated to address the above issues we performed physiological and functional comparisons of four darps from as contaminated aquifers the findings of this work would help to better understand the microbial mechanisms by which as v in solid phase was reductively mobilized and released into groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 collection of as contaminated sediments arsenic contaminated sedimental samples were collected from a depth of 12 m by drilling a 20 m hole with a diameter of 20 cm using direct mud rotary drilling method the sampling site was located at a shimen realgar mine affected area 29 38 53 n 111 02 18 e the samples were taken from the core of a big sediment clod and immediately placed to an anaerobic bag all the bags were kept at 0 4 c and mailed to the lab immediately 2 2 chemical analysis total organic carbon and nitrogen were analyzed on multi n c 3100 analytikjena germany total as and fe concentrations in solid samples were measured on icp ms inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry after the samples were dried ground into fine powder and treated with aqua regia solution incubating at 90 c for 120 min the detection limit of this method for as fe was 1 0 μg l to determine soluble as species in sediments the samples were dried ground into fine powders and mixed with sterile water in a tube the tube was vigorously vortexed and centrifuged supernatant was collected for measurement of the concentrations of soluble as iii and as v as v was removed by lc sax spe 57017 supelco usa total soluble as and as iii were measured on afs atomic fluorescence spectroscopy and as v was thus determined by subtraction of as iii from the total soluble as concentrations of no3 no2 and so4 2 were determined on ion chromatography as a routine method soluble fe ii was determined with ferrozine reagent while fe iii was reduced to fe ii with hydroxylamine hydrochloride for further analysis using the same reagent viollier et al 2000 nh4 was analyzed with nessler assay kim et al 2006 2 3 isolation of new darp strains from the aquifers an enrichment technique was used to isolate darps from arsenic contaminated aquifers as described previously chen et al 2020 in brief to prepare active microcosms about 1 5 g of sedimental samples was mixed with 13 5 ml of minimal mineral mm medium supplemented with 2 0 mm as v and 5 0 mm pyruvate lactate acetate and citrate in a 20 ml tube under anaerobic conditions the tubes were incubated at 30 c with shaking after all as v was completely reduced approximately 2 ml of the cultures was removed from the anaerobic tubes and mixed with 13 5 ml of fresh mm medium amended with the same supplements the tube was incubated for a second round of enrichment under anaerobic conditions after 4 rounds of enrichments about 300 μl of the cultures was collected from the tube for isolation of single bacterial strains using the hungate rolling tube technique all colonies were picked up and cultured under anaerobic conditions a pair of primers 27f and 1492r was used to amplify their 16 s rrna genes luo et al 2012 a dna fingerprinting technique was used to detect repetitive 16 s rrna genes torres et al 2016 strains with different 16 s rrna genes were selected for further analysis 2 4 analysis of the 16 s rrna genes of the isolated darps pcr reactions with 27f and 1492r primers luo et al 2012 were used to amplify the 16 s rrna genes from all the darps pcr products were directly sent to commercial dna sequencing company for sequence analysis each 16 s rrna gene sequence of the isolates was used as a query to search against the ezbiocloud database using the blast tool a phylogenetic tree was thus constructed with the 16 s rrna gene sequences of darp strains and their closely related bacterial strains from ezbiocloud using neighbor joining method mu et al 2019 2 5 determination of the effects of as v on the growth of darps an appropriate amount of bacterial cell cultures was added to the anaerobic tubes containing oxygen free lb medium to a final cell density of 1 0 107 cells ml amended with 0 1 6 12 18 24 or 30 mm as v all the tubes were incubated at 30 c the bacterial growth processes were examined by measuring the cell density at intervals of 1 day 2 6 analysis of the bacterial soluble as v respiring activity to evaluate the effects of phs on the bacterial soluble as v respiring activity bacterial cells were inoculated into eight anaerobic tubes with oxygen free mm medium to a final cell density of 1 0 107 cells ml amended with 2 0 mm as v and 6 0 mm darp strain preferred electron donor adjusted to a ph value of 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 or 10 0 respectively the same tubes without inoculations were prepared as controls the tubes were incubated at 30 c under anaerobic conditions to determine the effects of temperatures on the bacterial soluble as v respiring activity bacterial cells were inoculated into the tubes containing oxygen free mm medium supplemented with 2 0 mm as v and 6 0 mm darp strain preferred electron donor all the tubes were incubated at 4 22 30 37 45 or 55 c under anaerobic conditions to detect the as v reduction reactions about 0 3 ml of mixtures was collected from the tubes for examination of the arsenic species at intervals of 24 h 2 7 effects of darps on the mobilization of arsenic from as bearing sediments and scorodite sedimental samples were dried both sediments and scorodite were thoroughly ground into fine powder with mortar and pestle and washed to remove soluble as especially as iii after being centrifuged the precipitations were dried and 0 5 g of the solid particles was taken for determination of the as v concentrations of the samples appropriate amount of solid particles was added to 20 0 ml mm medium to a final solid as v concentration of 2 0 mm the mixtures were amended with 6 0 mm darp strain preferred electron donor such as lactate pyruvate acetate or citrate the mixtures were treated by argon purging for removal of oxygen and then autoclaved bacterial cells at log phase were inoculated into the anaerobic tubes to a final cell density of 1 0 107 cells ml autoclaved mixtures were prepared as parallel controls all tubes were incubated at 30 c with shaking under anaerobic conditions at an interval of 3 or 6 days 0 2 ml of the cultures was collected from the tubes for examination of as and fe species 2 8 a comparison of the bacterial activities to reduce fe iii and no3 under anaerobic conditions each of darp strains in log phase was inoculated to two anaerobic tubes with mm medium containing 2 0 mm darp strain preferred electron donor which were amended with 2 0 mm fe iii and nano3 respectively the same mixtures without inoculation of bacterial cells were prepared as controls all the experiments were performed in triplicate under anaerobic conditions all tubes were incubated at 30 c with shaking at an interval of 1 or 4 days 0 4 ml of cultures was collected from the tubes for determination of the concentrations of no3 no2 nh4 or fe ii as well as the bacterial cell numbers about 0 2 ml of headspace gas was collected for determination of the n2o concentration using gc gas chromatography 3 results 3 1 isolation and characterization of four new darps from the as contaminated aquifers the sedimental samples consisted of fine sand silt and clay with grayish brown color the samples had high contents of total as 1 6 g kg soluble as 137 2 mg kg fe 15 7 g kg total organic carbon toc 5 3 g kg and total nitrogen tn 0 1 g kg but low contents of so4 2 36 9 mg kg no3 11 6 mg kg and nh4 35 3 mg kg table s1 microcosm assays showed that the sediments had strong as v reducing activities when 5 0 mm lactate pyruvate acetate and citrate were each added to the microcosms as electron donors after 8 0 days of anaerobic incubation approximately 90 1 75 9 49 5 or 65 1 as v converted to as iii respectively fig s1 afterwards the microbial community could have consumed all the nutrition in the mixtures and thus the reduction of as v was ended fig s1 based on the above finding microbial enrichment technique was used to isolated cultivable darp strains from the as contaminated sedimental samples by using a mixture of lactate pyruvate acetate and citrate as electron donors approximately 200 bacterial colonies were obtained from the enriched cultures after excluding the repetitive strains and the strains with no significant soluble as v respiring activities we obtained four darp strains z01 z02 z03 and z04 from the sedimental samples phylogenetic analysis of their 16 s rrna genes suggests that the four isolates are affiliated to the genera bacillus bacillus achromobacter intrasporangium and thus referred to as bacillus sp z01 bacillus sp z02 achromobacter sp z03 and intrasporangium sp z04 respectively fig 1 z01 and z02 are affiliated to the phylum firmicutes while z03 and z04 are affiliated to proteobacteria and actinobacteria respectively to the best of our knowledge achromobacter sp z03 is the first darp strain of the genus achromobacter whereas intrasporangium sp z04 is the first darp strain of the phylum actinobacteria the highest homology between the 16 s rrna genes of z04 and other intrasporangium members is only 96 1 suggesting that z01 could represent a new species of this genus 3 2 as v respiring activities and preferences for electron donors of the four darps as shown in fig 2 all the four strains have significant soluble as v respiring activities z01 z02 and z04 needed 72 72 and 60 h for completely reducing 2 0 mm as v respectively fig 2a 2b and 2d in comparison after 96 h of anaerobic incubation z03 only reduced 64 5 of 2 0 mm as v fig 2c this suggests that the order of the bacterial soluble as v respiring activities is z04 z02 z01 z03 when their own preferred electron donors were used in the reactions as shown in table 1 we found that when as v was added as electron acceptor the four strains had different preferences for electron donors all the four strains can utilize lactate pyruvate citrate yeast extracts sucrose and glucose as the sole electron donor except for z02 all other three strains can use acetate except for z04 all others can use glycerol z03 and z04 can use ethanol but z01 and z02 cannot only z04 can use formate others cannot all the four strains cannot use oxalate and methanol as the sole electron donor 3 3 effects of as v on the growth of the four darp strains we inoculated bacterial cells into the anaerobic tubes containing lb medium to a final cell density of 1 0 107 cells ml amended with 0 1 6 12 18 24 or 30 mm as v the tubes were incubated under anaerobic conditions and the cell densities were determined by detecting the od600 values of the cultures at intervals of a day fig s2a shows the growth curve of z01 after 6 0 days the order of bacterial od600 at different concentrations of as v is od6 mm od1 mm od12 mm od18 mm od0 mm od24 mm od30 mm this suggests that lower concentrations of as v 18 mm significantly promoted the growth of z01 in a concentration dependent manner and 24 mm as v completely inhibited the bacterial growth similarly as v at 6 or 1 mm significantly promoted the growth of z02 whereas as v at 12 18 24 and 30 mm significantly inhibited the bacterial growth in a concentration dependent manner fig s2b fig s2c 2d show the growth curve of z03 and z04 we found that the order of bacterial od600 at different concentrations of as v for both strains is od0 mm od1 mm od6 mm od12 mm od18 mm od24 mm od30 mm suggesting that as v markedly inhibited the growth of both z03 and z04 in a concentration dependent manner 3 4 effects of ph values on the soluble as v respiring activities of the four darps we found that ph values had markedly different effects on the soluble as v respiring activities of the four darps fig 3 as shown in fig 3a the optimal ph for z01 was 5 in comparison under phs of 6 7 or 4 the bacterial activities declined to 90 63 or 51 of the bacterial optimal activity respectively under phs of 8 9 or 3 the activities declined to only less than 10 of the optimal activity as shown in fig 3b z02 was more tolerant to low phs its optimal ph was 4 under phs of 5 6 7 or 3 the bacterial activities declined to 83 55 50 or 43 of the optimal activity of this strain respectively under ph 8 or 9 the activities declined to only less than 5 of the optimal activity the optimal ph for z03 was also 4 fig 3c z03 displayed much lower optimal as v respiring activities than the other three strains after 60 h of anaerobic incubation under phs of 4 5 6 7 and 3 only 43 40 35 19 and 24 of 2 0 mm as v were reduced respectively as shown in fig 3d the optimal ph for z04 was 4 however under the ph values of 5 6 7 or 3 the bacterial activities declined by only 3 7 25 or 15 of the optimal activities respectively this suggests that z04 is the most tolerant to acidic conditions among the four strains taken together the results suggest that the optimal phs of the four strains were 4 or 5 and they overall preferred slightly acidic conditions under alkaline or extremely acidic conditions the bacterial activities dramatically declined 3 5 effects of temperatures on the as v respiring activities of the four darps as shown in fig 4 a z01 had the highest as v respiring activity at 30 c and 37 c while at 22 c its activity declined to 85 of the highest level this suggests that the optimal temperature for the activity of z01 fell into a wide range between 30 and 37 c z02 also had the highest as v respiring activity at 30 c when the temperature was 37 c and 22 c the bacterial activity declined to 97 and 90 of the highest activity respectively fig 4b differently z03 had the highest activity at 37 c and when the temperature was 30 and 22 c the bacterial activity declined to 75 and 25 of the highest activity respectively fig 4c the optimal temperature for z04 was also between 30 to 37 c z04 looked more sensitive to the temperature change than z01 and z02 when the temperature was 22 c the bacterial activity of z04 dramatically declined to only 10 of the highest level fig 4d for all the four strains when the temperature was 4 c 45 c or 55 c the bacterial activities declined into less than 5 of the highest levels these results suggest that the optimal temperature of darps in this study was 30 or 37 c and each strain demonstrated different tolerance to nonoptimal temperatures 3 6 different activities of the four darp strains to reduce and mobilize as v in sediments we compared the effects of the four darp strains on the reductive mobilization of as and fe from as contaminated sediments as shown in fig 5 a z01 had high activities to catalyze reductive mobilization and release of as iii and fe ii from as contaminated sediments after 24 days of anaerobic incubation approximately 60 32 μm as iii and 0 19 mm fe ii were released from the sediments z02 also possessed high activities to stimulate the reduction mobilization and release of as iii and fe ii from sediments after 24 days of incubation approximately 42 33 μm as iii and 0 23 mm fe ii were released from the sediments fig 5b for z03 after 24 days of incubation approximately 36 14 μm as iii and 0 17 mm fe ii were released from the sediments fig 5c from this curve we inferred that the expressions of the genes encoding as v respiring reductase and other proteins enzymes involved in sediment weathering required a long time for induction in z03 cell as shown in fig 5d z04 displayed little activity to catalyze as and fe mobilization by which only 13 85 μm as iii and 0 07 mm fe ii were released after 24 days of incubation for comparison purpose the bacterial activities to reduce soluble solid as v were defined as the average amount of as iii produced in aqueous phase per day by the bacterial cells before the reaction reached a plateau thus the activities of the four darps to reduce solid as v from sediments account for only 0 484 0 379 0 422 and 0 093 of their activities to reduce soluble as v respectively table 2 3 7 different activities of the four darp strains to reduce and mobilize as in minerals we further detected how darps affected the reductive mobilization and release of as iii and fe ii from scorodite as shown in fig 6a z01 had relatively low activities to catalyze the reductive mobilization and release of as iii and fe ii from scorodite after 30 days of anaerobic incubation only 4 66 μm as iii and 7 27 μm fe ii were released from the mineral particles fig 6a in comparison z02 displayed higher activities to catalyze the reductive mobilization and release of as iii and fe ii from scorodite fig 6b after 30 days of incubation approximately 6 49 μm as iii and 10 92 μm fe ii were released from the mineral particles z03 also significantly catalyzed the reductive mobilization of as and fe fig 6c after 30 days of incubation about 5 35 μm as iii and 9 14 μm fe ii were released from the mineral particles it is noteworthy that z04 had little activities to reduce and mobilize scorodite under the laboratory conditions fig 6d thus the order of the bacterial activities to catalyze the reductive mobilization of as from scorodite is z02 z03 z01 z04 it is interesting to see that the activities of the four darps to reduce solid as v in scorodite account for only 0 023 0 038 0 043 and 0 006 of their activities to reduce soluble as v respectively 3 8 comparisons of the bacterial activities to respire fe iii and no3 in addition to as v the four darp strains also were able to respire fe iii and no3 fig 7 we found that when fe iii was added to the microcosms as the final electron acceptor after 18 days of anaerobic incubation approximately 25 1 71 3 31 5 and 28 7 mg l fe iii were reduced into fe ii by z01 z02 z03 and z04 cells respectively fig 7a 7d so the order of the bacterial activities to reduce soluble fe iii is z02 z03 z04 z01 the four darp strains also possessed significant no3 respiring activities as shown in fig 7e and 7f z01 and z02 completely reduced all no3 into no2 coupled to the oxidation of each preferred electron donor in 5 0 and 9 0 days under anaerobic conditions respectively differently both z03 and z04 completely reduced all no3 into no2 in 3 0 days fig 7g and 7h afterwards no2 was further reduced to n2o and n2 with different levels of activities fig 7i 4 discussions darps were considered to be one of the main impetuses in driving the reduction mobilization and release of as from minerals soils and sediments chen et al 2017 2020 zobrist et al 2000 ohtsuka et al 2013 however their physiological and functional features remain to be elucidated to address this issue we successfully isolated four novel darp strains bacillus sp z01 bacillus sp z02 achromobacter sp z03 and intrasporangium sp z04 from the as contaminated aquifers among them z04 represents the first darp strain in the phylum actinobacteria physiological and functional comparisons of the four strains have given rise to some interesting findings as described in the following i as v significantly promotes the growth of z01 and z02 but inhibits the growth of z03 and z04 in general as is highly toxic to bacteria exposure of bacterial cells to as v may cause growth inhibition protein misfolding oxidative stress and genetic damage zhang et al 2016 interestingly we found that compared to the bacterial maximal biomass grown in lb medium without arsenic the presence of 6 0 mm as v in the medium led to 37 2 and 24 8 increases in the maximal biomass of z01 and z02 but 28 8 and 10 5 decreases in the biomass of z03 and z04 respectively this suggests that as v has differential effects on the growth of darp cells either promoting or inhibiting a question was thus raised why does as v which is highly toxic to bacterial cell have stimulating effects on the growth of darps this is because as v can act as electron acceptor that can drive the oxidation of small organic acids such as lactate formate acetate citrate and pyruvate fisher et al 2008 uhrynowski et al 2017 and thus stimulate the energy production in darp cells under anaerobic conditions leading to promotion of bacterial cell growth ii each darp strain has its own unique electron donor preference recipe all the four darp strains were isolated from one sample implying that they had the same or similar habitat environment however their preferences for electron donors are largely different this finding suggests that different darp strains in the environment developed different ways to utilize carbon in order to avoid direct competitions during the long term evolutions iii natural activities of darps can partially explain the as concentration fluctuations in groundwater it is striking to find that the four darp strains had high as v respiring activity at the ph values of 4 7 and possessed very low activity at ph greater than 7 however it was shown that majority of as contaminated groundwater is slightly alkaline with a ph value varied from 7 1 to 8 9 this observation suggests that in most as contaminated aquifers darps could be in a state of low activities in other words if we consider darps as a pandora s box under most natural conditions this box is partially or completely closed due to that the natural conditions are not optimal to the activities of darps this may explain why only a very small proportion of arsenic was mobilized and released from as contaminated sediments into groundwater in another hand we found that the four darps possess high as v respiring activities at a wide scope of temperatures ranging from 22 to 37 c for z01 and z02 and from 30 to 37 c for z03 and z04 this finding is consistent with the actual observations of arsenic concentration fluctuations in groundwater lower in the spring and winter and higher in the summer and autumn schaefer et al 2016 duan et al 2015 guo et al 2011 iv comparisons between the bacterial activities of darps to reduce soluble and solid as v the activities of the four darps to catalyze the reductive mobilization of as from sediments only account for 0 484 0 379 0 422 and 0 093 of their activities to reduce soluble as v respectively if the sediments were replaced with scorodite in the as release assays the activities of the four darps to reduce solid as v from minerals account for only 0 023 0 038 0 043 and 0 006 of their activities to reduce soluble as v respectively this finding strongly suggests that the activities of darps to reduce soluble as v cannot be used to predict their activities to catalyze the reductive mobilization of as v from solid phase v high inconsistency between the activities of the four darps to reduce soluble as v and to reduce solid as v if the activities of the darps to catalyze reductive mobilization of as v from solid phase are attributed to their activities to respire soluble as v it can be inferred that the higher activities of darps to respire soluble as v the higher activities to catalyze reductive mobilization of as v from solid phase however we observed that the activities of z01 z02 z03 and z04 to respire soluble as v were 652 4 672 9 422 8 and 809 5 μm day whereas their activities to reduce solid as v from sediments were only 3 2 2 6 1 8 and 0 7 μm day respectively table 2 this suggests that the size order of the bacterial activities to respire soluble as v z04 z02 z01 z03 is totally different from that of the activities to catalyze the reductive mobilization of as v from sediments z01 z02 z03 z04 high inconsistency was also observed between the bacterial activities to respire soluble as v and to catalyze the reductive mobilization of as v from scorodite z02 z03 z01 z04 it is noteworthy that z04 had the highest activity to respire soluble as v but had the lowest activity to catalyze the reductive mobilization of as v from sediments and scorodite these findings strongly suggest that bacterial activities to respire soluble as v is required but not enough for catalyzation of the reductive mobilization of as v from solid phase vi comparisons between the activities of the four darps to respire soluble and solid fe iii it was found that fe iii reducing bacteria also play important roles in arsenic mobilization due to that after iron oxides were reduced the as v adsorbed on them would be mobilized and released kocar et al 2006 tufano et al 2008 we found that in addition to their activities to respire soluble as v the four darp strains also had apparent activities to reduce soluble and solid fe iii as shown in figs 5 and 7 their activities to reduce solid fe iii were also markedly lower than those to reduce soluble fe iii this was attributed that the former was significantly restricted by specific surfaces on the iron oxides more investigations are needed to further explore the similarity and difference of the mechanisms by which darps reduce as v and fe iii in solid phase under anaerobic conditions 5 conclusions it was widely accepted that darps are one of the major players in driving the reductive mobilization of arsenic from sediments and minerals osborne et al 2015 ohtsuka et al 2013 cai et al 2016 however little is known about the physiological and functional features of different darps so far this led to a limited understanding of the actual environmental implications of darps to address this issue four novel darp strains bacillus sp z01 bacillus sp z02 achromobacter sp z03 and intrasporangium sp z04 were successfully isolated from as contaminated aquifers among them z03 is the first darp of the genus achromobacter whereas z04 is the first darp of the phylum actinobacteria as v promoted the growth of z01 and z02 but inhibited the growth of z03 and z04 each of the four strains had their own unique preference for electron donors when as v was used as electron acceptor the optimal ph values and temperatures for their activities to respire soluble as v were ph 4 5 and 30 37 c respectively in addition to as v respiring activities the four darps can also reduce fe iii and no3 and catalyze the reduction mobilization and release of arsenic from sediments and scorodite no3 was finally reduced to no2 by z01 and z02 and to n2o and n2 by z03 and z04 although the four darps have high activities to respire soluble as v their activities to catalyze reductive mobilization of solid as v are negligibly low accounting for only 0 006 0 484 of their each corresponding soluble as v respiring activity moreover extreme inconsistency between the size orders of their activities to respire soluble as v and to catalyze reductive mobilization of as v from sediments and scorodite was observed it is noteworthy that z04 possessed the highest activity to respire soluble as v but had the lowest activity to catalyze reductive mobilization of as v from sediments and scorodite these observations suggest that the activities of darps to reduce soluble as v are required but not enough for catalyzation of the reductive mobilization of as v in sediments and minerals taken together this work provides new

15532,it was shown that dissimilatory arsenate as v respiring prokaryotes darps play important roles in driving the formation of arsenic contaminated groundwater however because it is tough to isolate cultivable darps the physiological and functional features of darps have not been fully elucidated yet this impedes a deep understanding of the mechanisms for the dynamic fluctuations of as concentrations in contaminated groundwater here four new darps were isolated from as contaminated aquifers using the microbial enrichment technique which were referred to as bacillus sp z01 bacillus sp z02 achromobacter sp z03 and intrasporangium sp z04 we found that the presence of as v significantly inhibited the growth of z03 and z04 but promoted the growth of z01 and z02 the four strains possess significant as v no3 and fe iii respiring activities however their activities and preferred electron donors differ greatly no3 was finally reduced to no2 by z01 and z02 and to n2o and n2 by z03 and z04 the optimal ph value for their as v respiring activity was 5 for z01 and 4 for z02 z03 and z04 whereas their optimal temperature varied between 30 and 37 c microcosm assays with as contaminated sediments and scorodite suggested that the four darp strains had highly differential activities to reduce and mobilize solid as v under anaerobic conditions although the four darps have high soluble as v respiring activities their activities to mobilize solid as are negligibly low accounting for only 0 006 0 484 of their each corresponding soluble as v respiring activity moreover extreme inconsistency between the size orders of their activities to respire soluble as v and to catalyze as reductive mobilization was observed it is interesting to see that z04 had high as v respiring activity but had little ability to catalyze the reductive mobilization of as and fe these observations suggest that as v respiring activity is required but not enough to catalyze the reductive mobilization of solid as v these findings provide new knowledge about the physiological and functional features of darps and are helpful for a better understanding of the roles of darps in

minerals soils and other sorbents goldberg et al 2002 clancy et al 2013 however under the effects of microbial chemical and physical factors as well as human activities as in solid phase would be

factors are involved dissimilatory as v respiring prokaryotes darps were shown to be one of the main players in driving the reductive mobilization and release of as from solid phase into groundwater yin et al 2022 zhu et al 2014 some studies suggest that darps are able to directly reduce as v present in solid phase and thus promote the releases of as to liquid phase cai et al 2020 kudo et al 2013 kawa et al 2019 under anaerobic conditions darps are able to reduce as v coupled to oxidation of some electron donors including small organic acids glucose sulfide and hydrogen hollibaugh et al 2006

proteobacteria firmicutes or chrysiogenetes rauschenbach et al 2012 shi et al 2022 among them shewanella sp ana 3 mlms and shewanella putrefaciens cn 32 are three representative darp strains saltikov and newman 2003 planer friedrich et al 2015 huang et al 2011 ana 3 is a well studied darp isolated from a wood treated by arsenic containing solution it can reduce 10 mm as v to as iii in 23 h using lactate as the electron donor in lb medium under anaerobic conditions saltikov and newman 2003 deletion of arra or arrb from this strain led to the loss of its as v respiring activity saltikov and newman 2003 strain mlms was obtained from the mono lake planer friedrich et al 2015 it was capable of coupling as v reduction with the oxidation of sulfide to the end products of s0 and so4 2 shewanella putrefaciens cn 32 was isolated from deep sandstones huang et al 2011 it was capable of directly respiring as v at low concentrations adsorbed on different synthetic fe bearing minerals huang et al 2011 cn 32 was also capable of reducing fe iii huang et al 2018 although a number of darps were isolated and characterized little is known about the functional and physiological features of different darps from the environment so far this markedly impedes a deep understanding of the roles of darps in the mobilization and release of arsenic from solid phase moreover we found that microbial community in the environment had extremely strong activity to catalyze arsenic mobilization chen et al 2020 however darps only account for less than 1 of the total microbes xu et al unpublished data this suggests that some microbes other than darps may also have the activity to catalyze arsenic mobilization we thus proposed that the activities of darps to respire soluble as v cannot be used to predict their activities to mobilize solid as v and the relationship between the two kinds of activities of darps should be re evaluated to address the above issues we performed physiological and functional comparisons of four darps from as contaminated aquifers the findings of this work would help to better understand the microbial mechanisms by which as v in solid phase was reductively mobilized and released into groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 collection of as contaminated sediments arsenic contaminated sedimental samples were collected from a depth of 12 m by drilling a 20 m hole with a diameter of 20 cm using direct mud rotary drilling method the sampling site was located at a shimen realgar mine affected area 29 38 53 n 111 02 18 e the samples were taken from the core of a big sediment clod and immediately placed to an anaerobic bag all the bags were kept at 0 4 c and mailed to the lab immediately 2 2 chemical analysis total organic carbon and nitrogen were analyzed on multi n c 3100 analytikjena germany total as and fe concentrations in solid samples were measured on icp ms inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry after the samples were dried ground into fine powder and treated with aqua regia solution incubating at 90 c for 120 min the detection limit of this method for as fe was 1 0 μg l to determine soluble as species in sediments the samples were dried ground into fine powders and mixed with sterile water in a tube the tube was vigorously vortexed and centrifuged supernatant was collected for measurement of the concentrations of soluble as iii and as v as v was removed by lc sax spe 57017 supelco usa total soluble as and as iii were measured on afs atomic fluorescence spectroscopy and as v was thus determined by subtraction of as iii from the total soluble as concentrations of no3 no2 and so4 2 were determined on ion chromatography as a routine method soluble fe ii was determined with ferrozine reagent while fe iii was reduced to fe ii with hydroxylamine hydrochloride for further analysis using the same reagent viollier et al 2000 nh4 was analyzed with nessler assay kim et al 2006 2 3 isolation of new darp strains from the aquifers an enrichment technique was used to isolate darps from arsenic contaminated aquifers as described previously chen et al 2020 in brief to prepare active microcosms about 1 5 g of sedimental samples was mixed with 13 5 ml of minimal mineral mm medium supplemented with 2 0 mm as v and 5 0 mm pyruvate lactate acetate and citrate in a 20 ml tube under anaerobic conditions the tubes were incubated at 30 c with shaking after all as v was completely reduced approximately 2 ml of the cultures was removed from the anaerobic tubes and mixed with 13 5 ml of fresh mm medium amended with the same supplements the tube was incubated for a second round of enrichment under anaerobic conditions after 4 rounds of enrichments about 300 μl of the cultures was collected from the tube for isolation of single bacterial strains using the hungate rolling tube technique all colonies were picked up and cultured under anaerobic conditions a pair of primers 27f and 1492r was used to amplify their 16 s rrna genes luo et al 2012 a dna fingerprinting technique was used to detect repetitive 16 s rrna genes torres et al 2016 strains with different 16 s rrna genes were selected for further analysis 2 4 analysis of the 16 s rrna genes of the isolated darps pcr reactions with 27f and 1492r primers luo et al 2012 were used to amplify the 16 s rrna genes from all the darps pcr products were directly sent to commercial dna sequencing company for sequence analysis each 16 s rrna gene sequence of the isolates was used as a query to search against the ezbiocloud database using the blast tool a phylogenetic tree was thus constructed with the 16 s rrna gene sequences of darp strains and their closely related bacterial strains from ezbiocloud using neighbor joining method mu et al 2019 2 5 determination of the effects of as v on the growth of darps an appropriate amount of bacterial cell cultures was added to the anaerobic tubes containing oxygen free lb medium to a final cell density of 1 0 107 cells ml amended with 0 1 6 12 18 24 or 30 mm as v all the tubes were incubated at 30 c the bacterial growth processes were examined by measuring the cell density at intervals of 1 day 2 6 analysis of the bacterial soluble as v respiring activity to evaluate the effects of phs on the bacterial soluble as v respiring activity bacterial cells were inoculated into eight anaerobic tubes with oxygen free mm medium to a final cell density of 1 0 107 cells ml amended with 2 0 mm as v and 6 0 mm darp strain preferred electron donor adjusted to a ph value of 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 or 10 0 respectively the same tubes without inoculations were prepared as controls the tubes were incubated at 30 c under anaerobic conditions to determine the effects of temperatures on the bacterial soluble as v respiring activity bacterial cells were inoculated into the tubes containing oxygen free mm medium supplemented with 2 0 mm as v and 6 0 mm darp strain preferred electron donor all the tubes were incubated at 4 22 30 37 45 or 55 c under anaerobic conditions to detect the as v reduction reactions about 0 3 ml of mixtures was collected from the tubes for examination of the arsenic species at intervals of 24 h 2 7 effects of darps on the mobilization of arsenic from as bearing sediments and scorodite sedimental samples were dried both sediments and scorodite were thoroughly ground into fine powder with mortar and pestle and washed to remove soluble as especially as iii after being centrifuged the precipitations were dried and 0 5 g of the solid particles was taken for determination of the as v concentrations of the samples appropriate amount of solid particles was added to 20 0 ml mm medium to a final solid as v concentration of 2 0 mm the mixtures were amended with 6 0 mm darp strain preferred electron donor such as lactate pyruvate acetate or citrate the mixtures were treated by argon purging for removal of oxygen and then autoclaved bacterial cells at log phase were inoculated into the anaerobic tubes to a final cell density of 1 0 107 cells ml autoclaved mixtures were prepared as parallel controls all tubes were incubated at 30 c with shaking under anaerobic conditions at an interval of 3 or 6 days 0 2 ml of the cultures was collected from the tubes for examination of as and fe species 2 8 a comparison of the bacterial activities to reduce fe iii and no3 under anaerobic conditions each of darp strains in log phase was inoculated to two anaerobic tubes with mm medium containing 2 0 mm darp strain preferred electron donor which were amended with 2 0 mm fe iii and nano3 respectively the same mixtures without inoculation of bacterial cells were prepared as controls all the experiments were performed in triplicate under anaerobic conditions all tubes were incubated at 30 c with shaking at an interval of 1 or 4 days 0 4 ml of cultures was collected from the tubes for determination of the concentrations of no3 no2 nh4 or fe ii as well as the bacterial cell numbers about 0 2 ml of headspace gas was collected for determination of the n2o concentration using gc gas chromatography 3 results 3 1 isolation and characterization of four new darps from the as contaminated aquifers the sedimental samples consisted of fine sand silt and clay with grayish brown color the samples had high contents of total as 1 6 g kg soluble as 137 2 mg kg fe 15 7 g kg total organic carbon toc 5 3 g kg and total nitrogen tn 0 1 g kg but low contents of so4 2 36 9 mg kg no3 11 6 mg kg and nh4 35 3 mg kg table s1 microcosm assays showed that the sediments had strong as v reducing activities when 5 0 mm lactate pyruvate acetate and citrate were each added to the microcosms as electron donors after 8 0 days of anaerobic incubation approximately 90 1 75 9 49 5 or 65 1 as v converted to as iii respectively fig s1 afterwards the microbial community could have consumed all the nutrition in the mixtures and thus the reduction of as v was ended fig s1 based on the above finding microbial enrichment technique was used to isolated cultivable darp strains from the as contaminated sedimental samples by using a mixture of lactate pyruvate acetate and citrate as electron donors approximately 200 bacterial colonies were obtained from the enriched cultures after excluding the repetitive strains and the strains with no significant soluble as v respiring activities we obtained four darp strains z01 z02 z03 and z04 from the sedimental samples phylogenetic analysis of their 16 s rrna genes suggests that the four isolates are affiliated to the genera bacillus bacillus achromobacter intrasporangium and thus referred to as bacillus sp z01 bacillus sp z02 achromobacter sp z03 and intrasporangium sp z04 respectively fig 1 z01 and z02 are affiliated to the phylum firmicutes while z03 and z04 are affiliated to proteobacteria and actinobacteria respectively to the best of our knowledge achromobacter sp z03 is the first darp strain of the genus achromobacter whereas intrasporangium sp z04 is the first darp strain of the phylum actinobacteria the highest homology between the 16 s rrna genes of z04 and other intrasporangium members is only 96 1 suggesting that z01 could represent a new species of this genus 3 2 as v respiring activities and preferences for electron donors of the four darps as shown in fig 2 all the four strains have significant soluble as v respiring activities z01 z02 and z04 needed 72 72 and 60 h for completely reducing 2 0 mm as v respectively fig 2a 2b and 2d in comparison after 96 h of anaerobic incubation z03 only reduced 64 5 of 2 0 mm as v fig 2c this suggests that the order of the bacterial soluble as v respiring activities is z04 z02 z01 z03 when their own preferred electron donors were used in the reactions as shown in table 1 we found that when as v was added as electron acceptor the four strains had different preferences for electron donors all the four strains can utilize lactate pyruvate citrate yeast extracts sucrose and glucose as the sole electron donor except for z02 all other three strains can use acetate except for z04 all others can use glycerol z03 and z04 can use ethanol but z01 and z02 cannot only z04 can use formate others cannot all the four strains cannot use oxalate and methanol as the sole electron donor 3 3 effects of as v on the growth of the four darp strains we inoculated bacterial cells into the anaerobic tubes containing lb medium to a final cell density of 1 0 107 cells ml amended with 0 1 6 12 18 24 or 30 mm as v the tubes were incubated under anaerobic conditions and the cell densities were determined by detecting the od600 values of the cultures at intervals of a day fig s2a shows the growth curve of z01 after 6 0 days the order of bacterial od600 at different concentrations of as v is od6 mm od1 mm od12 mm od18 mm od0 mm od24 mm od30 mm this suggests that lower concentrations of as v 18 mm significantly promoted the growth of z01 in a concentration dependent manner and 24 mm as v completely inhibited the bacterial growth similarly as v at 6 or 1 mm significantly promoted the growth of z02 whereas as v at 12 18 24 and 30 mm significantly inhibited the bacterial growth in a concentration dependent manner fig s2b fig s2c 2d show the growth curve of z03 and z04 we found that the order of bacterial od600 at different concentrations of as v for both strains is od0 mm od1 mm od6 mm od12 mm od18 mm od24 mm od30 mm suggesting that as v markedly inhibited the growth of both z03 and z04 in a concentration dependent manner 3 4 effects of ph values on the soluble as v respiring activities of the four darps we found that ph values had markedly different effects on the soluble as v respiring activities of the four darps fig 3 as shown in fig 3a the optimal ph for z01 was 5 in comparison under phs of 6 7 or 4 the bacterial activities declined to 90 63 or 51 of the bacterial optimal activity respectively under phs of 8 9 or 3 the activities declined to only less than 10 of the optimal activity as shown in fig 3b z02 was more tolerant to low phs its optimal ph was 4 under phs of 5 6 7 or 3 the bacterial activities declined to 83 55 50 or 43 of the optimal activity of this strain respectively under ph 8 or 9 the activities declined to only less than 5 of the optimal activity the optimal ph for z03 was also 4 fig 3c z03 displayed much lower optimal as v respiring activities than the other three strains after 60 h of anaerobic incubation under phs of 4 5 6 7 and 3 only 43 40 35 19 and 24 of 2 0 mm as v were reduced respectively as shown in fig 3d the optimal ph for z04 was 4 however under the ph values of 5 6 7 or 3 the bacterial activities declined by only 3 7 25 or 15 of the optimal activities respectively this suggests that z04 is the most tolerant to acidic conditions among the four strains taken together the results suggest that the optimal phs of the four strains were 4 or 5 and they overall preferred slightly acidic conditions under alkaline or extremely acidic conditions the bacterial activities dramatically declined 3 5 effects of temperatures on the as v respiring activities of the four darps as shown in fig 4 a z01 had the highest as v respiring activity at 30 c and 37 c while at 22 c its activity declined to 85 of the highest level this suggests that the optimal temperature for the activity of z01 fell into a wide range between 30 and 37 c z02 also had the highest as v respiring activity at 30 c when the temperature was 37 c and 22 c the bacterial activity declined to 97 and 90 of the highest activity respectively fig 4b differently z03 had the highest activity at 37 c and when the temperature was 30 and 22 c the bacterial activity declined to 75 and 25 of the highest activity respectively fig 4c the optimal temperature for z04 was also between 30 to 37 c z04 looked more sensitive to the temperature change than z01 and z02 when the temperature was 22 c the bacterial activity of z04 dramatically declined to only 10 of the highest level fig 4d for all the four strains when the temperature was 4 c 45 c or 55 c the bacterial activities declined into less than 5 of the highest levels these results suggest that the optimal temperature of darps in this study was 30 or 37 c and each strain demonstrated different tolerance to nonoptimal temperatures 3 6 different activities of the four darp strains to reduce and mobilize as v in sediments we compared the effects of the four darp strains on the reductive mobilization of as and fe from as contaminated sediments as shown in fig 5 a z01 had high activities to catalyze reductive mobilization and release of as iii and fe ii from as contaminated sediments after 24 days of anaerobic incubation approximately 60 32 μm as iii and 0 19 mm fe ii were released from the sediments z02 also possessed high activities to stimulate the reduction mobilization and release of as iii and fe ii from sediments after 24 days of incubation approximately 42 33 μm as iii and 0 23 mm fe ii were released from the sediments fig 5b for z03 after 24 days of incubation approximately 36 14 μm as iii and 0 17 mm fe ii were released from the sediments fig 5c from this curve we inferred that the expressions of the genes encoding as v respiring reductase and other proteins enzymes involved in sediment weathering required a long time for induction in z03 cell as shown in fig 5d z04 displayed little activity to catalyze as and fe mobilization by which only 13 85 μm as iii and 0 07 mm fe ii were released after 24 days of incubation for comparison purpose the bacterial activities to reduce soluble solid as v were defined as the average amount of as iii produced in aqueous phase per day by the bacterial cells before the reaction reached a plateau thus the activities of the four darps to reduce solid as v from sediments account for only 0 484 0 379 0 422 and 0 093 of their activities to reduce soluble as v respectively table 2 3 7 different activities of the four darp strains to reduce and mobilize as in minerals we further detected how darps affected the reductive mobilization and release of as iii and fe ii from scorodite as shown in fig 6a z01 had relatively low activities to catalyze the reductive mobilization and release of as iii and fe ii from scorodite after 30 days of anaerobic incubation only 4 66 μm as iii and 7 27 μm fe ii were released from the mineral particles fig 6a in comparison z02 displayed higher activities to catalyze the reductive mobilization and release of as iii and fe ii from scorodite fig 6b after 30 days of incubation approximately 6 49 μm as iii and 10 92 μm fe ii were released from the mineral particles z03 also significantly catalyzed the reductive mobilization of as and fe fig 6c after 30 days of incubation about 5 35 μm as iii and 9 14 μm fe ii were released from the mineral particles it is noteworthy that z04 had little activities to reduce and mobilize scorodite under the laboratory conditions fig 6d thus the order of the bacterial activities to catalyze the reductive mobilization of as from scorodite is z02 z03 z01 z04 it is interesting to see that the activities of the four darps to reduce solid as v in scorodite account for only 0 023 0 038 0 043 and 0 006 of their activities to reduce soluble as v respectively 3 8 comparisons of the bacterial activities to respire fe iii and no3 in addition to as v the four darp strains also were able to respire fe iii and no3 fig 7 we found that when fe iii was added to the microcosms as the final electron acceptor after 18 days of anaerobic incubation approximately 25 1 71 3 31 5 and 28 7 mg l fe iii were reduced into fe ii by z01 z02 z03 and z04 cells respectively fig 7a 7d so the order of the bacterial activities to reduce soluble fe iii is z02 z03 z04 z01 the four darp strains also possessed significant no3 respiring activities as shown in fig 7e and 7f z01 and z02 completely reduced all no3 into no2 coupled to the oxidation of each preferred electron donor in 5 0 and 9 0 days under anaerobic conditions respectively differently both z03 and z04 completely reduced all no3 into no2 in 3 0 days fig 7g and 7h afterwards no2 was further reduced to n2o and n2 with different levels of activities fig 7i 4 discussions darps were considered to be one of the main impetuses in driving the reduction mobilization and release of as from minerals soils and sediments chen et al 2017 2020 zobrist et al 2000 ohtsuka et al 2013 however their physiological and functional features remain to be elucidated to address this issue we successfully isolated four novel darp strains bacillus sp z01 bacillus sp z02 achromobacter sp z03 and intrasporangium sp z04 from the as contaminated aquifers among them z04 represents the first darp strain in the phylum actinobacteria physiological and functional comparisons of the four strains have given rise to some interesting findings as described in the following i as v significantly promotes the growth of z01 and z02 but inhibits the growth of z03 and z04 in general as is highly toxic to bacteria exposure of bacterial cells to as v may cause growth inhibition protein misfolding oxidative stress and genetic damage zhang et al 2016 interestingly we found that compared to the bacterial maximal biomass grown in lb medium without arsenic the presence of 6 0 mm as v in the medium led to 37 2 and 24 8 increases in the maximal biomass of z01 and z02 but 28 8 and 10 5 decreases in the biomass of z03 and z04 respectively this suggests that as v has differential effects on the growth of darp cells either promoting or inhibiting a question was thus raised why does as v which is highly toxic to bacterial cell have stimulating effects on the growth of darps this is because as v can act as electron acceptor that can drive the oxidation of small organic acids such as lactate formate acetate citrate and pyruvate fisher et al 2008 uhrynowski et al 2017 and thus stimulate the energy production in darp cells under anaerobic conditions leading to promotion of bacterial cell growth ii each darp strain has its own unique electron donor preference recipe all the four darp strains were isolated from one sample implying that they had the same or similar habitat environment however their preferences for electron donors are largely different this finding suggests that different darp strains in the environment developed different ways to utilize carbon in order to avoid direct competitions during the long term evolutions iii natural activities of darps can partially explain the as concentration fluctuations in groundwater it is striking to find that the four darp strains had high as v respiring activity at the ph values of 4 7 and possessed very low activity at ph greater than 7 however it was shown that majority of as contaminated groundwater is slightly alkaline with a ph value varied from 7 1 to 8 9 this observation suggests that in most as contaminated aquifers darps could be in a state of low activities in other words if we consider darps as a pandora s box under most natural conditions this box is partially or completely closed due to that the natural conditions are not optimal to the activities of darps this may explain why only a very small proportion of arsenic was mobilized and released from as contaminated sediments into groundwater in another hand we found that the four darps possess high as v respiring activities at a wide scope of temperatures ranging from 22 to 37 c for z01 and z02 and from 30 to 37 c for z03 and z04 this finding is consistent with the actual observations of arsenic concentration fluctuations in groundwater lower in the spring and winter and higher in the summer and autumn schaefer et al 2016 duan et al 2015 guo et al 2011 iv comparisons between the bacterial activities of darps to reduce soluble and solid as v the activities of the four darps to catalyze the reductive mobilization of as from sediments only account for 0 484 0 379 0 422 and 0 093 of their activities to reduce soluble as v respectively if the sediments were replaced with scorodite in the as release assays the activities of the four darps to reduce solid as v from minerals account for only 0 023 0 038 0 043 and 0 006 of their activities to reduce soluble as v respectively this finding strongly suggests that the activities of darps to reduce soluble as v cannot be used to predict their activities to catalyze the reductive mobilization of as v from solid phase v high inconsistency between the activities of the four darps to reduce soluble as v and to reduce solid as v if the activities of the darps to catalyze reductive mobilization of as v from solid phase are attributed to their activities to respire soluble as v it can be inferred that the higher activities of darps to respire soluble as v the higher activities to catalyze reductive mobilization of as v from solid phase however we observed that the activities of z01 z02 z03 and z04 to respire soluble as v were 652 4 672 9 422 8 and 809 5 μm day whereas their activities to reduce solid as v from sediments were only 3 2 2 6 1 8 and 0 7 μm day respectively table 2 this suggests that the size order of the bacterial activities to respire soluble as v z04 z02 z01 z03 is totally different from that of the activities to catalyze the reductive mobilization of as v from sediments z01 z02 z03 z04 high inconsistency was also observed between the bacterial activities to respire soluble as v and to catalyze the reductive mobilization of as v from scorodite z02 z03 z01 z04 it is noteworthy that z04 had the highest activity to respire soluble as v but had the lowest activity to catalyze the reductive mobilization of as v from sediments and scorodite these findings strongly suggest that bacterial activities to respire soluble as v is required but not enough for catalyzation of the reductive mobilization of as v from solid phase vi comparisons between the activities of the four darps to respire soluble and solid fe iii it was found that fe iii reducing bacteria also play important roles in arsenic mobilization due to that after iron oxides were reduced the as v adsorbed on them would be mobilized and released kocar et al 2006 tufano et al 2008 we found that in addition to their activities to respire soluble as v the four darp strains also had apparent activities to reduce soluble and solid fe iii as shown in figs 5 and 7 their activities to reduce solid fe iii were also markedly lower than those to reduce soluble fe iii this was attributed that the former was significantly restricted by specific surfaces on the iron oxides more investigations are needed to further explore the similarity and difference of the mechanisms by which darps reduce as v and fe iii in solid phase under anaerobic conditions 5 conclusions it was widely accepted that darps are one of the major players in driving the reductive mobilization of arsenic from sediments and minerals osborne et al 2015 ohtsuka et al 2013 cai et al 2016 however little is known about the physiological and functional features of different darps so far this led to a limited understanding of the actual environmental implications of darps to address this issue four novel darp strains bacillus sp z01 bacillus sp z02 achromobacter sp z03 and intrasporangium sp z04 were successfully isolated from as contaminated aquifers among them z03 is the first darp of the genus achromobacter whereas z04 is the first darp of the phylum actinobacteria as v promoted the growth of z01 and z02 but inhibited the growth of z03 and z04 each of the four strains had their own unique preference for electron donors when as v was used as electron acceptor the optimal ph values and temperatures for their activities to respire soluble as v were ph 4 5 and 30 37 c respectively in addition to as v respiring activities the four darps can also reduce fe iii and no3 and catalyze the reduction mobilization and release of arsenic from sediments and scorodite no3 was finally reduced to no2 by z01 and z02 and to n2o and n2 by z03 and z04 although the four darps have high activities to respire soluble as v their activities to catalyze reductive mobilization of solid as v are negligibly low accounting for only 0 006 0 484 of their each corresponding soluble as v respiring activity moreover extreme inconsistency between the size orders of their activities to respire soluble as v and to catalyze reductive mobilization of as v from sediments and scorodite was observed it is noteworthy that z04 possessed the highest activity to respire soluble as v but had the lowest activity to catalyze reductive mobilization of as v from sediments and scorodite these observations suggest that the activities of darps to reduce soluble as v are required but not enough for catalyzation of the reductive mobilization of as v in sediments and minerals taken together this work provides new information on the physiological and functional features of darps which are helpful for deep understandings of the roles of darps in driving the arsenic mobilization and release from sediments and

preserve human and ecosystem health microbial metabolism is hypothesized to play a key role in pollutant transformation in hyporheic sediments of natural streams however previous work investigating the influence of microbial metabolism on pollutant transformation has been predominantly laboratory studies the key challenge for field studies is the appropriate determination of net microbial metabolism i e information on the actual exposure times to specific microbial processes in the investigated system the present study uses reactive fluorescent tracers to determine microbial metabolism and ultimately its influence on pollutant transformation e g for trace organic compounds in hyporheic sediments under natural conditions in particular the reactive fluorescent tracers resazurin and its main transformation product resorufin were used to determine the microbial metabolism of facultative or obligate aerobes the influence of the derived microbial metabolism on the transformation of 20 trace organic compounds such as pharmaceuticals including 3 parent daughter pairs was examined the present findings validate laboratory results on the microbially mediated transformation of the anticonvulsant gabapentin to its main transformation product gabapentin lactam under natural conditions all other trocs investigated did not show a clear link between troc reactivity to the microbial metabolism informed by the resazurin resorufin system overall the present study not only demonstrates the use of the fluorescent tracer system resazurin and resorufin for determining microbial metabolism of facultative or obligate aerobes but also generally highlights the potential of reactive fluorescent tracers to disentangle specific reactive properties and ultimately their influence on

knowledge not been achieved under natural conditions previous studies mainly investigated the relationship between troc transformation and microbial metabolism in laboratory batch or column studies using natural stream biofilms desiante et al 2021 rosi et al 2017 hyporheic sediments coll et al 2020 rutere et al 2020 or conducted flume studies using hyporheic sediments posselt et al 2020 jaeger et al 2021 in regard to field studies the key challenge lies in the suitable determination of microbial metabolism so that this data can be appropriately related to troc transformation data in particular the dataset needs to inform the integrated effects of microbial reactions that have occurred along the investigated system abbott et al 2016 provide a general overview of the main approaches to characterize microbiological processes along the system of interest in regard to hzs one approach for characterizing the microbial community is to use sequencing techniques rutere et al 2020 jaeger et al 2021 and link the abundance of bacterial taxa and their known qualities to troc transformation reactions however the abundance of bacterial taxa or specific genes does not directly imply that the attributable processes have occurred in addition the approach only provides point data i e does not integrate the occurring microbiological processes limiting its use for stream scale interpretation overall the approach neither informs the actual exposure times of the trocs to the reactive microbial community nor helps to characterize the specific favourable microbial reactions for troc transformation to take place further advancements in investigating microbial metabolism in hzs include the use of fluorescent reactive tracers such as fluorescein diacetate battin 1997 or the resazurin resorufin system haggerty et al 2008 generally reactive fluorescent tracers provide two key benefits compared to alternative approaches first fluorescent tracers are easy to measure and allow continuous in situ real time measurements at low labour and financial costs second reactive fluorescent tracers provide net information about their exposure time to the specific conditions for their transformation reaction to occur for instance resazurin is transformed to resorufin under the specific condition of a midly reducing milieu in the presence of living facultative or obligate aerobes haggerty et al 2008 but not of strict anaerobes gonzález pinzón et al 2012 and thus its concentration measurements implicitly inform about this specific microbial metabolism or rather microbial activity in other words local point measurements of fluorescent reactive tracers provide large scale integrated net information on their attributable specific reactions general information on the well known concept of proxy tracers and how they inform exposure times to net processes can be found in chapter 3 in abbott et al 2016 and in figure 1b in höhne et al 2021a local point measurements of troc concentrations similarly provide integrative information on the reactive processes that have occurred within the investigated system thus measurements of both reactive fluorescent tracers as well as of trocs from the same location at stationary conditions reflect integrative information on their net reactivity along the same flow paths and consequently can be linked to inform possible relations to one another the overall objective of the present study is to clearly link specific microbial metabolism to troc transformation reactions in natural hzs to this end a stream tracer test using the resazurin resorufin system along with the conservative fluorescent tracer fluorescein was conducted in river erpe berlin germany a stream fed predominantly by treated wastewater samples for the fluorescent tracers as well as for 35 trocs including 9 transformation products were taken at 15 pore water locations within the shallow hz transport heterogeneities were investigated by the means of non parametric residence time distribution function estimates according to cirpka et al 2007 and temporal moment analysis as demonstrated by cirpka and kitanidis 2000 microbial metabolism was determined using the approach presented by höhne et al 2021a as well as by knapp and cirpka 2018 the main aim is to investigate any relationships between microbial metabolism informed by the resazurin resorufin system and single trocs or parent daughter pair transformation reactions in natural hzs 2 methods 2 1 site description and experimental overview the present study was conducted in a side channel of river erpe 52 476437 n 13 625765 e a treated wastewater impacted lowland stream located east of berlin germany the streambed sediment of the reach investigated is predominantly characterized by sandy material compare supporting material sm figure sm 1 determined from ground penetrating radar measurements using the viy3 300 system transient technologies llc ukraine the streambed sediment at the pore water sampling location consists of a muddy sand deposit on average 20 cm thick previous investigations by mueller et al 2021 have shown that most physical and chemical parameters of the surface water and pore water fluctuate at a characteristic diurnal pattern caused by regular diurnally changing discharge of the münchehofe wastewater treatment plant further detailed descriptions on sediment characteristics stream morphology and biogeochemical characteristics of the present study site can be found in mueller et al 2022 a fluorescence tracer test was conducted on 8 september 2020 during nighttime in order to avoid photodegradation between 9 55pm and 11 10pm a 15l fluorescent tracer solution with 60g of fluorescein as conservative and 60g of resazurin as reactive tracer dissolved in stream water was injected into the surface water 40m upstream of the pore water sampling location at a constant rate using a peristaltic pump ismatec sa germany sufficient mixing was achieved due to the injection of the tracer solution at four locations along the inlet cross section of a 12 5m long concrete pipe over the course of the experiment discharge ranged between 30 to 50 l s 1 compare table sm 1 net pore water pressure data allows the assumption of stationary conditions during the experiment i e a steady and uniform subsurface flow field despite reported discharge variations compare sm figure sm 2 note that determining further transport characteristics is not required as the conservative residence time distribution function already informs the full transport properties compare section 2 3 more information on the concept of conservative residence time distributions functions can be found in leray et al 2016 and in cirpka et al 2007 in total the experiment lasted 40h breakthrough curves of the injected fluorescent tracers fluorescein resazurin and additionally resorufin the main transformation product of resazurin were measured 40m downstream of the injection site in the surface water as well as at 15 pore water locations sampling was conducted in 3 cm 6 cm and 9 cm depth of the streambed sediment at 5 locations a e spaced 5 or 7 cm along a cross section perpendicular to the surface water flow direction fig 1 unfortunately a beaver has partly destroyed the pore water sampling setup after almost 24h only the 3

constant rate of 1ml min 1 fig 1 previous investigations conducted at river erpe have shown that a pumping rate of 1ml min 1 is sufficient to preserve the integrity of the hyporheic flow field posselt et al 2018 during the experiment 2ml of hyporheic pore water were sampled regularly from each of the 15 sampling ports and immediately analysed for the fluorescent tracers with the handheld fluorometer before and after the experiment about 3ml of surface water as well as of hyporheic pore water from all 15 ports were sampled for troc analysis in addition the conservative tracer fluorescein was recorded with a self constructed device for real time in situ fluorescence measurements developed by höhne et al 2021b two sensors were installed in the streambed sediment approximately 1m downstream of the pore water sampling location so that surface water and pore water at 5 cm depth were regularly sampled at 5 20min intervals the multi layered filter of each measurement chamber of the two sensors consisted of three layers with mesh sizes of 500 μ m 60 μ m and 34 μ m respectively detailed information on fluorescence data evaluation are provided in section sm 2 of the sm in addition electrical conductivity pressure and temperature were recorded at 5min intervals using ctd loggers van essen instruments b v netherlands in both the surface and pore water compare sm section sm 1 3 the pore water ctd loggers were covered with a nylon mesh and placed within the streambed channel in 7 cm 9 cm and 15 cm depth approximately 3m upstream of the pore water

the department of environmental science and analytical chemistry at stockholm university comparability of both methods was validated by analysing the trocs metoprolol venlafaxine valsartan valsartan acid benzotriazole and methylbenzotriazole using both methods differences less than 20 detailed descriptions on both methods for troc analyses can be found in section sm 3 of the sm in total 35 trocs

furosemide fur and chlorothiazide ctz ranged mainly within their respective limit of quantification loq and therefore were not considered in further analysis in addition surface water concentrations before and after the tracer experiment were not constant for guanylurea gua hydroxy diclofenac hcf diatrizoate ats iomeprol iom iopromid iop methylbenzotriazole mbt and acesulfame acs and thus also excluded from further analysis overall the influence of microbial metabolism on troc transformation processes in the hz could be investigated for 21 trocs namely the antidiabetic drugs metformin mef

product valsartan acid vsa 2 3 assessing conservative residence time distributions and local temporal moments the conservative residence time distributions inform the net heterogeneous transport properties of the investigated system non parametric conservative residence time distributions can directly be estimated using the well established deconvolution method introduced by cirpka et al 2007 in brief two concentration time series of a conservative tracer from an input and output location of the system investigated are deconvolved imposing a geostatistical method for smoothness and lagrange multipliers for non negativity in the present study surface water concentration time series of the conservative tracer fluorescein were deconvolved with each fluorescein concentration time series of the pore water locations investigated to reduce fluorescein mass uncertainties the high temporal resolution fluorescein data from the ggun fl30 recordings 10s intervals were used for the surface water concentration time series instead of the handheld data 10min intervals furthermore an artificial blank concentration had been added to all handheld measurements at the time of the tracer injection start preventing the addition of artificial mass due to the low sampling intervals compare sm figure sm 5 in addition missing values were linearly interpolated in the present study 1000 realizations and the best estimate for the conservative residence time distributions could be generated for 10 out of 15 pore water locations i e where a sufficient fluorescein signal was recorded fig 2a the estimated conservative residence time distributions and the fluorescein concentration time series were used to derive local temporal moments according to the approach presented by cirpka and kitanidis 2000 in that for the one dimensional case at stationary conditions local temporal moments help to inform mass balances unit mass for concentration time series and unit mass percentage for residence time distributions or rather dilution and apparent physical parameters such as pore water velocities and therefore mean residence times 2 4 calculation of relative attenuation formation percentages relative troc attenuation formation percentages were calculated between the surface water and each pore water location investigated normalized by a stable reference compound according to 1 r e l x 1 c ref sw c ref pw c x pw c x sw 100 where r e l x is the relative attenuation formation percentage of the compound of interest x c ref sw and c ref pw are the measured concentrations of the stable reference compound in the surface water and pore water respectively and c x sw and c x pw are the measured concentrations of the compound of interest in the surface water and pore water respectively note that positive values indicate percentage attenuation whereas negative values indicate percentage formation of the respective compound of interest i e how much has been attenuated formed yet in the present study cbz is used as stable reference compound as it was found to be rather stable in the hz variability less than 12 troc attenuation formation was considered significant if the 5 to 95 percentile of the relative attenuation formation did not include zero non significant relative attenuation formation percentages were set to zero the approach implies i stable hydrological conditions ii constant compound ratios in the surface water and iii the absence of other troc sources all requirements were met in the present study hydrological conditions over the course of the experiment i e subsurface flow field were relatively stationary as net pore water pressure fluctuations were small compare sm figure sm 2 furthermore a previous 11h experiment by mueller et al 2022 as well as a 48h experiment unpublished have shown that concentration time series for most trocs sampled at 1h intervals do not show significant fluctuations or changing compound ratios the measured surface water troc concentrations at two sampling times also only showed minor variations for most of the trocs investigated in the present study other sources for trocs are assumed negligible as the river erpe receives up to 80 of its discharge from the münchehofe municipal wastewater treatment plant lewandowski et al 2011 note that the approach also assumes similar transport time scales i e no significant retardation for the compounds of interest and the stable reference compound used i e cbz in the present study retardation coefficients could not be estimated for the trocs investigated since i no concentration time series were measured and ii the troc concentrations do barely show a distinct temporal pattern both requirements would be necessary to apply a model for estimating retardation or rather sorption desorption coefficients however previous investigations at river erpe have determined low retardation coefficients for trocs within the hz höhne et al 2021a in addition due to the relatively constant surface water concentrations and the aspect that the sediment is most likely well saturated with trocs mueller et al 2022 desorption processes and overall significant retardation processes are assumed negligible note that only relative formation attenuation percentages are provided in the present study most studies usually determine first order reaction rate coefficients or half lives as they are better suited for comparison among studies in the present study first order reaction rate coefficients were not determined for two main reasons first greskowiak et al 2017 demonstrate that first order reaction rate coefficients and implied half lives vary significantly among studies making comparisons difficult second the dataset was not sufficient to be used with a model approach that considers the heterogeneous transport properties of the hz in order to estimate reactive parameters such as the first order reaction rate coefficient note that reactive parameter estimates derived from simplistic transport model conceptualizations introduce significant errors höhne et al 2021a mccallum et al 2020 overall the findings from previous studies underline the complexity of troc reactivity and the great challenge in investigating the factors that drive the fate of trocs under natural conditions 2 5 assessing microbial metabolism microbial metabolism can be determined using the fluorescent tracer resazurin and its transformation product resorufin haggerty et al 2008 in the present study microbial metabolism is defined as the resazurin to resorufin transformation rate testing two approaches for its determination one approach proposed by knapp and cirpka 2018 and one approach presented by höhne et al 2021a the first approach by knapp and cirpka 2018 defines the resazurin to resorufin transformation rate as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the resazurin input mass to the sum of resazurin input mass and the changes in resorufin mass using the 0th temporal moments normalized by the mean residence time this approach yields the smallest possible bulk transformation rate knapp and cirpka 2018 note that the approach assumes no resorufin degradation the second approach by höhne et al 2021a determines the resazurin to resorufin transformation rate by using non parametric conservative transport with a linear sorption model in the present study the conservative tracer fluorescein is used to determine the non parametric conservative residence time distribution function the concentration time series of the fluorescent tracer resazurin and its transformation product resorufin are then used as calibration target for the simple retardation model to estimate the retardation and the first order degradation coefficients i e resazurin to resorufin transformation rate the approach requires stationary conditions and an appropriate dataset which are both met in the present study further details on the model implementation can be found in section sm 4 1 of the sm note that for investigating the influence of microbial metabolism on troc transformation reactions in natural hyporheic sediments only the results provided by the approach of höhne et al 2021a are used compare sm figure sm 10 3 results and discussion 3 1 transport heterogeneities in the hz fluorescein tracer signals could only be detected in 10 out of 15 pore water sampling locations fig 2a in particular no fluorescein tracer signals were detected at 6 cm depth for location c as well as at any 9 cm depth locations except for location e detecting no fluorescein tracer signal indicates that stream surface water did not infiltrate until those depths the fluorescein tracer concentrations measured served as conservative tracer to infer residence time distribution functions informing the heterogeneous transport processes fig 2b for all inferred residence time distribution functions the range of residence times increases whereas the maximum frequency decreases with depth in addition the shapes and peaks highly vary for both the different depths investigated and within the same depths the 0th moments determined from both the conservative residence time distribution functions and the fluorescein concentration time series measured at the sampling locations indicate increasing dilution towards greater depth fig 2a in contrast the relative attenuation percentage of the stable conservative troc cbz shows no change with depth i e no dilution this is reasonable since the extent of the apparent hz is hydrodynamically driven i e varies with the stream stage and thus depends on the tracer used for its investigation for example the river erpe receives treated wastewater containing trocs for many years and thus making cbz a tracer yielding the average extent of the hz including mixing processes whereas the artificially injected fluorescein tracer only informs the current hz extent this finding highlights the importance of using an appropriate conservative tracer that informs the actual physical conditions during the experimental investigations in addition the 0th moments for two locations i e at 6 cm and 9 cm depth for location e indicate that over twice of the actual injected surface water mass would have passed these locations fig 2a this is physically impossible significant errors during sampling are assumed negligible since it occurs at more than one sampling site and the raw fluorescein data does generally not show respective irregularities erroneous results due to non stationary conditions are also excluded as the pore water pressure data does not show significant net pressure changes i e net pressure differences between surface water and the respective pore water depth were constant over the course of the experiment the inaccurate 0th moments are rather attributed to locally restricted mixing issues in the surface water in particular since the stream channel was fairly well covered with macrophytes fig 1 it is reasonable that the injected tracer solution was less well mixed towards the banks therefore for location e being closest to the banks fractions of unmixed surface water may have entered the hz shortly upstream of the sampling site and got onto a pronounced horizontal flow path spanning the respective sampling locations i e 6 and 9 cm depth the lack of a similar finding for location a which is closest to the other bank is attributed to the hz s highly heterogeneous transport properties which makes interpreting local point observations in general very challenging overall calculating the 0th moment for measurements at unmixed conditions yields incorrect results as the unmixed surface water concentration being higher than the fully mixed one erroneously simulates higher initially injected mass on another note the incorrect 0th moments for 6 and 9 cm depth at location e do not imply that the mixing length of 40m was generally too short for the conducted tracer experiment according to day 1977 the required mixing length was approximately about 25m given a mean surface water velocity of about 0 2m s 1 in the present study the required mixing length was further reduced by injecting the tracer not only over multiple positions across a cross section of about 0 13m 2 but also directly before a 12 5m long concrete pipe general information on the theoretical determination for the required mixing length can be found in day 1977 nevertheless the dataset is still suitable for determining microbial metabolism assuming that the general shape of the surface water fluorescein concentration time series is independent of mixing processes in other words mixing would not affect the shape but only scale the resulting conservative residence time distribution functions this is pivotal as the shape of the conservative residence time distribution function is crucial for reactive parameter estimation höhne et al 2021a such as for microbial metabolism in the present study the assumption is reasonable as fluorescein surface water measurements from three different devices and four different sampling locations within the stream channel show similar shapes compare sm figure sm 6 in addition the shapes of the fluorescein pore water measurements at the locations with the erroneous 0th moments i e at 6 and 9 cm depth for location e are similar to the shapes of the other pore water locations investigated overall the conservative residence time distribution functions and 0th moments determined demonstrate the great transport heterogeneities already within a small cross section of 24 cm 9 cm of the shallow hz in the present snapshot of the hz investigated the apparent subsurface flow field is characterized by rather shallow flow paths that most likely return to the stream for two main reasons first the fluorescein signal did not infiltrate deeper than 6 cm depth second the geological data suggests that the muddy sand lens where the sampling locations were situated in hinders the surface water to infiltrate deeper in addition a pronounced horizontal flow path has occurred between 6 and 9 cm depth at location e the locally and temporally highly heterogeneous transport properties of the hz highlight not only the immense challenges in investigating the actual pollutant s exposure times to favourable conditions for transformation processes to take place but rather the great advantage of using conservative residence time distribution functions enabling the appropriate description of the hz s full heterogeneous transport properties 3 2 troc reactivity in the hz the present dataset demonstrates troc reactivity as spatially interpolated relative attenuation formation percentages and mean residence times as black contour lines for a hz cross section fig 3 note that relative attenuation formation percentages inform the net reactivity along the respective flow paths relative attenuation formation percentages could be calculated for 20 trocs including 3 parent daughter pairs compare section 2 2 note that relative attenuation formation percentages were only calculated for sampling locations where a fluorescein tracer signal was detected indicating the actual extent of the hz during the experiment as discussed in section 3 1 as relative attenuation formation percentages show no apparent pattern with the determined mean hyporheic residence time contour lines the investigated trocs were grouped according to their relative attenuation formation percentages pattern only in particular the trocs were grouped into i compounds that were well attenuated formed ii compounds that were poorly attenuated formed or rather stable and iii compounds that show mixed behaviour i e simultaneous formation and attenuation compounds in group i comprised mtp bis gab bta bzf faa smx as well as val and its transformation product vsa smx val and vsa in fig 3 for mtp val vsa bta bzf faa and bis relative attenuation formation percentages almost evenly increase with depth whereas gab and smx indicate reactive hotspots in particular smx shows two formation hotspots in 3 cm depth at location a and e of the cross section investigated note that smx formation is assumed to indicate backtransformation processes under denitrifying conditions from its transformation products as described for water sediment batch experiments by nödler et al 2012 as well as by barbieri et al 2012 furthermore gab demonstrates an attenuation hotspot at location d at 6 cm depth in general the relative attenuation formation percentages calculated for gab bta bzf vsa mtp and smx agree well with previous investigations at the main channel of river erpe schaper et al 2019 however the results for faa and val significantly differ from the findings reported by schaper et al 2019 recent investigations at the same study site as of the present study by mueller et al 2022 also partly agree with the findings at hand for instance attenuation percentages for bzf a lipid lowering agent were less than 50 compared to 100 in the present study in addition the antibiotic smx was found to undergo not only backtransformation reactions from its transformation products but also attenuation reactions mueller et al 2022 for the beta blocker bis which has widely been detected in surface waters loos et al 2013 quantitative information on its fate in hyporheic sediments is limited batch experiments using hyporheic sediments resulted in relatively low first order attenuation rates of 10 1 d 1 or rather half lives of almost 7 days ramil et al 2010 and thus agree poorly with the findings of the present study i e relatively high attenuation percentages of up to 50 in less than 2 days in regard to parent daughter pairs the findings of the present study suggest that the sartan val contributed most and the sartan irb contributed nothing to its common transformation product vsa which agrees with the findings from field studies by höhne et al 2021a however disagrees with the outcome from flume studies by posselt et al 2020 compounds of group ii i e that were poorly attenuated formed or rather stable comprised the antidiabetic drugs mef and sig as well as irb dbz tra hct dcf vlx mlx in particular irb sig tra hct vlx and its transformation product mlx are rather stable relative formation attenuation percentage 25 whereas mef dcf and dbz show little relative formation attenuation percentages of about 30 mef and dcf in fig 3 stable behaviour for the compounds mlx the metabolite of the antidepressant vlx and the opioid tra have been reported in the hz of the main channel at river erpe by schaper et al 2019 and for hct in flume experiments by jaeger et al 2021 and therefore agree with the present findings in contrast reported values for relative attenuation percentages by schaper et al 2019 disagree for irb with up to 37 compared to low relative percentages ranging between 9 to 9 in the present study during previous field investigations at river erpe vlx and dbz have been found to be persistent schaper et al 2019 as well as to be removed schaper et al 2018b mueller et al 2022 similarly for mef and sig attenuation has been demonstrated in previously conducted field studies posselt et al 2018 as well as in flume experiments jaeger et al 2021 and thus just partly agree with the rather stable behaviour found in the present study the anti inflammatory drug dcf indicates a formation hotspot of about 30 for the locations d and e at 3 cm depth respectively this result neither agrees with previously reported stable behaviour by schaper et al 2019 nor relative attenuation percentages of up to 50 by mueller et al 2022 and schaper et al 2018b however the present results may support the findings from water sediment batch studies by barbieri et al 2012 showing backtransformation behaviour for dcf under denitrifying conditions significant ambivalent behaviour i e simultaneous high formation and attenuation percentages was observed for gpl the main transformation product of the antiepileptic gab and the resin mel group iii mel in fig 3 in the present study the result for mel shows one attenuation and one formation hotspot both at 3 cm depth with low relative percentages of about 30 respectively to the best of our knowledge attenuation behaviour for the resin mel has barely been investigated in the hz under field conditions however the investigations from mechelke et al 2019 using passive samplers at river erpe suggest rather attenuation than formation processes considering the small attenuation and formation rates it can be assumed that the calculated formation is an artefact of small measurement errors the result for gpl shows three significant hotspots one high formation pattern at 6 cm depth and two attenuation patterns both at 3 cm depth fig 4 note that the region with the highest gpl formation aligns well with the region showing the highest attenuation for gab in particular the dimensions of the relative percentages are similar suggesting that gab is mainly transformed to gpl and in that supports previous laboratory findings by henning et al 2018 for field conditions the results for gpl generally agree with previous investigations observing both relatively good attenuation mueller et al 2022 as well as rather stable behaviour schaper et al 2019 overall the behaviour of all trocs considered not only often differs from the findings in previous studies but generally highlights inconsistent observations among laboratory as well as field studies investigating the fate of trocs in the hz in that the present findings underpin the outcome of a recent compilation of reported first order reaction rate coefficients for 82 trocs by greskowiak et al 2017 i e demonstrating large variabilities in troc reactivity among studies greskowiak et al 2017 attributed the differences to site specific microbial population as well as physical and chemical variations note that for modelling studies parameter estimates such as the first order reaction rate also partly differ among studies due to the application of inappropriate transport descriptions as demonstrated by höhne et al 2021a and mccallum et al 2020 in addition recent investigations by mueller et al 2022 demonstrate seasonal impacts on ambivalent reactive behaviour of certain trocs within natural hzs in general the reactivity of trocs in the hz is mainly a function of the exposure times to sorption processes redox conditions and microbial metabolism which themselves are influenced by temperature and other parameters posselt 2020 schaper 2019 more information on previous research discussing the different factors that generally influence troc reactivity can be found for instance in table s2 in mueller et al 2022 in rutere 2020 and in lewandowski et al 2019 however investigating troc reactivity in regard to specific conditions and processes within natural hzs is highly challenging and has barely been possible as it requires to track the trocs along hyporheic flow paths and the occurring chemical and microbiological conditions in other words datasets need to inform about the exposure times of trocs to physical chemical and or microbiological conditions along hyporheic flow paths the present study for the first time examines troc reactivity in regard to the actual exposure time to the microbial metabolism of living facultative or obligate aerobes in hyporheic sediments under natural conditions note that previous studies at river erpe have investigated the effects of the major factors redox conditions schaper et al 2018b and sorption processes schaper et al 2019 on troc reactivity within the natural hz 3 3 influence of microbial metabolism the present dataset on troc reactivity along with contour lines for mean residence times black is complemented by contour lines informing microbial metabolism of living facultative or obligate aerobes based on the resazurin to resorufin transformation rate yellow fig 4 the results indicate generally high microbial metabolism with a pronounced hotspot at 6 cm depth at location d this finding along with high relative removal percentages for 11 out of 20 trocs investigated i e total of group i and iii confirms previous research demonstrating not only the high transformation potential of the hz for trocs schaper 2019 posselt 2020 but also the generally high microbial activity in the shallow hz knapp et al 2017 schaper et al 2019 the microbially reactive hotspot at 6 cm depth aligns well with the reactive hotspots of the parent daughter pair gab and its main transformation product gpl fig 4 in particular the results show highest microbial metabolism where highest gab attenuation and highest gpl formation occurs this finding is in accordance with the results from laboratory scale incubation experiments in water sediment systems by henning et al 2018 suggesting that gab is quickly transformed to gpl under microbiological processes and under aerobic conditions note that although the results for smx and dcf suggest denitrifying conditions at 3 cm depth at location b and d as discussed in section 3 2 redox conditions at 3 cm depth or rather along that according flow path could still have been oxic at some point in fact it is well known that natural systems such as the hz are characterized by steep chemical and microbiological gradients battin et al 2016 in other words redox conditions cannot be explicitly distinguished i e physical chemical and microbiological conditions are highly variable in natural systems thus redox conditions along hyporheic flow paths can comprise any state between oxic and anoxic and therefore reactions such as smx backtransformation under denitrifying conditions as well as gab attenuation under oxic conditions are reasonable to have occurred along the very same flow path furthermore and contrary to henning et al 2018 our results for gpl reveal simultaneous high attenuation and formation potential and thus do not confirm its presumed environmental stability in particular henning et al 2018 suggest that gpl can undergo microbiologically mediated backtransformation to gab under oxic conditions which is not supported by the present findings i e gab does not show formation hotspots where the attenuation hotspots of gpl occur note that the present findings inform the net reactive processes only i e gpl backtransformation to gab may have occurred however was not the dominant process in general the observed attenuation potential of gpl in the present study is in accordance with previous column studies by burke et al 2018 using bank filtration sediments to investigate the fate of gpl under aerobic conditions besides gab and gpl all other trocs investigated that show high attenuation formation percentages such as bzf mtp bis bta faa smx val and its transformation product vsa do not show a reactive pattern similar to the one for microbial metabolism note that showing no similar pattern in the present study does not mean that those compounds are independent of microbial metabolism in fact the influence of microbial metabolism on troc transformation has been reported in batch studies for bta gab mtp val smx using sewage sludge huntscha et al 2014 for mtp using activated sludge rubirola et al 2014 for smx using natural stream biofilms desiante et al 2021 for val in flume studies posselt et al 2020 and for val and bzf in pilot membrane bioreactors kern et al 2010 in contrast for bis and faa no clear microbially dependent transformation has to the best of our knowledge been reported furthermore also trocs that show little attenuation formation or even stable behaviour in the present study can undergo microbially mediated transformation reactions for instance microbially propelled transformation has been reported for mef using activated sludge poursat et al 2019 for irb and sig in flume studies jaeger et al 2021 posselt et al 2020 as well as for sig using suspended sludge henning et al 2019 and for dcf in biofilms desiante et al 2021 overall the absence of a relative percentage reactivity pattern similar to that of microbial metabolism may have two main causes first those trocs simply do not behave as the resazurin resorufin tracer system used and thus investigating those trocs requires reactive tracers informing other specific net microbial metabolism second regarding the trocs that were well attenuated formed as well as reported to be dependent on microbial metabolism i e bzf mtp bta smx and val do actually behave similar to the reactive tracer system used however the present data may not resolve this dependency in other words since the microbial metabolism as well as the aforementioned high relative attenuation formation percentages of those trocs indicate high reactivity throughout the cross section investigated the lack of pronounced differences in reactivity may conceal existing patterns nevertheless the findings highlight that the resazurin resorufin tracer system can inform if microbial processes of facultative or obligate aerobes are a main driver for troc reactivity in natural hyporheic sediments in particular the results demonstrate that the transformation of the anticonvulsant gab to its main transformation product gpl is highly influenced by the microbial metabolism of facultative or obligate aerobes in shallow hyporheic sediments at the same time the present study showcases that appropriate tracers are one crucial building block in order to investigate the fate of pollutants in natural environments and thus stresses the need for further research on reactive tracers that can not only integrate specific microbial reactions but generally reactive properties along flow paths under natural conditions 4 conclusions and recommendations investigating the influence of specific microbial metabolism on troc transformation reactions in natural hyporheic sediments is challenging due to the hz s complex heterogeneous transport and biogeochemical properties a key problem is the suitable determination of microbial metabolism so that the dataset informs actual exposure times and ultimately the integrated effects of specific microbial processes along flow paths the present study demonstrates the use of reactive fluorescent tracers namely the resazurin resorufin system not only to inform specific microbial metabolism under natural conditions but rather an approach on how to appropriately relate data on specific reactive properties to troc transformation reactions in particular the present study highlights the influence of microbial metabolism informed by the resazurin resorufin system namely the metabolic activity of facultative and obligate aerobes on the transformation of the anticonvulsant gab to its main transformation product gpl in that the present study validates previous laboratory results for natural conditions although the present study shows that the resazurin resorufin system helps to elucidate clear links between its corresponding microbial processes and troc transformation reactions the findings likewise stress the need for further tracers that inform the integrated effects for other specific processes overall the findings suggest that reactive fluorescent tracers are well suited to provide net information on actual exposure times to specific reactions not only in hzs but generally in natural heterogeneous systems in addition the present study demonstrates a general framework on how to investigate the factors that drive troc reactivity in hzs under natural conditions beyond that the present study provides a detailed transport and microbial snapshot for a cross section of the shallow hz in regard to troc reactivity under natural conditions generally the snapshot emphasizes the complex transport and reactive properties of the hz in particular the findings most notably underline the difficulties arising from sampling too little point data within the hz such as the challenges regarding large scale interpretations for instance in case of the antibiotic smx and the anti inflammatory drug dcf too little sampling points may have not captured their ambivalent behaviour i e simultaneously indicating formation and attenuation hotspots eventually leading to erroneous conclusions thus future studies investigating the influence of microbial metabolism on pollutant removal within hzs as well as along streams under natural conditions are advised to conduct a multi fluorescent tracer experiment sampling an efficient number of pore water locations multiple reactive fluorescent tracers not only potentially facilitate the disentanglement of specific reactive processes but also inform the actual exposure times to those conditions within the system investigated using the resazurin resorufin tracer system demonstrates only a tiny glimpse of what a multiple reactive fluorescent tracer test may reveal on the pollutant removal capacities of hzs and ultimately their potential for whole stream water quality on that note höhne et al 2021b recently presented a powerful device that may enable real time fluorescence spectroscopy measurements in sediment pore water and thus give access to the many applications of fluorescence spectroscopy directly on site such a dataset would not only elucidate new insights on troc transformation reactions in natural hyporheic sediments but also considerably promote the development of improved conceptual and mathematical models for hzs as well as for conjunctive hz stream models that ultimately are needed to

hyporheic zone influence of microbial metabolism 
15533,the hyporheic zone hz is considered a hydrodynamically driven bioreactor with significant pollutant removal capacities and can therefore not only improve wholestream water quality but also preserve human and ecosystem health microbial metabolism is hypothesized to play a key role in pollutant transformation in hyporheic sediments of natural streams however previous work investigating the influence of microbial metabolism on pollutant transformation has been predominantly laboratory studies the key challenge for field studies is the appropriate determination of net microbial metabolism i e information on the actual exposure times to specific microbial processes in the investigated system the present study uses reactive fluorescent tracers to determine microbial metabolism and ultimately its influence on pollutant transformation e g for trace organic compounds in hyporheic sediments under natural conditions in particular the reactive fluorescent tracers resazurin and its main transformation product resorufin were used to determine the microbial metabolism of facultative or obligate aerobes the influence of the derived microbial metabolism on the transformation of 20 trace organic compounds such as pharmaceuticals including 3 parent daughter pairs was examined the present findings validate laboratory results on the microbially mediated transformation of the anticonvulsant gabapentin to its main transformation product gabapentin lactam under natural conditions all other trocs investigated did not show a clear link between troc reactivity to the microbial metabolism informed by the resazurin resorufin system overall the present study not only demonstrates the use of the fluorescent tracer system resazurin and resorufin for determining microbial metabolism of facultative or obligate aerobes but also generally highlights the potential of reactive fluorescent tracers to disentangle specific reactive properties and ultimately their influence on

system fluorescence tracer test data availability data will be made available on request plain language summary streambed sediments act as natural bioreactors with significant pollutant removal capacities and in that improve stream water quality the present study investigates the influence of microbial processes on the fate of certain pollutants in natural streambed sediments in addition the present study demonstrates an approach on how to investigate the link between pollutant reactivity and microbial processes under field conditions 1 introduction trace organic compounds trocs originating from wastewater treatment plants have become ubiquitous in aquatic systems wilkinson et al 2017 and may eventually impair human and ecosystem health mezzelani et al 2018 richmond et al 2018 in natural streams the hyporheic zone hz the interface in streambed sediments where surface water and groundwater mix has been widely reported to function as a hydrodynamically driven bioreactor findlay 1995 lewandowski et al 2019 recent studies have demonstrated the hz s removal potential not only for nutrients zarnetske et al 2011 gomez velez et al 2015 but also for trocs lewandowski et al 2011 schaper et al 2018b and thus its importance for overall stream water quality in other words understanding the influence of transport and biogeochemical processes on the fate of pollutants in hyporheic sediments is key for water quality management in riverine systems to this end previous studies investigated the influence of hyporheic exchange fluxes schaper et al 2018a redox conditions schaper et al 2018b seasonal effects mueller et al 2022 organic matter composition mueller et al 2021 and retardation processes schaper et al 2019 on the attenuation potential for trocs in natural hzs although considered to be a key driver roche and dentz 2021 rutere 2020 the influence of specific microbial metabolism on troc transformation reactions has barely been investigated in natural hyporheic sediments determining a clear relationship between specific microbial processes and troc transformation reactions in hyporheic sediments is extremely challenging and has to the best of our knowledge not been achieved under natural conditions previous studies mainly investigated the relationship between troc transformation and microbial metabolism in laboratory batch or column studies using natural stream biofilms desiante et al 2021 rosi et al 2017 hyporheic sediments coll et al 2020 rutere et al 2020 or conducted flume studies using hyporheic sediments posselt et al 2020 jaeger et al 2021 in regard to field studies the key challenge lies in the suitable determination of microbial metabolism so that this data can be appropriately related to troc transformation data in particular the dataset needs to inform the integrated effects of microbial reactions that have occurred along the investigated system abbott et al 2016 provide a general overview of the main approaches to characterize microbiological processes along the system of interest in regard to hzs one approach for characterizing the microbial community is to use sequencing techniques rutere et al 2020 jaeger et al 2021 and link the abundance of bacterial taxa and their known qualities to troc transformation reactions however the abundance of bacterial taxa or specific genes does not directly imply that the attributable processes have occurred in addition the approach only provides point data i e does not integrate the occurring microbiological processes limiting its use for stream scale interpretation overall the approach neither informs the actual exposure times of the trocs to the reactive microbial community nor helps to characterize the specific favourable microbial reactions for troc transformation to take place further advancements in investigating microbial metabolism in hzs include the use of fluorescent reactive tracers such as fluorescein diacetate battin 1997 or the resazurin resorufin system haggerty et al 2008 generally reactive fluorescent tracers provide two key benefits compared to alternative approaches first fluorescent tracers are easy to measure and allow continuous in situ real time measurements at low labour and financial costs second reactive fluorescent tracers provide net information about their exposure time to the specific conditions for their transformation reaction to occur for instance resazurin is transformed to resorufin under the specific condition of a midly reducing milieu in the presence of living facultative or obligate aerobes haggerty et al 2008 but not of strict anaerobes gonzález pinzón et al 2012 and thus its concentration measurements implicitly inform about this specific microbial metabolism or rather microbial activity in other words local point measurements of fluorescent reactive tracers provide large scale integrated net information on their attributable specific reactions general information on the well known concept of proxy tracers and how they inform exposure times to net processes can be found in chapter 3 in abbott et al 2016 and in figure 1b in höhne et al 2021a local point measurements of troc concentrations similarly provide integrative information on the reactive processes that have occurred within the investigated system thus measurements of both reactive fluorescent tracers as well as of trocs from the same location at stationary conditions reflect integrative information on their net reactivity along the same flow paths and consequently can be linked to inform possible relations to one another the overall objective of the present study is to clearly link specific microbial metabolism to troc transformation reactions in natural hzs to this end a stream tracer test using the resazurin resorufin system along with the conservative fluorescent tracer fluorescein was conducted in river erpe berlin germany a stream fed predominantly by treated wastewater samples for the fluorescent tracers as well as for 35 trocs including 9 transformation products were taken at 15 pore water locations within the shallow hz transport heterogeneities were investigated by the means of non parametric residence time distribution function estimates according to cirpka et al 2007 and temporal moment analysis as demonstrated by cirpka and kitanidis 2000 microbial metabolism was determined using the approach presented by höhne et al 2021a as well as by knapp and cirpka 2018 the main aim is to investigate any relationships between microbial metabolism informed by the resazurin resorufin system and single trocs or parent daughter pair transformation reactions in natural hzs 2 methods 2 1 site description and experimental overview the present study was conducted in a side channel of river erpe 52 476437 n 13 625765 e a treated wastewater impacted lowland stream located east of berlin germany the streambed sediment of the reach investigated is predominantly characterized by sandy material compare supporting material sm figure sm 1 determined from ground penetrating radar measurements using the viy3 300 system transient technologies llc ukraine the streambed sediment at the pore water sampling location consists of a muddy sand deposit on average 20 cm thick previous investigations by mueller et al 2021 have shown that most physical and chemical parameters of the surface water and pore water fluctuate at a characteristic diurnal pattern caused by regular diurnally changing discharge of the münchehofe wastewater treatment plant further detailed descriptions on sediment characteristics stream morphology and biogeochemical characteristics of the present study site can be found in mueller et al 2022 a fluorescence tracer test was conducted on 8 september 2020 during nighttime in order to avoid photodegradation between 9 55pm and 11 10pm a 15l fluorescent tracer solution with 60g of fluorescein as conservative and 60g of resazurin as reactive tracer dissolved in stream water was injected into the surface water 40m upstream of the pore water sampling location at a constant rate using a peristaltic pump ismatec sa germany sufficient mixing was achieved due to the injection of the tracer solution at four locations along the inlet cross section of a 12 5m long concrete pipe over the course of the experiment discharge ranged between 30 to 50 l s 1 compare table sm 1 net pore water pressure data allows the assumption of stationary conditions during the experiment i e a steady and uniform subsurface flow field despite reported discharge variations compare sm figure sm 2 note that determining further transport characteristics is not required as the conservative residence time distribution function already informs the full transport properties compare section 2 3 more information on the concept of conservative residence time distributions functions can be found in leray et al 2016 and in cirpka et al 2007 in total the experiment lasted 40h breakthrough curves of the injected fluorescent tracers fluorescein resazurin and additionally resorufin the main transformation product of resazurin were measured 40m downstream of the injection site in the surface water as well as at 15 pore water locations sampling was conducted in 3 cm 6 cm and 9 cm depth of the streambed sediment at 5 locations a e spaced 5 or 7 cm along a cross section perpendicular to the surface water flow direction fig 1 unfortunately a beaver has partly destroyed the pore water sampling setup after almost 24h only the 3

and additionally with a handheld fluorometer aquafluor turner designs usa by taking grab samples at 10min intervals during the tracer injection and at 1h intervals over the course of the experiment samples of hyporheic pore water were collected using hplc tubes peek inner diameter 0 76 mm sigma aldrich usa attached to wooden skewers and covered with a nylon mesh mesh size 40 μ m at the sampling

constant rate of 1ml min 1 fig 1 previous investigations conducted at river erpe have shown that a pumping rate of 1ml min 1 is sufficient to preserve the integrity of the hyporheic flow field posselt et al 2018 during the experiment 2ml of hyporheic pore water were sampled regularly from each of the 15 sampling ports and immediately analysed for the fluorescent tracers with the handheld fluorometer before and after the experiment about 3ml of surface water as well as of hyporheic pore water from all 15 ports were sampled for troc analysis in addition the conservative tracer fluorescein was recorded with a self constructed device for real time in situ fluorescence measurements developed by höhne et al 2021b two sensors were installed in the streambed sediment approximately 1m downstream of the pore water sampling location so that surface water and pore water at 5 cm depth were regularly sampled at 5 20min intervals the multi layered filter of each measurement chamber of the two sensors consisted of three layers with mesh sizes of 500 μ m 60 μ m and 34 μ m respectively detailed information on fluorescence data evaluation are provided in section sm 2 of the sm in addition electrical conductivity pressure and temperature were recorded at 5min intervals using ctd loggers van essen instruments b v netherlands in both the surface and pore water compare sm section sm 1 3 the pore water ctd loggers were covered with a nylon mesh and placed within the streambed channel in 7 cm 9 cm and 15 cm depth approximately 3m upstream of the pore water

acid benzotriazole and methylbenzotriazole using both methods differences less than 20 detailed descriptions on both methods for troc analyses can be found in section sm 3 of the sm in total 35 trocs

furosemide fur and chlorothiazide ctz ranged mainly within their respective limit of quantification loq and therefore were not considered in further analysis in addition surface water concentrations before and after the tracer experiment were not constant for guanylurea gua hydroxy diclofenac hcf diatrizoate ats iomeprol iom iopromid iop methylbenzotriazole mbt and acesulfame acs and thus also excluded from further analysis overall the influence of microbial metabolism on troc transformation processes in the hz could be investigated for 21 trocs namely the antidiabetic drugs metformin mef

product valsartan acid vsa 2 3 assessing conservative residence time distributions and local temporal moments the conservative residence time distributions inform the net heterogeneous transport properties of the investigated system non parametric conservative residence time distributions can directly be estimated using the well established deconvolution method introduced by cirpka et al 2007 in brief two concentration time series of a conservative tracer from an input and output location of the system investigated are deconvolved imposing a geostatistical method for smoothness and lagrange multipliers for non negativity in the present study surface water concentration time series of the conservative tracer fluorescein were deconvolved with each fluorescein concentration time series of the pore water locations investigated to reduce fluorescein mass uncertainties the high temporal resolution fluorescein data from the ggun fl30 recordings 10s intervals were used for the surface water concentration time series instead of the handheld data 10min intervals furthermore an artificial blank concentration had been added to all handheld measurements at the time of the tracer injection start preventing the addition of artificial mass due to the low sampling intervals compare sm figure sm 5 in addition missing values were linearly interpolated in the present study 1000 realizations and the best estimate for the conservative residence time distributions could be generated for 10 out of 15 pore water locations i e where a sufficient fluorescein signal was recorded fig 2a the estimated conservative residence time distributions and the fluorescein concentration time series were used to derive local temporal moments according to the approach presented by cirpka and kitanidis 2000 in that for the one dimensional case at stationary conditions local temporal moments help to inform mass balances unit mass for concentration time series and unit mass percentage for residence time distributions or rather dilution and apparent physical parameters such as pore water velocities and therefore mean residence times 2 4 calculation of relative attenuation formation percentages relative troc attenuation formation percentages were calculated between the surface water and each pore water location investigated normalized by a stable reference compound according to 1 r e l x 1 c ref sw c ref pw c x pw c x sw 100 where r e l x is the relative attenuation formation percentage of the compound of interest x c ref sw and c ref pw are the measured concentrations of the stable reference compound in the surface water and pore water respectively and c x sw and c x pw are the measured concentrations of the compound of interest in the surface water and pore water respectively note that positive values indicate percentage attenuation whereas negative values indicate percentage formation of the respective compound of interest i e how much has been attenuated formed yet in the present study cbz is used as stable reference compound as it was found to be rather stable in the hz variability less than 12 troc attenuation formation was considered significant if the 5 to 95 percentile of the relative attenuation formation did not include zero non significant relative attenuation formation percentages were set to zero the approach implies i stable hydrological conditions ii constant compound ratios in the surface water and iii the absence of other troc sources all requirements were met in the present study hydrological conditions over the course of the experiment i e subsurface flow field were relatively stationary as net pore water pressure fluctuations were small compare sm figure sm 2 furthermore a previous 11h experiment by mueller et al 2022 as well as a 48h experiment unpublished have shown that concentration time series for most trocs sampled at 1h intervals do not show significant fluctuations or changing compound ratios the measured surface water troc concentrations at two sampling times also only showed minor variations for most of the trocs investigated in the present study other sources for trocs are assumed negligible as the river erpe receives up to 80 of its discharge from the münchehofe municipal wastewater treatment plant lewandowski et al 2011 note that the approach also assumes similar transport time scales i e no significant retardation for the compounds of interest and the stable reference compound used i e cbz in the present study retardation coefficients could not be estimated for the trocs investigated since i no concentration time series were measured and ii the troc concentrations do barely show a distinct temporal pattern both requirements would be necessary to apply a model for estimating retardation or rather sorption desorption coefficients however previous investigations at river erpe have determined low retardation coefficients for trocs within the hz höhne et al 2021a in addition due to the relatively constant surface water concentrations and the aspect that the sediment is most likely well saturated with trocs mueller et al 2022 desorption processes and overall significant retardation processes are assumed negligible note that only relative formation attenuation percentages are provided in the present study most studies usually determine first order reaction rate coefficients or half lives as they are better suited for comparison among studies in the present study first order reaction rate coefficients were not determined for two main reasons first greskowiak et al 2017 demonstrate that first order reaction rate coefficients and implied half lives vary significantly among studies making comparisons difficult second the dataset was not sufficient to be used with a model approach that considers the heterogeneous transport properties of the hz in order to estimate reactive parameters such as the first order reaction rate coefficient note that reactive parameter estimates derived from simplistic transport model conceptualizations introduce significant errors höhne et al 2021a mccallum et al 2020 overall the findings from previous studies underline the complexity of troc reactivity and the great challenge in investigating the factors that drive the fate of trocs under natural conditions 2 5 assessing microbial metabolism microbial metabolism can be determined using the fluorescent tracer resazurin and its transformation product resorufin haggerty et al 2008 in the present study microbial metabolism is defined as the resazurin to resorufin transformation rate testing two approaches for its determination one approach proposed by knapp and cirpka 2018 and one approach presented by höhne et al 2021a the first approach by knapp and cirpka 2018 defines the resazurin to resorufin transformation rate as the natural logarithm of the ratio of the resazurin input mass to the sum of resazurin input mass and the changes in resorufin mass using the 0th temporal moments normalized by the mean residence time this approach yields the smallest possible bulk transformation rate knapp and cirpka 2018 note that the approach assumes no resorufin degradation the second approach by höhne et al 2021a determines the resazurin to resorufin transformation rate by using non parametric conservative transport with a linear sorption model in the present study the conservative tracer fluorescein is used to determine the non parametric conservative residence time distribution function the concentration time series of the fluorescent tracer resazurin and its transformation product resorufin are then used as calibration target for the simple retardation model to estimate the retardation and the first order degradation coefficients i e resazurin to resorufin transformation rate the approach requires stationary conditions and an appropriate dataset which are both met in the present study further details on the model implementation can be found in section sm 4 1 of the sm note that for investigating the influence of microbial metabolism on troc transformation reactions in natural hyporheic sediments only the results provided by the approach of höhne et al 2021a are used compare sm figure sm 10 3 results and discussion 3 1 transport heterogeneities in the hz fluorescein tracer signals could only be detected in 10 out of 15 pore water sampling locations fig 2a in particular no fluorescein tracer signals were detected at 6 cm depth for location c as well as at any 9 cm depth locations except for location e detecting no fluorescein tracer signal indicates that stream surface water did not infiltrate until those depths the fluorescein tracer concentrations measured served as conservative tracer to infer residence time distribution functions informing the heterogeneous transport processes fig 2b for all inferred residence time distribution functions the range of residence times increases whereas the maximum frequency decreases with depth in addition the shapes and peaks highly vary for both the different depths investigated and within the same depths the 0th moments determined from both the conservative residence time distribution functions and the fluorescein concentration time series measured at the sampling locations indicate increasing dilution towards greater depth fig 2a in contrast the relative attenuation percentage of the stable conservative troc cbz shows no change with depth i e no dilution this is reasonable since the extent of the apparent hz is hydrodynamically driven i e varies with the stream stage and thus depends on the tracer used for its investigation for example the river erpe receives treated wastewater containing trocs for many years and thus making cbz a tracer yielding the average extent of the hz including mixing processes whereas the artificially injected fluorescein tracer only informs the current hz extent this finding highlights the importance of using an appropriate conservative tracer that informs the actual physical conditions during the experimental investigations in addition the 0th moments for two locations i e at 6 cm and 9 cm depth for location e indicate that over twice of the actual injected surface water mass would have passed these locations fig 2a this is physically impossible significant errors during sampling are assumed negligible since it occurs at more than one sampling site and the raw fluorescein data does generally not show respective irregularities erroneous results due to non stationary conditions are also excluded as the pore water pressure data does not show significant net pressure changes i e net pressure differences between surface water and the respective pore water depth were constant over the course of the experiment the inaccurate 0th moments are rather attributed to locally restricted mixing issues in the surface water in particular since the stream channel was fairly well covered with macrophytes fig 1 it is reasonable that the injected tracer solution was less well mixed towards the banks therefore for location e being closest to the banks fractions of unmixed surface water may have entered the hz shortly upstream of the sampling site and got onto a pronounced horizontal flow path spanning the respective sampling locations i e 6 and 9 cm depth the lack of a similar finding for location a which is closest to the other bank is attributed to the hz s highly heterogeneous transport properties which makes interpreting local point observations in general very challenging overall calculating the 0th moment for measurements at unmixed conditions yields incorrect results as the unmixed surface water concentration being higher than the fully mixed one erroneously simulates higher initially injected mass on another note the incorrect 0th moments for 6 and 9 cm depth at location e do not imply that the mixing length of 40m was generally too short for the conducted tracer experiment according to day 1977 the required mixing length was approximately about 25m given a mean surface water velocity of about 0 2m s 1 in the present study the required mixing length was further reduced by injecting the tracer not only over multiple positions across a cross section of about 0 13m 2 but also directly before a 12 5m long concrete pipe general information on the theoretical determination for the required mixing length can be found in day 1977 nevertheless the dataset is still suitable for determining microbial metabolism assuming that the general shape of the surface water fluorescein concentration time series is independent of mixing processes in other words mixing would not affect the shape but only scale the resulting conservative residence time distribution functions this is pivotal as the shape of the conservative residence time distribution function is crucial for reactive parameter estimation höhne et al 2021a such as for microbial metabolism in the present study the assumption is reasonable as fluorescein surface water measurements from three different devices and four different sampling locations within the stream channel show similar shapes compare sm figure sm 6 in addition the shapes of the fluorescein pore water measurements at the locations with the erroneous 0th moments i e at 6 and 9 cm depth for location e are similar to the shapes of the other pore water locations investigated overall the conservative residence time distribution functions and 0th moments determined demonstrate the great transport heterogeneities already within a small cross section of 24 cm 9 cm of the shallow hz in the present snapshot of the hz investigated the apparent subsurface flow field is characterized by rather shallow flow paths that most likely return to the stream for two main reasons first the fluorescein signal did not infiltrate deeper than 6 cm depth second the geological data suggests that the muddy sand lens where the sampling locations were situated in hinders the surface water to infiltrate deeper in addition a pronounced horizontal flow path has occurred between 6 and 9 cm depth at location e the locally and temporally highly heterogeneous transport properties of the hz highlight not only the immense challenges in investigating the actual pollutant s exposure times to favourable conditions for transformation processes to take place but rather the great advantage of using conservative residence time distribution functions enabling the appropriate description of the hz s full heterogeneous transport properties 3 2 troc reactivity in the hz the present dataset demonstrates troc reactivity as spatially interpolated relative attenuation formation percentages and mean residence times as black contour lines for a hz cross section fig 3 note that relative attenuation formation percentages inform the net reactivity along the respective flow paths relative attenuation formation percentages could be calculated for 20 trocs including 3 parent daughter pairs compare section 2 2 note that relative attenuation formation percentages were only calculated for sampling locations where a fluorescein tracer signal was detected indicating the actual extent of the hz during the experiment as discussed in section 3 1 as relative attenuation formation percentages show no apparent pattern with the determined mean hyporheic residence time contour lines the investigated trocs were grouped according to their relative attenuation formation percentages pattern only in particular the trocs were grouped into i compounds that were well attenuated formed ii compounds that were poorly attenuated formed or rather stable and iii compounds that show mixed behaviour i e simultaneous formation and attenuation compounds in group i comprised mtp bis gab bta bzf faa smx as well as val and its transformation product vsa smx val and vsa in fig 3 for mtp val vsa bta bzf faa and bis relative attenuation formation percentages almost evenly increase with depth whereas gab and smx indicate reactive hotspots in particular smx shows two formation hotspots in 3 cm depth at location a and e of the cross section investigated note that smx formation is assumed to indicate backtransformation processes under denitrifying conditions from its transformation products as described for water sediment batch experiments by nödler et al 2012 as well as by barbieri et al 2012 furthermore gab demonstrates an attenuation hotspot at location d at 6 cm depth in general the relative attenuation formation percentages calculated for gab bta bzf vsa mtp and smx agree well with previous investigations at the main channel of river erpe schaper et al 2019 however the results for faa and val significantly differ from the findings reported by schaper et al 2019 recent investigations at the same study site as of the present study by mueller et al 2022 also partly agree with the findings at hand for instance attenuation percentages for bzf a lipid lowering agent were less than 50 compared to 100 in the present study in addition the antibiotic smx was found to undergo not only backtransformation reactions from its transformation products but also attenuation reactions mueller et al 2022 for the beta blocker bis which has widely been detected in surface waters loos et al 2013 quantitative information on its fate in hyporheic sediments is limited batch experiments using hyporheic sediments resulted in relatively low first order attenuation rates of 10 1 d 1 or rather half lives of almost 7 days ramil et al 2010 and thus agree poorly with the findings of the present study i e relatively high attenuation percentages of up to 50 in less than 2 days in regard to parent daughter pairs the findings of the present study suggest that the sartan val contributed most and the sartan irb contributed nothing to its common transformation product vsa which agrees with the findings from field studies by höhne et al 2021a however disagrees with the outcome from flume studies by posselt et al 2020 compounds of group ii i e that were poorly attenuated formed or rather stable comprised the antidiabetic drugs mef and sig as well as irb dbz tra hct dcf vlx mlx in particular irb sig tra hct vlx and its transformation product mlx are rather stable relative formation attenuation percentage 25 whereas mef dcf and dbz show little relative formation attenuation percentages of about 30 mef and dcf in fig 3 stable behaviour for the compounds mlx the metabolite of the antidepressant vlx and the opioid tra have been reported in the hz of the main channel at river erpe by schaper et al 2019 and for hct in flume experiments by jaeger et al 2021 and therefore agree with the present findings in contrast reported values for relative attenuation percentages by schaper et al 2019 disagree for irb with up to 37 compared to low relative percentages ranging between 9 to 9 in the present study during previous field investigations at river erpe vlx and dbz have been found to be persistent schaper et al 2019 as well as to be removed schaper et al 2018b mueller et al 2022 similarly for mef and sig attenuation has been demonstrated in previously conducted field studies posselt et al 2018 as well as in flume experiments jaeger et al 2021 and thus just partly agree with the rather stable behaviour found in the present study the anti inflammatory drug dcf indicates a formation hotspot of about 30 for the locations d and e at 3 cm depth respectively this result neither agrees with previously reported stable behaviour by schaper et al 2019 nor relative attenuation percentages of up to 50 by mueller et al 2022 and schaper et al 2018b however the present results may support the findings from water sediment batch studies by barbieri et al 2012 showing backtransformation behaviour for dcf under denitrifying conditions significant ambivalent behaviour i e simultaneous high formation and attenuation percentages was observed for gpl the main transformation product of the antiepileptic gab and the resin mel group iii mel in fig 3 in the present study the result for mel shows one attenuation and one formation hotspot both at 3 cm depth with low relative percentages of about 30 respectively to the best of our knowledge attenuation behaviour for the resin mel has barely been investigated in the hz under field conditions however the investigations from mechelke et al 2019 using passive samplers at river erpe suggest rather attenuation than formation processes considering the small attenuation and formation rates it can be assumed that the calculated formation is an artefact of small measurement errors the result for gpl shows three significant hotspots one high formation pattern at 6 cm depth and two attenuation patterns both at 3 cm depth fig 4 note that the region with the highest gpl formation aligns well with the region showing the highest attenuation for gab in particular the dimensions of the relative percentages are similar suggesting that gab is mainly transformed to gpl and in that supports previous laboratory findings by henning et al 2018 for field conditions the results for gpl generally agree with previous investigations observing both relatively good attenuation mueller et al 2022 as well as rather stable behaviour schaper et al 2019 overall the behaviour of all trocs considered not only often differs from the findings in previous studies but generally highlights inconsistent observations among laboratory as well as field studies investigating the fate of trocs in the hz in that the present findings underpin the outcome of a recent compilation of reported first order reaction rate coefficients for 82 trocs by greskowiak et al 2017 i e demonstrating large variabilities in troc reactivity among studies greskowiak et al 2017 attributed the differences to site specific microbial population as well as physical and chemical variations note that for modelling studies parameter estimates such as the first order reaction rate also partly differ among studies due to the application of inappropriate transport descriptions as demonstrated by höhne et al 2021a and mccallum et al 2020 in addition recent investigations by mueller et al 2022 demonstrate seasonal impacts on ambivalent reactive behaviour of certain trocs within natural hzs in general the reactivity of trocs in the hz is mainly a function of the exposure times to sorption processes redox conditions and microbial metabolism which themselves are influenced by temperature and other parameters posselt 2020 schaper 2019 more information on previous research discussing the different factors that generally influence troc reactivity can be found for instance in table s2 in mueller et al 2022 in rutere 2020 and in lewandowski et al 2019 however investigating troc reactivity in regard to specific conditions and processes within natural hzs is highly challenging and has barely been possible as it requires to track the trocs along hyporheic flow paths and the occurring chemical and microbiological conditions in other words datasets need to inform about the exposure times of trocs to physical chemical and or microbiological conditions along hyporheic flow paths the present study for the first time examines troc reactivity in regard to the actual exposure time to the microbial metabolism of living facultative or obligate aerobes in hyporheic sediments under natural conditions note that previous studies at river erpe have investigated the effects of the major factors redox conditions schaper et al 2018b and sorption processes schaper et al 2019 on troc reactivity within the natural hz 3 3 influence of microbial metabolism the present dataset on troc reactivity along with contour lines for mean residence times black is complemented by contour lines informing microbial metabolism of living facultative or obligate aerobes based on the resazurin to resorufin transformation rate yellow fig 4 the results indicate generally high microbial metabolism with a pronounced hotspot at 6 cm depth at location d this finding along with high relative removal percentages for 11 out of 20 trocs investigated i e total of group i and iii confirms previous research demonstrating not only the high transformation potential of the hz for trocs schaper 2019 posselt 2020 but also the generally high microbial activity in the shallow hz knapp et al 2017 schaper et al 2019 the microbially reactive hotspot at 6 cm depth aligns well with the reactive hotspots of the parent daughter pair gab and its main transformation product gpl fig 4 in particular the results show highest microbial metabolism where highest gab attenuation and highest gpl formation occurs this finding is in accordance with the results from laboratory scale incubation experiments in water sediment systems by henning et al 2018 suggesting that gab is quickly transformed to gpl under microbiological processes and under aerobic conditions note that although the results for smx and dcf suggest denitrifying conditions at 3 cm depth at location b and d as discussed in section 3 2 redox conditions at 3 cm depth or rather along that according flow path could still have been oxic at some point in fact it is well known that natural systems such as the hz are characterized by steep chemical and microbiological gradients battin et al 2016 in other words redox conditions cannot be explicitly distinguished i e physical chemical and microbiological conditions are highly variable in natural systems thus redox conditions along hyporheic flow paths can comprise any state between oxic and anoxic and therefore reactions such as smx backtransformation under denitrifying conditions as well as gab attenuation under oxic conditions are reasonable to have occurred along the very same flow path furthermore and contrary to henning et al 2018 our results for gpl reveal simultaneous high attenuation and formation potential and thus do not confirm its presumed environmental stability in particular henning et al 2018 suggest that gpl can undergo microbiologically mediated backtransformation to gab under oxic conditions which is not supported by the present findings i e gab does not show formation hotspots where the attenuation hotspots of gpl occur note that the present findings inform the net reactive processes only i e gpl backtransformation to gab may have occurred however was not the dominant process in general the observed attenuation potential of gpl in the present study is in accordance with previous column studies by burke et al 2018 using bank filtration sediments to investigate the fate of gpl under aerobic conditions besides gab and gpl all other trocs investigated that show high attenuation formation percentages such as bzf mtp bis bta faa smx val and its transformation product vsa do not show a reactive pattern similar to the one for microbial metabolism note that showing no similar pattern in the present study does not mean that those compounds are independent of microbial metabolism in fact the influence of microbial metabolism on troc transformation has been reported in batch studies for bta gab mtp val smx using sewage sludge huntscha et al 2014 for mtp using activated sludge rubirola et al 2014 for smx using natural stream biofilms desiante et al 2021 for val in flume studies posselt et al 2020 and for val and bzf in pilot membrane bioreactors kern et al 2010 in contrast for bis and faa no clear microbially dependent transformation has to the best of our knowledge been reported furthermore also trocs that show little attenuation formation or even stable behaviour in the present study can undergo microbially mediated transformation reactions for instance microbially propelled transformation has been reported for mef using activated sludge poursat et al 2019 for irb and sig in flume studies jaeger et al 2021 posselt et al 2020 as well as for sig using suspended sludge henning et al 2019 and for dcf in biofilms desiante et al 2021 overall the absence of a relative percentage reactivity pattern similar to that of microbial metabolism may have two main causes first those trocs simply do not behave as the resazurin resorufin tracer system used and thus investigating those trocs requires reactive tracers informing other specific net microbial metabolism second regarding the trocs that were well attenuated formed as well as reported to be dependent on microbial metabolism i e bzf mtp bta smx and val do actually behave similar to the reactive tracer system used however the present data may not resolve this dependency in other words since the microbial metabolism as well as the aforementioned high relative attenuation formation percentages of those trocs indicate high reactivity throughout the cross section investigated the lack of pronounced differences in reactivity may conceal existing patterns nevertheless the findings highlight that the resazurin resorufin tracer system can inform if microbial processes of facultative or obligate aerobes are a main driver for troc reactivity in natural hyporheic sediments in particular the results demonstrate that the transformation of the anticonvulsant gab to its main transformation product gpl is highly influenced by the microbial metabolism of facultative or obligate aerobes in shallow hyporheic sediments at the same time the present study showcases that appropriate tracers are one crucial building block in order to investigate the fate of pollutants in natural environments and thus stresses the need for further research on reactive tracers that can not only integrate specific microbial reactions but generally reactive properties along flow paths under natural conditions 4 conclusions and recommendations investigating the influence of specific microbial metabolism on troc transformation reactions in natural hyporheic sediments is challenging due to the hz s complex heterogeneous transport and biogeochemical properties a key problem is the suitable determination of microbial metabolism so that the dataset informs actual exposure times and ultimately the integrated effects of specific microbial processes along flow paths the present study demonstrates the use of reactive fluorescent tracers namely the resazurin resorufin system not only to inform specific microbial metabolism under natural conditions but rather an approach on how to appropriately relate data on specific reactive properties to troc transformation reactions in particular the present study highlights the influence of microbial metabolism informed by the resazurin resorufin system namely the metabolic activity of facultative and obligate aerobes on the transformation of the anticonvulsant gab to its main transformation product gpl in that the present study validates previous laboratory results for natural conditions although the present study shows that the resazurin resorufin system helps to elucidate clear links between its corresponding microbial processes and troc transformation reactions the findings likewise stress the need for further tracers that inform the integrated effects for other specific processes overall the findings suggest that reactive fluorescent tracers are well suited to provide net information on actual exposure times to specific reactions not only in hzs but generally in natural heterogeneous systems in addition the present study demonstrates a general framework on how to investigate the factors that drive troc reactivity in hzs under natural conditions beyond that the present study provides a detailed transport and microbial snapshot for a cross section of the shallow hz in regard to troc reactivity under natural conditions generally the snapshot emphasizes the complex transport and reactive properties of the hz in particular the findings most notably underline the difficulties arising from sampling too little point data within the hz such as the challenges regarding large scale interpretations for instance in case of the antibiotic smx and the anti inflammatory drug dcf too little sampling points may have not captured their ambivalent behaviour i e simultaneously indicating formation and attenuation hotspots eventually leading to erroneous conclusions thus future studies investigating the influence of microbial metabolism on pollutant removal within hzs as well as along streams under natural conditions are advised to conduct a multi fluorescent tracer experiment sampling an efficient number of pore water locations multiple reactive fluorescent tracers not only potentially facilitate the disentanglement of specific reactive processes but also inform the actual exposure times to those conditions within the system investigated using the resazurin resorufin tracer system demonstrates only a tiny glimpse of what a multiple reactive fluorescent tracer test may reveal on the pollutant removal capacities of hzs and ultimately their potential for whole stream water quality on that note höhne et al 2021b recently presented a powerful device that may enable real time fluorescence spectroscopy measurements in sediment pore water and thus give access to the many applications of fluorescence spectroscopy directly on site such a dataset would not only elucidate new insights on troc transformation reactions in natural hyporheic sediments but also considerably promote the development of improved conceptual and mathematical models for hzs as well as for conjunctive hz stream models that ultimately are needed to

15534,pollution exacerbates a region s water scarcity by making water unfit for different uses and reducing freshwater availability local water scarcity may lead to economic output losses and the risk can be transmitted to downstream sectors through reduced input supplies previous studies focus on quantity based water scarcity assessment it is still unknown how water quality constraints may amplify economic risks of local water use sectors and distant economies here we introduce an integrated method and assess the impacts of both quantity and quality based local physical water scarcity risks lwsr and virtual water scarcity risks vwsr in domestic trade system in china we find in 2017 quality based lwsr and vwsr in china are 593 and 240 billion us inclusion of water pollution constraints almost doubles the risks of economic losses due to insufficient clean water supply we then identify critical regions and sectors that are highly risky or vulnerable to the supply chains we find water pollution makes risky vwsr exporters more centralized in a few northern provinces where available freshwater resources are already limited e g the agriculture sector in hebei province vwsr importers span broadly but water pollution increases concentrations of upstream suppliers that face local water scarcity for most provinces decreasing overall resilience of china s domestic trade network our results underscore the needs to alleviate overall scarcity risks by conserving physical water resources and improving water quality simultaneously graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water scarcity risk water pollution multiregional input output model china data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water scarcity poses enormous economic risks to water use sectors such as energy agriculture and manufacturing dolan et al 2021 the imbalance between water demand and water availability is a major contributor to regional water scarcity boretti and rosa 2019 yu et al 2011 many regions in the world are suffering from economic impacts of water scarcity as the world s factory china feeds 20 of the global population but has only 7 of the freshwater resources on the planet cheng et al 2009 sun et al 2021 inequality in water scarcity is even worse within the country the north china plain located in the basins of the hai huai and yellow rivers contributes to more than a quarter of china s total economic outputs whereas available water resources in the region account for less than 8 of the country s total amount cheng et al 2009 assessing spatial pattern of water scarcity is thus fundamental for mitigating economic risks in local sectors in addition to insufficient water quantity water pollution also exacerbates local water scarcity risks poor water quality fails to meet the basic requirement of water use sectors which may constrain water usability and induce economic output losses gleick 1996 liu et al 2016 for instance salinity chemical oxygen demand cod and other pollutants lead to considerable constraints on water usability in sectors such as irrigation industrial production and domestic use van vliet et al 2017 as a result water scarcity risks are expected to worsen considerably in many regions as both surface and ground water quality have been deteriorated due to rapid urbanization and poorly treated wastewater discharge cheng and hu 2012 in china for example pollutant concentrations observed in 27 6 of china s surface water monitoring stations were not up to grade iii standard in 2018 a water quality level that merely enables people to swim in li et al 2019 sustainable management of water resources in china and other water dependent economies should not only account for demand in water quantity but also for water quality he et al 2020 current indices developed for assessing the levels of water scarcity are made mainly based on water quantity aspects for example the water stress index wsi is typically defined as the ratio of water withdrawal or consumption to water availability damkjaer and taylor 2017 to quantify the constraint of water quality on water stress several studies introduce the concept of gray water footprint mekonnen and hoekstra 2015 which is the amount of water required to dilute pollutants in wastewater to meet the water quality standard combining total water demand and gray water footprint liu et al 2017 calculate its ratio to freshwater availability to reflect both quantity and quality based water scarcity in chinese thirty provincial administrative units also employing the concept of gray water footprint van vliet et al 2017 evaluate the impact of water quality on sectoral water shortage in the pearl river basin of china they take into account three specific types of water quality indicators including temperature salinity and nitrogen ma et al 2020 perform water scarcity assessment at a high spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 arc degree for china s three level river basins taking the water quality requirement of different sectors into account their results confirm that water pollution aggravates regional water shortage and inequality these research efforts help delineate the threat of pollution on regional water stress however few of them comprehensively evaluate the risks of both quantity and quality based water scarcity on local industrial economy while water scarcity is often understood and managed as a local issue its drivers could be global and its impact could be transmitted to downstream economies through supply chains cosgrove and loucks 2015 davis et al 2021 pfister et al 2011 zhao et al 2015 studies have extensively quantified virtual water transfer driven by the demand for goods and services an early work led by feng et al 2014 assesses virtual water flows among chinese thirty provinces and finds that consumption in developed coastal regions exacerbates the pressure of water shortage in already water scarce inland provinces from the supply side the potential of losing outputs in local water intensive sectors can also exert economic impacts in other distant economies and sectors through the trade system for instance qu et al 2018 map the impacts of local water scarcity risk on global economy from 1995 to 2009 they identify top nation sectors in virtual water scarcity risk exports and imports however we notice that previous studies have rarely analyzed the impacts of local water scarcity on downstream sectors that consider water quantity and quality constraints simultaneously this study aims to reveal how water pollution may exacerbate the impacts of water scarcity on the local economic sectors and the entire supply chain system we first assessed the risks of losing economic outputs in chinese provincial sectors due to physical water scarcity by incorporating water quality requirements for agriculture industry and domestic sectoral uses we then mapped virtual water scarcity risks transmitted via domestic trade connections and identified top province sectors that have significant impacts on downstream economies due to local water stress or are vulnerable to distant water scarcity our results emphasize the needs for improving local water use efficiency and enhancing wastewater treatment at the same time to mitigate the entire supply chains risks 2 methods 2 1 quality included local water scarcity risk lwsr fig 1 illustrates our method framework we first developed a local water scarcity risk lwsr index that provides a quantitative measure of water scarcity risk in a sector in a province both available water quantity and acceptable quality for sectoral use were included in the formulation as listed in eq 1 lwsr includes three main parameters 1 l w s r m p w d r p w d m p k m p l w s r m p refers to the potential direct output loss in monetary unit of sector m in province p due to water scarcity water depletion risk w d r p measures the fraction of potentially reduced water use due to insufficient water quantity and deteriorated water quality water dependency w d m p refers to the water resource dependence of sector m in province p and is defined as the percentage of output loss caused by 1 water depletion parameter k m p refers to the benchmark economic output of sector m in province p without considering the risk of water resource depletion below we explain the estimation of wdr and wd 2 1 1 water depletion risk wdr water depletion risk wdr measures the risk of insufficient water use due to scarcity which has no direct data or measurement its value needs to be inferred from relevant variables accordingly we first calculated a combined water stress index w s p defined as the ratio of sectoral consumption of acceptable water quality to the overall water supply in province p as shown in eq 2 w s p contains both quantity based and quality based assessments of water stress the quantity based dimension is measured by the ratio of the total amount of sectoral water consumption d m p to water availability q p in province p the quality based dimension is calculated as the ratio of the sum of water resources required for dilution to obtain adequate quality for all sectoral water uses d q m p to water availability q p in province p 2 w s p m d m p q p m d q m p q p the approach to determine d q m p is shown in eq 3 where c i p is actual water quality level of parameter i e g chemical oxygen demand in province p and c m a x i m represents the maximum water quality threshold for parameter i in water use sector m we referred to the method proposed by ma et al 2020 to calculate d q m p that is when water quality meets the requirement extra water stress caused by pollution was set as 0 when pollution level exceeds the standard the amount of water for diluting the volume of the sectoral water consumption was calculated to reflect the constraints of poor water quality 3 d q m p 0 c i c m a x m d m p c i p c m a x m 1 c i c m a x m for setting sectoral water quality thresholds c m a x i m in eq 3 we chose chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen nh 4 n and electrical conductivity ec as three typical water quality measures for agricultural water use a concentration of 0 7 ds m 1 for ec reflecting a salinity constraint for crop growth was considered as the maximum water quality threshold for irrigation silber et al 2015 the value is in line with recommendations by food and agriculture organization according to the environmental quality standard for surface water in china 6 0 mg l 1 for cod and 1 0 mg l 1 for nh 4 n were used as the domestic water use thresholds ministry of water resources of china 2017 meanwhile 10 0 mg l 1 for cod and 1 5 mg l 1 for nh 4 n were adopted as the basic water requirements for industry sectors ma et al 2020 it should be noted that the value of water stress ws is not equivalent to the probability of inducing economic losses a province with ws greater than 1 can still use water through some physical water transfer projects or undermining ecological water requirement yevjevich 2001 zhang et al 2015 it is assumed that sectors in high ws regions are more at risk of output loss due to water scarcity therefore we applied a probabilistic function used by qu et al 2018 to convert ws to wdr the value of which lie in the interval 0 1 4 w d r p f w d r w s p σ e y p with f w d r w s p σ e y p where y p 0 i f x c 1 y p 1 x p i f x p 1 x p l o g n o r m a l 1 w s p σ as can be seen in eq 4 f w d r calculates the expected value of variable y p which is the function of x p x p follows a log normal distribution with the median being the inverse of ws and standard deviation σ the value of σ was set as 1 in this study the value of wdr in essence measures the probability that the wsi will be 1 when following the lognormal distribution fig s1 presents calculated wdrs with different ws values in our study we find the transformation does not change the relative order of wsi but scale the values of wsi into the interval 0 1 for a province with ws value higher than 0 20 which was considered as suffering water scarcity in previous literature kummu et al 2016 the function f w d r will output a wdr value over 1 2 1 2 water dependency wd water dependency wd measures relative output losses for an economic sector due to less water use its largest possible value is assumed to be 1 in which case water is completely not substitutable similar to wdr wd is also not accessible from existing data and should be calculated from water intensity wi however water intensity defined as water consumption for unitary sectoral economic output varies significantly across sectors and lie in 0 we therefore used eq 5 to convert sectoral wi to sectoral wd lying in 0 001 1 5 w d m f w d w i m α 1 1 e α w i m 1 0 001 1 as shown in eq 5 the w d m denotes the degree of water resource dependence in sector m which is the function of water intensity in sector m w i m the parameter α governs a cutoff value of wi above which wd will rise rapidly toward 1 we set α as 0 5 in this study for province sectors with very low or even zero water intensity their wd values are at the minimum value of 0 001 reflecting the general importance of water resources for province sectors with water intensity 20 ton their wd values will be very close to 1 as can be seen in the function curve drawn in fig s1 it should be noted that lwsr reflects the probability of output loss due to water scarcity and thus is measured in relative terms i e in we should admit the uncertainty for using wsi to represent wdr and using wi to calculate wd choosing different parameters may also affect wdr and wd values therefore we have performed sensitivity analysis using different relationship curves and found our conclusions are still robust the results and explanations for the analysis approach are presented in fig s2 2 2 virtual water scarcity risk vwsr we then assessed the impacts of lwsr on downstream provinces and sectors through reduced input supplies i e the virtual water scarcity risk vwsr the vwsr export reflects the impacts of lwsr transmitted to other province sectors through exporting water use goods e g agricultural products or industrial intermediate inputs the vwsr import on the other hand denotes the provincial or sectoral vulnerability to the local water stress in other regions we applied national multiregional input output mrio analysis to map vwsr exports and imports across chinese provinces in the mrio model different regions are connected by interregional trade links at the sector level the mrio table has the characteristics of column and row balance indicating that each sector s total input equals its total output as shown in eq 6 each sector s total input equals the sum of its intermediate inputs and value added 6 x e z v the 1 n vector x represents total inputs of each economic sector the n n matrix z denotes transaction flows among province sectors the 1 n vector v denotes value added creation in each sector every element in the 1 n vector e is equal to one to investigate transmission of local sectoral outputs to the whole system we define an n n matrix b as direct output coefficient matrix representing the product allocation ratio from one province sector to other province sectors the approach to calculate matrix b is shown in eq 7 where x is the diagonalized matrix of total inputs vector x 7 b x 1 z accordingly eq 6 can be rewritten in the form of eq 8 8 x v i b 1 the n n matrix i b 1 is the well known ghosh inverse matrix whose element refers to the total production value of sector j generated by unit initial input of sector i as specified in eq 9 we use ghosh inverse matrix to evaluate the influence of lwsr in the whole national trade network elements in vector δ x represent output loss of each province sector due to lwsr of all province sectors 9 δ x l w s r i b 1 furthermore we can get a matrix δ x by diagonalizing lwsr as shown in eq 10 elements in δ x i e δ x k l stand for the impact of province sector k s lwsr on province sector l s economic production then in eq 11 we derive n p q which represents the impact of province p lwsr on province q s lwsr by summing up δ x k l per province finally we sum n p q to get the values of vwsr imports and exports respectively as shown in eqs 12 and 13 10 δ x diag l w s r i b 1 11 n p q k p r o v i c n e p l p r o v i c n e q δ x k l 12 v w s r p i m p q n p q 13 v w s r p e x q p n p q moreover to examine relative impacts of a province s vwsr exports on supply chain and vwsr imports on local sectors irrespective of economic size we measure a risk index and a vulnerability index for each province by normalizing its vwsr by its total output 2 3 herfindahl index meanwhile a province s sensitivity to water scarcity risks of upstream suppliers is closely related to concentrations of its vwsr imports if the origin of a province s vwsr imports are very concentrated probability of the concurrence of upstream production losses due to water scarcity would be very high it reduces a province s resilience to water scarcity risks in distant places to evaluate resilience of supply chain here we choose the herfindahl index represented by h e r f p to measure the intensity of vwsr imports for province p ludema and mayda 2013 as shown eq 14 higher values of the herfindahl index indicate higher concentrations of its vwsr imports 14 h e r f p p q n p q p q n p q 2 2 4 data sources in sum four types of data were used in this study including 1 multi regional input output mrio data depicting provincial economic transactions in china 2 pollution monitoring data that reflect chinese current water quality status 3 water consumption data of all economic sectors and 4 water availability data at the provincial level mrio d ata we employed the china multi regional input output table in year 2017 which was compiled by china emissions accounting and data set ceads zheng et al 2021 the table covers 42 socioeconomic sectors in 31 provinces which is one of the most updated chinese mrio tables the division of sectors in the table was corrected according to the 2017 national input output table officially issued by the chinese government the dataset has been widely used to map the virtual transfer of water and energy among different regions in china li et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 water q uality the city level annual average cod ec and nh 4 n data in 2017 were obtained from the national environmental monitoring network we then calculated the annual average concentrations of cod and nh 4 n at the province level weighted by the total number of monitoring stations per city water quality indicators sectoral water uses quality threshold data sources and supporting references are listed in table s1 detailed water quality data for each province are reported in table s4 water c onsumption we investigated three categories of water use sectors in this study namely agriculture industry domestic sectors water consumption for eco environmental compensation is relatively small and was not considered in our study chinese government releases provincial water use volume of the three sectors every year officially published in water resources bulletin and we manually collected the data of the year 2017 next we estimate water consumption in 42 subdivided sectors used in mrio the chinese official statistical data water uses for specific manufacturing sectors or service sectors at the provincial level we have to allocate the total amount of water use in provincial industry and domestic sectors to specific manufacturing and tertiary sectors according to the national level estimated ratio therefore we refer to the chinese environmentally extended input output ceeio database developed by liang et al 2017 which provides an environmental satellite account of freshwater use of 45 sectors at the national level we assume subdivided sectors in different provinces share the same proportion of water use as can be calculated in ceeio we then allocate the total amount of water use in industry and domestic sectors at each province to corresponding subdivided sectors accordingly fig s3 presents the ratio of water uses in different manufacturing and tertiary sectors water a vailability water availability reflects water resource endowment of a region the water resources bulletin provides annual accounting of water availability at the province level which is the sum of surface and groundwater resources we collected these data published in the year of 2017 see provincial water consumption and water availability data in table s3 3 results 3 1 quality and quantity based local water scarcity risk lwsr we first examine how water pollution exacerbates local water stress at the provincial level fig 2a shows both quality based and quantity based water depletion risk wdr in 2017 abbreviations for all provinces are detailed in table s2 we find provincial wdrs in china exhibit spatial heterogeneity and water pollution exacerbates water scarcity at the national level water pollution approximately doubles wdrs in provinces located in northern china where available water resources are already limited such as hebei he shandong sd henan ha and shanxi sx conditions are even worse in megacities like beijing bj shanghai sh and tianjin tj where wdrs increase by 1 93 1 43 and 1 02 times after considering water quality constraints when we set 1 wdr as the threshold of local water stress dashed line in fig 2a qu et al 2018 we find more provinces including jiangxi jx and hunan hn are under risks of lacking sufficient available water geographical pattern of wdr in china is consistent with the distributions of water resource endowment that is provinces in northern china faces more severe water stress than those in southern china however the geographical pattern of lwsr has changed considerably compared to wdr as shown in fig 2b provinces in the central and eastern coast of china face higher lwsrs because of their larger size of the economies pollution poses extra economic burdens on lwsr for instance jiangsu js hebei he shandong sd and henan ha are major industrial centers and warehouses of agricultural products in china they become the provinces with the highest economic risks due to water scarcity after considering the constraints of water pollution for provinces with abundant water resources like guangdong gd and fujian fj quality based lwsr poses more threats on local water use sectors and economies rather than quantity based lwsr national aggregate estimate of quantity based lwsr is 660 billion us and quality based lwsr is 593 billion us in 2017 indicating that pollution almost doubles the risks of local economic losses due to water scarcity in china heatmap of lwsr for each province sector is illustrated in fig s4 we can identify sectors that are the most vulnerable to local water scarcity including agriculture textile printing paper manufacturing gas production and wholesales hotspots of province sector lwsr are related to the province s economic size and industrial division for example while lwsr of agricultural production are common across the country lwsr of industrial sectors are the most prominent in only a few provinces including jiangsu js shanghai sh henan ha and anhui ah when water quality constraints are considered we observe an increasing number of province sector lwsr hotspots 3 2 virtual water scarcity risk vwsr in domestic trade after calculating lwsr in each province sector we then input lwsr into the domestic trade model and examine vwsr exports and imports among provinces fig s5 shows the quantity based and quality based vwsr at the provincial level the impact of water pollution on vwsr is not consistent for example quality based vwsr exports in henan ha hebei he and shandong sd are 1 48 1 42 and 1 09 times of quantity based vwsr exports in contrast for provinces like ningxia nx and heilongjiang hl where major export sectors are not constrained by local water pollution issues quality based vwsr exports are only 10 and 23 of quantity based vwsr exports the destinations of vwsr i e importers span broadly while the origins are relatively concentrated in the national aggregate quantity based vwsr transfer across provinces in 2017 is 276 billion us accounting for 41 8 of the national quantity based lwsr quality based vwsr imports in 2017 are 240 billion us accounting for 40 4 of the national quality based lwsr we then map combined vwsr exports and imports across provinces as illustrated in fig 3a and fig 3b we find the geographical distribution of vwsr exports is generally consistent with the spatial pattern of lwsr provinces in north china plain including jiangsu js hebei he henan ha and shandong sd are four top ranking exporters of vwsr on the contrary vwsr importers are mainly located in southern china where water resources are more abundant the two coastal provinces including guangdong gd and zhejiang zj take the most economic risks due to water shortages in other distant provinces for china s two megacities shanghai sh plays a key role of vwsr exporter whereas beijing bj is a high ranking vwsr importer reflecting their different positions in china s domestic supply chains fig 3c illustrates the transfers of vwsr across provinces and we have identified the largest vwsr flows among them for example hebei he exports 17 8 billion us of vwsr to shandong sd jiangsu js shifts 11 2 10 8 9 0 and 8 8 billion us of vwsr to guangdong gd zhejiang zj henan ha and anhui ah respectively we have listed the top 50 provincial vwsr flows in table s6 the heatmap in fig s6 visualizes sector to sector vwsr transmissions darkest pixels indicate hotspots of sector to sector relationships the distribution of vwsr spreads over a variety of sectors in the national trade system the top 50 links before and after considering water quality constraints are listed in table s6 we find origins of vwsr are concentrated agriculture hunting forestry fishing production and supply of electricity and heat and smelting and processing of metals are three major sectors transferring vwsr to other places then the destinations of vwsr span broadly food and tobacco processing is the most top ranking sector that imports vwsr after considering constraints of water pollution we find origins of vwsr become more centralized in a few provinces especially for agriculture sector in hebei he 3 3 risk indices and vulnerability indices we then measure risk and vulnerability index by normalizing each province s vwsr exports and imports by its total output as illustrated in fig 4 we find ningxia nx a relatively arid region in northwest china has highest risk index due to water scarcity local water pollution has largely increased risk indices in many provinces such as hebei he xinjiang xj and inner mongolia nm it indicates that unitary economic output in these regions tends to exert more risks on domestic trade system via vwsr exports owing to insufficient water supply and inadequate water quality vulnerability index on the other hand reflects a province s economic sensitivity to water scarcity risks of upstream suppliers we identify a few provinces that do not rank top in vwsr imports but have highest vulnerability index including jilin jl jiangxi jx shaanxi sx chongqing cq and hainan hi inclusion of water quality in water scarcity assessment has increased vulnerability in most provinces in general risky provinces are more concentrated but vulnerable provinces span broadly some regions including beijing bj and henan ha have large in vwsr both in terms of absolute values and relative vulnerability indices 3 4 concurrence of water scarcity risks finally we analyze herfindahl index of vwsr imports for each province to evaluate the concentrations of upstream trade partners for each province that are vulnerable to local water scarcity risks if a province imports vwsr from only a few upstream province sectors the concurrence of water scarcity risks is much higher a larger herfindahl index indicates higher vulnerability and lower resilience of a province in the face of external water shortage shocks as shown in fig 5 when we only consider quantity based water scarcity provinces with high herfindahl index values are concentrated in tianjin tj and shandong sd when we consider water quality constraints at the same time the herfindahl index has increased for most regions but decreased for the top two provinces anhui ah and jilin jl emerge on the national average herfindahl index has risen from 0 118 to 0 131 indicating that the overall resilience of domestic supply chain has decreased due to widespread water pollution 4 discussions this study provides a comprehensive analysis of how local water pollution may impose risks on economic outputs of local water use sectors in china we find that poor water quality increases local water depletion risks van vliet et al 2021 and almost doubles potential local economic losses due to insufficient water supply in china risks of water pollution on economic production are not evenly distributed across geographical units northern provinces where available freshwater resources are limited face more severe water quality challenges however these northern provinces tend to produce water intensive goods for consumption in the south which amplify the scarcity risk guan and hubacek 2007 constraints of water pollution also influence vwsr transfers in the domestic trade system top vwsr exporters become more centralized in a few provinces whereas vulnerable provinces span broadly and are more likely to be affected by water shortage in distant regions the concurrence of water scarcity risks measured by herfindahl index becomes higher when water quality is included in the assessment it indicates that water pollution decreases overall supply chain resilience in china s economic system our study highlights the need to reduce economic risks of both quality based and quantity based local water scarcity we find regions that are short in water availability and poor in water quality are largely overlapped these provinces are spatially located in the north and are key upstream suppliers in china s domestic trade system we then identify critical regions and sectors that may have ramifications on downstream economies or are highly vulnerable to water scarcity in upstream suppliers jiangsu js hebei he henan ha and shandong sd are top ranking provinces in terms of absolute vwsr exports whereas guangdong gd zhejiang zj jiangsu js and henan ha are major vwsr importers when getting rid of the effect of economic size ningxia nx hebei hb and xinjiang xj become the most risky provinces and they are all located in the north jilin jl beijing bj jiangxi jx and shaanxi sx are the most vulnerable regions to distant water scarcity risks and they spread all over the country to lower water scarcity and alleviate overall risks local authorities should not only focus on conserving physical water resources but also improving water quality loucks and van beek 2017 qu et al 2018 adaptive solutions include improving water use efficiency levidow et al 2014 increasing water availability by increasing reservoir storage or water diversion projects long et al 2020 and reducing pollutant emissions through better wastewater treatment cosgrove and loucks 2015 wang et al 2020 meanwhile for provinces vulnerable to distant virtual water scarcity risks in addition to switching to upstream suppliers who are not subject to local water stress provinces should advance regional collaboration and investment on water management and controlling transboundary water pollution perry and praskievicz 2017 in terms of hotspots of sectors our estimates show that agriculture hunting forestry fishing production and supply of electricity and heat and smelting and processing of metals are important exporters of vwsr food and tobacco processing is the major destination of vwsr water pollution creates more hotspots of sectoral vwsr and makes the origins of water scarcity risks more concentrated in several provinces these findings inform decision makers to focus on these hotspots for mitigating risk transmissions for example agricultural sector in hebei he province needs more efforts to mitigate its potential risks to downstream economies due to water scarcity long et al 2020 yet inequality exists in terms of risks of local water scarcity and shares of economic gains dolan et al 2021 provinces in the south imports more water intensive goods from the north but have larger water environment capacity and lower local water stress zhao et al 2015 our study develops an integrated method to assess the impacts of quantity based and quality based water scarcity on local and distant economies quantity and quality based lwsr calculated in this study for each province depends on its water availability pollution level sectoral water use efficiency economic size and industrial structure it provides an approach to efficiently quantify the restriction of pollution especially nutrients and major elements on local available water resources and economic activities a broader range of water quality parameters could be taken into consideration according to the needs in the future such as heavy metals and metalloid van vliet and zwolsman 2008 the indicator could also be used to measure the risks and impacts of extreme climate events such as drought and urban flood on local freshwater supply and output losses more than that the proposed method integrates mrio model and depicts the sources and destinations of transboundary risks in china s domestic trade system the framework can be extended to investigate how nationwide variability in inland water quality around the globe poses risks on global supply chains in addition if multiyear mrio tables or higher resolution water quality data are available the model could help support cost benefits analysis of water management policies by evaluating how improved water quality reduces local and distant economic risks last but not least several limitations in this study should be noted first there are still important water pollution issues that have not fully taken into consideration in this study for example increasing water body temperature caused by global warming affects agriculture and fisheries and reduces available cooling water for energy generations management of water resources for different water use sectors needs to account for quality requirements in nutrients plastics and other pollutants second our water quality data is based on annual average of city level monitoring stations records provincial sectoral water use data are estimated according to the national level estimated ratio mrio model at the provincial scale is also a coarse measure of the economic activities the combination of these datasets at provincial levels may not reflect constraints of water scarcity at finer spatial scales in reality future research may use high resolution water quality data and local sectoral economic data to improve the accuracy of water scarcity assessment 5 conclusion this study quantifies the risks of both quantity and quality based local water scarcity to china s economic performances of local water use sectors and downstream producers in the domestic trade system we first reveal that in the year of 2017 water pollution almost doubles china s local economic loss risks due to water scarcity in china we also identify the provinces and sectors that are the risky to downstream sectors and find pollution makes water scarcity risk exporters in china become more concentrated this effect on the other hand decreases the overall resilience of china s domestic trade network this work offers unique insights into the interaction of quality based water economy nexus closing the gap on inadequate attention to water quality constraints on water usability in previous studies we also offer hotspots that policy makers should prioritize on for sustainable water management and highlight the need to conserve water resources and improve water quality at the same time credit authorship contribution statement jinling li conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original draft jianxun yang investigation formal analysis writing

15534,pollution exacerbates a region s water scarcity by making water unfit for different uses and reducing freshwater availability local water scarcity may lead to economic output losses and the risk can be transmitted to downstream sectors through reduced input supplies previous studies focus on quantity based water scarcity assessment it is still unknown how water quality constraints may amplify economic risks of local water use sectors and distant economies here we introduce an integrated method and assess the impacts of both quantity and quality based local physical water scarcity risks lwsr and virtual water scarcity risks vwsr in domestic trade system in china we find in 2017 quality based lwsr and vwsr in china are 593 and 240 billion us inclusion of water pollution constraints almost doubles the risks of economic losses due to insufficient clean water supply we then identify critical regions and sectors that are highly risky or vulnerable to the supply chains we find water pollution makes risky vwsr exporters more centralized in a few northern provinces where available freshwater resources are already limited e g the agriculture sector in hebei province vwsr importers span broadly but water pollution increases concentrations of upstream suppliers that face local water scarcity for most provinces decreasing overall resilience of china s domestic trade network our results underscore the needs to alleviate overall scarcity risks by conserving physical water resources and improving water quality simultaneously graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water scarcity risk water pollution multiregional input output model china data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water scarcity poses enormous economic risks to water use sectors such as energy agriculture and manufacturing dolan et al 2021 the imbalance between water demand and water availability is a major contributor to regional water scarcity boretti and rosa 2019 yu et al 2011 many regions in the world are suffering from economic impacts of water scarcity as the world s factory china feeds 20 of the global population but has only 7 of the freshwater resources on the planet cheng et al 2009 sun et al 2021 inequality in water scarcity is even worse within the country the north china plain located in the basins of the hai huai and yellow rivers contributes to more than a quarter of china s total economic outputs whereas available water resources in the region account for less than 8 of the country s total amount cheng et al 2009 assessing spatial pattern of water scarcity is thus fundamental for mitigating economic risks in local sectors in addition to insufficient water quantity water pollution also exacerbates local water scarcity risks poor water quality fails to meet the basic requirement of water use sectors which may constrain water usability and induce economic output losses gleick 1996 liu et al 2016 for instance salinity chemical oxygen demand cod and other pollutants lead to considerable constraints on water usability in sectors such as irrigation industrial production and domestic use van vliet et al 2017 as a result water scarcity risks are expected to worsen considerably in many regions as both surface and ground water quality have been deteriorated due to rapid urbanization and poorly treated wastewater discharge cheng and hu 2012 in china for example pollutant concentrations observed in 27 6 of china s surface water monitoring stations were not up to grade iii standard in 2018 a water quality level that merely enables people to swim in li et al 2019 sustainable management of water resources in china and other water dependent economies should not only account for demand in water quantity but also for water quality he et al 2020 current indices developed for assessing the levels of water scarcity are made mainly based on water quantity aspects for example the water stress index wsi is typically defined as the ratio of water withdrawal or consumption to water availability damkjaer and taylor 2017 to quantify the constraint of water quality on water stress several studies introduce the concept of gray water footprint mekonnen and hoekstra 2015 which is the amount of water required to dilute pollutants in wastewater to meet the water quality standard combining total water demand and gray water footprint liu et al 2017 calculate its ratio to freshwater availability to reflect both quantity and quality based water scarcity in chinese thirty provincial administrative units also employing the concept of gray water footprint van vliet et al 2017 evaluate the impact of water quality on sectoral water shortage in the pearl river basin of china they take into account three specific types of water quality indicators including temperature salinity and nitrogen ma et al 2020 perform water scarcity assessment at a high spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 arc degree for china s three level river basins taking the water quality requirement of different sectors into account their results confirm that water pollution aggravates regional water shortage and inequality these research efforts help delineate the threat of pollution on regional water stress however few of them comprehensively evaluate the risks of both quantity and quality based water scarcity on local industrial economy while water scarcity is often understood and managed as a local issue its drivers could be global and its impact could be transmitted to downstream economies through supply chains cosgrove and loucks 2015 davis et al 2021 pfister et al 2011 zhao et al 2015 studies have extensively quantified virtual water transfer driven by the demand for goods and services an early work led by feng et al 2014 assesses virtual water flows among chinese thirty provinces and finds that consumption in developed coastal regions exacerbates the pressure of water shortage in already water scarce inland provinces from the supply side the potential of losing outputs in local water intensive sectors can also exert economic impacts in other distant economies and sectors through the trade system for instance qu et al 2018 map the impacts of local water scarcity risk on global economy from 1995 to 2009 they identify top nation sectors in virtual water scarcity risk exports and imports however we notice that previous studies have rarely analyzed the impacts of local water scarcity on downstream sectors that consider water quantity and quality constraints simultaneously this study aims to reveal how water pollution may exacerbate the impacts of water scarcity on the local economic sectors and the entire supply chain system we first assessed the risks of losing economic outputs in chinese provincial sectors due to physical water scarcity by incorporating water quality requirements for agriculture industry and domestic sectoral uses we then mapped virtual water scarcity risks transmitted via domestic trade connections and identified top province sectors that have significant impacts on downstream economies due to local water stress or are vulnerable to distant water scarcity our results emphasize the needs for improving local water use efficiency and enhancing wastewater treatment at the same time to mitigate the entire supply chains risks 2 methods 2 1 quality included local water scarcity risk lwsr fig 1 illustrates our method framework we first developed a local water scarcity risk lwsr index that provides a quantitative measure of water scarcity risk in a sector in a province both available water quantity and acceptable quality for sectoral use were included in the formulation as listed in eq 1 lwsr includes three main parameters 1 l w s r m p w d r p w d m p k m p l w s r m p refers to the potential direct output loss in monetary unit of sector m in province p due to water scarcity water depletion risk w d r p measures the fraction of potentially reduced water use due to insufficient water quantity and deteriorated water quality water dependency w d m p refers to the water resource dependence of sector m in province p and is defined as the percentage of output loss caused by 1 water depletion parameter k m p refers to the benchmark economic output of sector m in province p without considering the risk of water resource depletion below we explain the estimation of wdr and wd 2 1 1 water depletion risk wdr water depletion risk wdr measures the risk of insufficient water use due to scarcity which has no direct data or measurement its value needs to be inferred from relevant variables accordingly we first calculated a combined water stress index w s p defined as the ratio of sectoral consumption of acceptable water quality to the overall water supply in province p as shown in eq 2 w s p contains both quantity based and quality based assessments of water stress the quantity based dimension is measured by the ratio of the total amount of sectoral water consumption d m p to water availability q p in province p the quality based dimension is calculated as the ratio of the sum of water resources required for dilution to obtain adequate quality for all sectoral water uses d q m p to water availability q p in province p 2 w s p m d m p q p m d q m p q p the approach to determine d q m p is shown in eq 3 where c i p is actual water quality level of parameter i e g chemical oxygen demand in province p and c m a x i m represents the maximum water quality threshold for parameter i in water use sector m we referred to the method proposed by ma et al 2020 to calculate d q m p that is when water quality meets the requirement extra water stress caused by pollution was set as 0 when pollution level exceeds the standard the amount of water for diluting the volume of the sectoral water consumption was calculated to reflect the constraints of poor water quality 3 d q m p 0 c i c m a x m d m p c i p c m a x m 1 c i c m a x m for setting sectoral water quality thresholds c m a x i m in eq 3 we chose chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen nh 4 n and electrical conductivity ec as three typical water quality measures for agricultural water use a concentration of 0 7 ds m 1 for ec reflecting a salinity constraint for crop growth was considered as the maximum water quality threshold for irrigation silber et al 2015 the value is in line with recommendations by food and agriculture organization according to the environmental quality standard for surface water in china 6 0 mg l 1 for cod and 1 0 mg l 1 for nh 4 n were used as the domestic water use thresholds ministry of water resources of china 2017 meanwhile 10 0 mg l 1 for cod and 1 5 mg l 1 for nh 4 n were adopted as the basic water requirements for industry sectors ma et al 2020 it should be noted that the value of water stress ws is not equivalent to the probability of inducing economic losses a province with ws greater than 1 can still use water through some physical water transfer projects or undermining ecological water requirement yevjevich 2001 zhang et al 2015 it is assumed that sectors in high ws regions are more at risk of output loss due to water scarcity therefore we applied a probabilistic function used by qu et al 2018 to convert ws to wdr the value of which lie in the interval 0 1 4 w d r p f w d r w s p σ e y p with f w d r w s p σ e y p where y p 0 i f x c 1 y p 1 x p i f x p 1 x p l o g n o r m a l 1 w s p σ as can be seen in eq 4 f w d r calculates the expected value of variable y p which is the function of x p x p follows a log normal distribution with the median being the inverse of ws and standard deviation σ the value of σ was set as 1 in this study the value of wdr in essence measures the probability that the wsi will be 1 when following the lognormal distribution fig s1 presents calculated wdrs with different ws values in our study we find the transformation does not change the relative order of wsi but scale the values of wsi into the interval 0 1 for a province with ws value higher than 0 20 which was considered as suffering water scarcity in previous literature kummu et al 2016 the function f w d r will output a wdr value over 1 2 1 2 water dependency wd water dependency wd measures relative output losses for an economic sector due to less water use its largest possible value is assumed to be 1 in which case water is completely not substitutable similar to wdr wd is also not accessible from existing data and should be calculated from water intensity wi however water intensity defined as water consumption for unitary sectoral economic output varies significantly across sectors and lie in 0 we therefore used eq 5 to convert sectoral wi to sectoral wd lying in 0 001 1 5 w d m f w d w i m α 1 1 e α w i m 1 0 001 1 as shown in eq 5 the w d m denotes the degree of water resource dependence in sector m which is the function of water intensity in sector m w i m the parameter α governs a cutoff value of wi above which wd will rise rapidly toward 1 we set α as 0 5 in this study for province sectors with very low or even zero water intensity their wd values are at the minimum value of 0 001 reflecting the general importance of water resources for province sectors with water intensity 20 ton their wd values will be very close to 1 as can be seen in the function curve drawn in fig s1 it should be noted that lwsr reflects the probability of output loss due to water scarcity and thus is measured in relative terms i e in we should admit the uncertainty for using wsi to represent wdr and using wi to calculate wd choosing different parameters may also affect wdr and wd values therefore we have performed sensitivity analysis using different relationship curves and found our conclusions are still robust the results and explanations for the analysis approach are presented in fig s2 2 2 virtual water scarcity risk vwsr we then assessed the impacts of lwsr on downstream provinces and sectors through reduced input supplies i e the virtual water scarcity risk vwsr the vwsr export reflects the impacts of lwsr transmitted to other province sectors through exporting water use goods e g agricultural products or industrial intermediate inputs the vwsr import on the other hand denotes the provincial or sectoral vulnerability to the local water stress in other regions we applied national multiregional input output mrio analysis to map vwsr exports and imports across chinese provinces in the mrio model different regions are connected by interregional trade links at the sector level the mrio table has the characteristics of column and row balance indicating that each sector s total input equals its total output as shown in eq 6 each sector s total input equals the sum of its intermediate inputs and value added 6 x e z v the 1 n vector x represents total inputs of each economic sector the n n matrix z denotes transaction flows among province sectors the 1 n vector v denotes value added creation in each sector every element in the 1 n vector e is equal to one to investigate transmission of local sectoral outputs to the whole system we define an n n matrix b as direct output coefficient matrix representing the product allocation ratio from one province sector to other province sectors the approach to calculate matrix b is shown in eq 7 where x is the diagonalized matrix of total inputs vector x 7 b x 1 z accordingly eq 6 can be rewritten in the form of eq 8 8 x v i b 1 the n n matrix i b 1 is the well known ghosh inverse matrix whose element refers to the total production value of sector j generated by unit initial input of sector i as specified in eq 9 we use ghosh inverse matrix to evaluate the influence of lwsr in the whole national trade network elements in vector δ x represent output loss of each province sector due to lwsr of all province sectors 9 δ x l w s r i b 1 furthermore we can get a matrix δ x by diagonalizing lwsr as shown in eq 10 elements in δ x i e δ x k l stand for the impact of province sector k s lwsr on province sector l s economic production then in eq 11 we derive n p q which represents the impact of province p lwsr on province q s lwsr by summing up δ x k l per province finally we sum n p q to get the values of vwsr imports and exports respectively as shown in eqs 12 and 13 10 δ x diag l w s r i b 1 11 n p q k p r o v i c n e p l p r o v i c n e q δ x k l 12 v w s r p i m p q n p q 13 v w s r p e x q p n p q moreover to examine relative impacts of a province s vwsr exports on supply chain and vwsr imports on local sectors irrespective of economic size we measure a risk index and a vulnerability index for each province by normalizing its vwsr by its total output 2 3 herfindahl index meanwhile a province s sensitivity to water scarcity risks of upstream suppliers is closely related to concentrations of its vwsr imports if the origin of a province s vwsr imports are very concentrated probability of the concurrence of upstream production losses due to water scarcity would be very high it reduces a province s resilience to water scarcity risks in distant places to evaluate resilience of supply chain here we choose the herfindahl index represented by h e r f p to measure the intensity of vwsr imports for province p ludema and mayda 2013 as shown eq 14 higher values of the herfindahl index indicate higher concentrations of its vwsr imports 14 h e r f p p q n p q p q n p q 2 2 4 data sources in sum four types of data were used in this study including 1 multi regional input output mrio data depicting provincial economic transactions in china 2 pollution monitoring data that reflect chinese current water quality status 3 water consumption data of all economic sectors and 4 water availability data at the provincial level mrio d ata we employed the china multi regional input output table in year 2017 which was compiled by china emissions accounting and data set ceads zheng et al 2021 the table covers 42 socioeconomic sectors in 31 provinces which is one of the most updated chinese mrio tables the division of sectors in the table was corrected according to the 2017 national input output table officially issued by the chinese government the dataset has been widely used to map the virtual transfer of water and energy among different regions in china li et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 water q uality the city level annual average cod ec and nh 4 n data in 2017 were obtained from the national environmental monitoring network we then calculated the annual average concentrations of cod and nh 4 n at the province level weighted by the total number of monitoring stations per city water quality indicators sectoral water uses quality threshold data sources and supporting references are listed in table s1 detailed water quality data for each province are reported in table s4 water c onsumption we investigated three categories of water use sectors in this study namely agriculture industry domestic sectors water consumption for eco environmental compensation is relatively small and was not considered in our study chinese government releases provincial water use volume of the three sectors every year officially published in water resources bulletin and we manually collected the data of the year 2017 next we estimate water consumption in 42 subdivided sectors used in mrio the chinese official statistical data water uses for specific manufacturing sectors or service sectors at the provincial level we have to allocate the total amount of water use in provincial industry and domestic sectors to specific manufacturing and tertiary sectors according to the national level estimated ratio therefore we refer to the chinese environmentally extended input output ceeio database developed by liang et al 2017 which provides an environmental satellite account of freshwater use of 45 sectors at the national level we assume subdivided sectors in different provinces share the same proportion of water use as can be calculated in ceeio we then allocate the total amount of water use in industry and domestic sectors at each province to corresponding subdivided sectors accordingly fig s3 presents the ratio of water uses in different manufacturing and tertiary sectors water a vailability water availability reflects water resource endowment of a region the water resources bulletin provides annual accounting of water availability at the province level which is the sum of surface and groundwater resources we collected these data published in the year of 2017 see provincial water consumption and water availability data in table s3 3 results 3 1 quality and quantity based local water scarcity risk lwsr we first examine how water pollution exacerbates local water stress at the provincial level fig 2a shows both quality based and quantity based water depletion risk wdr in 2017 abbreviations for all provinces are detailed in table s2 we find provincial wdrs in china exhibit spatial heterogeneity and water pollution exacerbates water scarcity at the national level water pollution approximately doubles wdrs in provinces located in northern china where available water resources are already limited such as hebei he shandong sd henan ha and shanxi sx conditions are even worse in megacities like beijing bj shanghai sh and tianjin tj where wdrs increase by 1 93 1 43 and 1 02 times after considering water quality constraints when we set 1 wdr as the threshold of local water stress dashed line in fig 2a qu et al 2018 we find more provinces including jiangxi jx and hunan hn are under risks of lacking sufficient available water geographical pattern of wdr in china is consistent with the distributions of water resource endowment that is provinces in northern china faces more severe water stress than those in southern china however the geographical pattern of lwsr has changed considerably compared to wdr as shown in fig 2b provinces in the central and eastern coast of china face higher lwsrs because of their larger size of the economies pollution poses extra economic burdens on lwsr for instance jiangsu js hebei he shandong sd and henan ha are major industrial centers and warehouses of agricultural products in china they become the provinces with the highest economic risks due to water scarcity after considering the constraints of water pollution for provinces with abundant water resources like guangdong gd and fujian fj quality based lwsr poses more threats on local water use sectors and economies rather than quantity based lwsr national aggregate estimate of quantity based lwsr is 660 billion us and quality based lwsr is 593 billion us in 2017 indicating that pollution almost doubles the risks of local economic losses due to water scarcity in china heatmap of lwsr for each province sector is illustrated in fig s4 we can identify sectors that are the most vulnerable to local water scarcity including agriculture textile printing paper manufacturing gas production and wholesales hotspots of province sector lwsr are related to the province s economic size and industrial division for example while lwsr of agricultural production are common across the country lwsr of industrial sectors are the most prominent in only a few provinces including jiangsu js shanghai sh henan ha and anhui ah when water quality constraints are considered we observe an increasing number of province sector lwsr hotspots 3 2 virtual water scarcity risk vwsr in domestic trade after calculating lwsr in each province sector we then input lwsr into the domestic trade model and examine vwsr exports and imports among provinces fig s5 shows the quantity based and quality based vwsr at the provincial level the impact of water pollution on vwsr is not consistent for example quality based vwsr exports in henan ha hebei he and shandong sd are 1 48 1 42 and 1 09 times of quantity based vwsr exports in contrast for provinces like ningxia nx and heilongjiang hl where major export sectors are not constrained by local water pollution issues quality based vwsr exports are only 10 and 23 of quantity based vwsr exports the destinations of vwsr i e importers span broadly while the origins are relatively concentrated in the national aggregate quantity based vwsr transfer across provinces in 2017 is 276 billion us accounting for 41 8 of the national quantity based lwsr quality based vwsr imports in 2017 are 240 billion us accounting for 40 4 of the national quality based lwsr we then map combined vwsr exports and imports across provinces as illustrated in fig 3a and fig 3b we find the geographical distribution of vwsr exports is generally consistent with the spatial pattern of lwsr provinces in north china plain including jiangsu js hebei he henan ha and shandong sd are four top ranking exporters of vwsr on the contrary vwsr importers are mainly located in southern china where water resources are more abundant the two coastal provinces including guangdong gd and zhejiang zj take the most economic risks due to water shortages in other distant provinces for china s two megacities shanghai sh plays a key role of vwsr exporter whereas beijing bj is a high ranking vwsr importer reflecting their different positions in china s domestic supply chains fig 3c illustrates the transfers of vwsr across provinces and we have identified the largest vwsr flows among them for example hebei he exports 17 8 billion us of vwsr to shandong sd jiangsu js shifts 11 2 10 8 9 0 and 8 8 billion us of vwsr to guangdong gd zhejiang zj henan ha and anhui ah respectively we have listed the top 50 provincial vwsr flows in table s6 the heatmap in fig s6 visualizes sector to sector vwsr transmissions darkest pixels indicate hotspots of sector to sector relationships the distribution of vwsr spreads over a variety of sectors in the national trade system the top 50 links before and after considering water quality constraints are listed in table s6 we find origins of vwsr are concentrated agriculture hunting forestry fishing production and supply of electricity and heat and smelting and processing of metals are three major sectors transferring vwsr to other places then the destinations of vwsr span broadly food and tobacco processing is the most top ranking sector that imports vwsr after considering constraints of water pollution we find origins of vwsr become more centralized in a few provinces especially for agriculture sector in hebei he 3 3 risk indices and vulnerability indices we then measure risk and vulnerability index by normalizing each province s vwsr exports and imports by its total output as illustrated in fig 4 we find ningxia nx a relatively arid region in northwest china has highest risk index due to water scarcity local water pollution has largely increased risk indices in many provinces such as hebei he xinjiang xj and inner mongolia nm it indicates that unitary economic output in these regions tends to exert more risks on domestic trade system via vwsr exports owing to insufficient water supply and inadequate water quality vulnerability index on the other hand reflects a province s economic sensitivity to water scarcity risks of upstream suppliers we identify a few provinces that do not rank top in vwsr imports but have highest vulnerability index including jilin jl jiangxi jx shaanxi sx chongqing cq and hainan hi inclusion of water quality in water scarcity assessment has increased vulnerability in most provinces in general risky provinces are more concentrated but vulnerable provinces span broadly some regions including beijing bj and henan ha have large in vwsr both in terms of absolute values and relative vulnerability indices 3 4 concurrence of water scarcity risks finally we analyze herfindahl index of vwsr imports for each province to evaluate the concentrations of upstream trade partners for each province that are vulnerable to local water scarcity risks if a province imports vwsr from only a few upstream province sectors the concurrence of water scarcity risks is much higher a larger herfindahl index indicates higher vulnerability and lower resilience of a province in the face of external water shortage shocks as shown in fig 5 when we only consider quantity based water scarcity provinces with high herfindahl index values are concentrated in tianjin tj and shandong sd when we consider water quality constraints at the same time the herfindahl index has increased for most regions but decreased for the top two provinces anhui ah and jilin jl emerge on the national average herfindahl index has risen from 0 118 to 0 131 indicating that the overall resilience of domestic supply chain has decreased due to widespread water pollution 4 discussions this study provides a comprehensive analysis of how local water pollution may impose risks on economic outputs of local water use sectors in china we find that poor water quality increases local water depletion risks van vliet et al 2021 and almost doubles potential local economic losses due to insufficient water supply in china risks of water pollution on economic production are not evenly distributed across geographical units northern provinces where available freshwater resources are limited face more severe water quality challenges however these northern provinces tend to produce water intensive goods for consumption in the south which amplify the scarcity risk guan and hubacek 2007 constraints of water pollution also influence vwsr transfers in the domestic trade system top vwsr exporters become more centralized in a few provinces whereas vulnerable provinces span broadly and are more likely to be affected by water shortage in distant regions the concurrence of water scarcity risks measured by herfindahl index becomes higher when water quality is included in the assessment it indicates that water pollution decreases overall supply chain resilience in china s economic system our study highlights the need to reduce economic risks of both quality based and quantity based local water scarcity we find regions that are short in water availability and poor in water quality are largely overlapped these provinces are spatially located in the north and are key upstream suppliers in china s domestic trade system we then identify critical regions and sectors that may have ramifications on downstream economies or are highly vulnerable to water scarcity in upstream suppliers jiangsu js hebei he henan ha and shandong sd are top ranking provinces in terms of absolute vwsr exports whereas guangdong gd zhejiang zj jiangsu js and henan ha are major vwsr importers when getting rid of the effect of economic size ningxia nx hebei hb and xinjiang xj become the most risky provinces and they are all located in the north jilin jl beijing bj jiangxi jx and shaanxi sx are the most vulnerable regions to distant water scarcity risks and they spread all over the country to lower water scarcity and alleviate overall risks local authorities should not only focus on conserving physical water resources but also improving water quality loucks and van beek 2017 qu et al 2018 adaptive solutions include improving water use efficiency levidow et al 2014 increasing water availability by increasing reservoir storage or water diversion projects long et al 2020 and reducing pollutant emissions through better wastewater treatment cosgrove and loucks 2015 wang et al 2020 meanwhile for provinces vulnerable to distant virtual water scarcity risks in addition to switching to upstream suppliers who are not subject to local water stress provinces should advance regional collaboration and investment on water management and controlling transboundary water pollution perry and praskievicz 2017 in terms of hotspots of sectors our estimates show that agriculture hunting forestry fishing production and supply of electricity and heat and smelting and processing of metals are important exporters of vwsr food and tobacco processing is the major destination of vwsr water pollution creates more hotspots of sectoral vwsr and makes the origins of water scarcity risks more concentrated in several provinces these findings inform decision makers to focus on these hotspots for mitigating risk transmissions for example agricultural sector in hebei he province needs more efforts to mitigate its potential risks to downstream economies due to water scarcity long et al 2020 yet inequality exists in terms of risks of local water scarcity and shares of economic gains dolan et al 2021 provinces in the south imports more water intensive goods from the north but have larger water environment capacity and lower local water stress zhao et al 2015 our study develops an integrated method to assess the impacts of quantity based and quality based water scarcity on local and distant economies quantity and quality based lwsr calculated in this study for each province depends on its water availability pollution level sectoral water use efficiency economic size and industrial structure it provides an approach to efficiently quantify the restriction of pollution especially nutrients and major elements on local available water resources and economic activities a broader range of water quality parameters could be taken into consideration according to the needs in the future such as heavy metals and metalloid van vliet and zwolsman 2008 the indicator could also be used to measure the risks and impacts of extreme climate events such as drought and urban flood on local freshwater supply and output losses more than that the proposed method integrates mrio model and depicts the sources and destinations of transboundary risks in china s domestic trade system the framework can be extended to investigate how nationwide variability in inland water quality around the globe poses risks on global supply chains in addition if multiyear mrio tables or higher resolution water quality data are available the model could help support cost benefits analysis of water management policies by evaluating how improved water quality reduces local and distant economic risks last but not least several limitations in this study should be noted first there are still important water pollution issues that have not fully taken into consideration in this study for example increasing water body temperature caused by global warming affects agriculture and fisheries and reduces available cooling water for energy generations management of water resources for different water use sectors needs to account for quality requirements in nutrients plastics and other pollutants second our water quality data is based on annual average of city level monitoring stations records provincial sectoral water use data are estimated according to the national level estimated ratio mrio model at the provincial scale is also a coarse measure of the economic activities the combination of these datasets at provincial levels may not reflect constraints of water scarcity at finer spatial scales in reality future research may use high resolution water quality data and local sectoral economic data to improve the accuracy of water scarcity assessment 5 conclusion this study quantifies the risks of both quantity and quality based local water scarcity to china s economic performances of local water use sectors and downstream producers in the domestic trade system we first reveal that in the year of 2017 water pollution almost doubles china s local economic loss risks due to water scarcity in china we also identify the provinces and sectors that are the risky to downstream sectors and find pollution makes water scarcity risk exporters in china become more concentrated this effect on the other hand decreases the overall resilience of china s domestic trade network this work offers unique insights into the interaction of quality based water economy nexus closing the gap on inadequate attention to water quality constraints on water usability in previous studies we also offer hotspots that policy makers should prioritize on for sustainable water management and highlight the need to conserve water resources and improve water quality at the same time credit authorship contribution statement jinling li conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original draft jianxun yang investigation formal analysis writing
