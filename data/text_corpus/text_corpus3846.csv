united kingdom department of engineering and the built environment faculty of science and technology anglia ruskin university chelmsford essex cm1 1sq united kingdom corresponding author reliability risk and resilience are strongly related concepts and have been widely utilised in the context of water infrastructure performance analysis however there are many ways in which each measure can be formulated depending on the reliability of what risk to what from what and resilience of what to what and the relationships will differ depending on the formulations used this research has developed a framework to explore the ways in which reliability risk and resilience may be formulated identifying possible components and knowledge required for calculation of each and formalising the conceptual relationships between specified and general resilience this utilises the safe sure framework which shows how threats to a water system can result in consequences for society the economy and the environment to enable the formulations to be derived in a logical manner and to ensure consistency in any comparisons the framework is used to investigate the relationship between levels of reliability risk and resilience provided by multiple operational control and design strategies for an urban wastewater system case study the results highlight that although reliability risk and resilience values may exhibit correlations designing for just one is insufficient reliability risk and resilience are complementary rather than interchangeable measures and one cannot be used as a substitute for another furthermore it is shown that commonly used formulations address only a small fraction of the possibilities and a more comprehensive assessment of a system s response to threats is necessary to provide a comprehensive understanding of risk and resilience graphical abstract image 1 keywords integrated urban wastewater system reliability risk resilience safe sure water quality 1 introduction reliability and risk have been widely used as the primary criterion in water infrastructure design and operation conventional design aims to provide a high degree of reliability butler et al 2017 and risk analysis is commonly used to address the response to threats however there are limitations to risk assessment not all risks can be quantified due to the existence of emerging and unobserved threats park et al 2013 unforeseeable threats cannot be included and highly improbable events which have a high degree of uncertainty are dealt with poorly only threats which are known and can be assigned a probability can be analysed so calculated risk depends on what is and is not known kaplan and garrick 1981 in recent years the resilience concept has evolved and is beginning to be incorporated in the design and operation of various water systems sometimes in combination with risk and reliability asefa et al 2014 hoque et al 2012 however the relative importance of these three terms their interdependencies and their impact on system performance are currently poorly understood reliability risk and resilience are strongly related concepts scholz et al 2011 and the relationship between reliability and risk has been well developed in the context of infrastructure performance analysis there have also been more recent studies into relationships with resilience the us homeland security studies and analysis institute 2010 for example comprehensively studied risk and resilience relationships qualitatively and quantitatively by generating a risk resilience matrix and adopting of mathematical methods to identify influencing factors in a system the eth zürich centre for security studies 2011 conceptualized the risk and resilience relationship using three different perspectives that have been implicitly adopted in several subsequent studies a considering resilience as a goal of risk management ongkowwijoyo and doloi 2018 serre and heinzlef 2018 b considering it as part of risk management hoque et al 2012 kammouh et al 2017 mitchell and harris 2012 shafieezadeh and burden 2014 and c considering it as an alternative complementary to risk management homeland security studies and analysis institute 2010 joyce et al 2018 kammouh et al 2017 park et al 2013 the latter argues that risk and resilience are differentiable concepts but interrelated complementary mutually reinforcing and could be coupled to improve adaptive capacity of engineering systems whilst risk and resilience have previously been compared conceptually e g aven 2011 baum 2015 there are many ways in which each term can be formulated depending on the reliability of what risk to what from what and resilience of what to what and the relationships will differ depending on the formulations used it is recognised that resilience for example can exist at different scales time periods and systems and there may be trade offs between these which are key to the assessment and management of resilience chelleri et al 2015 however the multiple different ways in which resilience can be formulated have not previously been formalised risk has previously been decomposed using a matrix approach to show the links between multiple initiating events intermediate states and final damage states kaplan et al 1983 but analysis of specific formulations was not carried out the current lack of understanding of all the ways in which reliability risk and resilience can be formulated within the same framework poses a barrier to a comprehensive understanding of their relationships and comparison on a like for like basis urban wastewater system studies have typically aimed to reduce level of service failures under design conditions i e increase reliability e g juznic zonta et al 2012 oliveira and von sperling 2008 and there has also been research into risk e g astaraie imani et al 2012 and resilience e g matthews 2016 schoen et al 2015 scott et al 2012 individually resilience analysis can provide additional understanding of wastewater system performance provide greater scope than risk analysis and account for a wider range of threats particularly those that are low probability and high impact it can also provide greater insight into the failure characteristics since it is commonly assumed to be dependent on both the magnitude and duration of failures butler et al 2016 mugume et al 2015 there is also an increasing interest in building resilience in practice as evidenced for example by the resilience duty imposed in the uk water act hm government 2014 and the rapid growth in the publication of papers relating to resilience in a range of fields juan garcía et al 2017 conducted a comprehensive and critical review of the state of the art in resilience assessment in wastewater systems management and defined future research directions that will contribute to the operationalisation of resilience however the relationship between risk and resilience and whether for example resilience analysis can replace risk assessment is still unclear with respect to reliability risk and resilience there is a lack of studies on wastewater systems that consider all three metrics as separate criteria for design and operation and explore their relationships both conceptually and quantitatively wang and blackmore 2012 calculated separate values for each however these were for a rainwater harvesting system and whilst they were all used to inform the design process the relationships between the performance measures was not explored other publications focusing on different water systems have also not evaluated all three metric and or explored their relationships in a quantitative manner blackmore and plant 2008 for example discussed the differences between risk management and resilience approaches but did not explore these in a case study and did not undertake a quantitative analysis reliability was not discussed in other studies that have used a case study and provided a quantitative analysis e g su et al 2018 resilience has been considered a component of risk assessment separate risk and resilience values have not been computed and risk and resilience have not been compared this paper therefore presents an innovative framework to explore the relationships between reliability risk and resilience levels provided by multiple operational control and design options for a case study integrated urban wastewater system iuws sewer catchment wastewater treatment plant and receiving river considered as a whole in this the multiple ways in which reliability risk and resilience can be formulated are captured and formalised in a single framework for the first time and the potential advantages or disadvantages of each formulation are investigated the framework also reveals the prerequisite knowledge required for calculations under each formulation clearly illustrating the differences between what can be addressed by reliability risk and resilience assessments this research builds upon the safe sure framework butler et al 2016 which shows how threats to a water system can result in consequences for society the economy and the environment to enable the formulations to be derived in a logical manner and to ensure consistency in any comparisons this paper does not aim to quantify the correlations between reliability risk and resilience in a general sense although numerical values specific to the case study are presented and discussed as the numerical values will vary depending on the system evaluated however formalisation of the conceptual formulations of each measure illustrates the overlap in what is addressed by each as well as the differences the conceptual decomposition of reliability risk and resilience into all their possible formulations provided in this study enables future analyses to be placed within the wider picture ensuring that any comparisons are made on a suitable basis and using compatible formulations the results also highlight the gaps in many analyses of risk and resilience showing that commonly used formulations address only a small fraction of the possibilities means by which a more comprehensive assessment of a system s response to threats can be achieved are also identified this research complements the increasing number of projects and initiatives focused on resilience including for example the 100 resilient cities initiative rockefeller foundation 2018 the eu funded improver improver 2018 and resilens resilens 2018 projects the epsrc funded brim network brim 2018 and the resilience shift project funded by lloyd s register foundation resilience shift 2018 and contributes to the rapidly growing body of research in this field the proposed methodology could also be applied to other types of integrated systems analysis e g water energy food waste climate etc and contribute to future developments in these areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 formulating reliability risk and resilience in the safe sure framework for reliability risk and resilience to be fully defined it is necessary to specify reliability of what risk to what from what and resilience of what or resilience of what to what i e where the failure and causal event characteristics are measured this study builds upon the safe sure framework as illustrated in fig 1 to show the potential failures and their causal events there are many options and combinations that can be chosen and all are identified before selection of a set that enables comparable reliability risk and resilience values to be calculated for the case study iuws in the safe sure framework threats are stresses or shocks which may affect the system infrastructure e g a storm event and can be reduced by mitigation measures impacts are the effects on level of service resulting from system failures e g pump failure and may be reduced with adaptation measures and consequences are the effects on society the economy and the environment resulting from the impacts e g eutrophication and may be reduced with coping strategies an event which may result in a failure could be a threat a system failure or a change in level of service provision an impact failure could refer to the adverse effects of an event on the system e g physical failure of system components level of service i e failure to provide the required level of service or on the society economy and environment i e adverse consequences in the safe sure framework threats system failure states impacts and consequences are each presented as a single component however these can all be further categorised as known or unknown depending on whether or not there is knowledge of their potential existence prior to their occurrence known event types include both known knowns and known unknowns where known knowns are well understood and their characteristics identified and known unknowns poorly understood but known to exist illustrated in fig 2 attempts to quantify known unknowns may be based on past experience but are subject to uncertainty unknowns cannot be characterised since their existence is not recognised whilst their existence has been acknowledged unknown threats and unknown consequences have not previously been considered explicitly or in detail in the safe sure framework butler et al 2016 including these two elements in following formulation of reliability risk and resilience is an important step forward as it facilitates a detailed understanding of all the elements that contribute to of reliability risk and resilience and shows the interdependencies between known and unknown threats known system failure modes known impacts and known and unknown consequences it also clearly illustrates the challenges in providing a comprehensive assessment both known and unknown threats t k and t u and consequences c k and c u exist however it is reasonably assumed that for a well characterised iuws all potential system failure states s k can be identified i e there are no unknowns and the number of knowns is finite all types of potential impact i k are also known since these are based on pre defined level of service requirements the interdependencies of these components are shown in fig 1 known system failure states result from both known and unknown threats known impacts results from known system failure states only and known impacts can result in both known and unknown consequences note that threat system failure state impact and consequence refer only to the type of event each of which can encompass a range of different magnitude and duration events of that type for example population growth is one potential threat but this might be 10 or 100 although all potential types of system failure and impact are known their characteristics are unknown if the cause is not specified due to the chain of events shown in fig 1 all consequences impacts and system failure states are ultimately affected by both known and unknown threats and hence their characteristics cannot be fully defined while the types of impact for example are all known the probability magnitude and duration of these in a general sense cannot be determined since they are partly dependent on unknown threats it is only possible to determine the probability magnitude and duration of impacts under specified system failures and or specified known threats a summary of potential events and failures and their characteristics as may be considered components of reliability risk and resilience is given in table 1 note that knowledge of the probability distribution function magnitudes and durations may be incomplete even for known threats due to the existence of unknown unknowns also known probabilities cannot reasonably cover the complete range of event scales that are theoretically possible since there is likely to be very little data from which a frequency distribution can be derived for particularly rare events wang and blackmore 2009 calculation of joint probabilities of two or more major events occurring simultaneously poses an even greater challenge park et al 2013 although many possible formulations of reliability risk and resilience exist performance metrics can only be calculated for those which do not require knowledge of unknown failure or causal event types or unknown characteristics probability magnitude and duration the following sections therefore investigate the components and pre requisite knowledge required for all formulations possible within the safe sure framework to enable identification of those that can and cannot be calculated theoretically and facilitate investigation into the relationships between reliability risk and resilience 2 1 1 reliability reliability rel is defined here as the degree to which the system minimises level of service failure frequency over its design life when subject to standard loading butler et al 2017 it is typically represented by the probability of success or probability of a system being in a non failure state hashimoto et al 1982 kjeldsen and rosbjerg 2004 as in eq 1 1 r e l 1 p f a i l u r e in order to calculate reliability it is necessary to specify where the failure state is measured i e reliability of what based on the definition given this should be the level of service impact however there are further options such as reliability of a specific system component and given their common usage it is useful to identify these too using the safe sure framework and components identified in fig 1 reliability can be formulated in six ways as detailed in table 2 not all reliability measures detailed are useful it is unclear what would represent a failure with respect to the society economy environment and formulations r5 and r6 are unlikely to be used in practice however provided failure limits can be defined reliability is theoretically calculable using any of the formulations listed since it addresses only performance under standard loading i e known knowns any event which is rare enough to be a known unknown or completely unknown is not considered standard 2 1 2 resilience the safe sure definition of resilience the degree to which the system minimises level of service failure magnitude and duration over its design life when subject to exceptional conditions butler et al 2017 is used in this study this contains two components failure magnitude and failure duration it is not necessary to know what causes the failure although it may be specified since the probability dimension as used in risk assessment is not conventionally included in resilience aven 2011 resilience can be specified or general for general resilience the resilience of any and all parts of a system to all kinds of shocks including novel ones folke et al 2010 it is necessary to specify resilience of what i e where the failure is measured this encompasses the response to all future threats including those which are unknown and unforeseeable resilience of an iuws for example is a measure of the magnitude and duration of effects on the iuws resulting from any threat including those that cannot be foreseen for specified resilience resilience of some particular part of a system to one or more identified kinds of shocks folke et al 2010 resilience of what to what i e where the failure state is measured and what the causal event considered is must be specified an example would be resilience of an iuws to storm events in which the magnitude and duration of the effects of the storm events on the iuws determine the resilience value possible points in the safe sure framework which the failure magnitude and duration may relate to are shown in fig 3 in fig 3a the cause of the failure causal event is specified these formulations therefore relate to specified resilience general resilience uses the formulations in fig 3b since the failures here can result from anything resilience cannot be calculated in formulations in which the magnitude and duration of the failure are unknown however knowledge of the probability of the causal event is not required therefore resilience can theoretically be calculated under twelve different formulations s1 s2 s4 and s7 s12 in fig 3a and g2 and g5 g6 in fig 3b haimes 2009 argues that general resilience cannot be calculated since it requires knowledge of the response to any threat but this is not always the case resilience cannot be calculated under formulation g3 resilience of society economy and the environment as this requires knowledge of unknown consequences and g1 and g4 resilience of system and resilience of specified system component are also incalculable since not all threats which may cause system failures are known however the framework presented illustrates that general resilience can be calculated through a middle state based analysis as in g2 and g5 as both known and unknown threats result in the same known finite set of system failure modes take for example formulation g2 resilience of level of service this may be modelled as resilience of level of service to any threat which cannot be calculated since not all threats are known but also as resilience of level of service to any system failure which can be calculated as all the modes by which the system may fail are identifiable what threat known or unknown causes them is irrelevant since by evaluating all system failure modes the potential effects of all threats are captured multiple threats can thus be addressed with analysis of a smaller number of system failure modes traditionally resilience has focussed on the failure of assets however asset failure may not necessarily affect level of service provision and may be irrelevant from a consumer perspective ofwat 2010 this suggests that although formulation s1 may be of interest to the asset owners an impact or consequence based approach such as g5 or g6 is of greater benefit similar applies to reliability and risk 2 1 3 risk definitions and use of the term risk are inconsistent whilst risk is conventionally calculated as a function of probability and consequence of a given scenario kaplan and garrick 1981 often in practice the severity of the resultant adverse effects are not accounted for konstantinou et al 2011 for example defined risk as the conditional probability of incurring loss or damage under certain unfavourable circumstances and in terms of practical application the environment agency s flood risk maps environment agency 2018 show only the probability of flooding with no indication of severity such an approach may be acceptable when knowledge of the degree of the damage is not required e g if knowing simply whether or not flooding occurs irrespective of depth is sufficient however it is also argued that risk should provide a measure of the potential losses or adverse effects scholz et al 2011 and it is generally quantified using a function of event frequency and effect magnitude blackmore and plant 2008 this is the interpretation used in this work the following equation adapted from the typical probability x consequence to fit the terminology of this study is used here to represent risk 2 r i s k p c a s u a l e v e n t m a g n i t u d e f a i l u r e in calculation of risk the casual event probability and failure magnitude could be measured at different locations for example when calculating the risk of a combined sewer overflow cso resulting from a storm event failure could refer to either the occurrence of a cso or the occurrence of deterioration in the receiving water body quality in the case of the former the causal event could be considered the storm event whereas for the latter either the storm event or the cso could be considered as the causal event hence for absolute clarity it is necessary to specify risk to what from what i e where the effect is measured and the potential cause of that considered for conventional risk calculation both the probability of the causal event and the magnitude of its effects the failure need to be known and measurable accordingly fig 3 illustrates all potential combinations of failure and causal event within the safe sure framework and identifies those which result in a calculable risk formulation similarly to resilience risk formulations in which a specific causal event is identified may be classified as specified risk and those which address risk from any known or unknown event can be classified as general risk risk cannot be calculated in formulations which include unknown threats in the causal events i e the general formulations g1 g6 in fig 3b since by definition these cannot be characterised this is in contrast to resilience where it is not necessary to know for example the probability of the events that may result in failures similarly risk cannot be calculated in formulations that include unknown consequences in the measured failures i e formulations s3 s6 s9 and s11 in fig 3a and g3 in fig 3b furthermore risk cannot be calculated if the required causal event probability or failure magnitude is unknown despite the existence of the causal event or failure type being known formulations s10 and s12 in fig 3a this leaves five formulations s1 s2 and s7s9 in fig 3a under which risk may be calculated in the safe sure framework further details including equations for each formulation are provided in the supplementary information 2 2 conceptual relationships 2 2 1 reliability and risk there is widely assumed to be a connection between reliability and risk however the nature of this relationship is less clear some consider increasing reliability to be analogous to decreasing risk for example with high risk equating to low reliability konstantinou et al 2011 however others consider reliability a contributor to risk as it contributes to the probability of failure but is not the only component zio 2013 this corresponds with the risk assessment approach of kjeldsen and rosbjerg 2004 and suggests that although increasing reliability may contribute to a reduction in risk other factors must also be considered 2 2 2 reliability and resilience reliability may be considered a prerequisite and or a component of resilience butler et al 2017 francis and bekera 2014 or alternatively a complementary performance indicator e g kjeldsen and rosbjerg 2004 as for risk this suggests that increasing reliability may contribute to efforts to increase resilience but additional measures are also required 2 2 3 risk and resilience resilience is differentiable from but complementary to risk analysis park et al 2013 however there is often overlap and confusion in use of the two terms and resilience analysis in practice is commonly based on the concept of risk the overseas development institute mitchell and harris 2012 for example have published a risk management approach to resilience and halcrow 2008 have produced a service risk framework for assessment of resilience fig 3 highlights the broader scope of resilience assessment risk can only be calculated under five of the eighteen possible formulations and cannot account for unknown threats whereas resilience can be calculated under nine including all for which risk can be calculated risk cannot be calculated under formulations s4 and s10 12 amongst others since these require knowledge of probabilities that cannot be determined p sk x and p ik y despite the event type being specified and known in these cases its probability is not known as it may occur as a result of unknown threats the probabilities of which are not known resilience can be calculated under formulations s4 and s10 12 however since this does not require knowledge of the probability of the event s resulting in failure risk cannot be calculated under the formulations used for general resilience g2 g5 or g6 since knowledge of the probability of unknown threats is required in every case even if the probability can be expressed as the probability of infrastructure failure or probability of level of service failure as in g6 for example it is still affected by unknown threats and cannot be calculated to be calculable risk must be specified general resilience formulations could be considered more useful for detailed system analysis since they include a measure of the response to any threat including unknowns but they are also more challenging to calculate for this very reason 2 2 4 reliability risk and resilience based on the definitions and discussion in section 2 1 the conceptual relationships between reliability risk and resilience with respect to the probability and magnitude of events addressed are presented graphically in fig 4 reliability concerns performance under standard loading which will typically cover the relatively low magnitude high probability events which are expected to occur within the system s design life risk can address more extreme events with a lower probability and higher magnitude but still cannot deal with events that are considered too unlikely to be assigned a probability with any degree of certainty or events that cannot be foreseen resilience can address the same events as risk assessment but as it is not necessary to know the probability can also consider the system response to and recovery from much more extreme events including so called black swans which although highly unlikely may occur 2 3 integrated urban wastewater system case study 2 3 1 case study the case study iuws used shown diagrammatically in fig 5 is a semi hypothetical system that was originally presented by schütze et al 2002 and has since been the subject of many studies e g butler and schütze 2005 fu et al 2008 zacharof et al 2004 it comprises a sewer system a wastewater treatment plant with an off line pass through storage tank at the inlet and a river of which 45 km is modelled it was simulated using simba6 ifak 2009 it should be noted that as the model is of a semi hypothetical system and risk and resilience assessments are based on the modelling of extreme events including those that have not previously happened the complete integrated model cannot be calibrated and the results cannot be validated using data from real events performance evaluation is based on simulation of a seven day rainfall event with a total depth of 27 mm dynamic outputs used are the dissolved oxygen do and ammonium concentrations in the river un ionised ammonium concentration is estimated from the total ammonium using a conversion factor of 0 0195 based on a ph of 7 7 and a temperature of 20 c schütze et al 2002 further details on the iuws model simulation are given by astaraie imani et al 2012 ten operational control and design parameters detailed in table 3 are used as decision variables and sampled using latin hypercube sampling to produce a set of 400 options for evaluation in this study these parameters include four sewer storage tank volumes maximum pumped outflow from each storage tank above which csos occur maximum flow to the wastewater treatment plant wwtp and the wwtp influent threshold triggering emptying of the storm tank upper and lower limits for operational decision variables are extended beyond those typically considered so as to provide a greater range of reliability risk and resilience values it is recognised that this approach may produce many solutions with poor performance however it should also yield options providing a high level of performance and it is important that a wide range is captured so as to gain a more complete picture of the relationships between reliability risk and resilience 2 3 2 reliability risk and resilience formulation in order that reliability risk and resilience can be compared it is important that compatible formulations are used for each for risk and resilience formulation s2 risk to level of service from specified threat and resilience of level of service to specified threat is chosen since this requires no knowledge of unknowns and can be calculated for reliability the corresponding formulation is r4 reliability of level of service provision all require measures of failure characteristics and must therefore consider the same level of service requirements to be comparable in all formulations receiving water quality represents the level of service and level of service failure is classified as the occurrence of a do concentration less than 4 mg l fu et al 2008 and or an un ionised ammonia concentration greater than 0 068 mg l johnson et al 2007 the specified threat considered for risk and resilience is population increase which is modelled as an increase in dry weather flow dwf the reliability risk and resilience values calculated can therefore be explicitly defined as follows reliability of receiving water quality compliance risk to receiving water quality from population increase by 2035 resilience of receiving water quality to population increase note that it is necessary to define the time frame for risk assessment since population increase probabilities are time dependent the measured failure characteristics will be different in each case as each must consider different causal event scenarios reliability relates to failures under standard loading whereas risk relates to failures under foreseeable conditions and resilience relates to failures under exceptional conditions it is acknowledged that use of a resilience formulation which incorporates response to unknowns e g g2 would be preferable however this would not allow risk to be calculated and compared on a like for like basis 2 3 3 reliability risk and resilience assessment a brief description of the assessment methodologies is provided here further detail is available in the supporting information 2 3 3 1 iuws reliability assessment reliability is assessed under standard conditions i e no population increase using eq 1 where the probability of failure is based on the modelled level of service failure duration 2 3 3 2 iuws risk assessment risk is evaluated for population increases of 0 15 at 1 5 intervals using eq 2 in each case the probability of population growth equalling or exceeding the given value is calculated based on 95 prediction intervals reported by the united nations raftery et al 2012 united nations 2012 for the uk population in 2035 assuming a normal distribution the greater of the normalised do deficit and normalised un ionised ammonia exceedance represents the failure magnitude this yields 16 risk values for each iuws operational control and design option the highest of which is used in the following analysis 2 3 3 3 iuws resilience assessment assessment of resilience is based on the concept of using a response curve system performance as a function of disturbance magnitude for comparison of solutions diao et al 2016 mugume et al 2015 where the area under the curve provides a measure of resilience to capture both the magnitude and duration components of resilience failure characteristics are measured using two metrics p deficit based on mean performance deficit and p duration mean based on mean failure duration each of which are calculated for population changes in the range 0 150 this yields two resilience indicators for each option r deficit and r duration mean 3 results and discussion 3 1 reliability risk and resilience relationships fig 6 shows the relationships between reliability risk and resilience for the 400 iuws operational control and design options evaluated each circle represents a different option the colour of the circle represents its reliability value and its x and y coordinates show its risk and resilience values respectively fig 6a utilises the resilience indicator based on mean performance deficit and fig 6b the resilience indicator based on mean failure duration fig 6 shows that an increase in reliability typically corresponds with reduced risk and increased resilience in this system for the reliability risk and resilience formulations considered r 0 91 for reliability and risk r 0 97 for reliability and r deficit and r 0 95 for reliability and r duration mean however most levels of reliability can be achieved with a range of different risk and resilience values showing the importance of considering performance under extreme conditions as well as standard loading additionally risk and resilience values shown in fig 6 reveal a correlation r 0 92 for risk and r deficit r 0 83 for risk and r duration mean but they are not directly proportional hence risk assessment cannot be considered a substitute for resilience assessment with respect to the system design and operational control it is desirable that the same option provides the highest reliability lowest risk and highest resilience this section explores the feasibility of this goal and the observed relationships between reliability risk and resilience 3 1 1 high reliability options in fig 6b reliability greater than 0 999 can be achieved with 30 operational control and design options yet the resilience r duration mean values of these options range from 0 85 to 0 92 this is attributed to variation in the do failure characteristics resulting from the different design and operational control options whilst the do failures are observed with a 15 population increase in the lower resilience option do failures in the higher resilience option are not recorded until population increase reaches 45 and are then of significantly shorter magnitude and duration 3 1 2 high reliability low risk options in fig 6b resilience r duration mean values range from 0 87 to 0 92 for options with reliability greater than 0 999 and risk below 0 001 this indicates that there is significant variation in the resilience of options providing low risk and high reliability particularly noticeable with the r duration mean resilience indicator therefore these results demonstrate that when selecting design and operational control options for an iuws high reliability and low risk are necessary criteria but not sufficient for high resilience resilience must be considered as a third and separate objective if in this case study no benefit of considering the three performance measures as separate objectives had been found this would not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that in the wider sense reliability risk and resilience do not all need to be considered in the design and operation of iuwss however the observation here that they cannot be used interchangeably is sufficient to demonstrate that the highest reliability and lowest risk options do not necessarily provide the highest resilience 3 1 3 high resilience options fig 6a and b also show that there can be significant variation in the risk and reliability values for options providing a given level of resilience for example in fig 5b options providing a resilience r duration mean value of 0 85 have reliability values in the range 0 910 1 000 and risk values in the range 0 023 0 176 this suggests that consideration of greatest resilience alone is insufficient and reliability and or risk must also be evaluated to ensure that the chosen option performs well under a wide range of conditions including standard loading this observation is particularly important when it is not possible to implement the option providing the greatest resilience e g due to cost restraints as there is greater range in risk and reliability for lower resilience options the different levels of resilience risk and reliability provided by each option are attributed to adjustment in the decision variables presented in table 3 when analysing the options providing a resilience r duration mean value of 0 85 as above the option providing highest reliability and lowest risk has larger values for qmaxin qst2 qst4 and qst6 this will result in a smaller volume of csos from subcatchments 1 4 and 7 as well as a greater volume of wastewater being treated thereby resulting in higher receiving water quality under standard conditions however it only provides the same level of resilience as that provided by a less reliable option with greater csos and less wastewater treated whereas it would intuitively be expected to provide higher resilience than a less reliable option this may be attributed to it resulting in a greater impact on level of service under extreme population increase as the surcharged wwtp performs poorly and low quality discharge is concentrated at the wwtp outlet instead of distributed along the river by csos 3 2 reliability risk and resilience based design most operational control and design options shown in fig 6 do not represent realistic solutions given their poor performance even under standard loading design conditions further analysis therefore focuses on those which provide good performance under the base case population i e have high reliability example response curves for three options which provide a reliability of at least 0 999 are shown in fig 7 the first grey line provides a high degree of reliability only the second black line is also low risk risk 0 001 and the third bold dashed line is the option that provides the highest level of resilience whilst also providing high reliability and low risk these show that a high degree of reliability does not guarantee good performance under disturbances consideration of risk improves the response but resilience assessment is required to ensure the chosen option performs well with respect to alternatives when water quality failures do occur the difference between reliability risk and resilience based iuws design is most marked in fig 7b where the control and design option resulting in the greatest do deficit minimum do concentration under any level of population increase has high reliability but not low risk and the most resilient solution maintains the highest do concentration minimises the failure magnitude under any population increase to illustrate the potential differences between reliability risk and resilience based design the decision variable values of the three different options are shown in fig 8 the high reliability option provides a receiving water quality compliance reliability of 1 000 risk to receiving water quality from population increase of 0 023 and a receiving water quality resilience to population increase r duration mean of 0 853 the high reliability and low risk option has reliability risk and resilience values of 1 000 0 000 and 0 868 respectively and in the high resilience option the resilience r duration mean is increased to 0 922 it is shown that whilst there are similarities between the three options most notably in qmaxin and vst7 the characteristics of the operational control and design option providing high resilience differ from those providing just high reliability for example high reliability can be achieved with an increase in storage volume of 23 31 vst2 vst4 vst6 and vst7 however significantly greater increase in storage volume is required to provide the highest level of resilience this suggests that identification of preferable design and operational control options taking into account reliability risk and resilience requires an understanding of the mechanism of failure minimisation i e how the different options reduce the frequency magnitude and duration of failure and that there may be cost implications of increasing resilience e g due to extra storage required note that observations on the relationships between reliability risk and resilience in the iuws case study are based on a formulation of resilience that addresses only one known threat the capability of a middle state based resilience assessment to address multiple threats including unknowns as in formulation g2 for example has not been exploited the benefits of a high resilience approach over a low risk approach are expected to be greater if resilience is calculated using a formulation under which risk is incalculable e g s4 s10 or g2 but demonstrating the benefits is challenging if they are not observable until the occurrence of a previously unknown threat even under risk and resilience formulation s2 however it is shown that failure magnitude and duration under a specified threat can be significantly reduced by considering resilience in addition to risk 4 conclusions this research has explored the ways in which reliability risk and resilience may be formulated identifying possible components and knowledge required for calculation of each and formalising the conceptual relationships between specified and general resilience a set of corresponding formulations has also been implemented in a case study iuws to enable investigation into the relationships between reliability risk and resilience for this system the following conclusions are drawn many formulations of both general and specified risk and resilience exist but not all can be calculated due to the existence of unknown threats and unknown consequences general resilience can theoretically be calculated under some formulations whereas general risk cannot resilience can therefore address responses to a wider range of threats all threats including both known and unknown can be addressed with a middle state based resilience analysis which focusses on the level of service response to system failures risk cannot be calculated on the same basis since the probability of system failure is affected by the probability of unknown threats consideration of resilience in addition to risk can be beneficial even when only considering specified threats as demonstrated in the case study lowest risk solutions do not necessarily provide the highest specified resilience although reliability risk and resilience values may exhibit correlations

united kingdom department of engineering and the built environment faculty of science and technology anglia ruskin university chelmsford essex cm1 1sq united kingdom corresponding author reliability risk and resilience are strongly related concepts and have been widely utilised in the context of water infrastructure performance analysis however there are many ways in which each measure can be formulated depending on the reliability of what risk to what from what and resilience of what to what and the relationships will differ depending on the formulations used this research has developed a framework to explore the ways in which reliability risk and resilience may be formulated identifying possible components and knowledge required for calculation of each and formalising the conceptual relationships between specified and general resilience this utilises the safe sure framework which shows how threats to a water system can result in consequences for society the economy and the environment to enable the formulations to be derived in a logical manner and to ensure consistency in any comparisons the framework is used to investigate the relationship between levels of reliability risk and resilience provided by multiple operational control and design strategies for an urban wastewater system case study the results highlight that although reliability risk and resilience values may exhibit correlations designing for just one is insufficient reliability risk and resilience are complementary rather than interchangeable measures and one cannot be used as a substitute for another furthermore it is shown that commonly used formulations address only a small fraction of the possibilities and a more comprehensive assessment of a system s response to threats is necessary to provide a comprehensive understanding of risk and resilience graphical abstract image 1 keywords integrated urban wastewater system reliability risk resilience safe sure water quality 1 introduction reliability and risk have been widely used as the primary criterion in water infrastructure design and operation conventional design aims to provide a high degree of reliability butler et al 2017 and risk analysis is commonly used to address the response to threats however there are limitations to risk assessment not all risks can be quantified due to the existence of emerging and unobserved threats park et al 2013 unforeseeable threats cannot be included and highly improbable events which have a high degree of uncertainty are dealt with poorly only threats which are known and can be assigned a probability can be analysed so calculated risk depends on what is and is not known kaplan and garrick 1981 in recent years the resilience concept has evolved and is beginning to be incorporated in the design and operation of various water systems sometimes in combination with risk and reliability asefa et al 2014 hoque et al 2012 however the relative importance of these three terms their interdependencies and their impact on system performance are currently poorly understood reliability risk and resilience are strongly related concepts scholz et al 2011 and the relationship between reliability and risk has been well developed in the context of infrastructure performance analysis there have also been more recent studies into relationships with resilience the us homeland security studies and analysis institute 2010 for example comprehensively studied risk and resilience relationships qualitatively and quantitatively by generating a risk resilience matrix and adopting of mathematical methods to identify influencing factors in a system the eth zürich centre for security studies 2011 conceptualized the risk and resilience relationship using three different perspectives that have been implicitly adopted in several subsequent studies a considering resilience as a goal of risk management ongkowwijoyo and doloi 2018 serre and heinzlef 2018 b considering it as part of risk management hoque et al 2012 kammouh et al 2017 mitchell and harris 2012 shafieezadeh and burden 2014 and c considering it as an alternative complementary to risk management homeland security studies and analysis institute 2010 joyce et al 2018 kammouh et al 2017 park et al 2013 the latter argues that risk and resilience are differentiable concepts but interrelated complementary mutually reinforcing and could be coupled to improve adaptive capacity of engineering systems whilst risk and resilience have previously been compared conceptually e g aven 2011 baum 2015 there are many ways in which each term can be formulated depending on the reliability of what risk to what from what and resilience of what to what and the relationships will differ depending on the formulations used it is recognised that resilience for example can exist at different scales time periods and systems and there may be trade offs between these which are key to the assessment and management of resilience chelleri et al 2015 however the multiple different ways in which resilience can be formulated have not previously been formalised risk has previously been decomposed using a matrix approach to show the links between multiple initiating events intermediate states and final damage states kaplan et al 1983 but analysis of specific formulations was not carried out the current lack of understanding of all the ways in which reliability risk and resilience can be formulated within the same framework poses a barrier to a comprehensive understanding of their relationships and comparison on a like for like basis urban wastewater system studies have typically aimed to reduce level of service failures under design conditions i e increase reliability e g juznic zonta et al 2012 oliveira and von sperling 2008 and there has also been research into risk e g astaraie imani et al 2012 and resilience e g matthews 2016 schoen et al 2015 scott et al 2012 individually resilience analysis can provide additional understanding of wastewater system performance provide greater scope than risk analysis and account for a wider range of threats particularly those that are low probability and high impact it can also provide greater insight into the failure characteristics since it is commonly assumed to be dependent on both the magnitude and duration of failures butler et al 2016 mugume et al 2015 there is also an increasing interest in building resilience in practice as evidenced for example by the resilience duty imposed in the uk water act hm government 2014 and the rapid growth in the publication of papers relating to resilience in a range of fields juan garcía et al 2017 conducted a comprehensive and critical review of the state of the art in resilience assessment in wastewater systems management and defined future research directions that will contribute to the operationalisation of resilience however the relationship between risk and resilience and whether for example resilience analysis can replace risk assessment is still unclear with respect to reliability risk and resilience there is a lack of studies on wastewater systems that consider all three metrics as separate criteria for design and operation and explore their relationships both conceptually and quantitatively wang and blackmore 2012 calculated separate values for each however these were for a rainwater harvesting system and whilst they were all used to inform the design process the relationships between the performance measures was not explored other publications focusing on different water systems have also not evaluated all three metric and or explored their relationships in a quantitative manner blackmore and plant 2008 for example discussed the differences between risk management and resilience approaches but did not explore these in a case study and did not undertake a quantitative analysis reliability was not discussed in other studies that have used a case study and provided a quantitative analysis e g su et al 2018 resilience has been considered a component of risk assessment separate risk and resilience values have not been computed and risk and resilience have not been compared this paper therefore presents an innovative framework to explore the relationships between reliability risk and resilience levels provided by multiple operational control and design options for a case study integrated urban wastewater system iuws sewer catchment wastewater treatment plant and receiving river considered as a whole in this the multiple ways in which reliability risk and resilience can be formulated are captured and formalised in a single framework for the first time and the potential advantages or disadvantages of each formulation are investigated the framework also reveals the prerequisite knowledge required for calculations under each formulation clearly illustrating the differences between what can be addressed by reliability risk and resilience assessments this research builds upon the safe sure framework butler et al 2016 which shows how threats to a water system can result in consequences for society the economy and the environment to enable the formulations to be derived in a logical manner and to ensure consistency in any comparisons this paper does not aim to quantify the correlations between reliability risk and resilience in a general sense although numerical values specific to the case study are presented and discussed as the numerical values will vary depending on the system evaluated however formalisation of the conceptual formulations of each measure illustrates the overlap in what is addressed by each as well as the differences the conceptual decomposition of reliability risk and resilience into all their possible formulations provided in this study enables future analyses to be placed within the wider picture ensuring that any comparisons are made on a suitable basis and using compatible formulations the results also highlight the gaps in many analyses of risk and resilience showing that commonly used formulations address only a small fraction of the possibilities means by which a more comprehensive assessment of a system s response to threats can be achieved are also identified this research complements the increasing number of projects and initiatives focused on resilience including for example the 100 resilient cities initiative rockefeller foundation 2018 the eu funded improver improver 2018 and resilens resilens 2018 projects the epsrc funded brim network brim 2018 and the resilience shift project funded by lloyd s register foundation resilience shift 2018 and contributes to the rapidly growing body of research in this field the proposed methodology could also be applied to other types of integrated systems analysis e g water energy food waste climate etc and contribute to future developments in these areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 formulating reliability risk and resilience in the safe sure framework for reliability risk and resilience to be fully defined it is necessary to specify reliability of what risk to what from what and resilience of what or resilience of what to what i e where the failure and causal event characteristics are measured this study builds upon the safe sure framework as illustrated in fig 1 to show the potential failures and their causal events there are many options and combinations that can be chosen and all are identified before selection of a set that enables comparable reliability risk and resilience values to be calculated for the case study iuws in the safe sure framework threats are stresses or shocks which may affect the system infrastructure e g a storm event and can be reduced by mitigation measures impacts are the effects on level of service resulting from system failures e g pump failure and may be reduced with adaptation measures and consequences are the effects on society the economy and the environment resulting from the impacts e g eutrophication and may be reduced with coping strategies an event which may result in a failure could be a threat a system failure or a change in level of service provision an impact failure could refer to the adverse effects of an event on the system e g physical failure of system components level of service i e failure to provide the required level of service or on the society economy and environment i e adverse consequences in the safe sure framework threats system failure states impacts and consequences are each presented as a single component however these can all be further categorised as known or unknown depending on whether or not there is knowledge of their potential existence prior to their occurrence known event types include both known knowns and known unknowns where known knowns are well understood and their characteristics identified and known unknowns poorly understood but known to exist illustrated in fig 2 attempts to quantify known unknowns may be based on past experience but are subject to uncertainty unknowns cannot be characterised since their existence is not recognised whilst their existence has been acknowledged unknown threats and unknown consequences have not previously been considered explicitly or in detail in the safe sure framework butler et al 2016 including these two elements in following formulation of reliability risk and resilience is an important step forward as it facilitates a detailed understanding of all the elements that contribute to of reliability risk and resilience and shows the interdependencies between known and unknown threats known system failure modes known impacts and known and unknown consequences it also clearly illustrates the challenges in providing a comprehensive assessment both known and unknown threats t k and t u and consequences c k and c u exist however it is reasonably assumed that for a well characterised iuws all potential system failure states s k can be identified i e there are no unknowns and the number of knowns is finite all types of potential impact i k are also known since these are based on pre defined level of service requirements the interdependencies of these components are shown in fig 1 known system failure states result from both known and unknown threats known impacts results from known system failure states only and known impacts can result in both known and unknown consequences note that threat system failure state impact and consequence refer only to the type of event each of which can encompass a range of different magnitude and duration events of that type for example population growth is one potential threat but this might be 10 or 100 although all potential types of system failure and impact are known their characteristics are unknown if the cause is not specified due to the chain of events shown in fig 1 all consequences impacts and system failure states are ultimately affected by both known and unknown threats and hence their characteristics cannot be fully defined while the types of impact for example are all known the probability magnitude and duration of these in a general sense cannot be determined since they are partly dependent on unknown threats it is only possible to determine the probability magnitude and duration of impacts under specified system failures and or specified known threats a summary of potential events and failures and their characteristics as may be considered components of reliability risk and resilience is given in table 1 note that knowledge of the probability distribution function magnitudes and durations may be incomplete even for known threats due to the existence of unknown unknowns also known probabilities cannot reasonably cover the complete range of event scales that are theoretically possible since there is likely to be very little data from which a frequency distribution can be derived for particularly rare events wang and blackmore 2009 calculation of joint probabilities of two or more major events occurring simultaneously poses an even greater challenge park et al 2013 although many possible formulations of reliability risk and resilience exist performance metrics can only be calculated for those which do not require knowledge of unknown failure or causal event types or unknown characteristics probability magnitude and duration the following sections therefore investigate the components and pre requisite knowledge required for all formulations possible within the safe sure framework to enable identification of those that can and cannot be calculated theoretically and facilitate investigation into the relationships between reliability risk and resilience 2 1 1 reliability reliability rel is defined here as the degree to which the system minimises level of service failure frequency over its design life when subject to standard loading butler et al 2017 it is typically represented by the probability of success or probability of a system being in a non failure state hashimoto et al 1982 kjeldsen and rosbjerg 2004 as in eq 1 1 r e l 1 p f a i l u r e in order to calculate reliability it is necessary to specify where the failure state is measured i e reliability of what based on the definition given this should be the level of service impact however there are further options such as reliability of a specific system component and given their common usage it is useful to identify these too using the safe sure framework and components identified in fig 1 reliability can be formulated in six ways as detailed in table 2 not all reliability measures detailed are useful it is unclear what would represent a failure with respect to the society economy environment and formulations r5 and r6 are unlikely to be used in practice however provided failure limits can be defined reliability is theoretically calculable using any of the formulations listed since it addresses only performance under standard loading i e known knowns any event which is rare enough to be a known unknown or completely unknown is not considered standard 2 1 2 resilience the safe sure definition of resilience the degree to which the system minimises level of service failure magnitude and duration over its design life when subject to exceptional conditions butler et al 2017 is used in this study this contains two components failure magnitude and failure duration it is not necessary to know what causes the failure although it may be specified since the probability dimension as used in risk assessment is not conventionally included in resilience aven 2011 resilience can be specified or general for general resilience the resilience of any and all parts of a system to all kinds of shocks including novel ones folke et al 2010 it is necessary to specify resilience of what i e where the failure is measured this encompasses the response to all future threats including those which are unknown and unforeseeable resilience of an iuws for example is a measure of the magnitude and duration of effects on the iuws resulting from any threat including those that cannot be foreseen for specified resilience resilience of some particular part of a system to one or more identified kinds of shocks folke et al 2010 resilience of what to what i e where the failure state is measured and what the causal event considered is must be specified an example would be resilience of an iuws to storm events in which the magnitude and duration of the effects of the storm events on the iuws determine the resilience value possible points in the safe sure framework which the failure magnitude and duration may relate to are shown in fig 3 in fig 3a the cause of the failure causal event is specified these formulations therefore relate to specified resilience general resilience uses the formulations in fig 3b since the failures here can result from anything resilience cannot be calculated in formulations in which the magnitude and duration of the failure are unknown however knowledge of the probability of the causal event is not required therefore resilience can theoretically be calculated under twelve different formulations s1 s2 s4 and s7 s12 in fig 3a and g2 and g5 g6 in fig 3b haimes 2009 argues that general resilience cannot be calculated since it requires knowledge of the response to any threat but this is not always the case resilience cannot be calculated under formulation g3 resilience of society economy and the environment as this requires knowledge of unknown consequences and g1 and g4 resilience of system and resilience of specified system component are also incalculable since not all threats which may cause system failures are known however the framework presented illustrates that general resilience can be calculated through a middle state based analysis as in g2 and g5 as both known and unknown threats result in the same known finite set of system failure modes take for example formulation g2 resilience of level of service this may be modelled as resilience of level of service to any threat which cannot be calculated since not all threats are known but also as resilience of level of service to any system failure which can be calculated as all the modes by which the system may fail are identifiable what threat known or unknown causes them is irrelevant since by evaluating all system failure modes the potential effects of all threats are captured multiple threats can thus be addressed with analysis of a smaller number of system failure modes traditionally resilience has focussed on the failure of assets however asset failure may not necessarily affect level of service provision and may be irrelevant from a consumer perspective ofwat 2010 this suggests that although formulation s1 may be of interest to the asset owners an impact or consequence based approach such as g5 or g6 is of greater benefit similar applies to reliability and risk 2 1 3 risk definitions and use of the term risk are inconsistent whilst risk is conventionally calculated as a function of probability and consequence of a given scenario kaplan and garrick 1981 often in practice the severity of the resultant adverse effects are not accounted for konstantinou et al 2011 for example defined risk as the conditional probability of incurring loss or damage under certain unfavourable circumstances and in terms of practical application the environment agency s flood risk maps environment agency 2018 show only the probability of flooding with no indication of severity such an approach may be acceptable when knowledge of the degree of the damage is not required e g if knowing simply whether or not flooding occurs irrespective of depth is sufficient however it is also argued that risk should provide a measure of the potential losses or adverse effects scholz et al 2011 and it is generally quantified using a function of event frequency and effect magnitude blackmore and plant 2008 this is the interpretation used in this work the following equation adapted from the typical probability x consequence to fit the terminology of this study is used here to represent risk 2 r i s k p c a s u a l e v e n t m a g n i t u d e f a i l u r e in calculation of risk the casual event probability and failure magnitude could be measured at different locations for example when calculating the risk of a combined sewer overflow cso resulting from a storm event failure could refer to either the occurrence of a cso or the occurrence of deterioration in the receiving water body quality in the case of the former the causal event could be considered the storm event whereas for the latter either the storm event or the cso could be considered as the causal event hence for absolute clarity it is necessary to specify risk to what from what i e where the effect is measured and the potential cause of that considered for conventional risk calculation both the probability of the causal event and the magnitude of its effects the failure need to be known and measurable accordingly fig 3 illustrates all potential combinations of failure and causal event within the safe sure framework and identifies those which result in a calculable risk formulation similarly to resilience risk formulations in which a specific causal event is identified may be classified as specified risk and those which address risk from any known or unknown event can be classified as general risk risk cannot be calculated in formulations which include unknown threats in the causal events i e the general formulations g1 g6 in fig 3b since by definition these cannot be characterised this is in contrast to resilience where it is not necessary to know for example the probability of the events that may result in failures similarly risk cannot be calculated in formulations that include unknown consequences in the measured failures i e formulations s3 s6 s9 and s11 in fig 3a and g3 in fig 3b furthermore risk cannot be calculated if the required causal event probability or failure magnitude is unknown despite the existence of the causal event or failure type being known formulations s10 and s12 in fig 3a this leaves five formulations s1 s2 and s7s9 in fig 3a under which risk may be calculated in the safe sure framework further details including equations for each formulation are provided in the supplementary information 2 2 conceptual relationships 2 2 1 reliability and risk there is widely assumed to be a connection between reliability and risk however the nature of this relationship is less clear some consider increasing reliability to be analogous to decreasing risk for example with high risk equating to low reliability konstantinou et al 2011 however others consider reliability a contributor to risk as it contributes to the probability of failure but is not the only component zio 2013 this corresponds with the risk assessment approach of kjeldsen and rosbjerg 2004 and suggests that although increasing reliability may contribute to a reduction in risk other factors must also be considered 2 2 2 reliability and resilience reliability may be considered a prerequisite and or a component of resilience butler et al 2017 francis and bekera 2014 or alternatively a complementary performance indicator e g kjeldsen and rosbjerg 2004 as for risk this suggests that increasing reliability may contribute to efforts to increase resilience but additional measures are also required 2 2 3 risk and resilience resilience is differentiable from but complementary to risk analysis park et al 2013 however there is often overlap and confusion in use of the two terms and resilience analysis in practice is commonly based on the concept of risk the overseas development institute mitchell and harris 2012 for example have published a risk management approach to resilience and halcrow 2008 have produced a service risk framework for assessment of resilience fig 3 highlights the broader scope of resilience assessment risk can only be calculated under five of the eighteen possible formulations and cannot account for unknown threats whereas resilience can be calculated under nine including all for which risk can be calculated risk cannot be calculated under formulations s4 and s10 12 amongst others since these require knowledge of probabilities that cannot be determined p sk x and p ik y despite the event type being specified and known in these cases its probability is not known as it may occur as a result of unknown threats the probabilities of which are not known resilience can be calculated under formulations s4 and s10 12 however since this does not require knowledge of the probability of the event s resulting in failure risk cannot be calculated under the formulations used for general resilience g2 g5 or g6 since knowledge of the probability of unknown threats is required in every case even if the probability can be expressed as the probability of infrastructure failure or probability of level of service failure as in g6 for example it is still affected by unknown threats and cannot be calculated to be calculable risk must be specified general resilience formulations could be considered more useful for detailed system analysis since they include a measure of the response to any threat including unknowns but they are also more challenging to calculate for this very reason 2 2 4 reliability risk and resilience based on the definitions and discussion in section 2 1 the conceptual relationships between reliability risk and resilience with respect to the probability and magnitude of events addressed are presented graphically in fig 4 reliability concerns performance under standard loading which will typically cover the relatively low magnitude high probability events which are expected to occur within the system s design life risk can address more extreme events with a lower probability and higher magnitude but still cannot deal with events that are considered too unlikely to be assigned a probability with any degree of certainty or events that cannot be foreseen resilience can address the same events as risk assessment but as it is not necessary to know the probability can also consider the system response to and recovery from much more extreme events including so called black swans which although highly unlikely may occur 2 3 integrated urban wastewater system case study 2 3 1 case study the case study iuws used shown diagrammatically in fig 5 is a semi hypothetical system that was originally presented by schütze et al 2002 and has since been the subject of many studies e g butler and schütze 2005 fu et al 2008 zacharof et al 2004 it comprises a sewer system a wastewater treatment plant with an off line pass through storage tank at the inlet and a river of which 45 km is modelled it was simulated using simba6 ifak 2009 it should be noted that as the model is of a semi hypothetical system and risk and resilience assessments are based on the modelling of extreme events including those that have not previously happened the complete integrated model cannot be calibrated and the results cannot be validated using data from real events performance evaluation is based on simulation of a seven day rainfall event with a total depth of 27 mm dynamic outputs used are the dissolved oxygen do and ammonium concentrations in the river un ionised ammonium concentration is estimated from the total ammonium using a conversion factor of 0 0195 based on a ph of 7 7 and a temperature of 20 c schütze et al 2002 further details on the iuws model simulation are given by astaraie imani et al 2012 ten operational control and design parameters detailed in table 3 are used as decision variables and sampled using latin hypercube sampling to produce a set of 400 options for evaluation in this study these parameters include four sewer storage tank volumes maximum pumped outflow from each storage tank above which csos occur maximum flow to the wastewater treatment plant wwtp and the wwtp influent threshold triggering emptying of the storm tank upper and lower limits for operational decision variables are extended beyond those typically considered so as to provide a greater range of reliability risk and resilience values it is recognised that this approach may produce many solutions with poor performance however it should also yield options providing a high level of performance and it is important that a wide range is captured so as to gain a more complete picture of the relationships between reliability risk and resilience 2 3 2 reliability risk and resilience formulation in order that reliability risk and resilience can be compared it is important that compatible formulations are used for each for risk and resilience formulation s2 risk to level of service from specified threat and resilience of level of service to specified threat is chosen since this requires no knowledge of unknowns and can be calculated for reliability the corresponding formulation is r4 reliability of level of service provision all require measures of failure characteristics and must therefore consider the same level of service requirements to be comparable in all formulations receiving water quality represents the level of service and level of service failure is classified as the occurrence of a do concentration less than 4 mg l fu et al 2008 and or an un ionised ammonia concentration greater than 0 068 mg l johnson et al 2007 the specified threat considered for risk and resilience is population increase which is modelled as an increase in dry weather flow dwf the reliability risk and resilience values calculated can therefore be explicitly defined as follows reliability of receiving water quality compliance risk to receiving water quality from population increase by 2035 resilience of receiving water quality to population increase note that it is necessary to define the time frame for risk assessment since population increase probabilities are time dependent the measured failure characteristics will be different in each case as each must consider different causal event scenarios reliability relates to failures under standard loading whereas risk relates to failures under foreseeable conditions and resilience relates to failures under exceptional conditions it is acknowledged that use of a resilience formulation which incorporates response to unknowns e g g2 would be preferable however this would not allow risk to be calculated and compared on a like for like basis 2 3 3 reliability risk and resilience assessment a brief description of the assessment methodologies is provided here further detail is available in the supporting information 2 3 3 1 iuws reliability assessment reliability is assessed under standard conditions i e no population increase using eq 1 where the probability of failure is based on the modelled level of service failure duration 2 3 3 2 iuws risk assessment risk is evaluated for population increases of 0 15 at 1 5 intervals using eq 2 in each case the probability of population growth equalling or exceeding the given value is calculated based on 95 prediction intervals reported by the united nations raftery et al 2012 united nations 2012 for the uk population in 2035 assuming a normal distribution the greater of the normalised do deficit and normalised un ionised ammonia exceedance represents the failure magnitude this yields 16 risk values for each iuws operational control and design option the highest of which is used in the following analysis 2 3 3 3 iuws resilience assessment assessment of resilience is based on the concept of using a response curve system performance as a function of disturbance magnitude for comparison of solutions diao et al 2016 mugume et al 2015 where the area under the curve provides a measure of resilience to capture both the magnitude and duration components of resilience failure characteristics are measured using two metrics p deficit based on mean performance deficit and p duration mean based on mean failure duration each of which are calculated for population changes in the range 0 150 this yields two resilience indicators for each option r deficit and r duration mean 3 results and discussion 3 1 reliability risk and resilience relationships fig 6 shows the relationships between reliability risk and resilience for the 400 iuws operational control and design options evaluated each circle represents a different option the colour of the circle represents its reliability value and its x and y coordinates show its risk and resilience values respectively fig 6a utilises the resilience indicator based on mean performance deficit and fig 6b the resilience indicator based on mean failure duration fig 6 shows that an increase in reliability typically corresponds with reduced risk and increased resilience in this system for the reliability risk and resilience formulations considered r 0 91 for reliability and risk r 0 97 for reliability and r deficit and r 0 95 for reliability and r duration mean however most levels of reliability can be achieved with a range of different risk and resilience values showing the importance of considering performance under extreme conditions as well as standard loading additionally risk and resilience values shown in fig 6 reveal a correlation r 0 92 for risk and r deficit r 0 83 for risk and r duration mean but they are not directly proportional hence risk assessment cannot be considered a substitute for resilience assessment with respect to the system design and operational control it is desirable that the same option provides the highest reliability lowest risk and highest resilience this section explores the feasibility of this goal and the observed relationships between reliability risk and resilience 3 1 1 high reliability options in fig 6b reliability greater than 0 999 can be achieved with 30 operational control and design options yet the resilience r duration mean values of these options range from 0 85 to 0 92 this is attributed to variation in the do failure characteristics resulting from the different design and operational control options whilst the do failures are observed with a 15 population increase in the lower resilience option do failures in the higher resilience option are not recorded until population increase reaches 45 and are then of significantly shorter magnitude and duration 3 1 2 high reliability low risk options in fig 6b resilience r duration mean values range from 0 87 to 0 92 for options with reliability greater than 0 999 and risk below 0 001 this indicates that there is significant variation in the resilience of options providing low risk and high reliability particularly noticeable with the r duration mean resilience indicator therefore these results demonstrate that when selecting design and operational control options for an iuws high reliability and low risk are necessary criteria but not sufficient for high resilience resilience must be considered as a third and separate objective if in this case study no benefit of considering the three performance measures as separate objectives had been found this would not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that in the wider sense reliability risk and resilience do not all need to be considered in the design and operation of iuwss however the observation here that they cannot be used interchangeably is sufficient to demonstrate that the highest reliability and lowest risk options do not necessarily provide the highest resilience 3 1 3 high resilience options fig 6a and b also show that there can be significant variation in the risk and reliability values for options providing a given level of resilience for example in fig 5b options providing a resilience r duration mean value of 0 85 have reliability values in the range 0 910 1 000 and risk values in the range 0 023 0 176 this suggests that consideration of greatest resilience alone is insufficient and reliability and or risk must also be evaluated to ensure that the chosen option performs well under a wide range of conditions including standard loading this observation is particularly important when it is not possible to implement the option providing the greatest resilience e g due to cost restraints as there is greater range in risk and reliability for lower resilience options the different levels of resilience risk and reliability provided by each option are attributed to adjustment in the decision variables presented in table 3 when analysing the options providing a resilience r duration mean value of 0 85 as above the option providing highest reliability and lowest risk has larger values for qmaxin qst2 qst4 and qst6 this will result in a smaller volume of csos from subcatchments 1 4 and 7 as well as a greater volume of wastewater being treated thereby resulting in higher receiving water quality under standard conditions however it only provides the same level of resilience as that provided by a less reliable option with greater csos and less wastewater treated whereas it would intuitively be expected to provide higher resilience than a less reliable option this may be attributed to it resulting in a greater impact on level of service under extreme population increase as the surcharged wwtp performs poorly and low quality discharge is concentrated at the wwtp outlet instead of distributed along the river by csos 3 2 reliability risk and resilience based design most operational control and design options shown in fig 6 do not represent realistic solutions given their poor performance even under standard loading design conditions further analysis therefore focuses on those which provide good performance under the base case population i e have high reliability example response curves for three options which provide a reliability of at least 0 999 are shown in fig 7 the first grey line provides a high degree of reliability only the second black line is also low risk risk 0 001 and the third bold dashed line is the option that provides the highest level of resilience whilst also providing high reliability and low risk these show that a high degree of reliability does not guarantee good performance under disturbances consideration of risk improves the response but resilience assessment is required to ensure the chosen option performs well with respect to alternatives when water quality failures do occur the difference between reliability risk and resilience based iuws design is most marked in fig 7b where the control and design option resulting in the greatest do deficit minimum do concentration under any level of population increase has high reliability but not low risk and the most resilient solution maintains the highest do concentration minimises the failure magnitude under any population increase to illustrate the potential differences between reliability risk and resilience based design the decision variable values of the three different options are shown in fig 8 the high reliability option provides a receiving water quality compliance reliability of 1 000 risk to receiving water quality from population increase of 0 023 and a receiving water quality resilience to population increase r duration mean of 0 853 the high reliability and low risk option has reliability risk and resilience values of 1 000 0 000 and 0 868 respectively and in the high resilience option the resilience r duration mean is increased to 0 922 it is shown that whilst there are similarities between the three options most notably in qmaxin and vst7 the characteristics of the operational control and design option providing high resilience differ from those providing just high reliability for example high reliability can be achieved with an increase in storage volume of 23 31 vst2 vst4 vst6 and vst7 however significantly greater increase in storage volume is required to provide the highest level of resilience this suggests that identification of preferable design and operational control options taking into account reliability risk and resilience requires an understanding of the mechanism of failure minimisation i e how the different options reduce the frequency magnitude and duration of failure and that there may be cost implications of increasing resilience e g due to extra storage required note that observations on the relationships between reliability risk and resilience in the iuws case study are based on a formulation of resilience that addresses only one known threat the capability of a middle state based resilience assessment to address multiple threats including unknowns as in formulation g2 for example has not been exploited the benefits of a high resilience approach over a low risk approach are expected to be greater if resilience is calculated using a formulation under which risk is incalculable e g s4 s10 or g2 but demonstrating the benefits is challenging if they are not observable until the occurrence of a previously unknown threat even under risk and resilience formulation s2 however it is shown that failure magnitude and duration under a specified threat can be significantly reduced by considering resilience in addition to risk 4 conclusions this research has explored the ways in which reliability risk and resilience may be formulated identifying possible components and knowledge required for calculation of each and formalising the conceptual relationships between specified and general resilience a set of corresponding formulations has also been implemented in a case study iuws to enable investigation into the relationships between reliability risk and resilience for this system the following conclusions are drawn many formulations of both general and specified risk and resilience exist but not all can be calculated due to the existence of unknown threats and unknown consequences general resilience can theoretically be calculated under some formulations whereas general risk cannot resilience can therefore address responses to a wider range of threats all threats including both known and unknown can be addressed with a middle state based resilience analysis which focusses on the level of service response to system failures risk cannot be calculated on the same basis since the probability of system failure is affected by the probability of unknown threats consideration of resilience in addition to risk can be beneficial even when only considering specified threats as demonstrated in the case study lowest risk solutions do not necessarily provide the highest specified resilience although reliability risk and resilience values may exhibit correlations

storage capacity of the nation was the greatest rate after 2000 because of the completion of massive reservoirs such as the three gorges dam yang and lu 2013 the boom in reservoir construction is a

spatial resolution were used and these tm etm images are mainly acquired after the monsoon season september october in the period 2005 to 2008 the statistical areas include reservoirs and lakes with surfaces greater than 0 0036 km2 the surfaces of lakes with flux data are larger than 0 01 km2 lakes with an area less than 0 01 km2 have a cumulative surface area of 540 km2 accounting for approximately 0 66 of total lake surface area and reservoirs with an area less than 0 01 km2 have a combined surface area of 144 km2 accounting for 0 54 of total reservoir surface area in china yang and lu 2013 thus ghgs fluxes from these very small ponds could be negligible because of their minor contribution to total surfaces albeit recent report demonstrated higher ghgs areal fluxes from small ponds holgerson and raymond 2016 co2 equivalents are a widely recognized tool for comparing ghgs the total ghg footprints were calculated by converting ch4 and n2o emissions to co2 equivalents and summing with the co2 emission results myhre et al 2013 we supplied detailed information on data quality control water air interface ghgs areal fluxes calculations and uncertainty analyses in the supplementary material we here highlighted the key parameter ph for co2 fluxes uncertainty samples for co2 fluxes estimated from ph and alkalinity had ph average of 8 12 0 40 median 8 20 with quartiles of 7 90 8 40 n 79 for reservoirs while ph in lakes averaged 8 40 0 86 with a median of 8 26 quartiles 7 83 9 02 n 255 thus overestimation of calculated co2 areal flux from ph and alkalinity is likely to be minor abril et al 2015 2 3 statistical analyses relationships between ghgs fluxes and physicochemical variables were examined by means of linear and exponential regressions spearman s rho was also provided see supplementary information variables with non normal distribution were log transformed to approach normality for data sets containing negative gaseous fluxes negative sign represents net carbon sink we added a constant to get the regression model through log transformation a constant of 1000 was added for reservoir co2 areal flux 500 for lake co2 and 5 for lake ch4 we used stepwise multiple regressions to identify which variables explained the variance in co2 and ch4 emission rates and used p 0 05 for the significance probability for each control variable however a limited number of n2o emission rates prevented the use of regression analyses all statistical analyses were carried out using spss 16 0 and sigmaplot 11 0 95 confidence intervals ci were used to present uncertainties of estimates of ghgs fluxes we separated the waterbodies into categories of reservoirs and lakes reservoirs were further separated into pelagic and drawdown areas lakes were categorized into five geographic zones and pelagic and littoral areas fig 1 then national estimates were obtained by upscaling the average emissions for those categories 3 results 3 1 reservoir ghgs

emission table 1 our newly estimated ch4 emission was 1 7 fold higher than the previous ch4 estimate from china s reservoirs table 2 which was likely due to our more complete coverage of data and inclusion of high emission rates particularly in drawdown areas the majority 72 of co2 equivalents from reservoirs occurred as co2 while ch4 and n2o were responsible for 15 and 13 of radiative forcing

test fig 3 with high average of ch4 in tpl where lakes are mostly rich in doc at the high altitude and high average of co2 in npml where lakes are mostly effected by carbon rich wetlands at the high

supplementary table s3 generally lakes had lower fluxes of co2 and n2o but higher ch4 fluxes relative to reservoirs table 1 lake littoral zones had distinctly higher ghgs areal fluxes than the pelagic zones fig 3 supplementary table s4 in average littoral zones showed 5 fold higher mean ch4 emission rate 2 6 fold higher co2 and 7 4 fold higher n2o than open waters table 1 for the different geographic zones of lakes the maximal ratio of ghgs emission rate in littoral zones to pelagic areas was 7 4 for co2 imxl 10 9 for ch4 tpl and 13 4 for n2o tpl respectively table 1 we also found distinct differences in emission rates of the three ghgs between lake littoral areas and reservoir drawdown zones p 0 05 by mann whitney rank sum test table s4 albeit comparable mean areal n2o fluxes were observed 2 63 6 40 vs 2 17 1 78 mg n n2o m2 d for reservoir drawdown and lake littoral respectively table 1 we estimated that lake pelagic areas emitted 0 96 95 ci 0 57 1 36 tg c ch4 y 10 2 6 6

larger than the littoral area lake pelagic n2o emission however was around 72 of the littoral emission table 1 highest emissions of ghgs occurred in tpl while ygpl had the lowest ranging from 1 74 1

tg c ch4 y of emissions from very limited data table 2 yang et al 2011a chen et al 2013 the earlier higher estimate of china s lake methane emissions was based on several extremely high measurements yang et al 2011a in contrast to reservoirs the majority of co2 equivalents from lakes occurred as ch4 50 and co2 45 and n2o was responsible for 5 of radiative forcing respectively over a 100 year timeframe we combined lake littoral and pelagic areas into individual lake geographical zones to minimize the effects of the limited lake littoral data table 4 tpl and ygpl respectively showed the

of ghgs areal fluxes of china s reservoirs and lakes we collated lake and reservoirs characteristics that may explain ghgs fluxes similar to other climate zones such as arctic and boreal biomes complex interactions of biological processes trophic status hydro climatological factors and organic matter are believed to drive ghgs emissions from china s reservoirs and lakes supplementary table s5 bastviken et al 2004 rantakari and kortelainen 2005 2008 humborg et al 2010 halbedel and koschorreck 2013 regression models for n2o were not attempted due to the small n2o dataset available the areal emissions of ch4 from reservoirs had most significant correlations with air and surface water temperature when multiple biotic and abiotic variables were tested p 0 05 table s5 this implies ch4 production in anoxic sediments usually the main methane source to lakes and reservoirs is primarily controlled by temperature as observed elsewhere gudasz et al 2010 marotta et al 2014 wang et al 2014 also many of china s reservoirs have gorge type topography where deep water depth facilitates ch4 oxidation bastviken et al 2004 delsontro et al 2011 xiao et al 2013 as indicated separately by the significant negative associations between spatial heterogeneity in ch4 areal fluxes and water depth in the two typical reservoirs yang et al 2011b zheng et al 2011 the areal fluxes of co2 from reservoirs were positively correlated to air temperature total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp but negatively correlated with chlorophyll a chl a dissolved oxygen do and ph supplementary table s5 prior studies also reported strong positive correlations between nutrients and co2 emissions rantakari and kortelainen 2008 teodoru et al 2009 the negative correlation between co2 emission and do concentration could indicate in situ respiration of organic c as an important source of the co2 supersaturation that drives emissions however this negative correlation is concurrently controlled by photosynthesis producing do and consuming co2 thus lowering co2 supersaturation and co2 emissions as well as increasing ph we further identified new predictors of ghgs areal fluxes using a multiple regression model the most robust multiple regression model for the reservoir co2 emission rate included tp and chla as independent variables and explained 40 of the variation in co2 fluxes the model for areal ch4 fluxes included tp do and air temperature and explained 36 of variations in ch4 flux supplementary table s6 like the ghgs emission rates of reservoirs that were predicted using nutrients and productivity lake ch4 areal flux was predicted by tp doc and chl a and co2 areal flux by tp 49 and 33 of variances are explained respectively supplementary table s6 3 4 upscaling ghgs emissions from china s reservoirs and lakes clearly reservoirs and lakes in china are important ghg sources lakes have 9 3 fold greater ch4 fluxes and 1 7 fold greater co2 fluxes than reservoirs whereas lakes and reservoirs have comparable n2o fluxes combined the total estimated emissions of ch4 1 56 tg c ch4 y 95 ci 1 12 2 00 co2 25 2 tg c co2 y 95 ci 20 8 29 5 and n2o 25 5 gg n n2o y 95 ci 16 6 34 4 from reservoirs and lakes account for 3 9 1 6 and 1 2 of anthropogenic ch4 co2 and n2o emissions in china tables 2 and 3 our data implies emissions of 202 6 95 ci 106 8 298 5 tg co2 equivalent per year if littoral zone and pelagic zone are combined tables 1 and 4 and 175 0 95 ci 134 7 215 3 tg co2 equivalent per year if the two zones are separated table 3 in 100 year horizon for lakes and reservoirs 73 4 of total radiative forcing contributed by lakes translating into the global warming potential of ch4 co2 and n2o tables 1 and 3 this is equal to about 14 1 22 6 of the estimated terrestrial carbon sink of china 260 90 tg c co2 y piao et al 2009 tian et al 2011 this indicates that large amounts of the estimated land co2 sink is returned to the atmosphere through reservoirs and lakes therefore our results indicate that china s lakes and reservoirs are a disproportionately high contributor of ghgs given their minor contribution ca 1 1 to the china s land surface 4 discussion 4 1 implications of chinese inland water ghg emission on global budgets our new estimates of china s reservoir diffusive ghgs emissions contributed significantly to ghgs budgets in the temperate zone diffusion driven annual ch4 emission from china s reservoirs represented 21 6 34 8 of the total emissions from temperate reservoirs comparable to the area proportion 21 of china s reservoirs to the temperate biome table 2 the total annual emission of co2 from china s reservoirs made up 61 78 of the temperate reservoir co2 flux more than 3 fold higher than its proportion of surface area st louis et al 2000 hertwich 2013 table 2 annual n2o emissions comprised 35 5 of the reservoir n2o emission in the usa much lower than the ratio of reservoir surface area in china 26870 km2 to usa 27600 km2 baron et al 2013 if we incorporated the more recent reservoir data in the temperate biome deemer et al 2016 there were no significant differences in co2 and ch4 diffusive areal fluxes between china s reservoirs and temperate reservoirs including china or excluding china p 0 05 by mann whitney rank sum test while reservoir n2o emission rate was significantly higher in china than in the temperate biome fig 4 in total ghgs emissions from china s lakes and reservoirs expressed co2 equivalents accounted for 2 5 3 8 of global lakes and reservoirs combined 1 25 2 30 pg c co2eq y comparable to the surface area proportion 2 0 3 4 of lakes and reservoirs in china to globe delsontro et al 2018 we found that reservoir pelagic areal fluxes of co2 and n2o in china were higher than or at least proximate to global estimates table 2 the lower pelagic areal ch4 emissions one tenth of the global averages table 2 can be explained by the omission of ebullitive fluxes i e ebullition may exceed diffusion by 2 4 3 4 fold delsontro et al 2018 and a preponderance of high ch4 flux estimates in tropical reservoirs or other temperate areas outside of china st louis et al 2000 deemer et al 2016 our findings are consistent with the common view that low latitude reservoirs have higher ch4 emission rates than the reservoirs in the temperate biome albeit high emission rates were reported in the mid latitude reservoirs in north america europe and australia deemer et al 2016 mean areal fluxes of ghgs would be 1 3 4 2 fold higher in temperate reservoirs including china 9 23 28 39 mg c ch4 m2 d 440 89 664 76 mg c co2 m2 d 0 60 0 14 n n2o m2 d than temperate reservoirs excluding china 7 18 13 87 mg c ch4 m2 d 293 96 370 79 mg c co2 m2 d 0 14 0 31 n n2o m2 d fig 4 consequently ghg emissions from temperate reservoirs could be revised to be 0 40 1 24 95 ci 0 23 0 58 tg c ch4 y as diffusion 19 31 29 12 95 ci 16 40 22 22 tg c co2 y and 26 2 49 8 95 ci 14 4 38 0 gg n n2o y therefore our comprehensive analysis of ghgs emissions from chinee reservoirs demonstrated that previous estimates based largely on european and north american systems likely underestimated inland water s contribution to global ghgs budgets and highlights the need of including more data from china and other under sampled areas in developing countries in global upscaling exercises for lakes our estimated ch4 flux accounted for 39 of the total ch4 emissions from the temperate zone which was 6 3 fold higher than china s lakes proportion of surface area table 2 the total emission of co2 from lakes in china was 24 6 of the temperate fluxes 4 fold higher than the contribution of surface area table 2 aufdenkampe et al 2011 however n2o emission from china s lakes was only 28 8 the emission from usa lakes baron et al 2013 this offers further support to our suggestion that china s reservoirs and lakes were a disproportionate contributor to temperate inland water emissions of ch4 and co2 but not n2o we reported ghgs emissions from natural lakes and reservoirs in china and build on prior studies elaborating on the combined effects of ghgs emissions from natural lakes and artificial reservoirs bastviken et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 deemer et al 2016 while emissions from reservoirs anthropogenic systems can be related to a new source to the atmosphere emissions from lakes will usually represent a natural ghg pathway unless the lakes and their catchment have been modified anthropogenic ghgs emissions from reservoirs need to consider the pre impoundment fluxes reservoir co2 emission declines quickly in the years following impoundment barros et al 2011 prairie et al 2017 life cycle analysis demonstrated that 25 of the cumulative co2 flux was attributable to creation of reservoirs prairie et al 2017 this is of great importance due to china s rapid growth in reservoir construction carbon sedimentation is a potential offset to reservoir c emissions especially in china where 0 6 gt y particulate materials can be trapped by dams chu et al 2009 assuming a minimum poc content of 0 5 in suspended sediment trapped by dams lu et al 2012 indicates that around 3 tg c y could be discounted from the estimated reservoir co2 emissions to the atmosphere the resulting net co2 emission would be 6 2 tg c co2 y which is 33 lower than the total estimated emissions from reservoirs this analysis highlights the need for developing full carbon budgets for new reservoirs to quantify their net ghg footprint prairie et al 2017 4 2 national and regional conditions affecting ghg production and emission in comparison to global lakes china s lakes have higher loadings of nutrients and are usually more eutrophic supplementary table s2 bastviken et al 2011 yang et al 2011a high photosynthetic rates and high organic loads increase the substrate for methanogenesis and consequently contribute to the high diffusion driven emission rate i e the 3 3 fold higher ch4 in lake pelagic areas of china than in temperate lakes in north america and europe 7 42 mg c ch4 m2 d 2 the ch4 emission rate is also much higher 4 6 times than diffusive emission rate of global lakes table 2 our key findings are indicative of highest areal emission rates of ch4 n2o and co2 from littoral or drawdown zones of lakes and reservoirs table 1 elevated levels of sedimentary organic matter combined with periodically inundated plant biomass are closely linked to distinctly higher emission rates of ch4 and co2 in the littoral or drawdown zones of both lakes and reservoirs fearnside and pueyo 2012 hertwich 2013 moreover diffusive ch4 and co2 areal fluxes were significantly different between different lake geographic zones with the highest emission rates of ch4 in tpl and co2 in imxl and npml p 0 05 by mann whitney rank sum test fig 3 these three geographic lake zones particularly the tpl have extremely higher doc concentrations supplementary fig s9 doc concentrations are weakly correlated with primary production chl a in lakes r 0 29 p 0 01 by spearman s rho implying that doc is likely allochthonous i e surrounding soils groundwater or upper catchment rather than autochthonous the low doc as well as high nutrients and primary production resulted in the low ch4 and co2 emissions in epl and ygl lake zones table 1 fig 3 as observed elsewhere cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 knoll et al 2013 monsoon climate in east centre southwest and south china where reservoirs concentrate and changing land use largely increases reservoir carbon loads and turbidity which limits light penetration and fuels heterotrophic activity and drives co2 production the concentrated rainfall even with high temperature decreases reservoir co2 flux in the monsoonal season li and zhang 2014b the monsoonal particulate carbon may be highly recalcitrant limiting respiration and masking the coupling between allochthonous organic carbon and co2 production supplementary table s5 mayorga et al 2005 detailed seasonal observations including rainfall events and monsoon cycles are unavailable but essential to refine our estimates the averages of ghgs fluxes were not clearly linked to reservoir ages data from supplementary table s1 which is different than a global analysis barros et al 2011 the common practice of biomass clearing before impoundment in china can reduce the flooded biomass and prevent the formation of ghgs in addition the initial intense degradation of labile biomass and soil organic carbon in tropical reservoirs results in negative correlations between ghgs emissions and age barros et al 2011 fearnside and pueyo 2012 congruent with global analyses excluding tropical reservoirs there were no significant correlations between ghgs fluxes and latitude for china s temperate reservoirs barros et al 2011 our findings highlighted the importance of phosphorus aquatic productivity and organic carbon for water air interface ghgs emissions which were in agreement with the recent studies either using global reservoir data deemer et al 2016 or diffusive ch4 data from lakes in north american and eurasia bastviken et al 2004 as well as the combined data from global reservoirs and lakes delsontro et al 2018 our models for ghgs areal emissions from reservoirs and lakes can explain 33 49 of the variations supplementary table s6 which are comparable or better than other models bastviken et al 2004 deemer et al 2016 delsontro et al 2018 such models can help us to define the most important drivers of ghg areal fluxes in reservoirs and lakes of china 4 3 limitations of this study similar to other studies at national and global scales our new estimates of ghgs emissions from china s reservoirs and lakes are also impacted by data limitations and uncertainties firstly limited measurements are assumed to represent national observations and often these measurements do not include ch4 bubbles this certainly contributes to large uncertainty of ghgs emissions because their areal fluxes are spatially and temporally heterogeneous supplementary tables s1 and s2 furthermore not including ebullition biases our estimates low for example field measurements in a lake huahua of tpl indicated that bubbling ch4 areal flux was 9 fold higher than its diffusive areal flux zhu et al 2016 this is three times the ratio of ch4 ebullition to ch4 diffusion driven flux from temperate lakes bastviken et al 2011 if this is the case everywhere an additional 2 8 11 3 tg c ch4 y would be emitted from chinese lakes due to ch4 bubbling the upper and lower levels are based on the ratio of bubbling flux to diffusive flux in tpl and temperate lakes moreover the available dataset does not allow for an assessment of pulses of emissions when hypolimnic water usually enriched in ghgs emerges at the surface other alterative flux pathways including rivers downstream of dams and dam spillways and turbines were not included in the ghgs emission estimates prior studies reported that river stretches directly downstream of dams constitute a significant fraction 9 33 for ch4 and 2 32 for co2 of the emissions across the reservoir surfaces guerin et al 2006 kemenes et al 2007 2011 teodoru et al 2015 degassing occurs when the hypolimnic waters rich in dissolved gases pass through turbines and spillways due to rapid depressurization and aeration past studies on tropical reservoirs showed that ch4 emissions from turbines and spillways accounted for a magnitude of nine times the emission from reservoir surface roehm and tremblay 2006 fearnside and pueyo 2012 valley type chinese reservoirs have relatively small surface area with large water discharge and turbine depth greater than 30 m clearly resulting in a larger proportion of ghgs emissions from turbines and spillways albeit uncertainties are still large our new dataset advances our understanding of inland waters ghgs emissions 4 4 policy implications and recommendations phosphorus p and chla were the best predictors of reservoir and lake ghgs areal fluxes this deserves particular attention because phytoplankton growth and bacterioplankton production are more often phosphorus limited in lakes and reservoirs in china as reflected by high n p ratios tables s1 and s2 similar to other lakes elsewhere chrzanowski and grover 2001 vrede 2005 krist et al 2016 our findings suggest that p loading reduction would be beneficial to mitigate ch4 and co2 emissions specifically the carbon rich tpl region tibetan plateau has ch4 emissions that are responsible for 68 of the radiative forcing from pelagic areas table 1 since the tibetan plateau is highly vulnerable to climate change increasing temperatures in this region could result in additional ghgs emissions thus our work provides a crucial step in identifying potential management priorities for the reduction of ghgs emissions from natural and artificial lakes phosphate control should be prioritized in tpl and npml with higher ghgs areal fluxes a total of 98 000 reservoirs have caused highly regulated river flows in china particularly in the yangtze river basin with 50 000 reservoirs mwr 2016 increasing anthropogenic nutrient inputs have driven lakes and reservoirs into a more autotrophic state thus reducing the average pco2 in the river network wang et al 2007 eutrophication however increases ch4 areal fluxes from the lentic systems deemer et al 2016 these man made reservoirs are now acknowledged as non carbon neutral deemer et al 2016 and ghgs emissions could discount the green credentials of hydropower fearnside 2005 in order to test the green credentials of china s hydropower network we compared ghgs emissions from reservoirs to fossil alternatives ghgs emissions released by hydropower reservoirs are only 5 9 of the thermo power emissions over a 100 year timespan table 5 dos santos et al 2006 but the hydropower generation accounts for 18 9 of the total energy 5811 twh produced in china the analysis further indicates that hydroelectric reservoirs can reduce carbon emission by 500 953 tg co2 eq per year in comparison to equivalent coal fired plant alternatives table 5 ghgs emissions from inland waters such as reservoirs and lakes are now gaining increased attention however inland water data remain scarce and fragmented with very little spatial and temporal resolution our work reveals that china s reservoirs and lakes may disproportionally contribute to temperate ghgs emissions our new estimated emissions of ghgs from china s lakes and reservoirs account for 14 23 of china s terrestrial carbon sink even though these aquatic systems contribute to only 1 1 of china s mainland area with the current boom in regional and global dam constructions zarfl et al 2015 ghgs emissions from reservoirs including reservoir water surfaces turbines and spillways and river downstream dam will represent large fraction of anthropogenic co2 equivalents the rapid expansion of china s reservoir area for hydropower generation will result in increases in ghgs emissions further research is needed to evaluate impacts of the expansion in reservoir area on ghgs emissions as well as extending existing datasets to cover spatial and temporal dynamics 5 conclusion the study provides new insights into magnitude and controls on diffusion driven emissions of ghgs ch4 co2 and n2o from china s lakes and reservoirs our estimates of national scale ghg budgets are the only estimates based on unbiased large scale regional sampling that are extrapolated to the whole china resolving the magnitude of ghg emissions from inland waters as well as the first chinese estimates of n2o emissions china s lake and reservoirs seem to emit 1 56 tg c ch4 y and 25 2 tg c co2 y expressed as co2 equivalents these correspond to 175 0 134 7 215 3 tg co2 equivalent with 73 4 of this forcing contributed by lakes these aquatic sources are 14 1 22 6 of china s estimated terrestrial carbon sink implying a disproportionally high contribution to national ghgs emissions our investigation also identifies characteristics of lakes and geographic areas that disproportionately contribute to ghgs fluxes informing policies that can be designed to minimize ghgs emissions more artificial and natural lakes ghg data covering detailed spatial and temporal dynamics are required for more accurate assessments of regional and global emissions new datasets should include not only reservoir water surfaces but also turbines spillways and rivers downstream of dams competing financial interests the authors

19231,freshwaters are important sources of greenhouse gases ghgs to the atmosphere that may partially offset the terrestrial carbon sink however current emission estimates from inland waters remain uncertain due to data paucity in key regions with a large freshwater surface area such as china here we show that the areal fluxes of ghgs carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide from lakes and reservoirs in china are much larger than previous estimates our work summarized data from 310 lakes and 153 reservoirs and revealed diffusive emissions of 1 56 95 confidence interval 1 12 2 00 tg c

are equivalent to 14 1 22 6 of china s estimated terrestrial carbon sink our results suggest a disproportionally high contribution of china s reservoirs and lakes to national and global ghgs emissions

regional estimates especially in developing countries where datasets are often less detailed indeed previous observations were primarily made in european and north american waterbodies limited datasets are available from large developing countries like india and china where the areal ghg fluxes from inland waters may be highly different than european and north american systems yang et al 2011a large scale extrapolation from field data in europe and north america thus may result in large uncertainty of the global carbon budget here we focus on china where a large expanse of freshwater areas exists china now possesses half of the world s total number of dams and has the largest amount of hydropower generation capacity 1100 billion kwh 27 5 of the world s total mwr 2016 nea 2016 china had 40 small reservoirs in the year of the foundation of the people s republic of china in 1949 dam construction in china experienced a rapid growth in the two decades of the 1950s and 1960s when the number of dams rose remarkably to 72 000 the number of reservoirs in china slowly increased after the 1980s and rose to 98 000 in 2015 mwr 2016 the annual increase of the total reservoir storage capacity of the nation was the greatest rate after 2000 because of the completion of massive reservoirs such as the three gorges dam yang and lu 2013 the boom in reservoir construction is a result of multiple demands such as flood control more stable water supplies and energy demand in 2011 china vowed to update the country s water infrastructures to alleviate water scarcity and provide cleaner energy as a result dam construction has been drastically accelerated with hydropower generation capacity nearly doubled between 2010 ca 216 gw and 2020 ca 380 gw and a related increase in reservoir surface area nea 2016 little is known on how these dam constructions will alter ghgs emissions from inland waters here we estimate for the first time diffusive emissions of methane and carbon dioxide from reservoirs and lakes using available data from 310 lakes and 153 reservoirs across china fig 1 china has a freshwater area of 26 870 km2 for reservoirs and 82 232 km2 for lakes

chambers and headspace technique or derived from ph alkalinity and temperature using co2sys detailed information on supplementary material ch4 and co2 areal fluxes from around additional 91 lentic systems in north china 15 reservoirs in north china 63 lakes in npml and 13 lakes in imxl were determined using headspace equilibrium method these data are marked unpublished data in the supplementary excel file 2 26 samples were taken from individual lake or reservoir in the year of 2013 2014 nutrients and organic carbon were also measured additional field investigations were performed in lakes in ygpl and epl in october 2015 and july september 2017 to compare the three main methods floating chamber with gc thin boundary layer model tbl from headspace with gc and tbl from alkalinity and ph which were used for comparative assessment of different methods a total of 79 samples were taken and carbon and nutrients were also determined water chemistry ph carbon and nutrients physical characteristics geographic coordinates age mean depth volume and area and climate air and water temperature and rainfall were extracted for all reservoir and lake systems supplementary tables s1 and s2 reservoir and lake areas and volume were calculated using remote sensing images with arcgis ma et al 2011 yang and lu 2013 landsat thematic mapper tm and enhanced thematic mapper plus etm with 30 m spatial resolution were used and these tm etm images are mainly acquired after the monsoon season september october in the period 2005 to 2008 the statistical areas include reservoirs and lakes with surfaces greater than 0 0036 km2 the surfaces of lakes with flux data are larger than 0 01 km2 lakes with an area less than 0 01 km2 have a cumulative surface area of 540 km2 accounting for approximately 0 66 of total lake surface area and reservoirs with an area less than 0 01 km2 have a combined surface area of 144 km2 accounting for 0 54 of total reservoir surface area in china yang and lu 2013 thus ghgs fluxes from these very small ponds could be negligible because of their minor contribution to total surfaces albeit recent report demonstrated higher ghgs areal fluxes from small ponds holgerson and raymond 2016 co2 equivalents are a widely recognized tool for comparing ghgs the total ghg footprints were calculated by converting ch4 and n2o emissions to co2 equivalents and summing with the co2 emission results myhre et al 2013 we supplied detailed information on data quality control water air interface ghgs areal fluxes calculations and uncertainty analyses in the supplementary material we here highlighted the key parameter ph for co2 fluxes uncertainty samples for co2 fluxes estimated from ph and alkalinity had ph average of 8 12 0 40 median 8 20 with quartiles of 7 90 8 40 n 79 for reservoirs while ph in lakes averaged 8 40 0 86 with a median of 8 26 quartiles 7 83 9 02 n 255 thus overestimation of calculated co2 areal flux from ph and alkalinity is likely to be minor abril et al 2015 2 3 statistical analyses relationships between ghgs fluxes and physicochemical variables were examined by means of linear and exponential regressions spearman s rho was also provided see supplementary information variables with non normal distribution were log transformed to approach normality for data sets containing negative gaseous fluxes negative sign represents net carbon sink we added a constant to get the regression model through log transformation a constant of 1000 was added for reservoir co2 areal flux 500 for lake co2 and 5 for lake ch4 we used stepwise multiple regressions to identify which variables explained the variance in co2 and ch4 emission rates and used p 0 05 for the significance probability for each control variable however a limited number of n2o emission rates prevented the use of regression analyses all statistical analyses were carried out using spss 16 0 and sigmaplot 11 0 95 confidence intervals ci were used to present uncertainties of estimates of ghgs fluxes we separated the waterbodies into categories of reservoirs and lakes reservoirs were further separated into pelagic and drawdown areas lakes were categorized into five geographic zones and pelagic and littoral areas fig 1 then national estimates were obtained by upscaling the average emissions for those categories 3 results 3 1 reservoir ghgs emissions in china all of the sampled reservoirs were sources of ch4 and n2o to the atmosphere via diffusive emissions and 74 of the sampled reservoirs were sources of co2 the reservoirs that were

upscaling emissions to the reservoir surface area we estimated that reservoir pelagic areas emitted 0 08 95 ci 0 035 0 126 tg c ch4 per year 4 18 3 40 4 96 tg c co2 y and 7 97 4 23 11 72 gg n n2o y tables 1 and 3 the reservoir pelagic emissions of ch4 and co2 were comparable to the reservoir drawdown areas while reservoir pelagic n2o emissions were around 1 5 fold higher than the drawdown emission table 1 our newly estimated ch4 emission was 1 7 fold higher than the previous ch4 estimate from china s reservoirs table 2 which was likely due to our more complete coverage of data and inclusion of high emission rates particularly in drawdown areas the majority 72 of co2 equivalents from reservoirs occurred as co2 while ch4 and n2o were responsible for 15 and 13 of radiative forcing respectively over a 100 year timespan 3 2 lake ghgs emissions in china similar to reservoirs all the lake systems were either ch4 neutral or ch4 sources most lakes 75 6 were also sources of co2 only 24 4 of open lake waters were net co2 sinks and 12 6 of lakes were net n2o sinks fig 2 there are distinct differences in spatial variability and median fluxes of ghgs p 0 05 by mann whitney rank sum test fig 3 with high average of ch4 in tpl where lakes are mostly rich in doc at the high altitude and high average of co2 in npml where lakes are mostly effected by carbon rich wetlands at the high

supplementary table s3 generally lakes had lower fluxes of co2 and n2o but higher ch4 fluxes relative to reservoirs table 1 lake littoral zones had distinctly higher ghgs areal fluxes than the pelagic zones fig 3 supplementary table s4 in average littoral zones showed 5 fold higher mean ch4 emission rate 2 6 fold higher co2 and 7 4 fold higher n2o than open waters table 1 for the different geographic zones of lakes the maximal ratio of ghgs emission rate in littoral zones to pelagic areas was 7 4 for co2 imxl 10 9 for ch4 tpl and 13 4 for n2o tpl respectively table 1 we also found distinct differences in emission rates of the three ghgs between lake littoral areas and reservoir drawdown zones p 0 05 by mann whitney rank sum test table s4 albeit comparable mean areal n2o fluxes were observed 2 63 6 40 vs 2 17 1 78 mg n n2o m2 d for reservoir drawdown and lake littoral respectively table 1 we estimated that lake pelagic areas emitted 0 96 95 ci 0 57 1 36 tg c ch4 y 10 2 6 6 13 8 tg c co2 y and 5 18 0 02 10 34 gg n n2o y tables 1 and 3 the lake pelagic emissions of ch4 and co2 were much higher than the lake littoral emissions given that the pelagic area was 7 3 fold larger than the littoral area lake pelagic n2o emission however was around 72 of the littoral emission table 1 highest emissions of ghgs occurred in tpl while ygpl had the lowest ranging from 1 74 1

tg c ch4 y of emissions from very limited data table 2 yang et al 2011a chen et al 2013 the earlier higher estimate of china s lake methane emissions was based on several extremely high measurements yang et al 2011a in contrast to reservoirs the majority of co2 equivalents from lakes occurred as ch4 50 and co2 45 and n2o was responsible for 5 of radiative forcing respectively over a 100 year timeframe we combined lake littoral and pelagic areas into individual lake geographical zones to minimize the effects of the limited lake littoral data table 4 tpl and ygpl respectively showed the highest and lowest ghgs emissions emissions of ch4 2 08 tg c ch4 y 95 ci 0 65 3 51 were 148 of the separated estimate of littoral and pelagic zones table 1 co2 12 1 tg c co2 y 95 ci 7 8 16 4 was 76

of ghgs areal fluxes of china s reservoirs and lakes we collated lake and reservoirs characteristics that may explain ghgs fluxes similar to other climate zones such as arctic and boreal biomes complex interactions of biological processes trophic status hydro climatological factors and organic matter are believed to drive ghgs emissions from china s reservoirs and lakes supplementary table s5 bastviken et al 2004 rantakari and kortelainen 2005 2008 humborg et al 2010 halbedel and koschorreck 2013 regression models for n2o were not attempted due to the small n2o dataset available the areal emissions of ch4 from reservoirs had most significant correlations with air and surface water temperature when multiple biotic and abiotic variables were tested p 0 05 table s5 this implies ch4 production in anoxic sediments usually the main methane source to lakes and reservoirs is primarily controlled by temperature as observed elsewhere gudasz et al 2010 marotta et al 2014 wang et al 2014 also many of china s reservoirs have gorge type topography where deep water depth facilitates ch4 oxidation bastviken et al 2004 delsontro et al 2011 xiao et al 2013 as indicated separately by the significant negative associations between spatial heterogeneity in ch4 areal fluxes and water depth in the two typical reservoirs yang et al 2011b zheng et al 2011 the areal fluxes of co2 from reservoirs were positively correlated to air temperature total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp but negatively correlated with chlorophyll a chl a dissolved oxygen do and ph supplementary table s5 prior studies also reported strong positive correlations between nutrients and co2 emissions rantakari and kortelainen 2008 teodoru et al 2009 the negative correlation between co2 emission and do concentration could indicate in situ respiration of organic c as an important source of the co2 supersaturation that drives emissions however this negative correlation is concurrently controlled by photosynthesis producing do and consuming co2 thus lowering co2 supersaturation and co2 emissions as well as increasing ph we further identified new predictors of ghgs areal fluxes using a multiple regression model the most robust multiple regression model for the reservoir co2 emission rate included tp and chla as independent variables and explained 40 of the variation in co2 fluxes the model for areal ch4 fluxes included tp do and air temperature and explained 36 of variations in ch4 flux supplementary table s6 like the ghgs emission rates of reservoirs that were predicted using nutrients and productivity lake ch4 areal flux was predicted by tp doc and chl a and co2 areal flux by tp 49 and 33 of variances are explained respectively supplementary table s6 3 4 upscaling ghgs emissions from china s reservoirs and lakes clearly reservoirs and lakes in china are important ghg sources lakes have 9 3 fold greater ch4 fluxes and 1 7 fold greater co2 fluxes than reservoirs whereas lakes and reservoirs have comparable n2o fluxes combined the total estimated emissions of ch4 1 56 tg c ch4 y 95 ci 1 12 2 00 co2 25 2 tg c co2 y 95 ci 20 8 29 5 and n2o 25 5 gg n n2o y 95 ci 16 6 34 4 from reservoirs and lakes account for 3 9 1 6 and 1 2 of anthropogenic ch4 co2 and n2o emissions in china tables 2 and 3 our data implies emissions of 202 6 95 ci 106 8 298 5 tg co2 equivalent per year if littoral zone and pelagic zone are combined tables 1 and 4 and 175 0 95 ci 134 7 215 3 tg co2 equivalent per year if the two zones are separated table 3 in 100 year horizon for lakes and reservoirs 73 4 of total radiative forcing contributed by lakes translating into the global warming potential of ch4 co2 and n2o tables 1 and 3 this is equal to about 14 1 22 6 of the estimated terrestrial carbon sink of china 260 90 tg c co2 y piao et al 2009 tian et al 2011 this indicates that large amounts of the estimated land co2 sink is returned to the atmosphere through reservoirs and lakes therefore our results indicate that china s lakes and reservoirs are a disproportionately high contributor of ghgs given their minor contribution ca 1 1 to the china s land surface 4 discussion 4 1 implications of chinese inland water ghg emission on global budgets our new estimates of china s reservoir diffusive ghgs emissions contributed significantly to ghgs budgets in the temperate zone diffusion driven annual ch4 emission from china s reservoirs represented 21 6 34 8 of the total emissions from temperate reservoirs comparable to the area proportion 21 of china s reservoirs to the temperate biome table 2 the total annual emission of co2 from china s reservoirs made up 61 78 of the temperate reservoir co2 flux more than 3 fold higher than its proportion of surface area st louis et al 2000 hertwich 2013 table 2 annual n2o emissions comprised 35 5 of the reservoir n2o emission in the usa much lower than the ratio of reservoir surface area in china 26870 km2 to usa 27600 km2 baron et al 2013 if we incorporated the more recent reservoir data in the temperate biome deemer et al 2016 there were no significant differences in co2 and ch4 diffusive areal fluxes between china s reservoirs and temperate reservoirs including china or excluding china p 0 05 by mann whitney rank sum test while reservoir n2o emission rate was significantly higher in china than in the temperate biome fig 4 in total ghgs emissions from china s lakes and reservoirs expressed co2 equivalents accounted for 2 5 3 8 of global lakes and reservoirs combined 1 25 2 30 pg c co2eq y comparable to the surface area proportion 2 0 3 4 of lakes and reservoirs in china to globe delsontro et al 2018 we found that reservoir pelagic areal fluxes of co2 and n2o in china were higher than or at least proximate to global estimates table 2 the lower pelagic areal ch4 emissions one tenth of the global averages table 2 can be explained by the omission of ebullitive fluxes i e ebullition may exceed diffusion by 2 4 3 4 fold delsontro et al 2018 and a preponderance of high ch4 flux estimates in tropical reservoirs or other temperate areas outside of china st louis et al 2000 deemer et al 2016 our findings are consistent with the common view that low latitude reservoirs have higher ch4 emission rates than the reservoirs in the temperate biome albeit high emission rates were reported in the mid latitude reservoirs in north america europe and australia deemer et al 2016 mean areal fluxes of ghgs would be 1 3 4 2 fold higher in temperate reservoirs including china 9 23 28 39 mg c ch4 m2 d 440 89 664 76 mg c co2 m2 d 0 60 0 14 n n2o m2 d than temperate reservoirs excluding china 7 18 13 87 mg c ch4 m2 d 293 96 370 79 mg c co2 m2 d 0 14 0 31 n n2o m2 d fig 4 consequently ghg emissions from temperate reservoirs could be revised to be 0 40 1 24 95 ci 0 23 0 58 tg c ch4 y as diffusion 19 31 29 12 95 ci 16 40 22 22 tg c co2 y and 26 2 49 8 95 ci 14 4 38 0 gg n n2o y therefore our comprehensive analysis of ghgs emissions from chinee reservoirs demonstrated that previous estimates based largely on european and north american systems likely underestimated inland water s contribution to global ghgs budgets and highlights the need of including more data from china and other under sampled areas in developing countries in global upscaling exercises for lakes our estimated ch4 flux accounted for 39 of the total ch4 emissions from the temperate zone which was 6 3 fold higher than china s lakes proportion of surface area table 2 the total emission of co2 from lakes in china was 24 6 of the temperate fluxes 4 fold higher than the contribution of surface area table 2 aufdenkampe et al 2011 however n2o emission from china s lakes was only 28 8 the emission from usa lakes baron et al 2013 this offers further support to our suggestion that china s reservoirs and lakes were a disproportionate contributor to temperate inland water emissions of ch4 and co2 but not n2o we reported ghgs emissions from natural lakes and reservoirs in china and build on prior studies elaborating on the combined effects of ghgs emissions from natural lakes and artificial reservoirs bastviken et al 2011 raymond et al 2013 deemer et al 2016 while emissions from reservoirs anthropogenic systems can be related to a new source to the atmosphere emissions from lakes will usually represent a natural ghg pathway unless the lakes and their catchment have been modified anthropogenic ghgs emissions from reservoirs need to consider the pre impoundment fluxes reservoir co2 emission declines quickly in the years following impoundment barros et al 2011 prairie et al 2017 life cycle analysis demonstrated that 25 of the cumulative co2 flux was attributable to creation of reservoirs prairie et al 2017 this is of great importance due to china s rapid growth in reservoir construction carbon sedimentation is a potential offset to reservoir c emissions especially in china where 0 6 gt y particulate materials can be trapped by dams chu et al 2009 assuming a minimum poc content of 0 5 in suspended sediment trapped by dams lu et al 2012 indicates that around 3 tg c y could be discounted from the estimated reservoir co2 emissions to the atmosphere the resulting net co2 emission would be 6 2 tg c co2 y which is 33 lower than the total estimated emissions from reservoirs this analysis highlights the need for developing full carbon budgets for new reservoirs to quantify their net ghg footprint prairie et al 2017 4 2 national and regional conditions affecting ghg production and emission in comparison to global lakes china s lakes have higher loadings of nutrients and are usually more eutrophic supplementary table s2 bastviken et al 2011 yang et al 2011a high photosynthetic rates and high organic loads increase the substrate for methanogenesis and consequently contribute to the high diffusion driven emission rate i e the 3 3 fold higher ch4 in lake pelagic areas of china than in temperate lakes in north america and europe 7 42 mg c ch4 m2 d 2 the ch4 emission rate is also much higher 4 6 times than diffusive emission rate of global lakes table 2 our key findings are indicative of highest areal emission rates of ch4 n2o and co2 from littoral or drawdown zones of lakes and reservoirs table 1 elevated levels of sedimentary organic matter combined with periodically inundated plant biomass are closely linked to distinctly higher emission rates of ch4 and co2 in the littoral or drawdown zones of both lakes and reservoirs fearnside and pueyo 2012 hertwich 2013 moreover diffusive ch4 and co2 areal fluxes were significantly different between different lake geographic zones with the highest emission rates of ch4 in tpl and co2 in imxl and npml p 0 05 by mann whitney rank sum test fig 3 these three geographic lake zones particularly the tpl have extremely higher doc concentrations supplementary fig s9 doc concentrations are weakly correlated with primary production chl a in lakes r 0 29 p 0 01 by spearman s rho implying that doc is likely allochthonous i e surrounding soils groundwater or upper catchment rather than autochthonous the low doc as well as high nutrients and primary production resulted in the low ch4 and co2 emissions in epl and ygl lake zones table 1 fig 3 as observed elsewhere cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 knoll et al 2013 monsoon climate in east centre southwest and south china where reservoirs concentrate and changing land use largely increases reservoir carbon loads and turbidity which limits light penetration and fuels heterotrophic activity and drives co2 production the concentrated rainfall even with high temperature decreases reservoir co2 flux in the monsoonal season li and zhang 2014b the monsoonal particulate carbon may be highly recalcitrant limiting respiration and masking the coupling between allochthonous organic carbon and co2 production supplementary table s5 mayorga et al 2005 detailed seasonal observations including rainfall events and monsoon cycles are unavailable but essential to refine our estimates the averages of ghgs fluxes were not clearly linked to reservoir ages data from supplementary table s1 which is different than a global analysis barros et al 2011 the common practice of biomass clearing before impoundment in china can reduce the flooded biomass and prevent the formation of ghgs in addition the initial intense degradation of labile biomass and soil organic carbon in tropical reservoirs results in negative correlations between ghgs emissions and age barros et al 2011 fearnside and pueyo 2012 congruent with global analyses excluding tropical reservoirs there were no significant correlations between ghgs fluxes and latitude for china s temperate reservoirs barros et al 2011 our findings highlighted the importance of phosphorus aquatic productivity and organic carbon for water air interface ghgs emissions which were in agreement with the recent studies either using global reservoir data deemer et al 2016 or diffusive ch4 data from lakes in north american and eurasia bastviken et al 2004 as well as the combined data from global reservoirs and lakes delsontro et al 2018 our models for ghgs areal emissions from reservoirs and lakes can explain 33 49 of the variations supplementary table s6 which are comparable or better than other models bastviken et al 2004 deemer et al 2016 delsontro et al 2018 such models can help us to define the most important drivers of ghg areal fluxes in reservoirs and lakes of china 4 3 limitations of this study similar to other studies at national and global scales our new estimates of ghgs emissions from china s reservoirs and lakes are also impacted by data limitations and uncertainties firstly limited measurements are assumed to represent national observations and often these measurements do not include ch4 bubbles this certainly contributes to large uncertainty of ghgs emissions because their areal fluxes are spatially and temporally heterogeneous supplementary tables s1 and s2 furthermore not including ebullition biases our estimates low for example field measurements in a lake huahua of tpl indicated that bubbling ch4 areal flux was 9 fold higher than its diffusive areal flux zhu et al 2016 this is three times the ratio of ch4 ebullition to ch4 diffusion driven flux from temperate lakes bastviken et al 2011 if this is the case everywhere an additional 2 8 11 3 tg c ch4 y would be emitted from chinese lakes due to ch4 bubbling the upper and lower levels are based on the ratio of bubbling flux to diffusive flux in tpl and temperate lakes moreover the available dataset does not allow for an assessment of pulses of emissions when hypolimnic water usually enriched in ghgs emerges at the surface other alterative flux pathways including rivers downstream of dams and dam spillways and turbines were not included in the ghgs emission estimates prior studies reported that river stretches directly downstream of dams constitute a significant fraction 9 33 for ch4 and 2 32 for co2 of the emissions across the reservoir surfaces guerin et al 2006 kemenes et al 2007 2011 teodoru et al 2015 degassing occurs when the hypolimnic waters rich in dissolved gases pass through turbines and spillways due to rapid depressurization and aeration past studies on tropical reservoirs showed that ch4 emissions from turbines and spillways accounted for a magnitude of nine times the emission from reservoir surface roehm and tremblay 2006 fearnside and pueyo 2012 valley type chinese reservoirs have relatively small surface area with large water discharge and turbine depth greater than 30 m clearly resulting in a larger proportion of ghgs emissions from turbines and spillways albeit uncertainties are still large our new dataset advances our understanding of inland waters ghgs emissions 4 4 policy implications and recommendations phosphorus p and chla were the best predictors of reservoir and lake ghgs areal fluxes this deserves particular attention because phytoplankton growth and bacterioplankton production are more often phosphorus limited in lakes and reservoirs in china as reflected by high n p ratios tables s1 and s2 similar to other lakes elsewhere chrzanowski and grover 2001 vrede 2005 krist et al 2016 our findings suggest that p loading reduction would be beneficial to mitigate ch4 and co2 emissions specifically the carbon rich tpl region tibetan plateau has ch4 emissions that are responsible for 68 of the radiative forcing from pelagic areas table 1 since the tibetan plateau is highly vulnerable to climate change increasing temperatures in this region could result in additional ghgs emissions thus our work provides a crucial step in identifying potential management priorities for the reduction of ghgs emissions from natural and artificial lakes phosphate control should be prioritized in tpl and npml with higher ghgs areal fluxes a total of 98 000 reservoirs have caused highly regulated river flows in china particularly in the yangtze river basin with 50 000 reservoirs mwr 2016 increasing anthropogenic nutrient inputs have driven lakes and reservoirs into a more autotrophic state thus reducing the average pco2 in the river network wang et al 2007 eutrophication however increases ch4 areal fluxes from the lentic systems deemer et al 2016 these man made reservoirs are now acknowledged as non carbon neutral deemer et al 2016 and ghgs emissions could discount the green credentials of hydropower fearnside 2005 in order to test the green credentials of china s hydropower network we compared ghgs emissions from reservoirs to fossil alternatives ghgs emissions released by hydropower reservoirs are only 5 9 of the thermo power emissions over a 100 year timespan table 5 dos santos et al 2006 but the hydropower generation accounts for 18 9 of the total energy 5811 twh produced in china the analysis further indicates that hydroelectric reservoirs can reduce carbon emission by 500 953 tg co2 eq per year in comparison to equivalent coal fired plant alternatives table 5 ghgs emissions from inland waters such as reservoirs and lakes are now gaining increased attention however inland water data remain scarce and fragmented with very little spatial and temporal resolution our work reveals that china s reservoirs and lakes may disproportionally contribute to temperate ghgs emissions our new estimated emissions of ghgs from china s lakes and reservoirs account for 14 23 of china s terrestrial carbon sink even though these aquatic systems contribute to only 1 1 of china s mainland area with the current boom in regional and global dam constructions zarfl et al 2015 ghgs emissions from reservoirs including reservoir water surfaces turbines and spillways and river downstream dam will represent large fraction of anthropogenic co2 equivalents the rapid expansion of china s reservoir area for hydropower generation will result in increases in ghgs emissions further research is needed to evaluate impacts of the expansion in reservoir area on ghgs emissions as well as extending existing datasets to cover spatial and temporal dynamics 5 conclusion the study provides new insights into magnitude and controls on diffusion driven emissions of ghgs ch4 co2 and n2o from china s lakes and reservoirs our estimates of national scale ghg budgets are the only estimates based on unbiased large scale regional sampling that are extrapolated to the whole china resolving the magnitude of ghg emissions from inland waters as well as the first chinese estimates of n2o emissions china s lake and reservoirs seem to emit 1 56 tg c ch4 y and 25 2 tg c co2 y expressed as co2 equivalents these correspond to 175 0 134 7 215 3 tg co2 equivalent with 73 4 of this forcing contributed by lakes these aquatic sources are 14 1 22 6 of china s estimated terrestrial carbon sink implying a disproportionally high contribution to national ghgs emissions our investigation also identifies characteristics of lakes and geographic areas that disproportionately contribute to ghgs fluxes informing policies that can be designed to minimize ghgs emissions more artificial and natural lakes ghg data covering detailed spatial and temporal dynamics are required for more accurate assessments of regional and global emissions new datasets should include not only reservoir water surfaces but also turbines spillways and rivers downstream of dams competing financial interests the authors

the accumulation of extracellular we alike compounds can be up to 12 times higher compared to intracellular reaching 3 08 grams per litre of reactor volume g lreactor extracellularly and 0 28 g lreactor intracellularly with residual n alkane concentration of 311 5 34 2 mg l accumulation of extracellular and intracellular we alike compounds can reach up to 6 15 and 0 91 g lreactor respectively to the best of our knowledge simultaneous pw treatment coupled with production of neutral lipids has never been demonstrated before graphical abstract image 1 keywords produced water biological treatment alkane biodegradation neutral lipids production 1 introduction water co produced with oil and gas is referred to as produced water pw cakmakce et al 2008 it is a complex mixture of organic and inorganic compounds tellez et al 2002 fakhru l razi et al 2009 with varying composition depending on the reservoir characteristics operation strategy production process geological structure of the formation lifetime of reservoirs chemicals used in production facilities ozgun et al 2013a 2013b rehman et al 2018 and has been reported as the largest waste stream in oil and gas industry fakhru l razi et al 2009 contaminants such as organics and salts within pw have negative effects on the environment upon direct discharge hence several organisations e g ospar usepa and countries e g venezuela people s republic of china australia have set stringent discharge rules with respect to both salinity and organic content of treated pw díaz et al 2000 rincón et al 2003 tellez et al 2005 lefebvre and moletta 2006 fakhru l razi et al 2009 igunnu and chen 2012 due to the stringent discharge limits for pw many of the oil and gas wells in the u s were reported to reach their economic limit since production maintenance treatment and disposal costs were higher than the selling price in 2005 tellez et al 2005 while the selling price in the early 2000s was high millard et al 2017 since historically substitutes for oil exist its price may decrease rapidly millard et al 2017 for example the price of crude oil dropped by more than a half from july 2014 to january 2015 millard et al 2017 meaning that the costs of extraction and processing should be minimised conventionally pw is treated by a combination of several physical and chemical processes such as coagulation hydro cyclones flotation units and membrane processes but they are expensive to apply due to high start up and running costs lefebvre and moletta 2006 cakmakce et al 2008 knutsen 2011 ozgun et al 2013a moreover chemical processes can produce hazardous sludge knutsen 2011 another drawback of current physical chemical treatment technologies of pw is their inability to remove small suspended oil particles and dissolved organics lefebvre and moletta 2006 fakhru l razi et al 2009 dong et al 2011 space limitations offshore do not allow for implementation of large bioreactors however onshore it has been proposed to incorporate biological removal of organic contaminants from pw because of cost effectiveness of biological compared to physical chemical treatment tellez et al 2005 lefebvre and moletta 2006 fakhru l razi et al 2009 lu et al 2009 fakhru l razi et al 2010 pw is often a highly saline stream díaz et al 2000 freire et al 2001 lefebvre and moletta 2006 fakhru l razi et al 2009 and around 90 of total hydrocarbons within the stream are dispersed oil alkanes tellez et al 2002 the salinity of pw introduces microorganisms to a challenge of dealing with osmotic stress if biological treatment is applied the low solubility of hydrocarbon substrates makes them difficult to biodegrade because all known hydrocarbon oxidizing enzymes are cell bound tellez et al 2002 hydrocarbons with chain lengths above c12 are almost insoluble in water and bacteria capable of degrading them need to produce biosurfactants either to attach to the substrate or to solubilize it for uptake singh et al 2012 these molecules are also chemically very inert and need to be activated by specific enzymes for biological conversion singh et al 2012 anaerobic biological treatment has several advantages over aerobic biological treatment such as net energy recovery reduced surplus sludge production and possibility to apply higher loading rates xiao and roberts 2010 some researchers have demonstrated the efficiency of for example addition of anaerobic zone to waste stabilization ponds for removal of heavy metals oil and grease shpiner et al 2009a 2009b or application of anaerobic baffled reactors for removal of oil and suspended solids su et al 2007 from pw despite the potential advantages of anaerobic biological treatment over aerobic thus far most researchers have been focusing on aerobic biological treatment of pw su et al 2007 lu et al 2009 fakhru l razi et al 2010 dong et al 2011 mancini et al 2012 the research focus on aerobic treatment of pw is mainly due to high sensitivity of anaerobic biomass towards osmotic stress and other potentially toxic compounds within pw khong et al 2012 in addition anaerobic degradation of alkanes and other petroleum hydrocarbons proceeds at much slower rate and is less efficient than degradation under aerobic conditions heider et al 1998 berdugo clavijo and gieg 2014 application of pure cultures of specialised marine hydrocarbonoclastic microorganisms as inoculum in bioreactors has not been a widely recognised approach for pw treatment neither in aerobic nor in anaerobic biological treatment alcanivorax borkumensis sk2 is a marine hydrocarbonoclastic bacterium with a highly specialised metabolism for n alkane degradation kasai et al 2002 head et al 2006 schneiker et al 2006 cappello and yakimov 2010 one of its peculiar features is the ability to produce intracellular and extracellular neutral lipids in the form of wax esters we and triacylglycerols tag upon exposure to abundance of hydrocarbons kalscheuer et al 2007 manilla pérez et al 2011 alvarez 2010 reported an increasing interest in bacterial production of we and tag due to increasing global demand for fats oils and we industrially tag can be used for production of for example personal care products plastics detergents soaps resins and lubricants wax esters can be used in production of lubricants surface coatings and cosmetics alvarez 2010 the unique features of a borkumensis sk2 can potentially allow for aerobic biological treatment of pw coupled with recovery of valuable compounds we and tag in this study we explore the applicability of a borkumensis sk2 as inoculum for biological treatment of oily part of pw obtained from a full scale physical separation process and investigate the conditions allowing for simultaneous production of intracellular and extracellular neutral lipids this contribution is not aiming to give detailed mass balances with respect to production of neutral lipids but is rather aiming to demonstrate the concept with real pw for the first time we demonstrate efficient more than 90 n alkane biodegradation both in batch and continuous experiments biodegradation of other non polar compounds as well as nutrient non limited production of intracellular and extracellular neutral lipids 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor system inoculum and produced water two continuously stirred tank reactors cstrs without sludge retention connected in series were inoculated with a borkumensis sk2 dsm number 11573 the culture was previously adapted to the produced water concentrate as the sole carbon and energy source in batch experiments using saline medium onr7a prepared according to dmsz braunschweig germany a simplified reactor scheme is shown in fig 1 reactor 1 r1 with a working volume of 2 l was operated at 28 c 40 oxygen saturation ph of 7 5 and with nitrogen non limited conditions the detection of undissolved matter such as microbial cells emulsified alkanes and hydrophobic matter produced by bacteria was measured in real time as optical density od600 at the near infrared region by a photometric probe full details on the control and monitoring system can be found in da silva et al 2016 reactor 2 r2 with a working volume of 4 l was operated at room temperature 19 21 c under oxygen depleted and saturated conditions ph of 7 5 and nitrogen limiting conditions oxygen depleted and saturated conditions were studied because dissolved oxygen concentration of 2 100 has been reported to be suitable for we production in other hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria such as fundibacter jadensis t9 bredemeier et al 2003 if this is true for a borkumensis sk2 it allows to optimize the aeration costs for production of neutral lipids mixing of r1 was achieved by a metal propeller with a diameter of 4 cm at 900 rpm whereas mixing of r2 was achieved by two metal propellers attached to one shaft at 500 rpm concentrated oily part of pw from a full scale physical separation process was obtained from shell the netherlands and fed to the reactor system as a separate stream the total c10 c33 n alkane concentration of the pw concentrate was determined as described below and was 98 g l which accounts for a cod of 339 2 g cod l detailed analyses of n alkanes in pw are provided in table s1 the pw fed to r1 was mixed with onr7a medium and phosphate source the onr7a medium was modified for nitrogen concentration of 334 mg l and phosphorous concentration in the phosphorous solution source was adjusted to reach influent concentration of 62 mg l in order to have sufficient amount of iron for microbial growth fecl2 4h2o concentration was adjusted from 0 00001 m in the original recipe to 0 00021 m after the first 112 h of continuous r1 operation in this study the increase of iron concentration was found to be necessary after observing decreasing oxygen feed rate in r1 with the 40 oxygen saturation as the set point indicating decreasing microbial activity in the reactor fig 2 oxygen uptake rate is defined here as oxygen flow measured with ez control device from applikon biotechnology inc delft the netherlands to maintain the set point of 40 oxygen saturation in the reactor 2 2 reactor operation two experiments were performed during this study in the first experiment the performance of r1 in a controlled batch operation was studied in terms of n alkane removal to evaluate if efficient n alkane biodegradation can be achieved within the complex pw matrix with the chosen inoculum the batch experiment lasted for 54 h a borkumensis sk2 was inoculated in onr7a medium containing 238 mg l nh4 n 34 mg l po4 p and 23 5 ml 19 8 g of pw the resulting n alkane cod n p ratio at the beginning of the batch was 234 4 7 1 the inoculum was prepared as described above during the second experiment r1 and r2 were operated continuously in series and performance of both reactors was studied in terms of n alkane biodegradation and production of neutral lipids concentrated stream of oily pw onr7a medium and phosphorous source were fed as separate streams to r1 resulting in influent concentrations of 334 9 and 62 mg l for nh4 n and po4 p respectively the flow rate of pw was reduced in steps resulting in influent n alkane cod concentrations of 10305 66 8766 40 and 7205 160 mg l and a hrt in r1 of 14 9 0 09 h finally the hrt in r1 was decreased down to 28 9 0 18 h while keeping the influent nh4 n and po4 p concentration constant and n alkane cod influent concentration of 7411 197 mg l the resulting n p and cod loads are depicted in fig 2 a b the nitrogen and phosphorous load was kept such in order to achieve carbon limiting conditions within r1 before decreasing the loading rate pw was spiked into the reactor to assess carbon limiting conditions a responsive increase in oxygen uptake rate indicates the previous carbon limiting conditions the entire experiment was divided into six periods shown in fig 2 a periods ii iv v and vi were periods with stable oxygen uptake rate for at least 3 hydraulic retention times the removal of n alkanes and production of neutral lipids was studied during these stable periods only period vi was carbon source limited since spiking of additional carbon source induced an immediate increase of the oxygen uptake rate from 4 to 6 24 l h fig 2 a the phosphorous and nitrogen loading rates applied in r1 are depicted in fig 2 b no additional dosing of nutrients was performed in r2 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 ammonium nitrogen total particulate nitrogen and phosphorous ammonium nitrogen in the reactors was measured on daily bases in triplicate for r1 and in duplicate for r2 two ml samples were taken directly from the reactors and immediately filtered through 0 45 μm filters further analysis was performed with lck 302 lck 303 or lck 304 hach gmbh germany ammonium kits the relative standard deviation for ammonium nitrogen analysis in triplicate was up to 28 in the concentration range below 1 mg nh4 n l and up to 8 in the higher concentration range the deviation range for duplicate samples of r2 was up to 28 in the lower range and up to 4 above 1 mg l nh4 n biomass concentration in the bioreactors was measured as total particulate nitrogen tpn da silva et al 2016 samples taken from bioreactors were centrifuged at 20 350 xg for 5 min and washed with pbs 1x for 3 times finally the washed pellet was re suspended in mili q and total nitrogen was measured with lck 338 kit hach gmbh germany the relative standard deviation for tpn measurements in triplicate was 2 19 in the tn range of 20 40 mg n l and 4 16 in the higher range phosphorous concentration in the bioreactors was detected with icp elementary analysis sampling was performed once a day and measurements were made in triplicate for r1 and in duplicate for r2 samples were filtered through 0 45 μm filters diluted with deionised water to result in tds levels smaller than 1 g l and acidified to result in 2 nitric acid content within the samples these samples were analysed with perkin elmer optima 5300 dv icp apparatus equipped with perkin elmer software package winlab 32 3 3 1 0210 the relative standard deviation of triplicate measurements in r1 ranged from 1 to 14 throughout the operational period with only one exception where 27 deviation was measured the absolute deviation for duplicate measurements in r2 ranged from 1 to 13 2 3 2 extraction and analysis of hydrocarbons two times 15 ml samples for hydrocarbon analysis were collected on daily bases analysis was performed on samples taken during the stable operation periods ii iv v and vi extraction of hydrocarbons and analysis of c10 c33 n alkanes was done as described in da silva et al 2016 extractions were performed on mixed liquor samples including the volatile suspended solids therefore the effluent n alkane concentration adsorbed to microbial cells was taken into account to measure the total n alkanes in the effluent the chromatograms and data for hydrocarbon quantification were obtained with galaxie software version 1 9 302 530 in the sequence of sample injection also standard solutions of c8 c20 and c21 c40 with 20 and 40 ppm of each compound as well as standard solutions of c10 c20 c30 and c40 with concentrations from 25 to 200 ppm were injected the quantification of hydrocarbons was done based on area for c8 c20 and based on response factor area divided by theoretical concentration in the standards for c21 c40 relative standard deviations for n alkane analysis in raw pw concentrate are shown in table s1 the deviation range was 1 14 with higher variation in the range c10 to c14 in the effluent samples the relative standard deviations between duplicate measurements of c10 to c12 ranged between 0 03 up to 141 for c13 to c29 the deviation range was between 0 04 and 26 4 and for c30 to c33 between 1 2 and 141 4 2 3 3 extraction and thin layer chromatography tlc of neutral lipids twenty five ml duplicate samples for extraction and analysis of neutral lipids were taken on daily bases analysis was performed on samples taken during the stable operation periods ii iv v and vi samples were taken directly from r2 whereas composite effluent samples were collected from r1 to avoid interference with the process performance solid and liquid phase of the reactor samples were separated by centrifugation for 10 min at 15 000 xg and 10 c by a centrifuge avanti j25 beckman coulter both phases were freeze dried and the extraction of non polar compounds was done by use of chloroform methanol 3 1 v v solution the extraction of neutral lipids was adapted from folch et al 1957 whereas the removal of trace polar compounds was achieved with polarity based fractionation on spe columns lc si spe tubes 6 ml 1 g the fractionation process was adapted from revellame et al 2012 as described in da silva et al 2016 the fractions obtained were analysed with thin layer chromatography tlc silica gel plates 60 f254 10 20 cm by merck kgaa were used to perform tlc with n hexane diethyl ether acetic acid 80 20 1 v v v serving as mobile phase lipids were highlighted on 8 2 cm elution area by staining with iodine vapour silva et al 2010 for recognition of different non polar compounds oleic acid fatty acids oleyl oleate methyl hexanoate methyl linoleate methyl oleate wes glyceryl tri oleate glyceryl trihexanoate glyceryl trilinoleate tags glyceryl di oleate dags glyceryl mono oleate mags were used as references each fraction was re suspended in 250 μl of chloroform and 5 μl were used for tlc analysis images of tlc plates were processed with imajej software by converting them to 8 bit greyscale and increasing the contrast by 1 of saturated pixels 2 3 4 quantification of tags wes and fatty acids fas each class of neutral lipids was scraped off from the tlc plate transferred into a pasteur pipet containing glass wool and eluted from the silica for three times with 0 5 ml of chloroform santala et al 2011 the extracts were dried with gentle flow of nitrogen and their weight was measured daily till constant value the quantification was done in one replicate for each sampling time 2 3 5 dna extraction and 16s rrna gene sequencing samples of well homogenized biomass were centrifuged 4000 rpm 10 min at 4 c and preserved at 20 c until dna isolation total genomic dna was extracted using a fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals solon oh according to instructions of the manufacturer amplification of dna illumina libraries preparation amplicon sequencing illumina miseq and bioinformatics analysis of the data were performed at baseclear bv leiden the netherlands as described earlier roman et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 efficient n alkane biodegradation within the complex pw matrix in a controlled batch experiment dispersed oil alkanes may represent as much as 90 of total hydrocarbons in pw tellez et al 2002 fig 3 shows efficient c10 c33 n alkane biodegradation during the controlled batch experiment the concentration of aliphatics dropped from 1150 3 32 3 mg l at the start of the experiment to 588 2 11 1 mg l after 24 6 h and finally to 20 6 mg l 0 7 mg l after 53 8 h the final concentration of sum of c10 c33 n alkanes corresponds to a removal efficiency of 98 2 profiles of individual n alkanes concentrations during the batch experiment are shown in figure s1 the overall trend for individual n alkanes was similar to the sum of n alkanes shown in fig 3 resulting in low concentrations at the end of the batch experiment and overall removal efficiencies above 90 the downwards trend of nh4 n in fig 3 a suggests that the removal mechanism of n alkanes is biodegradation since no other carbon source was provided for microbial growth during the experiment no nitrification was found in the reactor data not shown the headspace of the reactor was not monitored for ammonia stripping or n alkane stripping efficient ammonia stripping is only possible at high ph 9 5 and above high gas flow rates and large contact area between liquid and gas guštin and marinšek logar 2011 since the ph in our study was controlled at 7 5 and the maximum oxygen flow peaked at 3 9 l h fig 3 b significant ammonia stripping is unlikely to occur shorter chain n alkanes on the other hand have been demonstrated to partition into gas phase during air stripping cazoir et al 2012 in a set up of similar size as used in the present study cazoir et al 2012 demonstrated that with an air flow rate of 2 4 lair lreactor h more than the maximum oxygen flow rate during the batch experiment only hydrocarbons with chain lengths of c10 to c12 can be stripped from the aqueous phase c10 to c12 contributed 4 9 0 3 of total hydrocarbons analysed in this study therefore the impact of stripping on the overall c10 c33 removal presented in fig 3 a is expected to be rather small especially considering that the actual oxygen flow rate was much smaller than reported by cazoir et al 2012 fig 3 b moreover partitioning of these alkanes into the gas phase can be even further reduced because a borkumensis is shown to solubilize them by producing biosurfactants perfumo et al 2010 also the optical density profile in fig 3 b follows the trend of n alkane disappearance indicating dispersion of n alkanes with biosurfactants and of microbial growth the biosurfactants produced by a borkumensis sk2 are glycolipidic molecules containing nitrogen perfumo et al 2010 interestingly we demonstrate that a borkumensis sk2 is capable of biodegrading even tritriacontane c33 thus far a borkumensis sk2 has been reported to biodegrade n alkanes up to c32 schneiker et al 2006 the above results confirmed the ability of a borkumensis sk2 to biodegrade n alkanes even within the complex pw matrix at seawater salinity levels thus showing its affinity to oil hydrocarbons as reported before kasai et al 2002 cappello and yakimov 2010 moreover due to the fact that it is a marine microorganism yakimov et al 1998 no adaptation period was necessary to the salinity levels of seawater applied in this study 3 2 continuous reactor operation efficient alkane removal coupled with production of neutral lipids 3 2 1 continuous system with efficient n alkane biodegradation continuous system yielded good removal efficiency of n alkanes both with the r1 and r2 combined as well as with r1 alone n alkane removal efficiency profiles in fig 4 clearly show the possibility of efficient biodegradation in a continuously operated system a hrt of 15 h in r1 30 h in r2 could yield up to 82 6 1 9 removal efficiency within r1 alone and up to 94 5 1 0 removal efficiency within the total system upon increase of r1 hrt to 30 h 60 h in r2 the removal efficiency within r1 alone up to 90 3 2 1 could be achieved whereas in the entire system up to 98 8 1 0 of n alkanes could be removed table 1 summarizes the average reactors performance during the periods of stable oxygen uptake rates in r1 the good removal efficiency of n alkanes was achieved while operating r1 at organic loading rates relatively high for an aerobic activated sludge system the organic loading rates applied here are approximately four times higher than those reported before in previous studies the organic loading rates applied in biological treatment systems ranged from 0 3 kg cod m3 d in a pilot scale hydrolysis acidification bio contact oxidation system treating pw from oilfield in china ha bco lu et al 2009 up to 4 2 kg cod m3 d in an activated sludge and mbbr system treating pw from an oilfield injection pipe dong et al 2011 the organic loading rate applied to r1 considering only the n alkanes contribution was 6 2 17 kg cod m3 d table 1 it is difficult to compare the performance of bioreactors in different studies since often pre treatment post treatment is applied and the performance is calculated over the entire system including the pre treatment steps rather than reporting the biodegradation efficiency lu et al 2009 moreover often cod measurements are made to assess the reactors performance instead of analysis of specific target compounds dong et al 2011 thus it is not always possible to conclude if the bioreactors are capable of removing the insoluble n alkanes within pw and what is the actual efficiency of the biological treatment with reactors as presented in this study and pw of a similar composition the volume of aeration basins to treat e g pw with a flow rate of 20 000 m3 day would be approximately 37 500 m3 if both reactors would be connected in series with an hrt of 15 h in r1 however potentially the size of the reactors can be reduced by 25 000 m3 because most of n alkanes are biodegraded already in r1 table 1 and the capacity of the reactors can be even higher if biomass concentration would be increased by implementing a sludge retention system another consideration when choosing an activated sludge system for treatment of pw is the excess sludge production with a sludge yield reported for refinery wastewater ranging from 0 3 to 0 5 kg ss kg cod fakhru l razi et al 2010 very large amounts of excess sludge would be produced if pw with high influent cod concentrations would be treated if intracellular accumulation of neutral lipids can be achieved as shown in section 3 2 2 and a cheap extraction method of neutral lipids can be developed this sludge can become of value otherwise a large amount of excess sludge needs to be treated and disposed of fig 5 illustrates the conversion rates of different n alkane chain lengths during period v the conversion rates of individual n alkanes in r1 followed the trend of influent concentrations with increasing influent concentrations corresponding to an increased removal rate the maximum conversion rate was found for c17 10 37 mg l h whereas the minimum for c33 1 53 mg l h both the maximum and minimum conversion rates correspond to minimum and maximum influent concentrations of 22 9 and 208 3 mg l respectively interestingly our results provide evidence that besides n alkane biodegradation also other non polar compounds were biodegraded fig 6 contains chromatograms of untreated pw fig 6 a and a sample taken from r1 fig 6 b the dilution factor of a raw pw sample was 130 whereas the dilution factor of treated sample was 45 by taking into account also the dilution within the reactor the unresolved area as well as unidentified peaks shown in fig 6 a were practically absent in the chromatograms obtained for samples taken from r1 fig 6 b the disappearance of these is an indicator of biodegradation of those compounds in the reactor a borkumensis sk2 has been reported to grow on several hydrocarbons other than alkanes including branched aliphatic as well as isoprenoid hydrocarbons alkylarenes organic alkyl sulphuric compounds alkylcycloalkanes volatile fatty acids pyruvate and its methyl ether yakimov et al 1998 sabirova et al 2006 schneiker et al 2006 here we demonstrate removal of a mixture of n alkanes as well as other non polar compounds in a complex pw matrix and in a continuously operated bioreactor this is of great importance if real wastewater needs to be treated since one of the biggest challenges for physical chemical post treatment is not only removal of small suspended oil particles but also removal of dissolved organic compounds dong et al 2011 it is important to realise that the operated system was non sterile and the removal of other non polar compounds may be attributed to different microorganisms than a borkumensis sk2 eventually evolving in r1 however given the high abundance of n alkanes within the concentrated pw table s1 and the reported competitive advantage of a borkumensis sk2 to scavenge on the rather insoluble substrate kasai et al 2002 cappello and yakimov 2010 it should have remained as the dominant microorganism within the system throughout the operational period indeed 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis revealed that a borkumensis was the dominant microorganisms in both r1 and r2 representing about 40 50 of the total microbial community table s2 3 2 2 production of intracellular and extracellular neutral lipids coupled to n alkane biodegradation table 2 summarizes the conditions under which production of neutral lipids was observed in r1 and r2 as well as concentrations of intracellular and extracellular wes tags and fas besides we like and tag like neutral lipids other lipophilic compounds such as diacylglycerol like and monoglyceryl like compounds were also detected in both intracellular figure s2 and extracellular fractions figure s3 accumulation of neutral lipids was observed both in r1 and r2 table 2 shows that in general more we like neutral lipids compared to tag like and fas were produced in both reactors for example maximum concentration of extracellular tag like and we like neutral lipids reached 0 2 and 6 7 g l respectively in r1 similarly in r2 the maximum concentration of tag like and we like neutral lipids were 0 33 and 6 15 g l interestingly accumulation of these compounds within r1 occurred even though residual soluble concentrations of both nh4 n and p were present at sufficiently high levels the accumulation of neutral lipids in r1 as well as r2 decreased once the carbon source became limiting during period vi table 2 in r2 extracellular we like lipids concentration dropped from approximately 2 6 g l during period v to 0 03 during period vi it becomes clear that accumulation of neutral lipids within r1 occurred in a broad range of residual total n alkane phosphorous or total n alkane nh4 n ratios the ratio ranges at which accumulation occurred were 0 5 47 5 and 10 8 88 1 for nh4 n and p respectively however from table 2 it is also obvious that more neutral lipids in particular wes was produced in r2 compared to r1 with the amount of data gathered in this study good correlation between individual parameters within the reactors and the amounts of neutral lipids quantified could not be established the only exception with a reasonable linear correlation r2 0 89 could be found between residual n alkane concentration in r2 and the extracellular we content with higher residual n alkane concentration in the reactor more extracellular we could be quantified intracellular accumulation of neutral lipids in r2 was lower than extracellular production throughout the operational period the highest intracellular concentrations of we like and tag like lipids could be observed during period ii when n alkane concentration from r1 effluent was above 650 mg l and residual n alkane concentration inside the reactor was above 300 mg l also in the case of r2 it seems that accumulation of neutral lipids only takes place during periods with sufficient residual n alkane concentration within the reactor table 2 the results obtained in our study suggest that intracellular accumulation of neutral lipids by a borkumensis sk2 in a complex pw matrix is not only nitrogen or phosphorous limitation related since accumulation in both r1 and r2 occurred during carbon non limiting conditions with sufficient nutrients available a similar phenomenon was previously observed by da silva et al 2016 when treating lubricant waste rich in n alkanes using a borkumensis sk2 as inoculum it was hypothesized that the accumulation of neutral lipids could be associated with removal of n alkane oxidation intermediates toxic to a borkumensis sk2 namely fatty alcohols which are known to be the first products from n alkane biodegradation da silva et al 2016 it has been reported by several authors that production and excretion of neutral lipids has an advantage over intracellular accumulation because extracellular production is not cell volume limited and in fact is a key to make the process economically viable alvarez 2010 manilla pérez et al 2010 the excretion of produced neutral lipids took place at the same conditions as intracellular accumulation throughout the operational period in both reactors interestingly we demonstrate that conditions within r2 were created under which extracellular we like lipids were accumulated at concentrations up to 12 times higher than intracellular characteristic for these periods are low nitrogen concentrations phosphorous concentrations below 5 15 mg l and around 100 140 mg l of residual n alkanes this is an important outcome since extracellular production of neutral lipids has been suggested as one of the main aspects to make the process economically viable due to expensive downstream processing when these compounds occur intracellularly alvarez 2010 manilla pérez et al 2010 manilla pérez et al 2010 demonstrated the ability of a borkumensis sk2 to produce and excrete lipids when grown on hexadecane or pyruvate as the sole carbon source here we show that this can be achieved with a complex pw matrix as the carbon source to better evaluate the economic viability of the production of neutral lipids coupled to pw treatment detailed mass balances are needed to understand the fraction of influent organics being converted to both intracellular and extracellular neutral lipids the current paper aims to demonstrate the feasibility of efficient pw treatment coupled to simultaneous production of neutral lipids for the first time rather than performing detailed mass balances 4 conclusions the results presented here suggest that aerobic biological treatment of pw while using a specialised inoculum may be an interesting alternative efficient n alkane biodegradation in continuously operated bioreactor while treating real pw is possible with a borkumensis sk2 as the dominant microorganism within the reactors besides n alkanes other non polar organic compounds are biodegraded in bioreactors inoculated with a borkumensis sk2 when treating pw simultaneous accumulation and excretion of neutral lipids by microbial consortia can be achieved and with adequate conditions the process can be steered to predominant accumulation of extracellular neutral lipids the simultaneous process of hydrocarbon biodegradation and production of neutral lipids while treating pw could offer an interesting alternative for the oil and gas industry especially if extracellular neutral lipids can be produced further investigations with detailed mass balances may reveal an alternative for treatment of pw coupled to bio recovery of valuable compounds acknowledgements this work was performed in the cooperation framework of wetsus european

19232,produced water pw is the largest waste stream generated by oil and gas industry it is commonly treated by physical chemical processes due to high salt content and poor biodegradability of water insoluble compounds such as n alkanes n alkanes can represent a major fraction of organic contaminants within pw in this study the possibility of simultaneous n alkane biodegradation and production of neutral lipids in a concentrated pw stream with a borkumenis sk2 as the sole reactor inoculum was investigated n alkane removal efficiency up to 99 6 with influent alkane cod of 7 4 g l was achieved in a continuously operated reactor system gas chromatography results also showed that the majority of other non polar compounds present in the pw were biodegraded biodegradation of n alkanes was accompanied by simultaneous production of neutral lipids mostly wax ester we alike compounds we demonstrate that under nutrient limited conditions and 108 9 3 3 mg l residual n alkane concentration the accumulation of extracellular we alike compounds can be up to 12 times higher compared to intracellular reaching 3 08 grams per litre of reactor volume g lreactor extracellularly and 0 28 g lreactor intracellularly with residual n alkane concentration of 311 5 34 2 mg l accumulation of extracellular and intracellular we alike compounds can reach up to 6 15 and 0 91 g lreactor respectively to the best of our knowledge simultaneous pw treatment coupled with production of neutral lipids has never been demonstrated before graphical abstract image 1 keywords produced water biological treatment alkane biodegradation neutral lipids production 1 introduction water co produced with oil and gas is referred to as produced water pw cakmakce et al 2008 it is a complex mixture of organic and inorganic compounds tellez et al 2002 fakhru l razi et al 2009 with varying composition depending on the reservoir characteristics operation strategy production process geological structure of the formation lifetime of reservoirs chemicals used in production facilities ozgun et al 2013a 2013b rehman et al 2018 and has been reported as the largest waste stream in oil and gas industry fakhru l razi et al 2009 contaminants such as organics and salts within pw have negative effects on the environment upon direct discharge hence several organisations e g ospar usepa and countries e g venezuela people s republic of china australia have set stringent discharge rules with respect to both salinity and organic content of treated pw díaz et al 2000 rincón et al 2003 tellez et al 2005 lefebvre and moletta 2006 fakhru l razi et al 2009 igunnu and chen 2012 due to the stringent discharge limits for pw many of the oil and gas wells in the u s were reported to reach their economic limit since production maintenance treatment and disposal costs were higher than the selling price in 2005 tellez et al 2005 while the selling price in the early 2000s was high millard et al 2017 since historically substitutes for oil exist its price may decrease rapidly millard et al 2017 for example the price of crude oil dropped by more than a half from july 2014 to january 2015 millard et al 2017 meaning that the costs of extraction and processing should be minimised conventionally pw is treated by a combination of several physical and chemical processes such as coagulation hydro cyclones flotation units and membrane processes but they are expensive to apply due to high start up and running costs lefebvre and moletta 2006 cakmakce et al 2008 knutsen 2011 ozgun et al 2013a moreover chemical processes can produce hazardous sludge knutsen 2011 another drawback of current physical chemical treatment technologies of pw is their inability to remove small suspended oil particles and dissolved organics lefebvre and moletta 2006 fakhru l razi et al 2009 dong et al 2011 space limitations offshore do not allow for implementation of large bioreactors however onshore it has been proposed to incorporate biological removal of organic contaminants from pw because of cost effectiveness of biological compared to physical chemical treatment tellez et al 2005 lefebvre and moletta 2006 fakhru l razi et al 2009 lu et al 2009 fakhru l razi et al 2010 pw is often a highly saline stream díaz et al 2000 freire et al 2001 lefebvre and moletta 2006 fakhru l razi et al 2009 and around 90 of total hydrocarbons within the stream are dispersed oil alkanes tellez et al 2002 the salinity of pw introduces microorganisms to a challenge of dealing with osmotic stress if biological treatment is applied the low solubility of hydrocarbon substrates makes them difficult to biodegrade because all known hydrocarbon oxidizing enzymes are cell bound tellez et al 2002 hydrocarbons with chain lengths above c12 are almost insoluble in water and bacteria capable of degrading them need to produce biosurfactants either to attach to the substrate or to solubilize it for uptake singh et al 2012 these molecules are also chemically very inert and need to be activated by specific enzymes for biological conversion singh et al 2012 anaerobic biological treatment has several advantages over aerobic biological treatment such as net energy recovery reduced surplus sludge production and possibility to apply higher loading rates xiao and roberts 2010 some researchers have demonstrated the efficiency of for example addition of anaerobic zone to waste stabilization ponds for removal of heavy metals oil and grease shpiner et al 2009a 2009b or application of anaerobic baffled reactors for removal of oil and suspended solids su et al 2007 from pw despite the potential advantages of anaerobic biological treatment over aerobic thus far most researchers have been focusing on aerobic biological treatment of pw su et al 2007 lu et al 2009 fakhru l razi et al 2010 dong et al 2011 mancini et al 2012 the research focus on aerobic treatment of pw is mainly due to high sensitivity of anaerobic biomass towards osmotic stress and other potentially toxic compounds within pw khong et al 2012 in addition anaerobic degradation of alkanes and other petroleum hydrocarbons proceeds at much slower rate and is less efficient than degradation under aerobic conditions heider et al 1998 berdugo clavijo and gieg 2014 application of pure cultures of specialised marine hydrocarbonoclastic microorganisms as inoculum in bioreactors has not been a widely recognised approach for pw treatment neither in aerobic nor in anaerobic biological treatment alcanivorax borkumensis sk2 is a marine hydrocarbonoclastic bacterium with a highly specialised metabolism for n alkane degradation kasai et al 2002 head et al 2006 schneiker et al 2006 cappello and yakimov 2010 one of its peculiar features is the ability to produce intracellular and extracellular neutral lipids in the form of wax esters we and triacylglycerols tag upon exposure to abundance of hydrocarbons kalscheuer et al 2007 manilla pérez et al 2011 alvarez 2010 reported an increasing interest in bacterial production of we and tag due to increasing global demand for fats oils and we industrially tag can be used for production of for example personal care products plastics detergents soaps resins and lubricants wax esters can be used in production of lubricants surface coatings and cosmetics alvarez 2010 the unique features of a borkumensis sk2 can potentially allow for aerobic biological treatment of pw coupled with recovery of valuable compounds we and tag in this study we explore the applicability of a borkumensis sk2 as inoculum for biological treatment of oily part of pw obtained from a full scale physical separation process and investigate the conditions allowing for simultaneous production of intracellular and extracellular neutral lipids this contribution is not aiming to give detailed mass balances with respect to production of neutral lipids but is rather aiming to demonstrate the concept with real pw for the first time we demonstrate efficient more than 90 n alkane biodegradation both in batch and continuous experiments biodegradation of other non polar compounds as well as nutrient non limited production of intracellular and extracellular neutral lipids 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor system inoculum and produced water two continuously stirred tank reactors cstrs without sludge retention connected in series were inoculated with a borkumensis sk2 dsm number 11573 the culture was previously adapted to the produced water concentrate as the sole carbon and energy source in batch experiments using saline medium onr7a prepared according to dmsz braunschweig germany a simplified reactor scheme is shown in fig 1 reactor 1 r1 with a working volume of 2 l was operated at 28 c 40 oxygen saturation ph of 7 5 and with nitrogen non limited conditions the detection of undissolved matter such as microbial cells emulsified alkanes and hydrophobic matter produced by bacteria was measured in real time as optical density od600 at the near infrared region by a photometric probe full details on the control and monitoring system can be found in da silva et al 2016 reactor 2 r2 with a working volume of 4 l was operated at room temperature 19 21 c under oxygen depleted and saturated conditions ph of 7 5 and nitrogen limiting conditions oxygen depleted and saturated conditions were studied because dissolved oxygen concentration of 2 100 has been reported to be suitable for we production in other hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria such as fundibacter jadensis t9 bredemeier et al 2003 if this is true for a borkumensis sk2 it allows to optimize the aeration costs for production of neutral lipids mixing of r1 was achieved by a metal propeller with a diameter of 4 cm at 900 rpm whereas mixing of r2 was achieved by two metal propellers attached to one shaft at 500 rpm concentrated oily part of pw from a full scale physical separation process was obtained from shell the netherlands and fed to the reactor system as a separate stream the total c10 c33 n alkane concentration of the pw concentrate was determined as described below and was 98 g l which accounts for a cod of 339 2 g cod l detailed analyses of n alkanes in pw are provided in table s1 the pw fed to r1 was mixed with onr7a medium and phosphate source the onr7a medium was modified for nitrogen concentration of 334 mg l and phosphorous concentration in the phosphorous solution source was adjusted to reach influent concentration of 62 mg l in order to have sufficient amount of iron for microbial growth fecl2 4h2o concentration was adjusted from 0 00001 m in the original recipe to 0 00021 m after the first 112 h of continuous r1 operation in this study the increase of iron concentration was found to be necessary after observing decreasing oxygen feed rate in r1 with the 40 oxygen saturation as the set point indicating decreasing microbial activity in the reactor fig 2 oxygen uptake rate is defined here as oxygen flow measured with ez control device from applikon biotechnology inc delft the netherlands to maintain the set point of 40 oxygen saturation in the reactor 2 2 reactor operation two experiments were performed during this study in the first experiment the performance of r1 in a controlled batch operation was studied in terms of n alkane removal to evaluate if efficient n alkane biodegradation can be achieved within the complex pw matrix with the chosen inoculum the batch experiment lasted for 54 h a borkumensis sk2 was inoculated in onr7a medium containing 238 mg l nh4 n 34 mg l po4 p and 23 5 ml 19 8 g of pw the resulting n alkane cod n p ratio at the beginning of the batch was 234 4 7 1 the inoculum was prepared as described above during the second experiment r1 and r2 were operated continuously in series and performance of both reactors was studied in terms of n alkane biodegradation and production of neutral lipids concentrated stream of oily pw onr7a medium and phosphorous source were fed as separate streams to r1 resulting in influent concentrations of 334 9 and 62 mg l for nh4 n and po4 p respectively the flow rate of pw was reduced in steps resulting in influent n alkane cod concentrations of 10305 66 8766 40 and 7205 160 mg l and a hrt in r1 of 14 9 0 09 h finally the hrt in r1 was decreased down to 28 9 0 18 h while keeping the influent nh4 n and po4 p concentration constant and n alkane cod influent concentration of 7411 197 mg l the resulting n p and cod loads are depicted in fig 2 a b the nitrogen and phosphorous load was kept such in order to achieve carbon limiting conditions within r1 before decreasing the loading rate pw was spiked into the reactor to assess carbon limiting conditions a responsive increase in oxygen uptake rate indicates the previous carbon limiting conditions the entire experiment was divided into six periods shown in fig 2 a periods ii iv v and vi were periods with stable oxygen uptake rate for at least 3 hydraulic retention times the removal of n alkanes and production of neutral lipids was studied during these stable periods only period vi was carbon source limited since spiking of additional carbon source induced an immediate increase of the oxygen uptake rate from 4 to 6 24 l h fig 2 a the phosphorous and nitrogen loading rates applied in r1 are depicted in fig 2 b no additional dosing of nutrients was performed in r2 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 ammonium nitrogen total particulate nitrogen and phosphorous ammonium nitrogen in the reactors was measured on daily bases in triplicate for r1 and in duplicate for r2 two ml samples were taken directly from the reactors and immediately filtered through 0 45 μm filters further analysis was performed with lck 302 lck 303 or lck 304 hach gmbh germany ammonium kits the relative standard deviation for ammonium nitrogen analysis in triplicate was up to 28 in the concentration range below 1 mg nh4 n l and up to 8 in the higher concentration range the deviation range for duplicate samples of r2 was up to 28 in the lower range and up to 4 above 1 mg l nh4 n biomass concentration in the bioreactors was measured as total particulate nitrogen tpn da silva et al 2016 samples taken from bioreactors were centrifuged at 20 350 xg for 5 min and washed with pbs 1x for 3 times finally the washed pellet was re suspended in mili q and total nitrogen was measured with lck 338 kit hach gmbh germany the relative standard deviation for tpn measurements in triplicate was 2 19 in the tn range of 20 40 mg n l and 4 16 in the higher range phosphorous concentration in the bioreactors was detected with icp elementary analysis sampling was performed once a day and measurements were made in triplicate for r1 and in duplicate for r2 samples were filtered through 0 45 μm filters diluted with deionised water to result in tds levels smaller than 1 g l and acidified to result in 2 nitric acid content within the samples these samples were analysed with perkin elmer optima 5300 dv icp apparatus equipped with perkin elmer software package winlab 32 3 3 1 0210 the relative standard deviation of triplicate measurements in r1 ranged from 1 to 14 throughout the operational period with only one exception where 27 deviation was measured the absolute deviation for duplicate measurements in r2 ranged from 1 to 13 2 3 2 extraction and analysis of hydrocarbons two times 15 ml samples for hydrocarbon analysis were collected on daily bases analysis was performed on samples taken during the stable operation periods ii iv v and vi extraction of hydrocarbons and analysis of c10 c33 n alkanes was done as described in da silva et al 2016 extractions were performed on mixed liquor samples including the volatile suspended solids therefore the effluent n alkane concentration adsorbed to microbial cells was taken into account to measure the total n alkanes in the effluent the chromatograms and data for hydrocarbon quantification were obtained with galaxie software version 1 9 302 530 in the sequence of sample injection also standard solutions of c8 c20 and c21 c40 with 20 and 40 ppm of each compound as well as standard solutions of c10 c20 c30 and c40 with concentrations from 25 to 200 ppm were injected the quantification of hydrocarbons was done based on area for c8 c20 and based on response factor area divided by theoretical concentration in the standards for c21 c40 relative standard deviations for n alkane analysis in raw pw concentrate are shown in table s1 the deviation range was 1 14 with higher variation in the range c10 to c14 in the effluent samples the relative standard deviations between duplicate measurements of c10 to c12 ranged between 0 03 up to 141 for c13 to c29 the deviation range was between 0 04 and 26 4 and for c30 to c33 between 1 2 and 141 4 2 3 3 extraction and thin layer chromatography tlc of neutral lipids twenty five ml duplicate samples for extraction and analysis of neutral lipids were taken on daily bases analysis was performed on samples taken during the stable operation periods ii iv v and vi samples were taken directly from r2 whereas composite effluent samples were collected from r1 to avoid interference with the process performance solid and liquid phase of the reactor samples were separated by centrifugation for 10 min at 15 000 xg and 10 c by a centrifuge avanti j25 beckman coulter both phases were freeze dried and the extraction of non polar compounds was done by use of chloroform methanol 3 1 v v solution the extraction of neutral lipids was adapted from folch et al 1957 whereas the removal of trace polar compounds was achieved with polarity based fractionation on spe columns lc si spe tubes 6 ml 1 g the fractionation process was adapted from revellame et al 2012 as described in da silva et al 2016 the fractions obtained were analysed with thin layer chromatography tlc silica gel plates 60 f254 10 20 cm by merck kgaa were used to perform tlc with n hexane diethyl ether acetic acid 80 20 1 v v v serving as mobile phase lipids were highlighted on 8 2 cm elution area by staining with iodine vapour silva et al 2010 for recognition of different non polar compounds oleic acid fatty acids oleyl oleate methyl hexanoate methyl linoleate methyl oleate wes glyceryl tri oleate glyceryl trihexanoate glyceryl trilinoleate tags glyceryl di oleate dags glyceryl mono oleate mags were used as references each fraction was re suspended in 250 μl of chloroform and 5 μl were used for tlc analysis images of tlc plates were processed with imajej software by converting them to 8 bit greyscale and increasing the contrast by 1 of saturated pixels 2 3 4 quantification of tags wes and fatty acids fas each class of neutral lipids was scraped off from the tlc plate transferred into a pasteur pipet containing glass wool and eluted from the silica for three times with 0 5 ml of chloroform santala et al 2011 the extracts were dried with gentle flow of nitrogen and their weight was measured daily till constant value the quantification was done in one replicate for each sampling time 2 3 5 dna extraction and 16s rrna gene sequencing samples of well homogenized biomass were centrifuged 4000 rpm 10 min at 4 c and preserved at 20 c until dna isolation total genomic dna was extracted using a fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals solon oh according to instructions of the manufacturer amplification of dna illumina libraries preparation amplicon sequencing illumina miseq and bioinformatics analysis of the data were performed at baseclear bv leiden the netherlands as described earlier roman et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 efficient n alkane biodegradation within the complex pw matrix in a controlled batch experiment dispersed oil alkanes may represent as much as 90 of total hydrocarbons in pw tellez et al 2002 fig 3 shows efficient c10 c33 n alkane biodegradation during the controlled batch experiment the concentration of aliphatics dropped from 1150 3 32 3 mg l at the start of the experiment to 588 2 11 1 mg l after 24 6 h and finally to 20 6 mg l 0 7 mg l after 53 8 h the final concentration of sum of c10 c33 n alkanes corresponds to a removal efficiency of 98 2 profiles of individual n alkanes concentrations during the batch experiment are shown in figure s1 the overall trend for individual n alkanes was similar to the sum of n alkanes shown in fig 3 resulting in low concentrations at the end of the batch experiment and overall removal efficiencies above 90 the downwards trend of nh4 n in fig 3 a suggests that the removal mechanism of n alkanes is biodegradation since no other carbon source was provided for microbial growth during the experiment no nitrification was found in the reactor data not shown the headspace of the reactor was not monitored for ammonia stripping or n alkane stripping efficient ammonia stripping is only possible at high ph 9 5 and above high gas flow rates and large contact area between liquid and gas guštin and marinšek logar 2011 since the ph in our study was controlled at 7 5 and the maximum oxygen flow peaked at 3 9 l h fig 3 b significant ammonia stripping is unlikely to occur shorter chain n alkanes on the other hand have been demonstrated to partition into gas phase during air stripping cazoir et al 2012 in a set up of similar size as used in the present study cazoir et al 2012 demonstrated that with an air flow rate of 2 4 lair lreactor h more than the maximum oxygen flow rate during the batch experiment only hydrocarbons with chain lengths of c10 to c12 can be stripped from the aqueous phase c10 to c12 contributed 4 9 0 3 of total hydrocarbons analysed in this study therefore the impact of stripping on the overall c10 c33 removal presented in fig 3 a is expected to be rather small especially considering that the actual oxygen flow rate was much smaller than reported by cazoir et al 2012 fig 3 b moreover partitioning of these alkanes into the gas phase can be even further reduced because a borkumensis is shown to solubilize them by producing biosurfactants perfumo et al 2010 also the optical density profile in fig 3 b follows the trend of n alkane disappearance indicating dispersion of n alkanes with biosurfactants and of microbial growth the biosurfactants produced by a borkumensis sk2 are glycolipidic molecules containing nitrogen perfumo et al 2010 interestingly we demonstrate that a borkumensis sk2 is capable of biodegrading even tritriacontane c33 thus far a borkumensis sk2 has been reported to biodegrade n alkanes up to c32 schneiker et al 2006 the above results confirmed the ability of a borkumensis sk2 to biodegrade n alkanes even within the complex pw matrix at seawater salinity levels thus showing its affinity to oil hydrocarbons as reported before kasai et al 2002 cappello and yakimov 2010 moreover due to the fact that it is a marine microorganism yakimov et al 1998 no adaptation period was necessary to the salinity levels of seawater applied in this study 3 2 continuous reactor operation efficient alkane removal coupled with production of neutral lipids 3 2 1 continuous system with efficient n alkane biodegradation continuous system yielded good removal efficiency of n alkanes both with the r1 and r2 combined as well as with r1 alone n alkane removal efficiency profiles in fig 4 clearly show the possibility of efficient biodegradation in a continuously operated system a hrt of 15 h in r1 30 h in r2 could yield up to 82 6 1 9 removal efficiency within r1 alone and up to 94 5 1 0 removal efficiency within the total system upon increase of r1 hrt to 30 h 60 h in r2 the removal efficiency within r1 alone up to 90 3 2 1 could be achieved whereas in the entire system up to 98 8 1 0 of n alkanes could be removed table 1 summarizes the average reactors performance during the periods of stable oxygen uptake rates in r1 the good removal efficiency of n alkanes was achieved while operating r1 at organic loading rates relatively high for an aerobic activated sludge system the organic loading rates applied here are approximately four times higher than those reported before in previous studies the organic loading rates applied in biological treatment systems ranged from 0 3 kg cod m3 d in a pilot scale hydrolysis acidification bio contact oxidation system treating pw from oilfield in china ha bco lu et al 2009 up to 4 2 kg cod m3 d in an activated sludge and mbbr system treating pw from an oilfield injection pipe dong et al 2011 the organic loading rate applied to r1 considering only the n alkanes contribution was 6 2 17 kg cod m3 d table 1 it is difficult to compare the performance of bioreactors in different studies since often pre treatment post treatment is applied and the performance is calculated over the entire system including the pre treatment steps rather than reporting the biodegradation efficiency lu et al 2009 moreover often cod measurements are made to assess the reactors performance instead of analysis of specific target compounds dong et al 2011 thus it is not always possible to conclude if the bioreactors are capable of removing the insoluble n alkanes within pw and what is the actual efficiency of the biological treatment with reactors as presented in this study and pw of a similar composition the volume of aeration basins to treat e g pw with a flow rate of 20 000 m3 day would be approximately 37 500 m3 if both reactors would be connected in series with an hrt of 15 h in r1 however potentially the size of the reactors can be reduced by 25 000 m3 because most of n alkanes are biodegraded already in r1 table 1 and the capacity of the reactors can be even higher if biomass concentration would be increased by implementing a sludge retention system another consideration when choosing an activated sludge system for treatment of pw is the excess sludge production with a sludge yield reported for refinery wastewater ranging from 0 3 to 0 5 kg ss kg cod fakhru l razi et al 2010 very large amounts of excess sludge would be produced if pw with high influent cod concentrations would be treated if intracellular accumulation of neutral lipids can be achieved as shown in section 3 2 2 and a cheap extraction method of neutral lipids can be developed this sludge can become of value otherwise a large amount of excess sludge needs to be treated and disposed of fig 5 illustrates the conversion rates of different n alkane chain lengths during period v the conversion rates of individual n alkanes in r1 followed the trend of influent concentrations with increasing influent concentrations corresponding to an increased removal rate the maximum conversion rate was found for c17 10 37 mg l h whereas the minimum for c33 1 53 mg l h both the maximum and minimum conversion rates correspond to minimum and maximum influent concentrations of 22 9 and 208 3 mg l respectively interestingly our results provide evidence that besides n alkane biodegradation also other non polar compounds were biodegraded fig 6 contains chromatograms of untreated pw fig 6 a and a sample taken from r1 fig 6 b the dilution factor of a raw pw sample was 130 whereas the dilution factor of treated sample was 45 by taking into account also the dilution within the reactor the unresolved area as well as unidentified peaks shown in fig 6 a were practically absent in the chromatograms obtained for samples taken from r1 fig 6 b the disappearance of these is an indicator of biodegradation of those compounds in the reactor a borkumensis sk2 has been reported to grow on several hydrocarbons other than alkanes including branched aliphatic as well as isoprenoid hydrocarbons alkylarenes organic alkyl sulphuric compounds alkylcycloalkanes volatile fatty acids pyruvate and its methyl ether yakimov et al 1998 sabirova et al 2006 schneiker et al 2006 here we demonstrate removal of a mixture of n alkanes as well as other non polar compounds in a complex pw matrix and in a continuously operated bioreactor this is of great importance if real wastewater needs to be treated since one of the biggest challenges for physical chemical post treatment is not only removal of small suspended oil particles but also removal of dissolved organic compounds dong et al 2011 it is important to realise that the operated system was non sterile and the removal of other non polar compounds may be attributed to different microorganisms than a borkumensis sk2 eventually evolving in r1 however given the high abundance of n alkanes within the concentrated pw table s1 and the reported competitive advantage of a borkumensis sk2 to scavenge on the rather insoluble substrate kasai et al 2002 cappello and yakimov 2010 it should have remained as the dominant microorganism within the system throughout the operational period indeed 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis revealed that a borkumensis was the dominant microorganisms in both r1 and r2 representing about 40 50 of the total microbial community table s2 3 2 2 production of intracellular and extracellular neutral lipids coupled to n alkane biodegradation table 2 summarizes the conditions under which production of neutral lipids was observed in r1 and r2 as well as concentrations of intracellular and extracellular wes tags and fas besides we like and tag like neutral lipids other lipophilic compounds such as diacylglycerol like and monoglyceryl like compounds were also detected in both intracellular figure s2 and extracellular fractions figure s3 accumulation of neutral lipids was observed both in r1 and r2 table 2 shows that in general more we like neutral lipids compared to tag like and fas were produced in both reactors for example maximum concentration of extracellular tag like and we like neutral lipids reached 0 2 and 6 7 g l respectively in r1 similarly in r2 the maximum concentration of tag like and we like neutral lipids were 0 33 and 6 15 g l interestingly accumulation of these compounds within r1 occurred even though residual soluble concentrations of both nh4 n and p were present at sufficiently high levels the accumulation of neutral lipids in r1 as well as r2 decreased once the carbon source became limiting during period vi table 2 in r2 extracellular we like lipids concentration dropped from approximately 2 6 g l during period v to 0 03 during period vi it becomes clear that accumulation of neutral lipids within r1 occurred in a broad range of residual total n alkane phosphorous or total n alkane nh4 n ratios the ratio ranges at which accumulation occurred were 0 5 47 5 and 10 8 88 1 for nh4 n and p respectively however from table 2 it is also obvious that more neutral lipids in particular wes was produced in r2 compared to r1 with the amount of data gathered in this study good correlation between individual parameters within the reactors and the amounts of neutral lipids quantified could not be established the only exception with a reasonable linear correlation r2 0 89 could be found between residual n alkane concentration in r2 and the extracellular we content with higher residual n alkane concentration in the reactor more extracellular we could be quantified intracellular accumulation of neutral lipids in r2 was lower than extracellular production throughout the operational period the highest intracellular concentrations of we like and tag like lipids could be observed during period ii when n alkane concentration from r1 effluent was above 650 mg l and residual n alkane concentration inside the reactor was above 300 mg l also in the case of r2 it seems that accumulation of neutral lipids only takes place during periods with sufficient residual n alkane concentration within the reactor table 2 the results obtained in our study suggest that intracellular accumulation of neutral lipids by a borkumensis sk2 in a complex pw matrix is not only nitrogen or phosphorous limitation related since accumulation in both r1 and r2 occurred during carbon non limiting conditions with sufficient nutrients available a similar phenomenon was previously observed by da silva et al 2016 when treating lubricant waste rich in n alkanes using a borkumensis sk2 as inoculum it was hypothesized that the accumulation of neutral lipids could be associated with removal of n alkane oxidation intermediates toxic to a borkumensis sk2 namely fatty alcohols which are known to be the first products from n alkane biodegradation da silva et al 2016 it has been reported by several authors that production and excretion of neutral lipids has an advantage over intracellular accumulation because extracellular production is not cell volume limited and in fact is a key to make the process economically viable alvarez 2010 manilla pérez et al 2010 the excretion of produced neutral lipids took place at the same conditions as intracellular accumulation throughout the operational period in both reactors interestingly we demonstrate that conditions within r2 were created under which extracellular we like lipids were accumulated at concentrations up to 12 times higher than intracellular characteristic for these periods are low nitrogen concentrations phosphorous concentrations below 5 15 mg l and around 100 140 mg l of residual n alkanes this is an important outcome since extracellular production of neutral lipids has been suggested as one of the main aspects to make the process economically viable due to expensive downstream processing when these compounds occur intracellularly alvarez 2010 manilla pérez et al 2010 manilla pérez et al 2010 demonstrated the ability of a borkumensis sk2 to produce and excrete lipids when grown on hexadecane or pyruvate as the sole carbon source here we show that this can be achieved with a complex pw matrix as the carbon source to better evaluate the economic viability of the production of neutral lipids coupled to pw treatment detailed mass balances are needed to understand the fraction of influent organics being converted to both intracellular and extracellular neutral lipids the current paper aims to demonstrate the feasibility of efficient pw treatment coupled to simultaneous production of neutral lipids for the first time rather than performing detailed mass balances 4 conclusions the results presented here suggest that aerobic biological treatment of pw while using a specialised inoculum may be an interesting alternative efficient n alkane biodegradation in continuously operated bioreactor while treating real pw is possible with a borkumensis sk2 as the dominant microorganism within the reactors besides n alkanes other non polar organic compounds are biodegraded in bioreactors inoculated with a borkumensis sk2 when treating pw simultaneous accumulation and excretion of neutral lipids by microbial consortia can be achieved and with adequate conditions the process can be steered to predominant accumulation of extracellular neutral lipids the simultaneous process of hydrocarbon biodegradation and production of neutral lipids while treating pw could offer an interesting alternative for the oil and gas industry especially if extracellular neutral lipids can be produced further investigations with detailed

19233,the main processes contributing to elevated effluent suspended solids in the full scale aerobic granular sludge process were studied the two processes found to be most important were 1 rising of sludge due to degasification of nitrogen gas produced by denitrification and 2 wash out of particles that intrinsically do not settle such as certain fats and foams a mathematical model was made to describe the process of degasification of nitrogen gas during the feeding phase in an ags reactor the process of rising sludge due to degasification could be limited by stripping out the nitrogen gas before starting the settling phase in the process cycle the wash out of scum particles could be reduced by introducing a vertical scum baffle in front of the effluent weir similar to weirs in traditional clarifiers a full scale nereda reactor in the municipality of utrecht the netherlands was operated with a nitrogen stripping phase and scum baffles for 9 months at an average biomass concentration of 10 g l 1 and an average granulation grade of 84 in this period the influent suspended solids concentration was 230 118 mg l 1 and the concentration of effluent suspended solids was 7 8 3 8 mg l 1 graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge denitrification degasification nitrogen gas scum layer rising sludge effluent suspended solids 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags technology is a relatively new technology for the treatment of both domestic and industrial wastewater pronk et al 2015 ags technology was developed at laboratory scale in the late nineties heijnen and van loosdrecht 1998 morgenroth et al 1997 a full scale demonstration installation in gansbaai was started up in 2008 giesen et al 2013 and in 2011 the first full scale application was reported van der roest et al 2011 effluent requirements for cod total nitrogen en total phosphorus were easily met with average suspended solids effluent concentrations reported for full scale applications in the range of 5 mg l 1 to 20 mg l 1 see table 1 some reports indicate an increase in effluent suspended solids concentrations for ags reactors with increasing granulation li et al 2008 rocktäschel et al 2015 in most laboratory studies the focus is on the granulation process and wasting of sludge for ease of operation is combined with decanting of the effluent de kreuk et al 2005 as a result biomass is present in the effluent of laboratory reactors this poses no problem under laboratory conditions but for the full scale treatment of sewage the removal of suspended solids is an integral part of the purification process and is usually limited by law since hydraulics of laboratory and even pilot plant installations are not representative for full scale conditions effluent suspended solids can only effectively be studied at full scale installations in full scale applications the effluent and sludge withdrawal are separated processes this leads to relatively low suspended solids effluent concentrations certainly when compared to influent values pronk et al 2015 still the reported average values of 5 mg l 1 to 20 mg l 1 are higher than usually reported for conventional activated sludge processes which can be considerably lower than 10 mg l 1 parker et al 2001 elevated levels of effluent suspended solids have been intensively studied over the last decades in conventional activated sludge systems commonly reported issues in these systems are bulking sludge and foam formation jenkins 1992 another reported issue in secondary clarifiers is the rising of sludge due to denitrification henze et al 1993 denitrification can lead to nitrogen bubble formation degasification if over saturation of nitrogen gas in the liquid is reached the bubbles attach to the sludge flocs which then rise towards the top of the clarifier and wash out with the effluent sludge settling too fast indicated by a low sludge volume index svi is also reported to cause elevated levels of suspended solids in the effluent of conventional activated sludge systems although this effect is doubted by others reporting a strong relation with the flocculator design parker et al 2001 1996 vitasovic et al 1997 since reported svi values for full scale ags reactors are generally low 35 mg l 1 to 70 mg l 1 pronk et al 2015 van der roest et al 2011 this might also be a potential cause of elevated levels of effluent suspended solids besides a different sludge morphology and likely flocculation behaviour current granular sludge plants according to the nereda concept deviate also in hydraulics from secondary settling tanks secondary clarifiers have typical superficial upflow velocities of 0 5 m h 1 1 0 m h 1 while the complex flow in the clarifier is mainly caused by density currents zhou et al 1992 for the nereda technology effluent results from pumping influent in the bottom of the granular bed this generates an upward plug flow in the reactor with typical superficial velocities in the range of 2 m h 1 4 m h 1 through a granular bed with on top of that a layer of flocculent sludge the relatively higher upflow velocities in nereda reactors might be responsible for the washout of floating sludge and fat like particles in contrast to conventional activated sludge systems the mechanisms behind the formation and control of effluent suspended solids for full scale aerobic granular sludge reactors are not yet fully understood the aim of this study was to evaluate the main processes leading to effluent suspended solids in full scale ags reactors and the options to minimize effluent suspended solids therefore a full scale nereda reactor situated in the municipality of utrecht the netherlands was used to study the mechanisms leading to elevated suspended solids concentrations in the effluent in this study we focused on both removal of floating material and degasification of nitrogen gas hereto full scale experiments were performed and a mathematical model was developed to describe the degasification of nitrogen gas during the operation of the aerobic granular sludge reactor 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the plant in 2013 the dutch water authority hoogheemraadschap de stichtse rijnlanden took a 1050 m 3 aerobic granular sludge reactor in operation the reactor is located in the municipality of utrecht the netherlands and was designed by royal haskoningdhv under the trade name nereda the reactor has a footprint of 150 m 2 and a water depth of 7 00 m the influent pumps have a total capacity of 900 m 3 h 1 the influent is pumped directly from a main sewer line of the overvecht district in utrecht the sewage consists mainly of domestic wastewater wastewater characteristics are given in table 2 after screening by a 6 mm perforated plate screen the wastewater is directly pumped into the reactor during the trial the reactor was operated at a mlss concentration of 8 kg m 3 12 kg m 3 a svi5 of 34 ml g 1 57 ml g 1 a svi30 of 33 ml g 1 43 ml g 1 a volumetric loading rate of 0 6 m 3 m 3 d 1 to 2 7 m 3 m 3 d 1 and an average sludge loading rate of 0 08 kgcod kgmlss d about 84 of the biomass present in the reactor was granulated during the experimental period i e granule size larger than 0 2 mm average granule size distributions are shown in table 3 the reactor is equipped with two blowers each with a capacity of 400 m 3 h 1 air is supplied to the reactor using micro bubble diffusors evenly distributed on the floor of the tank the reactor is operated as a sequencing fed batch process with constant volume consisting of a combined feeding and effluent withdrawal step a reaction phase and a settling and sludge withdrawal step process conditions are set to target full biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal no possibilities for chemical dosing are present in the reactor during the trial nitrogen removal was established by nitrification and denitrification the cycle time varied between 4 and 8 h with 1 h of anaerobic feeding and simultaneous effluent withdrawal a variable reaction phase and a phase for mixing setting and decanting of sludge of 30 60 min the reaction phase was stopped when the set points 2 mg l 1 and 3 mg l 1 for respectively nh 4 n and no 3 n were reached during the reaction phase the dissolved oxygen concentration was controlled in the range of 1 0 mg l 1 to 2 0 mg l 1 the plant is in operation since the 1st of april 2013 the reactor was started up without baffles in front of the overflow weir at the 3rd of june 2015 vertical baffles were placed in front of the effluent weirs to investigate the effect of scum baffles on the concentration of effluent suspended solids 2 2 online measurements the reactor was equipped with probes for dissolved oxygen redox potential water level temperature turbidity and nitrate ammonium and phosphate are continuously measured using a filter unit and auto sampling device hach lange filtrax amtax and phosphax the filter unit was situated 0 5 m below the water surface sampling was done at an interval of 5 min a turbidity sensor hach lange solitax was present in the effluent gutter to observe the presence of suspended solids 2 3 sampling samples for analyses of influent and effluent were collected using refrigerated auto samplers collecting flow proportional samples for both influent and effluent suspended solids concentrations of both influent and effluent were measured by filtering 1 l of sample with a glass fiber filter which was dried at 105 c until no weight change was measured grab samples for mlss analyses were taken from the top of the reactor after at least 15 min of aeration at full capacity to ensure sufficiently mixed conditions 2 4 physical characteristics of the sludge to determine the granule size distribution 1 l of sample was poured over a series of sieves with different mesh sizes 200 μm 400 μm 630 μm 1000 μm and 2000 μm these sieve fractions together with 100 ml of unsieved sludge were dried at 105 c the sludge volume index svi was measured by pouring 1000 ml of mixed undiluted sludge into a graduated measuring cylinder the sludge volumes were measured after 5 and 30 min 2 5 microscopic analysis a leica microsystems ltd stereo zoom microscope m205 fa in combination with leica microsystems qwin v3 5 1 image analysis software was used to analyze the morphology of the sludge 2 6 modelling of n2 stripping a mathematical model was developed to calculate the concentrations of dissolved nitrogen gas in the reactor the solubility of nitrogen gas in water c s is dependent on the partial pressure of nitrogen gas in the gas phase p and is calculated using henrys law 1 c s m k h p here k h is the henrys constant for the solubility of nitrogen gas in water and m is the molar mass of nitrogen gas the henrys constant is a decreasing function of temperature meaning that the solubility of nitrogen gas in water decreases with an increasing temperature the partial pressure of nitrogen in the gas phase is both dependent on the gas fraction f and the pressure in the reactor the latter being the sum of atmospheric pressure p a t m and hydrostatic pressure 2 p f p a t m h ρ g here h is the water depth ρ is the mixture density and g is the gravitational acceleration the transfer of nitrogen gas between the air bubbles and the liquid is calculated by 3 d c d t α f k l a n c s c here c is the nitrogen gas concentration in the water phase k l is the mass transfer coefficient and a is the interfacial area of the gas bubbles the subscripts o and n indicate the values for oxygen gas and nitrogen gas the mass transfer rate is corrected for effects of wastewater contaminants α and fouling on the membrane aerators f the value of the product of k l and a for oxygen transfer k l a o is commonly measured during commissioning in full scale wastewater treatment plants and depends on the temperature for this study a value of k l a o including the effects of contaminants and fouling was used hereto the values for α and f were set to 1 this empirical value of k l a o can be used to derive a value for nitrogen gas by using higbies penetration theory higbie 1935 based on this model the following relation between the k l a for oxygen gas and nitrogen gas and the diffusion coefficient for oxygen gas d o and nitrogen gas d n for can be derived 4 k l a o k l a n d o d n both the diffusion coefficient and the henry coefficient need to be corrected for temperature for the diffusion coefficient this is based on the stokes einstein equation einstein 1905 in this equation the diffusion coefficient d is related to the temperature t and the dynamic viscosity μ t 5 d t d 0 t t 0 μ 0 μ t the viscosity is also depending on temperature according to equation the vogel fulcher tammann equation dagdug 2000 in which parameters a b and c are empirical parameters 6 μ t e a b c t the henry coefficient is corrected for temperature using the van t hoff equation van t hoff 1884 in which k h 0 is the henry coefficient at reference temperature t 0 is the reference temperature and h c is the temperature correction factor 7 k h t k h 0 e k h c 1 t 1 t 0 the stripping of nitrogen gas is done by aeration of the reactor with fine bubble aeration this leads to transport of dissolved nitrogen gas through the reactor a simple axial dispersion model can be used to describe the liquid backmixing of dissolved nitrogen gas in the reactor degaleesan and dudukovic 1998 in which x is the reactor depth 8 d c d t d a x 1 d 2 c d x 2 the axial dispersion coefficient d a x 1 is a lumped coefficient containing the effect of both turbulent dispersion and global convective recirculation in the reactor molecular diffusion in this case is neglected due to an expected limited impact a tracer experiment with nh4 was used to determine the value of d a x 1 to describe the transfer of nitrogen gas between the air bubbles and the water phase equation 4 is substituted in equation 3 if this equation is combined with the transport of nitrogen gas in the water phase according equation 8 a description for the stripping of nitrogen in a 1d bubble column is constructed 9 d c d t d a x 1 d 2 c d x 2 α f k l a o d n d o c s x c the saturation concentration for nitrogen gas according to equation 1 can be combined with the actual concentration to calculate the nitrogen gas deficit in the bulk liquid c d 10 c d c s c when over saturation occurs during aeration i e the actual concentration c is bigger than c s at ambient pressure and temperature it is assumed that n2 gas bubbles are formed immediately and efficiently stripped out of the bulk liquid this is modelled by artificially increasing the local k l a with an order of magnitude 2 7 modelling of mixing during imperfect plug flow feeding during feeding the bulk liquid in the reactor is pushed up towards the top of the reactor where the overflow weirs are situated to describe the transport of nitrogen gas during feeding the same axial dispersion model of equation 8 is used with a different value for d a x also an additional term is added to describe the transport of nitrogen gas through convection here v is the upflow velocity of the liquid in the reactor the value of d a x 2 was experimentally established by measuring a step response curve with nh4 as a tracer 11 d c d t d a x 2 d 2 c d x 2 v d c d x the influent is fed from the bottom of the reactor it is assumed that the influent concentration of dissolved nitrogen is equal to the equilibrium concentration of nitrogen gas at atmospheric pressure during the feeding phase denitrification can take place the denitrification rate depends on many parameters but in this case a lumped specific denitrification rate r is used the specific denitrification rate was measured in the reactor in the days before the experiment by measuring the decrease of the no3 concentration during an anoxic phase in the cycle this rate is multiplied by the mlss concentration x which is a function of the reactor depth the sludge bed is assumed to be in steady state and thus invariable in time in the simulations it was assumed that the sludge bed occupies the lower 4 m of the reactor and that the sludge is evenly distributed we can then write equation 11 as follows 12 d c d t d a x 2 d 2 c d x 2 v d c d x r x x in this model the water in the reactor can get over saturated with nitrogen gas this means that the local concentration of nitrogen gas c becomes larger than the local saturation concentration according to equation 1 it is assumed that nitrogen gas bubbles are formed immediately after over saturation most likely supersaturation of nitrogen gas can occur but the effect is assumed to be limited henze et al 1993 to solve the model a python code was written all model parameters are given in table 4 3 results 3 1 reactor operation the data were collected between june 2015 and may 2016 in this period the reactor was run stable and without interruption with average effluent values of cod of 41 mg l 1 n kj n of 4 05 mg l 1 nh 4 n of 1 29 mg l 1 no 3 n of 3 72 mg l 1 p tot of 0 51 mg l 1 and po 4 3 p of 0 26 mg l 1 showing an highly efficient n and p removal of respectively 94 and 91 the average granule size distribution is reported in table 3 the sludge in the reactor mainly consisted of smooth granules bigger than 1 mm which is also shown by the microscopic image of the sludge in fig 1 a the water temperature was in the range of 9 c 23 c 3 2 degasification of nitrogen gas due to denitrification and upward transport of liquid decreasing local pressure over saturation of the water phase with nitrogen gas can occur leading to gas bubble formation in the feeding decanting period to confirm that over saturation of nitrogen gas is present during parts of the cycle an experiment was performed two comparable batches were fed to the reactor the batch sizes are given as volumetric exchange ratio ver which is the ratio between the batch size f e 400 m 3 and the volume of the reactor 1000 m 3 before the first batch batch 1 the reactor was intensely aerated before feeding the reactor while in the second batch batch 2 this stripping phase was omitted the gas stripping period was 30 min long with an air flow of 800 m 3 h 1 this high value was chosen to strip a maximum amount of nitrogen gas the process conditions in the two batches were comparable batch 1 volumetric exchange ratio 40 nitrogen removed in previous batch 13 8 mg l 1 average temperature 13 6 c batch 2 volumetric exchange ratio 40 nitrogen removed in previous batch 13 9 mg l 1 average temperature 13 5 c the effect of a stripping phase is clearly illustrated in fig 2 showing the effluent turbidity for both batches batch 1 showed an overall lower level effluent turbidity with a turbidity slightly decreasing over the batch with an average value of 4 9 fnu the turbidity in batch 2 was overall higher than in batch 1 with an average value of 21 0 fnu at a volumetric exchange ratio of 30 the effluent turbidity started to increase up to a value of 48 5 fnu at the end of batch 2 in fig 3 photographs recorded by a security camera are showing the gradual formation of a scum layer due to degasification during batch 2 3 3 stripping of nitrogen gas dissolved nitrogen gas can be stripped out by aerating right before the feeding phase in order to prevent rising of biomass as is shown above equation 9 together with equations 1 and 2 for pressure correction equation 5 equation 6 and equation 7 for temperature correction and equation 4 for the conversion of the kla can be used to evaluate the effect of the stripping period on the dissolved n2 concentration in the reactor in fig 4 the effect of stripping of an initially fully n2 saturated situation in the reactor is shown at a temperature of 20 c the dissolved nitrogen gas concentration in the reactor top at 0 m bottom at 7 m is shown the figure shows three colored zones the green zone marks the area where the nitrogen gas concentration is lower than the equilibrium concentration for air i e no degasification expected the red zone marks the area where the nitrogen gas concentration is higher than the equilibrium concentration for pure nitrogen gas i e degasification expected the white zone marks the area where only a partial nitrogen gas deficit exists the boundary between the green area and the white area is calculated according to equation 1 and equation 2 with a gas fraction of nitrogen gas in air at ambient water pressure and temperature f 78 the boundary between the white and the red area is calculated in a similar manner but with pure nitrogen gas bubbles f 100 the mixing of the reactor has a large impact on the effect of the stripping phase dissolved nitrogen gas is convectively transported through the reactor leading to an over saturated situation near the top of the reactor and an undersaturated situation near the bottom of the reactor when the aeration continues the nitrogen gas is slowly stripped out of the reactor and a n2 deficit is created at the bottom of the tank after 15 min due to the mixing the n2 concentration near the bottom of the reactor is lower than the air equilibrium concentration at 7 m water depth however near the top of the reactor the n2 concentration is still over saturated even after 60 min of aeration the nitrogen concentration is still at saturation concentration near the top of the reactor due to upmixing of dissolved n2 gas note that for operational conditions over saturation at the top of the reactor is not important since there is no sludge bed blanket near the top of the reactor during effluent withdrawal 3 4 degasification during feeding the effect of denitrification during feeding on degasification of nitrogen gas was also evaluated by extending the model according to equation 12 in fig 5 an example is shown for a batch comparable with the previously described batch 1 in which a stripping phase of 30 min is applied with t 13 5 c r 0 25 mg g 1 d 1 the model shows limited over saturation during the feeding period of 1 h but the over saturation only occurs above the sludge blanket so rising of sludge due to bubble formation is not likely to happen if the stripping phase is reduced to 5 min again with t 13 5 c r 0 25 mg g 1 d 1 a situation comparable with the above described batch 2 experiment can be modelled the results are shown in fig 6 the water in the vicinity of the sludge blanket is almost immediately slightly over saturated with nitrogen gas after 30 min the top of the sludge blanket is fully over saturated with nitrogen gas which most likely will lead to rising sludge as the escaping nitrogen bubbles get caught by small flocs near the supernatant sludge interface 3 5 identification of suspended solids in the effluent the suspended solids present in the effluent were examined under a stereo zoom microscope to determine the characteristics and possible origin fig 1b and d shows that the suspended solids in the effluent are small dense light brown flocs no filamentous organisms like thiothrix spp or microthrix spp were observed that would normally be associated with bad settling sludge fig 1d it was also observed that after light shaking of the sample flask the suspended solids quickly settled to the bottom indicating that the suspended solids were able to settle well 3 6 effect of the vertical baffle during the first experimental period between april 2013 and may 2015 the average suspended solids effluent concentration was 30 mg l 1 with a 50 percentile value of 19 8 mg l 1 in the same period many values below 10 mg l 1 were also recorded with a 25 percentile value of 9 3 mg l 1 on the 3rd of june 2015 vertical baffles were installed in front of the overflow weirs composite samples of the effluent of the reactor were taken in the period immediately before and after the baffles were installed i e under similar operational and sludge characteristics fig 7 shows the effluent suspended solids in this period in the period immediately before installation of the baffles the average effluent suspended solids concentration was 23 mg l 1 which is 10 of the influent suspended solids concentration in the period directly after installation of the baffles only 1 sample was above 10 mg l 1 with a total average of 7 2 mg l 1 in the period june 2015 to may 2016 175 composite influent and effluent samples were taken by the local water authority the suspended solids concentration in the influent was 230 118 mg l 1 and the concentration of effluent suspended solids was 7 8 3 8 mg l 1 with a 95 percentile value of 13 6 mg l 1 the average removal efficiency of suspended solids was 97 after installation of the baffles a thin layer of scum was present in most batches during feeding fig 1c but in this period no built up of scum was observed the thin layer of scum always disappeared in the first few minutes of the reaction phase of the cycle 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of ags reactors with activated sludge systems in this study we examined the main processes for production of effluent suspended solids in full scale aerobic granular sludge reactors the problem of rising sludge is known from both continuously fed activated sludge systems henze et al 1993 as from sequencing batch reactors torà et al 2011 comparison of the flow patterns in a secondary clarifier and the ags reactor reveals some important differences fig 8 the outflow from an aeration tank towards a secondary clarifier generally flows over a weir making the water pressure almost atmospheric and generating a lot of turbulence this is an effective way to remove at least part of the dissolved nitrogen gas subsequently the water from the aeration tank flows into the secondary clarifier through the center well were the water pressure is close to atmospheric pressure again in the clarifier the flow splits into effluent and return sludge the return sludge is removed from the bottom of the clarifier during dry weather conditions a limited amount of sludge is present in the clarifier and this sludge will be near the bottom of the clarifier at a water pressure well above atmospheric pressure if the water pressure increases at higher water depth automatically the nitrogen gas deficit increases thus if nitrogen gas is formed in a clarifier due to denitrification this will mainly take place at the bottom of the clarifier where a relatively high nitrogen gas deficit is present this is probably why degasification in a clarifier is not a very common problem and is only known from high loaded systems at high temperatures with high denitrification rates sarioglu and horan 1996 or when the inflow to the clarifier is not degassed at an overflow weir in the ags reactor the influent is fed from the bottom of the reactor pushing the with nitrogen gas saturated water in the reactor upwards to lower water pressure this process is comparable with the process occurring in a sequencing batch reactor where degasification can occur while decanting the effluent and thereby decreasing the water pressure thus while feeding the reactor the upwards moving liquid gets a lower saturation concentration for nitrogen gas while in a clarifier it gets increased in the ags reactor during feeding denitrification of remaining no3 on storage polymers by gao and pao like organisms built up in previous cycles can occur kuba et al 1996 the combination of a lower nitrogen gas deficit due to pressure decrease and an higher denitrification potential make the ags reactor more susceptible for degasification of nitrogen gas in comparison to a clarifier therefore washout of suspended solids due to degasification of nitrogen gas is less common in clarifiers than in ags reactors 4 2 effect of n2 stripping rising of sludge due to degasification of dissolved n2 gas can cause elevated levels of suspended solids in the effluent of activated sludge and ags plants experimentally it was shown that a nitrogen gas stripping phase just before the influent feeding phase was effective to prevent rising of sludge in the ags process the developed mathematical model shows that a limited amount of n2 gas deficit can be reached by applying a stripping phase when the water is pushed up during the feeding phase almost immediate over saturation occurs when no stripping phase is applied the model presented by henze et al 1993 only showed a steady state n2 gas deficit in an unmixed situation this model was extended to show the effect of non steady state aeration and feeding a convection dispersion term was added to the model to describe both mixing due to aeration of the reactor and the plug flow behaviour of the ags reactor during feeding the model shows that the local dissolved n2 gas concentration changes over time and depth of the reactor the maximum deficit for n2 gas depends highly on the temperature as do the denitrification rates the model can easily be extended to calculate the risk of rising sludge based on temperature batch size and aeration history of the reactor denitrification rates increase with temperature and the n2 gas deficit will decrease with temperature at temperatures above 20 c the need for a stripping phase increases it should be realized that for the denitrification during the settling feeding phase mainly residual cod from the previous cycles is used the cod containing influent is replacing the nitrate containing liquid in the reactor therefore influent cod and nitrate will only mix after the feeding phase when the aeration is switched on 4 3 effect of the scum baffle introduction of the vertical scum baffles in front of the effluent weir lowered the effluent suspended solids concentration from 23 mg l 1 to 7 mg l 1 analyses of the suspended solids in the effluent before installation of the baffles did not show any significant presence of granules or filamentous bacteria microscopic analyses only revealed the presence of small sludge flocs the thin layer of sludge present on the surface of the reactor during feeding observed after installation of the baffles apparently was the result of the blocking of wash out of floating sludge by the baffles the same effect is known from clarifiers in activated sludge systems metcalf and eddy 2014 it was shown that at a mlss concentration of 10 1 g l 1 and an influent suspended solids of 230 mg l 1 an effluent suspended solids concentration below 10 mg l 1 were obtained over long term operation the flocs present in the layer on top of the reactor are assumed to be grown in the reactor apparently not all biomass grown in the reactor is granular the flocculent mass likely consists of non biodegradable inert cod from the influent and detached biomass from the granules this is also shown by the fractionation of the sludge showing an average 16 of mass smaller than 200μ m the influent of the reactor contained an average of 230 mg l 1 of tss after screening since the only pre treatment of the reactor was a 6 mm perforated plate screen some floating material from the sewerage will end up in the reactor although the influent consists merely of domestic wastewater the sewage of the overvecht district is known to contain relatively large fraction of fat some fatlike particles were observed in the reactor but in the period of 10 months in which the experiment was run no build up of scum or fat on the reactor was observed apparently the fat particles were converted or removed with the excess sludge the reported values of effluent suspended solids of 20 mg l 1 for the garmerwolde plant pronk et al 2015 are comparable with the levels measured in this study before installation of the vertical baffles in front of the effluent weirs since the garmerwolde plant mainly treats domestic sewage and also the pre treatment of the wastewater is comparable these levels of effluent suspended solids are to be expected also reported values for other plants table 1 were in the range of range1020 mg l 1 and thus comparable with the values measured in this study before installation of the vertical baffle this value is to be expected from a full scale aerobic granular sludge reactor on domestic wastewater if no baffle is present the gansbaai plant is the exception with a value of 5 mg l 1 but detailed information is not available baffles have proven to be an effective and economic way to keep effluent suspended solids below 10 mg l 1 similar to well operated secondary clarifier effluents 5 conclusions in this study two main processes have been identified that can contribute to elevated suspended solids concentration in the effluent of the aerobic granular sludge process in practice these processes also play an important role in suspended solids control in secondary clarifiers of activated sludge plants two solutions known from operation of secondary clarifiers could successfully be incorporated into the ags process leading to low concentration of suspended solids in the effluent the implementation of nitrogen stripping before the settling period avoids gas bubble formation during feeding and thus the floatation of lighter biomass a mathematical model describing degasification was developed that explains the observations of higher suspended solids concentrations in the effluent when treating sewage introduction of a vertical baffle in front of the effluent weir showed to be an effective measure to keep floating sludge and fat like particle in the reactor resulting in an effluent suspended solids concentration lower than 10 mg l 1 with an average influent suspended solids concentration of 230 mg l 1 this was achieved with high biomass concentrations 10 g l 1 and a high granulation grade 84 acknowledgements the authors wish to thank mark stevens jan cloo and tim van erp for their endless dedication to this

19233,the main processes contributing to elevated effluent suspended solids in the full scale aerobic granular sludge process were studied the two processes found to be most important were 1 rising of sludge due to degasification of nitrogen gas produced by denitrification and 2 wash out of particles that intrinsically do not settle such as certain fats and foams a mathematical model was made to describe the process of degasification of nitrogen gas during the feeding phase in an ags reactor the process of rising sludge due to degasification could be limited by stripping out the nitrogen gas before starting the settling phase in the process cycle the wash out of scum particles could be reduced by introducing a vertical scum baffle in front of the effluent weir similar to weirs in traditional clarifiers a full scale nereda reactor in the municipality of utrecht the netherlands was operated with a nitrogen stripping phase and scum baffles for 9 months at an average biomass concentration of 10 g l 1 and an average granulation grade of 84 in this period the influent suspended solids concentration was 230 118 mg l 1 and the concentration of effluent suspended solids was 7

heijnen and van loosdrecht 1998 morgenroth et al 1997 a full scale demonstration installation in gansbaai was started up in 2008 giesen et al 2013 and in 2011 the first full scale application was reported van der roest et al 2011 effluent requirements for cod total nitrogen en total phosphorus were easily met with average suspended solids effluent concentrations reported for full scale applications in the range of 5 mg l 1 to 20 mg l 1 see table 1 some reports indicate an increase in effluent suspended solids concentrations for ags reactors with increasing granulation li et al 2008 rocktäschel et al 2015 in most laboratory studies the focus is on the granulation process and wasting of sludge for ease of operation is combined with decanting of the effluent de kreuk et al 2005 as a result biomass is present in the effluent of laboratory reactors this poses no problem under laboratory conditions but for the full scale treatment of sewage the removal of suspended solids is an integral part of the purification process and is usually limited by law since hydraulics of laboratory and even pilot plant installations are not representative for full scale conditions effluent suspended solids can only effectively be studied at full scale installations in full scale applications the effluent and sludge withdrawal are separated processes this leads to relatively low suspended solids effluent concentrations certainly when compared to influent values pronk et al 2015 still the reported average values of 5 mg l 1 to 20 mg l 1 are higher than usually reported for conventional activated sludge processes which can be considerably lower than 10 mg l 1 parker et al 2001 elevated levels of effluent suspended solids have been intensively studied over the last decades in conventional activated sludge systems commonly reported issues in these systems are bulking sludge and foam formation jenkins 1992 another reported issue in secondary clarifiers is the rising of sludge due to denitrification henze et al 1993 denitrification can lead to nitrogen bubble formation degasification if over saturation of nitrogen gas in the liquid is reached the bubbles attach to the sludge flocs which then rise towards the top of the clarifier and wash out with the effluent sludge settling too fast indicated by a low sludge volume index svi is also reported to cause elevated levels of suspended solids in the effluent of conventional activated sludge systems although this effect is doubted by others reporting a strong relation with the flocculator design parker et al 2001 1996 vitasovic et al 1997 since reported svi values for full scale ags reactors are generally low 35 mg l 1 to 70 mg l 1 pronk et al 2015 van der roest et al 2011 this might also be a potential cause of elevated levels of effluent suspended solids besides a different sludge morphology and likely flocculation behaviour current granular sludge plants according to the nereda concept deviate also in hydraulics from secondary settling tanks secondary clarifiers have typical superficial upflow velocities of 0 5 m h 1 1 0 m h 1 while the complex flow in the clarifier is mainly caused by density currents zhou et al 1992 for the nereda technology effluent results from pumping influent in the bottom of the granular bed this generates an upward plug flow in the reactor with typical superficial velocities in the range of 2 m h 1 4 m h 1 through a granular bed with on top of that a layer of flocculent sludge the relatively higher upflow velocities in nereda reactors might be responsible for the washout of floating sludge and fat like particles in contrast to conventional activated sludge systems the mechanisms behind the formation and control of effluent suspended solids for full scale aerobic granular sludge reactors are not yet fully understood the aim of this study was to evaluate the main processes leading to effluent suspended solids in full scale ags reactors and the options to minimize effluent suspended solids therefore a full scale nereda reactor situated in the municipality of utrecht the netherlands was used to study the mechanisms leading to elevated suspended solids concentrations in the effluent in this study we focused on both removal of floating material and degasification of nitrogen gas hereto full scale experiments were performed and a mathematical model was developed to describe the degasification of nitrogen gas during the operation of the aerobic granular sludge reactor 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the plant in 2013 the dutch water authority hoogheemraadschap de stichtse rijnlanden took a 1050 m 3 aerobic granular sludge reactor in operation the reactor is located in the municipality of utrecht the netherlands and was designed by royal haskoningdhv under the trade name nereda the reactor has a footprint of 150 m 2 and a water depth of 7 00 m the influent pumps have a total capacity of 900 m 3 h 1 the influent is pumped directly from a main sewer line of the overvecht district in utrecht the sewage consists mainly of domestic wastewater wastewater characteristics are given in table 2 after screening by a 6 mm perforated plate screen the wastewater is directly pumped into the reactor during the trial the reactor was operated at a mlss concentration of 8 kg m 3 12 kg m 3 a svi5 of 34 ml g 1 57 ml g 1 a svi30 of 33 ml g 1 43 ml g 1 a volumetric loading rate of 0 6 m 3 m 3 d 1 to 2 7 m 3 m 3 d 1 and an average sludge loading rate of 0 08 kgcod kgmlss d about 84 of the biomass present in the reactor was granulated during the experimental period i e granule size larger than 0 2 mm average granule size distributions are shown in table 3 the reactor is equipped with two blowers each with a capacity of 400 m 3 h 1 air is supplied to the reactor using micro bubble diffusors evenly distributed on the floor of the tank the reactor is operated as a sequencing fed batch process with constant volume consisting of a combined feeding and effluent withdrawal step a reaction phase and a settling and sludge withdrawal step process conditions are set to target full biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal no possibilities for chemical dosing are present in the reactor during the trial nitrogen removal was established by nitrification and denitrification the cycle time varied between 4 and 8 h with 1 h of anaerobic feeding and simultaneous effluent withdrawal a variable reaction phase and a phase for mixing setting and decanting of sludge of 30 60 min the reaction phase was stopped when the set points 2 mg l 1 and 3 mg l 1 for respectively nh 4 n and no 3 n were reached during the reaction phase the dissolved oxygen concentration was controlled in the range of 1 0 mg l 1 to 2 0 mg l 1 the plant is in operation since the 1st of april 2013 the reactor was started up without baffles in front of the overflow weir at the 3rd of june 2015 vertical baffles were placed in front of the effluent weirs to investigate the effect of scum baffles on the concentration of effluent suspended solids 2 2 online measurements the reactor was equipped with probes for dissolved oxygen redox potential water level temperature turbidity and nitrate ammonium and phosphate are continuously measured using a filter unit and auto sampling device hach lange filtrax amtax and phosphax the filter unit was situated 0 5 m below the water surface sampling was done at an interval of 5 min a turbidity sensor hach lange solitax was present in the effluent gutter to observe the presence of suspended solids 2 3 sampling samples for analyses of influent and effluent were collected using refrigerated auto samplers collecting flow proportional samples for both influent and effluent suspended solids concentrations of both influent and effluent were measured by filtering 1 l of sample with a glass fiber filter which was dried at 105 c until no weight change was measured grab samples for mlss analyses were taken from the top of the reactor after at least 15 min of aeration at full capacity to ensure sufficiently mixed conditions 2 4 physical characteristics of the sludge to determine the granule size distribution 1 l of sample was poured over a series of sieves with different mesh sizes 200 μm 400 μm 630 μm 1000 μm and 2000 μm these sieve fractions together with 100 ml of unsieved sludge were dried at 105 c the sludge volume index svi was measured by pouring 1000 ml of mixed undiluted sludge into a graduated measuring cylinder the sludge volumes were measured after 5 and 30 min 2 5 microscopic analysis a leica microsystems ltd stereo zoom microscope m205 fa in combination with leica microsystems qwin v3 5 1 image analysis software was used to analyze the morphology of the sludge 2 6 modelling of n2 stripping a mathematical model was developed to calculate the concentrations of dissolved nitrogen gas in the reactor the solubility of nitrogen gas in water c s is dependent on the partial pressure of nitrogen gas in the gas phase p and is calculated using henrys law 1 c s m k h p here k h is the henrys constant for the solubility of nitrogen gas in water and m is the molar mass of nitrogen gas the henrys constant is a decreasing function of temperature meaning that the solubility of nitrogen gas in water decreases with an increasing temperature the partial pressure of nitrogen in the gas phase is both dependent on the gas fraction f and the pressure in the reactor the latter being the sum of atmospheric pressure p a t m and hydrostatic pressure 2 p f p a t m h ρ g here h is the water depth ρ is the mixture density and g is the gravitational acceleration the transfer of nitrogen gas between the air bubbles and the liquid is calculated by 3 d c d t α f k l a n c s c here c is the nitrogen gas concentration in the water phase k l is the mass transfer coefficient and a is the interfacial area of the gas bubbles the subscripts o and n indicate the values for oxygen gas and nitrogen gas the mass transfer rate is corrected for effects of wastewater contaminants α and fouling on the membrane aerators f the value of the product of k l and a for oxygen transfer k l a o is commonly measured during commissioning in full scale wastewater treatment plants and depends on the temperature for this study a value of k l a o including the effects of contaminants and fouling was used hereto the values for α and f were set to 1 this empirical value of k l a o can be used to derive a value for nitrogen gas by using higbies penetration theory higbie 1935 based on this model the following relation between the k l a for oxygen gas and nitrogen gas and the diffusion coefficient for oxygen gas d o and nitrogen gas d n for can be derived 4 k l a o k l a n d o d n both the diffusion coefficient and the henry coefficient need to be corrected for temperature for the diffusion coefficient this is based on the stokes einstein equation einstein 1905 in this equation the diffusion coefficient d is related to the temperature t and the dynamic viscosity μ t 5 d t d 0 t t 0 μ 0 μ t the viscosity is also depending on temperature according to equation the vogel fulcher tammann equation dagdug 2000 in which parameters a b and c are empirical parameters 6 μ t e a b c t the henry coefficient is corrected for temperature using the van t hoff equation van t hoff 1884 in which k h 0 is the henry coefficient at reference temperature t 0 is the reference temperature and h c is the temperature correction factor 7 k h t k h 0 e k h c 1 t 1 t 0 the stripping of nitrogen gas is done by aeration of the reactor with fine bubble aeration this leads to transport of dissolved nitrogen gas through the reactor a simple axial dispersion model can be used to describe the liquid backmixing of dissolved nitrogen gas in the reactor degaleesan and dudukovic 1998 in which x is the reactor depth 8 d c d t d a x 1 d 2 c d x 2 the axial dispersion coefficient d a x 1 is a lumped coefficient containing the effect of both turbulent dispersion and global convective recirculation in the reactor molecular diffusion in this case is neglected due to an expected limited impact a tracer experiment with nh4 was used to determine the value of d a x 1 to describe the transfer of nitrogen gas between the air bubbles and the water phase equation 4 is substituted in equation 3 if this equation is combined with the transport of nitrogen gas in the water phase according equation 8 a description for the stripping of nitrogen in a 1d bubble column is constructed 9 d c d t d a x 1 d 2 c d x 2 α f k l a o d n d o c s x c the saturation concentration for nitrogen gas according to equation 1 can be combined with the actual concentration to calculate the nitrogen gas deficit in the bulk liquid c d 10 c d c s c when over saturation occurs during aeration i e the actual concentration c is bigger than c s at ambient pressure and temperature it is assumed that n2 gas bubbles are formed immediately and efficiently stripped out of the bulk liquid this is modelled by artificially increasing the local k l a with an order of magnitude 2 7 modelling of mixing during imperfect plug flow feeding during feeding the bulk liquid in the reactor is pushed up towards the top of the reactor where the overflow weirs are situated to describe the transport of nitrogen gas during feeding the same axial dispersion model of equation 8 is used with a different value for d a x also an additional term is added to describe the transport of nitrogen gas through convection here v is the upflow velocity of the liquid in the reactor the value of d a x 2 was experimentally established by measuring a step response curve with nh4 as a tracer 11 d c d t d a x 2 d 2 c d x 2 v d c d x the influent is fed from the bottom of the reactor it is assumed that the influent concentration of dissolved nitrogen is equal to the equilibrium concentration of nitrogen gas at atmospheric pressure during the feeding phase denitrification can take place the denitrification rate depends on many parameters but in this case a lumped specific denitrification rate r is used the specific denitrification rate was measured in the reactor in the days before the experiment by measuring the decrease of the no3 concentration during an anoxic phase in the cycle this rate is multiplied by the mlss concentration x which is a function of the reactor depth the sludge bed is assumed to be in steady state and thus invariable in time in the simulations it was assumed that the sludge bed occupies the lower 4 m of the reactor and that the sludge is evenly distributed we can then write equation 11 as follows 12 d c d t d a x 2 d 2 c d x 2 v d c d x r x x in this model the water in the reactor can get over saturated with nitrogen gas this means that the local concentration of nitrogen gas c becomes larger than the local saturation concentration according to equation 1 it is assumed that nitrogen gas bubbles are formed immediately after over saturation most likely supersaturation of nitrogen gas can occur but the effect is assumed to be limited henze et al 1993 to solve the model a python code was written all model parameters are given in table 4 3 results 3 1 reactor operation the data were collected between june 2015 and may 2016 in this period the reactor was run stable and without interruption with average effluent values of cod of 41 mg l 1 n kj n of 4 05 mg l 1 nh 4 n of 1 29 mg l 1 no 3 n of 3 72 mg l 1 p tot of 0 51 mg l 1 and po 4 3 p of 0 26 mg l 1 showing an highly efficient n and p removal of respectively 94 and 91 the average granule size distribution is reported in table 3 the sludge in the reactor mainly consisted of smooth granules bigger than 1 mm which is also shown by the microscopic image of the sludge in fig 1 a the water temperature was in the range of 9 c 23 c 3 2 degasification of nitrogen gas due to denitrification and upward transport of liquid decreasing local pressure over saturation of the water phase with nitrogen gas can occur leading to gas bubble formation in the feeding decanting period to confirm that over saturation of nitrogen gas is present during parts of the cycle an experiment was performed two comparable batches were fed to the reactor the batch sizes are given as volumetric exchange ratio ver which is the ratio between the batch size f e 400 m 3 and the volume of the reactor 1000 m 3 before the first batch batch 1 the reactor was intensely aerated before feeding the reactor while in the second batch batch 2 this stripping phase was omitted the gas stripping period was 30 min long with an air flow of 800 m 3 h 1 this high value was chosen to strip a maximum amount of nitrogen gas the process conditions in the two batches were comparable batch 1 volumetric exchange ratio 40 nitrogen removed in previous batch 13 8 mg l 1 average temperature 13 6 c batch 2 volumetric exchange ratio 40 nitrogen removed in previous batch 13 9 mg l 1 average temperature 13 5 c the effect of a stripping phase is clearly illustrated in fig 2 showing the effluent turbidity for both batches batch 1 showed an overall lower level effluent turbidity with a turbidity slightly decreasing over the batch with an average value of 4 9 fnu the turbidity in batch 2 was overall higher than in batch 1 with an average value of 21 0 fnu at a volumetric exchange ratio of 30 the effluent turbidity started to increase up to a value of 48 5 fnu at the end of batch 2 in fig 3 photographs recorded by a security camera are showing the gradual formation of a scum layer due to degasification during batch 2 3 3 stripping of nitrogen gas dissolved nitrogen gas can be stripped out by aerating right before the feeding phase in order to prevent rising of biomass as is shown above equation 9 together with equations 1 and 2 for pressure correction equation 5 equation 6 and equation 7 for temperature correction and equation 4 for the conversion of the kla can be used to evaluate the effect of the stripping period on the dissolved n2 concentration in the reactor in fig 4 the effect of stripping of an initially fully n2 saturated situation in the reactor is shown at a temperature of 20 c the dissolved nitrogen gas concentration in the reactor top at 0 m bottom at 7 m is shown the figure shows three colored zones the green zone marks the area where the nitrogen gas concentration is lower than the equilibrium concentration for air i e no degasification expected the red zone marks the area where the nitrogen gas concentration is higher than the equilibrium concentration for pure nitrogen gas i e degasification expected the white zone marks the area where only a partial nitrogen gas deficit exists the boundary between the green area and the white area is calculated according to equation 1 and equation 2 with a gas fraction of nitrogen gas in air at ambient water pressure and temperature f 78 the boundary between the white and the red area is calculated in a similar manner but with pure nitrogen gas bubbles f 100 the mixing of the reactor has a large impact on the effect of the stripping phase dissolved nitrogen gas is convectively transported through the reactor leading to an over saturated situation near the top of the reactor and an undersaturated situation near the bottom of the reactor when the aeration continues the nitrogen gas is slowly stripped out of the reactor and a n2 deficit is created at the bottom of the tank after 15 min due to the mixing the n2 concentration near the bottom of the reactor is lower than the air equilibrium concentration at 7 m water depth however near the top of the reactor the n2 concentration is still over saturated even after 60 min of aeration the nitrogen concentration is still at saturation concentration near the top of the reactor due to upmixing of dissolved n2 gas note that for operational conditions over saturation at the top of the reactor is not important since there is no sludge bed blanket near the top of the reactor during effluent withdrawal 3 4 degasification during feeding the effect of denitrification during feeding on degasification of nitrogen gas was also evaluated by extending the model according to equation 12 in fig 5 an example is shown for a batch comparable with the previously described batch 1 in which a stripping phase of 30 min is applied with t 13 5 c r 0 25 mg g 1 d 1 the model shows limited over saturation during the feeding period of 1 h but the over saturation only occurs above the sludge blanket so rising of sludge due to bubble formation is not likely to happen if the stripping phase is reduced to 5 min again with t 13 5 c r 0 25 mg g 1 d 1 a situation comparable with the above described batch 2 experiment can be modelled the results are shown in fig 6 the water in the vicinity of the sludge blanket is almost immediately slightly over saturated with nitrogen gas after 30 min the top of the sludge blanket is fully over saturated with nitrogen gas which most likely will lead to rising sludge as the escaping nitrogen bubbles get caught by small flocs near the supernatant sludge interface 3 5 identification of suspended solids in the effluent the suspended solids present in the effluent were examined under a stereo zoom microscope to determine the characteristics and possible origin fig 1b and d shows that the suspended solids in the effluent are small dense light brown flocs no filamentous organisms like thiothrix spp or microthrix spp were observed that would normally be associated with bad settling sludge fig 1d it was also observed that after light shaking of the sample flask the suspended solids quickly settled to the bottom indicating that the suspended solids were able to settle well 3 6 effect of the vertical baffle during the first experimental period between april 2013 and may 2015 the average suspended solids effluent concentration was 30 mg l 1 with a 50 percentile value of 19 8 mg l 1 in the same period many values below 10 mg l 1 were also recorded with a 25 percentile value of 9 3 mg l 1 on the 3rd of june 2015 vertical baffles were installed in front of the overflow weirs composite samples of the effluent of the reactor were taken in the period immediately before and after the baffles were installed i e under similar operational and sludge characteristics fig 7 shows the effluent suspended solids in this period in the period immediately before installation of the baffles the average effluent suspended solids concentration was 23 mg l 1 which is 10 of the influent suspended solids concentration in the period directly after installation of the baffles only 1 sample was above 10 mg l 1 with a total average of 7 2 mg l 1 in the period june 2015 to may 2016 175 composite influent and effluent samples were taken by the local water authority the suspended solids concentration in the influent was 230 118 mg l 1 and the concentration of effluent suspended solids was 7 8 3 8 mg l 1 with a 95 percentile value of 13 6 mg l 1 the average removal efficiency of suspended solids was 97 after installation of the baffles a thin layer of scum was present in most batches during feeding fig 1c but in this period no built up of scum was observed the thin layer of scum always disappeared in the first few minutes of the reaction phase of the cycle 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of ags reactors with activated sludge systems in this study we examined the main processes for production of effluent suspended solids in full scale aerobic granular sludge reactors the problem of rising sludge is known from both continuously fed activated sludge systems henze et al 1993 as from sequencing batch reactors torà et al 2011 comparison of the flow patterns in a secondary clarifier and the ags reactor reveals some important differences fig 8 the outflow from an aeration tank towards a secondary clarifier generally flows over a weir making the water pressure almost atmospheric and generating a lot of turbulence this is an effective way to remove at least part of the dissolved nitrogen gas subsequently the water from the aeration tank flows into the secondary clarifier through the center well were the water pressure is close to atmospheric pressure again in the clarifier the flow splits into effluent and return sludge the return sludge is removed from the bottom of the clarifier during dry weather conditions a limited amount of sludge is present in the clarifier and this sludge will be near the bottom of the clarifier at a water pressure well above atmospheric pressure if the water pressure increases at higher water depth automatically the nitrogen gas deficit increases thus if nitrogen gas is formed in a clarifier due to denitrification this will mainly take place at the bottom of the clarifier where a relatively high nitrogen gas deficit is present this is probably why degasification in a clarifier is not a very common problem and is only known from high loaded systems at high temperatures with high denitrification rates sarioglu and horan 1996 or when the inflow to the clarifier is not degassed at an overflow weir in the ags reactor the influent is fed from the bottom of the reactor pushing the with nitrogen gas saturated water in the reactor upwards to lower water pressure this process is comparable with the process occurring in a sequencing batch reactor where degasification can occur while decanting the effluent and thereby decreasing the water pressure thus while feeding the reactor the upwards moving liquid gets a lower saturation concentration for nitrogen gas while in a clarifier it gets increased in the ags reactor during feeding denitrification of remaining no3 on storage polymers by gao and pao like organisms built up in previous cycles can occur kuba et al 1996 the combination of a lower nitrogen gas deficit due to pressure decrease and an higher denitrification potential make the ags reactor more susceptible for degasification of nitrogen gas in comparison to a clarifier therefore washout of suspended solids due to degasification of nitrogen gas is less common in clarifiers than in ags reactors 4 2 effect of n2 stripping rising of sludge due to degasification of dissolved n2 gas can cause elevated levels of suspended solids in the effluent of activated sludge and ags plants experimentally it was shown that a nitrogen gas stripping phase just before the influent feeding phase was effective to prevent rising of sludge in the ags process the developed mathematical model shows that a limited amount of n2 gas deficit can be reached by applying a stripping phase when the water is pushed up during the feeding phase almost immediate over saturation occurs when no stripping phase is applied the model presented by henze et al 1993 only showed a steady state n2 gas deficit in an unmixed situation this model was extended to show the effect of non steady state aeration and feeding a convection dispersion term was added to the model to describe both mixing due to aeration of the reactor and the plug flow behaviour of the ags reactor during feeding the model shows that the local dissolved n2 gas concentration changes over time and depth of the reactor the maximum deficit for n2 gas depends highly on the temperature as do the denitrification rates the model can easily be extended to calculate the risk of rising sludge based on temperature batch size and aeration history of the reactor denitrification rates increase with temperature and the n2 gas deficit will decrease with temperature at temperatures above 20 c the need for a stripping phase increases it should be realized that for the denitrification during the settling feeding phase mainly residual cod from the previous cycles is used the cod containing influent is replacing the nitrate containing liquid in the reactor therefore influent cod and nitrate will only mix after the feeding phase when the aeration is switched on 4 3 effect of the scum baffle introduction of the vertical scum baffles in front of the effluent weir lowered the effluent suspended solids concentration from 23 mg l 1 to 7 mg l 1 analyses of the suspended solids in the effluent before installation of the baffles did not show any significant presence of granules or filamentous bacteria microscopic analyses only revealed the presence of small sludge flocs the thin layer of sludge present on the surface of the reactor during feeding observed after installation of the baffles apparently was the result of the blocking of wash out of floating sludge by the baffles the same effect is known from clarifiers in activated sludge systems metcalf and eddy 2014 it was shown that at a mlss concentration of 10 1 g l 1 and an influent suspended solids of 230 mg l 1 an effluent suspended solids concentration below 10 mg l 1 were obtained over long term operation the flocs present in the layer on top of the reactor are assumed to be grown in the reactor apparently not all biomass grown in the reactor is granular the flocculent mass likely consists of non biodegradable inert cod from the influent and detached biomass from the granules this is also shown by the fractionation of the sludge showing an average 16 of mass smaller than 200μ m the influent of the reactor contained an average of 230 mg l 1 of tss after screening since the only pre treatment of the reactor was a 6 mm perforated plate screen some floating material from the sewerage will end up in the reactor although the influent consists merely of domestic wastewater the sewage of the overvecht district is known to contain relatively large fraction of fat some fatlike particles were observed in the reactor but in the period of 10 months in which the experiment was run no build up of scum or fat on the reactor was observed apparently the fat particles were converted or removed with the excess sludge the reported values of effluent suspended solids of 20 mg l 1 for the garmerwolde plant pronk et al 2015 are comparable with the levels measured in this study before installation of the vertical baffles in front of the effluent weirs since the garmerwolde plant mainly treats domestic sewage and also the pre treatment of the wastewater is comparable these levels of effluent suspended solids are to be expected also reported values for other plants table 1 were in the range of range1020 mg l 1 and thus comparable with the values measured in this study before installation of the vertical baffle this value is to be expected from a full scale aerobic granular sludge reactor on domestic wastewater if no baffle is present the gansbaai plant is the exception with a value of 5 mg l 1 but detailed information is not available baffles have proven to be an effective and economic way to keep effluent suspended solids below 10 mg l 1 similar to well operated secondary clarifier effluents 5 conclusions in this study two main processes have been identified that can contribute to elevated suspended solids concentration in the effluent of the aerobic granular sludge process in practice these processes also play an important role in suspended solids control in secondary clarifiers of activated sludge plants two solutions known from operation of secondary clarifiers could successfully be incorporated into the ags process leading to low concentration of suspended solids in the effluent the implementation of nitrogen stripping before the settling period avoids gas bubble formation during feeding and thus the floatation of lighter biomass a mathematical model describing degasification was developed that explains the observations of higher suspended solids concentrations in the effluent when treating sewage introduction of a vertical baffle in front of the effluent weir showed to be an effective measure to keep floating sludge and fat like particle in the reactor resulting in an effluent suspended solids concentration lower than 10 mg l 1 with an average influent suspended solids concentration of 230 mg l 1 this was achieved with high biomass concentrations 10 g l 1 and a high granulation grade 84 acknowledgements the authors wish to thank mark stevens jan cloo and tim van erp for their endless dedication to this

their differential susceptibility to uv radiation harwood et al 2005 hijnen et al 2006 to help address these knowledge gaps monitoring and understanding the efficiency of uv inactivation of enteric

techniques such as qpcr to estimate virion concentrations in water samples however since molecular methods detect both infectious and non infectious viruses the public health impact regarding treatment efficacy is a concern francy et al 2012 in the past decade several attempts have been made to distinguish infectious and non infectious viruses by qpcr using pre treatment with rnase or using intercalating dyes such as propidium monoazide pma which can penetrate damaged or compromised virus particles and bind to the genome lamhoujeb et al 2008 parshionikar et al 2010 however karim et al suggest that pma qpcr was unable to differentiate infectious and uv inactivated viruses due to the inability of uv light to damage the viral capsid karim et al 2015 conversely traditional viral cell culture using cytopathic effects cpe for measuring infectious viruses are relatively insensitive due to the fact that not all infectious viruses induce a measurable cpe in cell culture dilnessa 2017 consequently traditional viral culture methods that incorporate qpcr as a measure on infectivity known as integrated cell culture qpcr icc qpcr have been used as an alternative tool for estimating infectious viruses in water qiu et al 2015 in the present study we evaluated uv inactivation against an array of enteric viruses at two full scale municipal wwtps by monitoring the occurrence of human enteric viruses before and after uv treatment using qpcr cell culture and icc qpcr of particular importance was the evaluation of infectious virus reduction by low pressure uv treatment and the potential of reovirus as a useful viral indicator to assess uv disinfection efficacy betancourt and gerba 2016 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater treatment plants and water sample collection two municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 located in calgary canada were evaluated in this study wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 have treatment capacities to serve a population of 250 000 and 1 000 000 respectively the average daily discharge for wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 were 90 900 m3 and 344 889 m3 respectively both facilities provide tertiary treatment of wastewater through i 6 mm screening of raw sewage ii grit removal iii primary clarification iv biological nutrient removal through an activated sludge process v secondary clarification and vi uv disinfection of final effluent wwtp 1 also has an effluent filtration step prior to uv disinfection where the secondary effluent is filtered through an aquadisk filter disc made of synthetic pile fabric with a 10 μm nominal pore size at wwtp 1 the filtered secondary effluent is uv disinfected trojan3000plus at an average capacity of 100 ml d and a peak capacity of 240 ml d the system is designed to provide a uv dose of 24 mj cm2 at peak flow from a total of 672 low pressure high output amalgam 250 w lamps arranged in 4 lamp banks across 2 uv channels at wwtp 2 the secondary effluent is disinfected in a fisher porter uv disinfection system with an average capacity of 500 ml d and a peak capacity of 1020 ml d the system is designed to provide an applied uv dose of 30 mj cm2 from a total of 11 520 low pressure low output mercury 65 w lamps arranged in 30 lamp banks across 10 uv channels wastewater samples were collected monthly before uv treatment pre uv and post uv treatment from both wwtps the samples were collected in a reverse order of treatment processes post uv prior to pre uv in order to minimize potential cross contamination of samples with higher pathogen concentrations the samples were collected upstream pre uv and downstream post uv of the light banks directly through access hatches from the continuously flowing streams of wastewater within the uv channels the channels sampled varied between sampling events based on those in service at the time of sampling as part of the normal wwtp operations samples were collected in 10 l plastic containers using a peristaltic pump isco 150 portable pump tubing and connectors were sterilized by autoclaving prior to use in the pumping system and in advance of each sampling event the sample was flushed through the pumping system for approximately 1 min prior to sample collection and the containers were rinsed three times with the sample matrix prior to sample collection the flow rate of the pump was maintained at 4 l min during sampling the samples were typically collected approximately 3 h prior to the peak daytime flow at wwtp 1 and 2 h prior to peak daytime flow at wwtp 2 samples were placed in coolers with ice packs and transported to the laboratory for processing within 24 h samples were collected from wwtp 1 for 21 months oct 2014 jun 2016 and wwtp 2 for 14 months nov 2014 dec 2015 a total of 51 pre uv samples wwtp 1 29 wwtp 2 22 and 50 post uv samples wwtp 1 28 wwtp 2 22 were analyzed for viruses additionally 32 and 21 pre uv samples from wwtp 1 and 2 respectively were used for spiking studies to monitor method recoveries for viruses 2 2 virus concentration from water samples the adsorption elution method using nanoceram 90 mm laminated disc filters argonide corp sanford fl usa was used to concentrate the virus from water samples as previously described pang et al 2012 qiu et al 2015 briefly 10 l of water sample were filtered and eluted with 1 5 beef extract buffer ph 9 75 followed by flocculation with 0 5 mol l fecl3 and centrifugation the final volume of the concentrated viral suspension was adjusted to 15 ml using mem medium invitrogen burlington on canada with the ph at 7 2 0 2 a flow chart outlining the sample processing procedure is provided in fig 1 the concentrated samples were aliquoted and stored at 70 c until further processed 2 3 viral nucleic acid extraction and qpcr total viral nucleic acids were extracted from 200 μl of viral concentrates and eluted in 50 μl rnase free water using the magazorb total rna prep kit promega wi usa according to the manufacturer s instructions two step reactions including reverse transcription rt and qpcr were performed for all rna and dna viruses using abi fast 7500 sequence detection system abi as previously described pang et al 2012 qiu et al 2015 2016 for each qpcr reaction an equivalent of 1 67 ml of the original water sample was assayed fig 1 an external standard curve was established for quantification of all viruses using the 875 bp dna fragment of nov genogroup ii gii by 10 fold serial dilution from 100 copies to 1 0 106 copies qiu 2016 virus load was expressed as genome equivalent ge copies l a panel of eight viruses including norovirus genogroups i and ii gi gii rotavirus sapovirus astrovirus enterovirus adenovirus jc virus and reovirus were tested the sequences of primers and probes for the qpcr targeting these viruses were previously described pang et al 2012 qiu et al 2015 but noting the sequence corrections for reovirus primers being forward 5 agttgctgaacgcaaattattttg 3 reverse 5 tgcgaatcatcagattaacctctgt 3 2 4 virus spiking for evaluating virus recovery a mix of four viruses containing norovirus gii adenovirus reovirus and coxsackievirus b which belongs to enterovirus were used to assess virus recoveries norovirus gii and adenovirus were prepared from clinical stool samples clinical strain of coxsackievirus b was prepared from culture stock and reovirus was isolated from one of the pre uv samples through cell culture one millilitre of the virus mixture was spiked into 10 l pre uv samples and concentrated as described above the same aliquot of the virus mixture 1 ml was added to 14 ml of deionized water as baseline control and tested in parallel with the concentrated spiked water samples using qpcr the recovery was calculated as follows recovery the amount of virus detected in the spiked pre uv sample the amount of virus detected in the baseline sample 100 2 5 virus cell culture for assessing infectivity of culturable viruses african rhesus monkey kidney cells ma 104 and buffalo green monkey kidney cells bgm were grown separately on eagle s mem medium sigma on canada as previously described qiu et al 2015 once the cells were confluent ma 104 and bgm cells were trypsinized and mixed in a 2 1 co culture ratio for virus infection in order to quantify infectious viruses the concentrated water samples were serially diluted 10 fold from undiluted to 10 3 for pre uv samples and to 10 2 for post uv samples respectively one millilitre of the undiluted or 10 fold serially diluted samples was inoculated into the mixed cells for a 10 day culture period sub culture was performed using 1 ml of the first cultured harvest medium to inoculate mixed cells for another 10 day culture each sample was cultured in duplicate flasks for most probable number mpn measurement and cpe was examined for viral replication in first cultures and sub cultures the viruses were harvested after sub culture and tested for rotavirus enterovirus adenovirus and reovirus by icc qpcr qiu et al 2015 2 6 correlation between infectious viruses and viral genomic copy number to understand the relationship between virus infectious unit iu and viral genomic copy numbers reovirus isolated from one of the post uv samples was titrated using the 50 tissue culture infectious dose method tcid50 briefly a serial 10 fold dilution of cultured reovirus down to 10 9 was inoculated into 4 flasks of bgm cells for each dilution the cells were monitored daily for ten days and any sign of cpe was recorded the tcid50 infectious unit was calculated using the reed muench method lennette 1988 based on virus dilutions and cpe observations coxsackievirus b was previously titrated using the same method pang et al 2012 titrated reovirus and coxsackievirus b cultured stocks were diluted and assayed by qpcr briefly a serial 10 fold dilution was performed for coxsackievirus b and reovirus cultured stocks down to 10 9 and the total nucleic acids were extracted for each dilution as described rt and qpcr were performed to quantify the viral load in ge copy numbers each dilution was run in triplicate for qpcr and repeated for three times 2 7 statistical analysis virus recoveries were compared between two wwtps for each virus using the mann whitney u test against the null hypothesis that the median recovery was identical for the two wwtps mpns and their corresponding 95 confidence intervals cis were determined based on a 2 well mpn of cpe counts of total infectious virus or icc qpcr test counts of individual infectious viruses rotavirus enterovirus adenovirus and reovirus with an assumption that the number of infectious virions in each cell culture followed a poisson distribution with the concentration of infectious virus as its constant rate parameter the maximum likelihood estimates of the virus concentration were determined to maximize the likelihood of getting the observed number of positive culture results at varied dilutions mpn was calculated for the original sample based on the maximum likelihood estimates of virus concentration the reduction in infectious viruses by uv disinfection and their corresponding cis were calculated as followed infectious virus log10 reduction log10 virus concentration of pre uv samples mpn l log10 virus concentration of post uv samples mpn l 3 results 3 1 virus recovery virus recoveries varied by virus type recovery ranged from 3 to 56 for adenovirus 11 37 for enterovirus 3 21 for norovirus and 4 80 for reovirus enterovirus and norovirus had the highest and lowest median recoveries respectively among the four spiked viruses the median recovery value for enterovirus was significantly higher p 0 002 in wwtp 2 compared to wwtp 1 no significant difference was found for recovery of adenovirus p 0 3 and reovirus p 0 9 between two wwtps fig 2 no reliable recovery for norovirus in wwtp 2 was obtained due to the highly uncertain estimated recoveries 3 2 detection and quantification of viruses in pre uv and post uv samples by qpcr norovirus gii rotavirus astrovirus and adenovirus were detected by qpcr in all pre uv n 51 and post uv n 50 samples table 1 norovirus gi was detected in most of the samples except one post uv sample from wwtp 2 sapovirus enterovirus and jc virus were detected in 46 90 47 92 and 47 92 pre uv samples 44 88 46 92 and 47 94 post uv samples respectively reovirus was only detected in 1 pre uv and 4 post uv samples rotavirus and enterovirus had the highest and lowest concentrations respectively in both plants the concentrations of rotavirus ranged from 4 5 to 6 7 log10 ge copies l in pre uv samples while the concentration of enterovirus ranged from non detected to 4 6 log10 ge copies l in pre uv samples no significant difference in norovirus gi gii and rotavirus concentrations in pre uv samples by qpcr was determined between the two plants fig 3 a however sapovirus p 0 034 astrovirus p 0 006 enterovirus p 0 0007 adenovirus p 0 026 and jc virus p 0 0003 were detected at significantly higher concentrations in pre uv samples in wwtp 2 compared to wwtp 1 fig 3b as anticipated virus concentrations obtained from qpcr did not show significant differences between pre and post uv samples at each plant except for enterovirus which had significantly greater concentration in pre uv than post uv samples at wwtp 1 p 0 05 although the duration of study 21 months for wwtp 1 and 14 months wwtp 2 pre empted us from comprehensively assessing seasonality of occurrence of the different viruses in both plants it is worth noting that rotavirus concentration peaked in the spring of each year in wwtp 1 march april of 2015 and 2016 fig 3a the peak occurrence of rotavirus in wwtp 1 in the spring of 2015 also coincided with a peak occurrence of this same virus in wwtp 2 in the spring of that same year norovirus gi and gii also had some of the highest concentrations observed in the spring march and april at each of the wwtps fig 3a no distinct temporal patterns of virus occurrence were readily observed for any of the other viruses studied fig 3b 3 3 infectious viruses detected by cell culture and icc qpcr cpe was observed in 27 29 93 and 22 22 100 cultured pre uv samples as well as 11 28 39 and 15 22 68 of post uv samples in wwtp 1 and 2 respectively table 2 icc qpcr results were obtained in 26 29 90 and 22 22 100 cultured pre uv samples and in 16 28 57 and 16 22 73 of post uv samples in wwtp 1 and 2 respectively table 2 infectious viruses were identified by icc qpcr in 1 pre uv and 12 post uv samples without cpe observed table s1 s2 however 2 pre uv and 6 post uv samples showed cpe without any viruses detected by icc qpcr table s1 s2 one virus type or multiple virus types up to 4 viruses were often detected by icc qpcr in the one pre uv or post uv sample table 2 reovirus was the most common virus detected present in 25 86 and 22 100 pre uv samples as well as 9 32 and 15 68 post uv samples in wwtp 1 and 2 respectively in combining data from both wwtps rotavirus enterovirus and adenovirus were detected in 3 51 6 17 51 33 and 16 51 31 pre uv samples and in 4 50 8 7 50 14 and 10 50 20 post uv samples 3 4 inactivation of infectious virus by uv disinfection based on mpn values obtained from cell culture with cpe the mean log10 reductions for total infectious viruses was similar between two plants p 0 29 which was determined to be 1 46 and 1 67 log10 for wwtp 1 and 2 respectively table 3 overall the concentration of most viruses as determined by icc qpcr in pre uv and post uv samples was too low to reliably evaluate log10 reduction values across the uv treatment process table 3 this challenge was also compounded by the infrequent detection of some of the viruses in the post uv samples i e rotavirus enterovirus and adenovirus the only virus to provide reliable data in terms of both detection frequency and concentrations was reovirus using icc qpcr 1 23 and 1 75 log10 reduction of reovirus was observed in wwtp 1 and 2 respectively which did not have significant difference between two plants p 0 34 table 3 as an additional approach for evaluating virus inactivation by uv disinfection the frequency of virus detection in cell culture was also assessed the frequency of detection of total infectious viruses based on cpe was reduced from 93 to 39 in wwtp 1 from 100 to 68 in wwtp 2 table s3 moreover the frequency of detection by icc qpcr was reduced from 28 to 14 for enterovirus 86 to 32 for reovirus in wwtp 1 no reduction in frequency of detection was observed for rotavirus and adenovirus in wwtp 1 the frequency of detection at wwtp 2 was reduced from 100 to 68 for reovirus 46 to 18 for adenovirus and 41 to 14 for enterovirus table s3 3 5 correlation between genomic copy numbers and virus infectious units as reovirus was rarely detected by qpcr in both pre uv and post uv samples but frequently detected in cell culture the correlation between genomic copy numbers obtained from qpcr and virus infectious units was assessed the limit of detection lod for qpcr assay was 5 ge copies pcr which was equivalent to 3000 ge copies l of water tested using the titrated reovirus with a tcid50 of 5 88 107 iu ml the lod of qpcr for infectious reovirus was 15 iu pcr equivalent to 9000 iu l of water tested which was much higher than the concentration of infectious reovirus obtained by cell culture icc qpcr undetectable to 1050 mpn l in pre uv samples table 3 to identify whether the qpcr sensitivity of reovirus is comparable to other viruses titrated coxsackievirus tcid50 4 68 107 iu ml was also tested by qpcr the lod of qpcr for infectious coxsackievirus was determined as 60 iu l of water which was much lower than reovirus even though both viruses have similar tcid50 values indicating that qpcr was more sensitive for detection of coxsackievirus compared to reovirus based on the correlation between viral genomic copy numbers and virus infectious unit one iu of infectious coxsackievirus and reovirus particle have an estimated equivalent of 212 and 4 4 ge copies respectively using qpcr 4 discussion with the widespread use of uv disinfection in the wastewater industry uv inactivation of pathogens in water has been broadly studied and has shown to be most effective against bacteria and protozoa especially oo cysts of cryptosporidium and giardia mofidi et al 2002 morita et al 2002 however viruses have been reported to be less susceptible to uv irradiation based on bench scale studies hijnen et al 2006 moreover limited data is available for uv inactivation of enteric viruses during wastewater treatment especially at full scale in this study we assessed the occurrence of enteric viruses norovirus rotavirus sapovirus astrovirus adenovirus enterovirus and reovirus and jc virus during uv disinfection at two full scale municipal wwtps the efficiency of uv inactivation of infectious viruses was evaluated using both qpcr and cell culture methods cpe and icc qpcr to our knowledge this is the first comprehensive study to assess uv inactivation of a variety of viruses at full scale wwtps using both molecular and cell culture techniques virus recovery is usually measured to monitor the concentration and qpcr procedures but it may vary due to different methods and water matrices in this study virus recovery from secondary treated wastewater pre uv was evaluated for four different viruses recovery for adenovirus 3 56 was similar to bofill mas s finding using an ultracentrifugation concentration method 2 25 for wastewater bofill mas et al 2006 but higher than several other studies using adsorption elution methods 7 wang et al 2018 or glass wool filtration with polyethylene glycol precipitation method 0 1 5 in wastewater francy et al 2012 as well as a negatively charged membrane filtration method 0 3 1 5 in river water fong et al 2010 recoveries for enterovirus 11 37 were similar to our previous studies using a deionized water matrix pang et al 2012 qiu et al 2015 but higher than francy s finding 1 in wastewater francy et al 2012 recoveries for reovirus 4 80 were also higher than a recent report using a nanoceram cartridge with tertiary treated wastewater 4 8 betancourt et al 2017 all these findings indicate that the concentration method and qpcr detection assay used in this study was as reliable and as good or higher than previously reported for other methods similar to our previous findings qiu et al 2015 seven viruses including norovirus rotavirus sapovirus astrovirus enterovirus adenovirus and jc virus were routinely detected by qpcr in pre uv samples while reovirus was rarely detected of these seven viruses sapovirus astrovirus enterovirus adenovirus and jc virus were present at significantly higher concentrations in pre uv samples in wwtp 2 than wwtp 1 for norovirus and rotavirus even though no statistically significant difference was identified in virus concentrations between the two plants based on qpcr the average viral loads of both viruses were still higher in wwtp 2 compared to wwtp 1 differences in virus concentrations between two plants may be due to several reasons the composition of incoming wastewater minor process and operational changes differences differing matrix effects on virus recovery it was noted that the highest concentrations of rotavirus occurred in spring in both plants in accordance with the seasonal increase of rotavirus associated sporadic gastroenteritis in alberta pang et al 2014 interestingly an unusual spring peak of norovirus was observed in both plants fig 3a an observation different from previous studies where norovirus was associated with winter seasonality in clinical samples hasing et al 2013 however the observation of a spring peak in norovirus coincided with a notable increase in sporadic children norovirus infections in alberta during the sampling period data not published indicating a close relationship between norovirus viral load in wastewater and the clinical norovirus associated gastroenteritis enteric viruses such as norovirus rotavirus and adenovirus have been detected in uv disinfected wastewater by qpcr in various studies francy et al 2012 qiu et al 2015 campos et al 2016 lopez galvez et al 2016 it is well known that qpcr alone cannot distinguish between free nucleic acid inactivated viruses and infectious viruses all which may result in the underestimation of the inactivation of enteric viruses by uv disinfection although many studies have demonstrated no correlation between pcr amplifiable virus genome copies and the level of inactivation achieved by uv some studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between these two variables allain et al 2006 lee et al 2008 whether this relationship holds true or not depends on both the virus itself i e rna vs dna single vs double stranded the composition of the gene target i e thymidine content and target length and the level of nucleic acid degradation associated with previous inactivation processes upstream of uv pecson et al 2009 rodriguez et al 2009 ronnqvist et al 2014 moreover most studies on uv inactivation have been performed at bench scale using water samples spiked with cultured or isolated virus stocks since wastewater contains a plethora of genetic variants in a population we sought to evaluate the utility of qpcr as a measure of inactivation efficacy at full scale in most cases qpcr concentration estimates of pre and post uv were similar for all viruses suggesting that qpcr itself is not a good measure of uv inactivation across all the genetic variants of selected virus species that may be present in full scale wastewater treatment plants although qpcr is often criticized as a method for measuring virus inactivation by uv it is important to note that the test provides critical information about viral occurrence not easily obtained by cpe or icc qpcr methods not all viruses are equally effective at establishing infections in cell culture including rotavirus and norovirus our data demonstrates that rotavirus was detected at the highest concentrations in both pre uv and post uv samples among all the viruses tested by qpcr in this study however it was rarely detected by icc qpcr and consequently it was impossible to assess the log10 reduction of infectious rotavirus it is known that different rotavirus strains have various capacities to grow in culture and in some cases it has been shown that some human strains are very inefficient at propagation in culture when obtained from human faecal specimens arnold et al 2009 other studies have demonstrated that rotavirus strains may grow more efficiently in primary cells than continuous cells such as bgm and ma104 with propagation efficiency being only one out of every 46000 virus particles infecting primary cells ward et al 1984 although a co cultured system of two cell lines bgm and ma104 was used in this study to maximize diversity in virus recovery the efficiency of rotavirus infecting either cell may still be low which could have resulted in underestimating infectious rotavirus in wastewater samples the recent development of a norovirus cell culture system zou et al 2017 may be useful to assess the performance of uv disinfection particularly considering that norovirus is one of the most conservative virus targets used for wastewater and drinking water risk assessment ashbolt 2015 due to the limitations in the qpcr approach the combination of cell culture and icc qpcr was used in this study to evaluate the inactivation of infectious enteric viruses four culturable viruses including rotavirus adenovirus enterovirus and rovirus were assessed for reductions in infectivity associated with uv treatment in addition to the four viruses tested by icc qpcr other unknown viruses were also shown to be present in the treated water as confirmed by cpe one of the disadvantages of icc qpcr is that the method is designed to look for specific viruses based on pcr primer designs and therefore may miss viruses that are present in the sample and could induce cpe in culture at the same time a certain number of samples processed by icc qpcr were also shown to detect infectious viruses in culture for which cpe could not be observed the disadvantage of using cpe is that not all viruses induce a detectable cpe outcome in culture dilnessa 2017 as such both methods provide important information regarding virus infectivity of the four viruses tested by icc qpcr rotavirus adenovirus enterovirusand reovirus no significant difference in virus inactivation was observed between wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 adenovirus and enterovirus were sporadically detected in pre uv and post uvsamples making it difficult to evaluate true log10 reductions reovirus had the greatest frequency of detection by icc qpcr and proved to be the most reliable virus for evaluating uv disinfection efficacy mean log10 reduction values for reovirus was 1 55 5 95 iles 0 44 2 90 in wwtp 1 and 2 to our knowledge this is the first report to illustrate the reduction efficiency of infectious reovirus by uv disinfection in full scale operating wwtps reovirus is frequently detected in environmental waters and it has been recommended as a viral indicator for human faecal contamination in seawater and surface water grohmann et al 1993 muscillo et al 2001 spinner and di giovanni 2001 in the current study the log10 reduction of total infectious viruses based on cpe 1 46 and 1 67 log10 for wwtp 1 2 respectively was similar to reovirus reduction based on icc qpcr furthermore uv dosimetry estimates based on e coli inactivation levels in the same wastewater samples verified that the effective uv dose administered at the wwtps was in the range of 8 24 mj cm2 and consequently when this effective dose is applied to estimate adenovirus inactivation based on published literature adenovirus reduction was estimated at 1 22 and 1 18 log by uv treatment at wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 respectively being similar to the overall reovirus reductions observed by icc qpcr at full scale collectively our data indicates the potential of reovirus to act as a reference virus during wastewater treatment at full scale more investigations on the occurrence sources concentrations and cell culture pathogenesis of reovirus are needed to confirm its value and potential genomic diversity as a virus index group for uv disinfection it is interesting to note that reovirus was rarely detected in pre uv and post uv samples by direct qpcr symonds et al 2009 but was frequently detected by cell culture icc qpcr as observed in many other studies aulicino et al 1996 lodder and de roda husman 2005 sedmak et al 2005 lim et al 2015 qiu et al 2015 betancourt and gerba 2016 it is possible that the overall reovirus load in wastewater was below the detection limit of the qpcr assay our qpcr assay was able to detect as low as 15 iu pcr of reovirus using the conserved regions of m1 gene which is similar to a previous study targeting reovirus s2 gene with a sensitivity of 10 100 tcid50 viral particles muscillo et al 2001 however the sensitivity of our qpcr assay for reovirus was lower compared to cell culture icc qpcr which detected an average of 30 mpn l of infectious reovirus in pre uv samples therefore it is not surprising that reovirus was rarely detected in wastewater by direct qpcr on the other hand with high tropism of bgm and ma 104 cell lines reovirus culture icc qpcr provides an excellent opportunity to assay infectious viral indicator as the most detectable virus by cell culture icc qpcr reovirus was detected in 92 of pre uv samples which was much higher than rotavirus with detection in only 6 of pre uv samples this may be due to their different efficiency of propagation in cell culture even though they both belong to the reoviridae family ward et al 1984 mccrae 1985 no reliable log10 reduction estimates could be calculated for adenovirus and enterovirus by icc qpcr although both viruses were detected more frequently in cell culture than rotavirus the maximum concentration of adenovirus and enterovirus in pre uv samples obtained from icc qpcr were 18 and 182 mpn l respectively table 3 which were similar to previous studies reporting 8 mpn l of adenovirus and 39 mpn l of enterovirus after activated sludge treatment lodder and de roda husman 2005 sedmak et al 2005 the concentration of enterovirus 182 mpn l was also consistent with the converted qpcr result 208 iu l based on the correlation between infectious virus unit and genomic copy numbers however the detection of adenovirus and enterovirus in post uv was much less than pre uv samples and the majority of the samples 15 17 detected by icc qpcr in post uv samples could not be quantified without the measurement of virus concentration in post uv samples it was impossible to accurately determine the log10 reduction of adenovirus and enterovirus francy et al were also unable to calculate log10 removal of enterovirus by uv disinfection in a similar wwtp francy et al 2012 although the log10 reduction could not be determined in our study overall detection frequency associated with icc qpcr declined for enterovirus and adenovirus in both plants indicating that uv has certain effect on inactivation of infectious enterovirus and adenovirus in wastewater despite the relatively low uv doses delivered in all cases both enterovirus and adenovirus could still be detected in a proportion of post uv samples suggesting that infectious viruses remained after uv treatment 5 conclusions norovirus rotavirus sapovirus astrovirus enterovirus adenovirus and jc virus were frequently detected in pre uv samples by qpcr with relatively high viral loads infectious viruses as detected by cell culture and icc qpcr were more prevalent in pre uv samples 98 than post uv samples 76 log10 reduction of total infectious viruses 1 46 and 1 67 log by uv disinfection was comparable to reovirus reduction 1 23 and 1 75 log indicating the potential of reovirus as a viral index for wastewater treatment infectious rotavirus was rarely detected in cell culture infectious enterovirus and adenovirus were detected with low viral load using icc qpcr therefore log10 reduction by uv disinfection was unable to be assessed for rotavirus enterovirus and adenovirus cell culture and icc qpcr can be used to assess uv inactivation of certain viruses such as reovirus but may not be suitable for rotavirus due to the inefficient propagation in cell culture

19234,ultraviolet uv disinfection is widely used to inactivate microorganisms prior to release of treated municipal wastewater however limited data are available for in situ inactivation of infectious enteric viruses by uv treatment at full scale in this study a total of 51 pre uv and 50 post uv samples were collected over a two year period from two wastewater treatment plants wwtps and analyzed for noroviruses rotavirus reovirus sapovirus astrovirus enteroviruses adenoviruses and jc virus both pre uv and post uv samples had relatively high concentrations of these viruses determined by qpcr infectious viruses were also observed in 98 of pre uv samples and 76 of post uv samples by cell culture using either cytopathic effect cpe or integrated cell culture with qpcr icc qpcr reovirus was the most common virus detected by icc qpcr present in 92 of pre uv and 48 of post uv samples infectious enterovirus and adenovirus were detected by icc qpcr in 33 and 31 of pre uv samples 14 and 20 of post uv samples respectively mean log10 reduction estimates for infectious reovirus was 1 2 and 1 8 log for the two wwtps as assessed by icc qpcr which was similar to the reduction of total infectious viruses 1 5 and 1 7 log as assessed by cpe in cells culture overall quantification of infectious reovirus appears to provide a useful index of enteric virus inactivation during wastewater treatment at full scale to our knowledge this is the first comprehensive study to assess uv inactivation of human enteric viruses at full scale in wwtps using both molecular and cell culture techniques providing

factors include microbial mechanisms such as dna repair enzymes genome thymidine content and even the synthesis of uv absorbing proteins hijnen et al 2006 rastogi et al 2014 with adenoviruses representing some of the most uv resistant enteric pathogens described rodriguez et al 2013 abiotic factors that affect uv efficacy include uv transmissivity of the water the higher transmissivity the less quenching of the uv light dose intensity mj cm2 hydraulic retention time and the spectrum of uv light output hijnen et al 2006 zhang et al 2016 human enteric viruses are common microbial contaminants in wastewater and require the highest removal of all pathogen classes for reuse applications soller et al 2018 the most notable ones include noroviruses rotaviruses sapoviruses astroviruses adenoviruses and enteroviruses all of which are commonly detected in municipal wastewater worldwide montazeri et al 2015 qiu et al 2015 kaas et al 2016 although prevalent in wastewater these viruses are rarely tested for or monitored in finished effluents at full scale facilities it is known that inactivation of bacterial indicators does not correlate well with viruses because of their differential susceptibility to uv radiation harwood et al 2005 hijnen et al 2006 to help address these knowledge gaps monitoring and understanding the efficiency of uv inactivation of enteric viruses during wastewater treatment is important the majority of studies regarding uv inactivation of viruses in water have been conducted at the laboratory or bench scale which cannot adequately reflect the performance of uv disinfection during wastewater treatment at full scale gerba et al 2002 shin et al 2005 calgua et al 2014 there are limited studies of uv inactivation of viruses carried out at full scale in wastewater treatment plants wwtps oppenheimer et al 1997 francy et al 2012 lee et al 2018 since many enteric viruses are not easily cultured most studies have used molecular techniques such as qpcr to estimate virion concentrations in water samples however since molecular methods detect both infectious and non infectious viruses the public health impact regarding treatment efficacy is a concern francy et al 2012 in the past decade several attempts have been made to distinguish infectious and non infectious viruses by qpcr using pre treatment with rnase or using intercalating dyes such as propidium monoazide pma which can penetrate damaged or compromised virus particles and bind to the genome lamhoujeb et al 2008 parshionikar et al 2010 however karim et al suggest that pma qpcr was unable to differentiate infectious and uv inactivated viruses due to the inability of uv light to damage the viral capsid karim et al 2015 conversely traditional viral cell culture using cytopathic effects cpe for measuring infectious viruses are relatively insensitive due to the fact that not all infectious viruses induce a measurable cpe in cell culture dilnessa 2017 consequently traditional viral culture methods that incorporate qpcr as a measure on infectivity known as integrated cell culture qpcr icc qpcr have been used as an alternative tool for estimating infectious viruses in water qiu et al 2015 in the present study we evaluated uv inactivation against an array of enteric viruses at two full scale municipal wwtps by monitoring the occurrence of human enteric viruses before and after uv treatment using qpcr cell culture and icc qpcr of particular importance was the evaluation of infectious virus reduction by low pressure uv treatment and the potential of reovirus as a useful viral indicator to assess uv disinfection efficacy betancourt and gerba 2016 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater treatment plants and water sample collection two municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 located in calgary canada were evaluated in this study wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 have treatment capacities to serve a population of 250 000 and 1 000 000 respectively the average daily discharge for wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 were 90 900 m3 and 344 889 m3 respectively both facilities provide tertiary treatment of wastewater through i 6 mm screening of raw sewage ii grit removal iii primary clarification iv biological nutrient removal through an activated sludge process v secondary clarification and vi uv disinfection of final effluent wwtp 1 also has an effluent filtration step prior to uv disinfection where the secondary effluent is filtered through an aquadisk filter disc made of synthetic pile fabric with a 10 μm nominal pore size at wwtp 1 the filtered secondary effluent is uv disinfected trojan3000plus at an average capacity of 100 ml d and a peak capacity of 240 ml d the system is designed to provide a uv dose of 24 mj cm2 at peak flow from a total of 672 low pressure high output amalgam 250 w lamps arranged in 4 lamp banks across 2 uv channels at wwtp 2 the secondary effluent is disinfected in a fisher porter uv disinfection system with an average capacity of 500 ml d and a peak capacity of 1020 ml d the system is designed to provide an applied uv dose of 30 mj cm2 from a total of 11 520 low pressure low output mercury 65 w lamps arranged in 30 lamp banks across 10 uv channels wastewater samples were collected monthly before uv treatment pre uv and post uv treatment from both wwtps the samples were collected in a reverse order of treatment processes post uv prior to pre uv in order to minimize potential cross contamination of samples with higher pathogen concentrations the samples were collected upstream pre uv and downstream post uv of the light banks directly through access hatches from the continuously flowing streams of wastewater within the uv channels the channels sampled varied between sampling events based on those in service at the time of sampling as part of the normal wwtp operations samples were collected in 10 l plastic containers using a peristaltic pump isco 150 portable pump tubing and connectors were sterilized by autoclaving prior to use in the pumping system and in advance of each sampling event the sample was flushed through the pumping system for approximately 1 min prior to sample collection and the containers were rinsed three times with the sample matrix prior to sample collection the flow rate of the pump was maintained at 4 l min during sampling the samples were typically collected approximately 3 h prior to the peak daytime flow at wwtp 1 and 2 h prior to peak daytime flow at wwtp 2 samples were placed in coolers with ice packs and transported to the laboratory for processing within 24 h samples were collected from wwtp 1 for 21 months oct 2014 jun 2016 and wwtp 2 for 14 months nov 2014 dec 2015 a total of 51 pre uv samples wwtp 1 29 wwtp 2 22 and 50 post uv samples wwtp 1 28 wwtp 2 22 were analyzed for viruses additionally 32 and 21 pre uv samples from wwtp 1 and 2 respectively were used for spiking studies to monitor method recoveries for viruses 2 2 virus concentration from water samples the adsorption elution method using nanoceram 90 mm laminated disc filters argonide corp sanford fl usa was used to concentrate the virus from water samples as previously described pang et al 2012 qiu et al 2015 briefly 10 l of water sample were filtered and eluted with 1 5 beef extract buffer ph 9 75 followed by flocculation with 0 5 mol l fecl3 and centrifugation the final volume of the concentrated viral suspension was adjusted to 15 ml using mem medium invitrogen burlington on canada with the ph at 7 2 0 2 a flow chart outlining the sample processing procedure is provided in fig 1 the concentrated samples were aliquoted and stored at 70 c until further processed 2 3 viral nucleic acid extraction and qpcr total viral nucleic acids were extracted from 200 μl of viral concentrates and eluted in 50 μl rnase free water using the magazorb total rna prep kit promega wi usa according to the manufacturer s instructions two step reactions including reverse transcription rt and qpcr were performed for all rna and dna viruses using abi fast 7500 sequence detection system abi as previously described pang et al 2012 qiu et al 2015 2016 for each qpcr reaction an equivalent of 1 67 ml of the original water sample was assayed fig 1 an external standard curve was established for quantification of all viruses using the 875 bp dna fragment of nov genogroup ii gii by 10 fold serial dilution from 100 copies to 1 0 106 copies qiu 2016 virus load was expressed as genome equivalent ge copies l a panel of eight viruses including norovirus genogroups i and ii gi gii rotavirus sapovirus astrovirus enterovirus adenovirus jc virus and reovirus were tested the sequences of primers and probes for the qpcr targeting these viruses were previously described pang et al 2012 qiu et al 2015 but noting the sequence corrections for reovirus primers being forward 5 agttgctgaacgcaaattattttg 3 reverse 5 tgcgaatcatcagattaacctctgt 3 2 4 virus spiking for evaluating virus recovery a mix of four viruses containing norovirus gii adenovirus reovirus and coxsackievirus b which belongs to enterovirus were used to assess virus recoveries norovirus gii and adenovirus were prepared from clinical stool samples clinical strain of coxsackievirus b was prepared from culture stock and reovirus was isolated from one of the pre uv samples through cell culture one millilitre of the virus mixture was spiked into 10 l pre uv samples and concentrated as described above the same aliquot of the virus mixture 1 ml was added to 14 ml of deionized water as baseline control and tested in parallel with the concentrated spiked water samples using qpcr the recovery was calculated as follows recovery the amount of virus detected in the spiked pre uv sample the amount of virus detected in the baseline sample 100 2 5 virus cell culture for assessing infectivity of culturable viruses african rhesus monkey kidney cells ma 104 and buffalo green monkey kidney cells bgm were grown separately on eagle s mem medium sigma on canada as previously described qiu et al 2015 once the cells were confluent ma 104 and bgm cells were trypsinized and mixed in a 2 1 co culture ratio for virus infection in order to quantify infectious viruses the concentrated water samples were serially diluted 10 fold from undiluted to 10 3 for pre uv samples and to 10 2 for post uv samples respectively one millilitre of the undiluted or 10 fold serially diluted samples was inoculated into the mixed cells for a 10 day culture period sub culture was performed using 1 ml of the first cultured harvest medium to inoculate mixed cells for another 10 day culture each sample was cultured in duplicate flasks for most probable number mpn measurement and cpe was examined for viral replication in first cultures and sub cultures the viruses were harvested after sub culture and tested for rotavirus enterovirus adenovirus and reovirus by icc qpcr qiu et al 2015 2 6 correlation between infectious viruses and viral genomic copy number to understand the relationship between virus infectious unit iu and viral genomic copy numbers reovirus isolated from one of the post uv samples was titrated using the 50 tissue culture infectious dose method tcid50 briefly a serial 10 fold dilution of cultured reovirus down to 10 9 was inoculated into 4 flasks of bgm cells for each dilution the cells were monitored daily for ten days and any sign of cpe was recorded the tcid50 infectious unit was calculated using the reed muench method lennette 1988 based on virus dilutions and cpe observations coxsackievirus b was previously titrated using the same method pang et al 2012 titrated reovirus and coxsackievirus b cultured stocks were diluted and assayed by qpcr briefly a serial 10 fold dilution was performed for coxsackievirus b and reovirus cultured stocks down to 10 9 and the total nucleic acids were extracted for each dilution as described rt and qpcr were performed to quantify the viral load in ge copy numbers each dilution was run in triplicate for qpcr and repeated for three times 2 7 statistical analysis virus recoveries were compared between two wwtps for each virus using the mann whitney u test against the null hypothesis that the median recovery was identical for the two wwtps mpns and their corresponding 95 confidence intervals cis were determined based on a 2 well mpn of cpe counts of total infectious virus or icc qpcr test counts of individual infectious viruses rotavirus enterovirus adenovirus and reovirus with an assumption that the number of infectious virions in each cell culture followed a poisson distribution with the concentration of infectious virus as its constant rate parameter the maximum likelihood estimates of the virus concentration were determined to maximize the likelihood of getting the observed number of positive culture results at varied dilutions mpn was calculated for the original sample based on the maximum likelihood estimates of virus concentration the reduction in infectious viruses by uv disinfection and their corresponding cis were calculated as followed infectious virus log10 reduction log10 virus concentration of pre uv samples mpn l log10 virus concentration of post uv samples mpn l 3 results 3 1 virus recovery virus recoveries varied by virus type recovery ranged from 3 to 56 for adenovirus 11 37 for enterovirus 3 21 for norovirus and 4 80 for reovirus enterovirus and norovirus had the highest and lowest median recoveries respectively among the four spiked viruses the median recovery value for enterovirus was significantly higher p 0 002 in wwtp 2 compared to wwtp 1 no significant difference was found for recovery of adenovirus p 0 3 and reovirus p 0 9 between two wwtps fig 2 no reliable recovery for norovirus in wwtp 2 was obtained due to the highly uncertain estimated recoveries 3 2 detection and quantification of viruses in pre uv and post uv samples by qpcr norovirus gii rotavirus astrovirus and adenovirus were detected by qpcr in all pre uv n 51 and post uv n 50 samples table 1 norovirus gi was detected in most of the samples except one post uv sample from wwtp 2 sapovirus enterovirus and jc virus were detected in 46 90 47 92 and 47 92 pre uv samples 44 88 46 92 and 47 94 post uv samples respectively reovirus was only detected in 1 pre uv and 4 post uv samples rotavirus and enterovirus had the highest and lowest concentrations respectively in both plants the concentrations of rotavirus ranged from 4 5 to 6 7 log10 ge copies l in pre uv samples while the concentration of enterovirus ranged from non detected to 4 6 log10 ge copies l in pre uv samples no significant difference in norovirus gi gii and rotavirus concentrations in pre uv samples by qpcr was determined between the two plants fig 3 a however sapovirus p 0 034 astrovirus p 0 006 enterovirus p 0 0007 adenovirus p 0 026 and jc virus p 0 0003 were detected at significantly higher concentrations in pre uv samples in wwtp 2 compared to wwtp 1 fig 3b as anticipated virus concentrations obtained from qpcr did not show significant differences between pre and post uv samples at each plant except for enterovirus which had significantly greater concentration in pre uv than post uv samples at wwtp 1 p 0 05 although the duration of study 21 months for wwtp 1 and 14 months wwtp 2 pre empted us from comprehensively assessing seasonality of occurrence of the different viruses in both plants it is worth noting that rotavirus concentration peaked in the spring of each year in wwtp 1 march april of 2015 and 2016 fig 3a the peak occurrence of rotavirus in wwtp 1 in the spring of 2015 also coincided with a peak occurrence of this same virus in wwtp 2 in the spring of that same year norovirus gi and gii also had some of the highest concentrations observed in the spring march and april at each of the wwtps fig 3a no distinct temporal patterns of virus occurrence were readily observed for any of the other viruses studied fig 3b 3 3 infectious viruses detected by cell culture and icc qpcr cpe was observed in 27 29 93 and 22 22 100 cultured pre uv samples as well as 11 28 39 and 15 22 68 of post uv samples in wwtp 1 and 2 respectively table 2 icc qpcr results were obtained in 26 29 90 and 22 22 100 cultured pre uv samples and in 16 28 57 and 16 22 73 of post uv samples in wwtp 1 and 2 respectively table 2 infectious viruses were identified by icc qpcr in 1 pre uv and 12 post uv samples without cpe observed table s1 s2 however 2 pre uv and 6 post uv samples showed cpe without any viruses detected by icc qpcr table s1 s2 one virus type or multiple virus types up to 4 viruses were often detected by icc qpcr in the one pre uv or post uv sample table 2 reovirus was the most common virus detected present in 25 86 and 22 100 pre uv samples as well as 9 32 and 15 68 post uv samples in wwtp 1 and 2 respectively in combining data from both wwtps rotavirus enterovirus and adenovirus were detected in 3 51 6 17 51 33 and 16 51 31 pre uv samples and in 4 50 8 7 50 14 and 10 50 20 post uv samples 3 4 inactivation of infectious virus by uv disinfection based on mpn values obtained from cell culture with cpe the mean log10 reductions for total infectious viruses was similar between two plants p 0 29 which was determined to be 1 46 and 1 67 log10 for wwtp 1 and 2 respectively table 3 overall the concentration of most viruses as determined by icc qpcr in pre uv and post uv samples was too low to reliably evaluate log10 reduction values across the uv treatment process table 3 this challenge was also compounded by the infrequent detection of some of the viruses in the post uv samples i e rotavirus enterovirus and adenovirus the only virus to provide reliable data in terms of both detection frequency and concentrations was reovirus using icc qpcr 1 23 and 1 75 log10 reduction of reovirus was observed in wwtp 1 and 2 respectively which did not have significant difference between two plants p 0 34 table 3 as an additional approach for evaluating virus inactivation by uv disinfection the frequency of virus detection in cell culture was also assessed the frequency of detection of total infectious viruses based on cpe was reduced from 93 to 39 in wwtp 1 from 100 to 68 in wwtp 2 table s3 moreover the frequency of detection by icc qpcr was reduced from 28 to 14 for enterovirus 86 to 32 for reovirus in wwtp 1 no reduction in frequency of detection was observed for rotavirus and adenovirus in wwtp 1 the frequency of detection at wwtp 2 was reduced from 100 to 68 for reovirus 46 to 18 for adenovirus and 41 to 14 for enterovirus table s3 3 5 correlation between genomic copy numbers and virus infectious units as reovirus was rarely detected by qpcr in both pre uv and post uv samples but frequently detected in cell culture the correlation between genomic copy numbers obtained from qpcr and virus infectious units was assessed the limit of detection lod for qpcr assay was 5 ge copies pcr which was equivalent to 3000 ge copies l of water tested using the titrated reovirus with a tcid50 of 5 88 107 iu ml the lod of qpcr for infectious reovirus was 15 iu pcr equivalent to 9000 iu l of water tested which was much higher than the concentration of infectious reovirus obtained by cell culture icc qpcr undetectable to 1050 mpn l in pre uv samples table 3 to identify whether the qpcr sensitivity of reovirus is comparable to other viruses titrated coxsackievirus tcid50 4 68 107 iu ml was also tested by qpcr the lod of qpcr for infectious coxsackievirus was determined as 60 iu l of water which was much lower than reovirus even though both viruses have similar tcid50 values indicating that qpcr was more sensitive for detection of coxsackievirus compared to reovirus based on the correlation between viral genomic copy numbers and virus infectious unit one iu of infectious coxsackievirus and reovirus particle have an estimated equivalent of 212 and 4 4 ge copies respectively using qpcr 4 discussion with the widespread use of uv disinfection in the wastewater industry uv inactivation of pathogens in water has been broadly studied and has shown to be most effective against bacteria and protozoa especially oo cysts of cryptosporidium and giardia mofidi et al 2002 morita et al 2002 however viruses have been reported to be less susceptible to uv irradiation based on bench scale studies hijnen et al 2006 moreover limited data is available for uv inactivation of enteric viruses during wastewater treatment especially at full scale in this study we assessed the occurrence of enteric viruses norovirus rotavirus sapovirus astrovirus adenovirus enterovirus and reovirus and jc virus during uv disinfection at two full scale municipal wwtps the efficiency of uv inactivation of infectious viruses was evaluated using both qpcr and cell culture methods cpe and icc qpcr to our knowledge this is the first comprehensive study to assess uv inactivation of a variety of viruses at full scale wwtps using both molecular and cell culture techniques virus recovery is usually measured to monitor the concentration and qpcr procedures but it may vary due to different methods and water matrices in this study virus recovery from secondary treated wastewater pre uv was evaluated for four different viruses recovery for adenovirus 3 56 was similar to bofill mas s finding using an ultracentrifugation concentration method 2 25 for wastewater bofill mas et al 2006 but higher than several other studies using adsorption elution methods 7 wang et al 2018 or glass wool filtration with polyethylene glycol precipitation method 0 1 5 in wastewater francy et al 2012 as well as a negatively charged membrane filtration method 0 3 1 5 in river water fong et al 2010 recoveries for enterovirus 11 37 were similar to our previous studies using a deionized water matrix pang et al 2012 qiu et al 2015 but higher than francy s finding 1 in wastewater francy et al 2012 recoveries for reovirus 4 80 were also higher than a recent report using a nanoceram cartridge with tertiary treated wastewater 4 8 betancourt et al 2017 all these findings indicate that the concentration method and qpcr detection assay used in this study was as reliable and as good or higher than previously reported for other methods similar to our previous findings qiu et al 2015 seven viruses including norovirus rotavirus sapovirus astrovirus enterovirus adenovirus and jc virus were routinely detected by qpcr in pre uv samples while reovirus was rarely detected of these seven viruses sapovirus astrovirus enterovirus adenovirus and jc virus were present at significantly higher concentrations in pre uv samples in wwtp 2 than wwtp 1 for norovirus and rotavirus even though no statistically significant difference was identified in virus concentrations between the two plants based on qpcr the average viral loads of both viruses were still higher in wwtp 2 compared to wwtp 1 differences in virus concentrations between two plants may be due to several reasons the composition of incoming wastewater minor process and operational changes differences differing matrix effects on virus recovery it was noted that the highest concentrations of rotavirus occurred in spring in both plants in accordance with the seasonal increase of rotavirus associated sporadic gastroenteritis in alberta pang et al 2014 interestingly an unusual spring peak of norovirus was observed in both plants fig 3a an observation different from previous studies where norovirus was associated with winter seasonality in clinical samples hasing et al 2013 however the observation of a spring peak in norovirus coincided with a notable increase in sporadic children norovirus infections in alberta during the sampling period data not published indicating a close relationship between norovirus viral load in wastewater and the clinical norovirus associated gastroenteritis enteric viruses such as norovirus rotavirus and adenovirus have been detected in uv disinfected wastewater by qpcr in various studies francy et al 2012 qiu et al 2015 campos et al 2016 lopez galvez et al 2016 it is well known that qpcr alone cannot distinguish between free nucleic acid inactivated viruses and infectious viruses all which may result in the underestimation of the inactivation of enteric viruses by uv disinfection although many studies have demonstrated no correlation between pcr amplifiable virus genome copies and the level of inactivation achieved by uv some studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between these two variables allain et al 2006 lee et al 2008 whether this relationship holds true or not depends on both the virus itself i e rna vs dna single vs double stranded the composition of the gene target i e thymidine content and target length and the level of nucleic acid degradation associated with previous inactivation processes upstream of uv pecson et al 2009 rodriguez et al 2009 ronnqvist et al 2014 moreover most studies on uv inactivation have been performed at bench scale using water samples spiked with cultured or isolated virus stocks since wastewater contains a plethora of genetic variants in a population we sought to evaluate the utility of qpcr as a measure of inactivation efficacy at full scale in most cases qpcr concentration estimates of pre and post uv were similar for all viruses suggesting that qpcr itself is not a good measure of uv inactivation across all the genetic variants of selected virus species that may be present in full scale wastewater treatment plants although qpcr is often criticized as a method for measuring virus inactivation by uv it is important to note that the test provides critical information about viral occurrence not easily obtained by cpe or icc qpcr methods not all viruses are equally effective at establishing infections in cell culture including rotavirus and norovirus our data demonstrates that rotavirus was detected at the highest concentrations in both pre uv and post uv samples among all the viruses tested by qpcr in this study however it was rarely detected by icc qpcr and consequently it was impossible to assess the log10 reduction of infectious rotavirus it is known that different rotavirus strains have various capacities to grow in culture and in some cases it has been shown that some human strains are very inefficient at propagation in culture when obtained from human faecal specimens arnold et al 2009 other studies have demonstrated that rotavirus strains may grow more efficiently in primary cells than continuous cells such as bgm and ma104 with propagation efficiency being only one out of every 46000 virus particles infecting primary cells ward et al 1984 although a co cultured system of two cell lines bgm and ma104 was used in this study to maximize diversity in virus recovery the efficiency of rotavirus infecting either cell may still be low which could have resulted in underestimating infectious rotavirus in wastewater samples the recent development of a norovirus cell culture system zou et al 2017 may be useful to assess the performance of uv disinfection particularly considering that norovirus is one of the most conservative virus targets used for wastewater and drinking water risk assessment ashbolt 2015 due to the limitations in the qpcr approach the combination of cell culture and icc qpcr was used in this study to evaluate the inactivation of infectious enteric viruses four culturable viruses including rotavirus adenovirus enterovirus and rovirus were assessed for reductions in infectivity associated with uv treatment in addition to the four viruses tested by icc qpcr other unknown viruses were also shown to be present in the treated water as confirmed by cpe one of the disadvantages of icc qpcr is that the method is designed to look for specific viruses based on pcr primer designs and therefore may miss viruses that are present in the sample and could induce cpe in culture at the same time a certain number of samples processed by icc qpcr were also shown to detect infectious viruses in culture for which cpe could not be observed the disadvantage of using cpe is that not all viruses induce a detectable cpe outcome in culture dilnessa 2017 as such both methods provide important information regarding virus infectivity of the four viruses tested by icc qpcr rotavirus adenovirus enterovirusand reovirus no significant difference in virus inactivation was observed between wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 adenovirus and enterovirus were sporadically detected in pre uv and post uvsamples making it difficult to evaluate true log10 reductions reovirus had the greatest frequency of detection by icc qpcr and proved to be the most reliable virus for evaluating uv disinfection efficacy mean log10 reduction values for reovirus was 1 55 5 95 iles 0 44 2 90 in wwtp 1 and 2 to our knowledge this is the first report to illustrate the reduction efficiency of infectious reovirus by uv disinfection in full scale operating wwtps reovirus is frequently detected in environmental waters and it has been recommended as a viral indicator for human faecal contamination in seawater and surface water grohmann et al 1993 muscillo et al 2001 spinner and di giovanni 2001 in the current study the log10 reduction of total infectious viruses based on cpe 1 46 and 1 67 log10 for wwtp 1 2 respectively was similar to reovirus reduction based on icc qpcr furthermore uv dosimetry estimates based on e coli inactivation levels in the same wastewater samples verified that the effective uv dose administered at the wwtps was in the range of 8 24 mj cm2 and consequently when this effective dose is applied to estimate adenovirus inactivation based on published literature adenovirus reduction was estimated at 1 22 and 1 18 log by uv treatment at wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 respectively being similar to the overall reovirus reductions observed by icc qpcr at full scale collectively our data indicates the potential of reovirus to act as a reference virus during wastewater treatment at full scale more investigations on the occurrence sources concentrations and cell culture pathogenesis of reovirus are needed to confirm its value and potential genomic diversity as a virus index group for uv disinfection it is interesting to note that reovirus was rarely detected in pre uv and post uv samples by direct qpcr symonds et al 2009 but was frequently detected by cell culture icc qpcr as observed in many other studies aulicino et al 1996 lodder and de roda husman 2005 sedmak et al 2005 lim et al 2015 qiu et al 2015 betancourt and gerba 2016 it is possible that the overall reovirus load in wastewater was below the detection limit of the qpcr assay our qpcr assay was able to detect as low as 15 iu pcr of reovirus using the conserved regions of m1 gene which is similar to a previous study targeting reovirus s2 gene with a sensitivity of 10 100 tcid50 viral particles muscillo et al 2001 however the sensitivity of our qpcr assay for reovirus was lower compared to cell culture icc qpcr which detected an average of 30 mpn l of infectious reovirus in pre uv samples therefore it is not surprising that reovirus was rarely detected in wastewater by direct qpcr on the other hand with high tropism of bgm and ma 104 cell lines reovirus culture icc qpcr provides an excellent opportunity to assay infectious viral indicator as the most detectable virus by cell culture icc qpcr reovirus was detected in 92 of pre uv samples which was much higher than rotavirus with detection in only 6 of pre uv samples this may be due to their different efficiency of propagation in cell culture even though they both belong to the reoviridae family ward et al 1984 mccrae 1985 no reliable log10 reduction estimates could be calculated for adenovirus and enterovirus by icc qpcr although both viruses were detected more frequently in cell culture than rotavirus the maximum concentration of adenovirus and enterovirus in pre uv samples obtained from icc qpcr were 18 and 182 mpn l respectively table 3 which were similar to previous studies reporting 8 mpn l of adenovirus and 39 mpn l of enterovirus after activated sludge treatment lodder and de roda husman 2005 sedmak et al 2005 the concentration of enterovirus 182 mpn l was also consistent with the converted qpcr result 208 iu l based on the correlation between infectious virus unit and genomic copy numbers however the detection of adenovirus and enterovirus in post uv was much less than pre uv samples and the majority of the samples 15 17 detected by icc qpcr in post uv samples could not be quantified without the measurement of virus concentration in post uv samples it was impossible to accurately determine the log10 reduction of adenovirus and enterovirus francy et al were also unable to calculate log10 removal of enterovirus by uv disinfection in a similar wwtp francy et al 2012 although the log10 reduction could not be determined in our study overall detection frequency associated with icc qpcr declined for enterovirus and adenovirus in both plants indicating that uv has certain effect on inactivation of infectious enterovirus and adenovirus in wastewater despite the relatively low uv doses delivered in all cases both enterovirus and adenovirus could still be detected in a proportion of post uv samples suggesting that infectious viruses remained after uv treatment 5 conclusions norovirus rotavirus sapovirus astrovirus enterovirus adenovirus and jc virus were frequently detected in pre uv samples by qpcr with relatively high viral loads infectious viruses as detected by cell culture and icc qpcr were more prevalent in pre uv samples 98 than post uv samples 76 log10 reduction of total infectious viruses 1 46 and 1 67 log by uv disinfection was comparable to reovirus reduction 1 23 and 1 75 log indicating the potential of reovirus as a viral index for wastewater treatment infectious rotavirus was rarely detected in cell culture infectious enterovirus and adenovirus were detected with low viral load using icc qpcr therefore log10 reduction by uv disinfection was unable to be assessed for rotavirus enterovirus and adenovirus cell culture and icc qpcr can be used to assess uv inactivation of certain viruses such as reovirus but may not be suitable for rotavirus due to the inefficient propagation in cell culture
