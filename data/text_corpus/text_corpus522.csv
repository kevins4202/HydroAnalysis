2610,drought has become one of the main reasons for the loss of terrestrial ecosystems gross primary productivity gpp because of its more frequent occurrence under the background of global warming aiming to explore the response mechanism of vegetation under drought conditions the sun induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and enhanced vegetation index evi were used to monitor vegetation drought and quantify the drought induced gpp variabilities modis gpp were used for analysis which was verified by close path eddy covariance flux r2 0 69 p 0 01 according to the standard precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and soil moisture sm the drought periods of 2010 and 2014 in the eastern piedmont of taihang mountains were selected to analyze drought impacts on gpp we found that sif had the ability to reflect the effects of drought prolonged action on vegetation and respond to gpp persistent changes during drought sif successfully described gpp loss during droughts in 2010 20 91 gcm 2month 1 and 2014 9 52 gcm 2month 1 sif was more significantly linearly correlated with gpp r2 0 89 than ndvi r2 0 69 and evi r2 0 84 suggesting that sif was more sensitive to physiological changes in vegetation sif correlated significantly higher to sm than spei and there was a two month lag to sm which may be related to the adaptation mechanism of vegetation physiological recovery under drought conditions results showed that sif is more accurate and sensitive than ndvi and evi in regional vegetation drought monitoring and drought induced gpp variations sif is an effective physiological index for timely detection and regional drought and an effective tool for ecosystem management and disaster warning keywords drought indicator sun induced chlorophyll fluorescence vegetation index gross primary productivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the terrestrial plants fix carbon dioxide co2 to organic compounds through photosynthesis gross primary productivity gpp refers to co2 absorbed by plants when producing organic matter beer et al 2010 as the production basis of human food wood and fiber gpp variations are related to human welfare beer et al 2010 due to the deep coupling of carbon water and energy at the ecosystem level the change of gpp profoundly affects the hydrological process and energy balance of the ecosystem chen et al 2021 as an important factor to control vegetation growth water participates in vegetation physiological activities promote vegetation photosynthesis increases ecosystem gpp and then improves ecosystem carbon absorption capacity soil water deficit during drought can damage ecosystem carbon cycle balance resulting in a decline in vegetation carbon absorption capacity zhang et al 2016 in the context of global climate warming the frequency of drought as a long lasting destructive and undetectable extreme climate event shows an increasing trend diffenbaugh et al 2005 drought has a huge impact on the composition structure and function of the ecosystem weakening the carbon sink function of the ecosystem to a certain extent resulting in the loss of ecosystem gpp frank et al 2015 whipple et al 2019 it is expected that drought will have a greater impact on ecosystem gpp in the future climate model schwalm et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 since the impact of drought on gpp is potential and complex its influencing mechanism is still unclear chen et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to study the response mechanism of gpp under drought conditions and monitor the gpp loss caused by drought in real time it can help predict the variation of gpp more accurately under future climate conditions which is of great significance to agricultural production management and ecological environment protection at present the observation on gpp mostly focuses on the site scale flux tower and the direct observation of gpp at regional and global scales faces severe challenges gpp research on regional and global scales mainly includes three approaches model simulation flux tower observation upscaling and satellite remote sensing anav et al 2015 model simulation is the main method of upscaling research mainly including remote sensing model based on data driven and mechanism model based on ecosystem process great uncertainty is usually introduced in model simulation by driving data model structure model parameters and initial conditions furthermore the prediction of gpp under future climate models requires historical data which cannot achieve real time observation of gpp variations in drought periods chen et al 2021 the method based on flux tower observation scaling needs to continuously increase the density of the observation tower and expand through the direct spatial interpolation of the observed values however due to the complexity and diversity of the ecological system it is impossible to obtain the actual observation data of all ecosystem types on the earth besides the results from flux tower observations cannot be applied to predicting the ecosystem response under future climate change scenarios yu et al 2004 satellite remote sensing is the major method of regional scale gpp observation which can provide a large number of time continuous and spatial consistent data products for ecosystem research and management wu et al 2020 vegetation indices vis based on remote sensing reflectance such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and enhanced vegetation index evi can indicate vegetation greenness and have been widely used to monitor changes in vegetation growth yang et al 2018 although vis can provide real time monitoring of vegetation greenness information to reflect the photosynthetic capacity of vegetation there are some limitations in reflecting gpp variations vegetation index based on remote sensing reflectance can explain the change of chlorophyll content by greenness to detect potential plant photosynthesis zhang et al 2019 but fails to reflect instantaneous photosynthetic rate and it cannot accurately reflect ecosystem gpp loss sun induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif is a new technique for monitoring vegetation growth and stress response at regional scale in recent years sif is a spectral signal with red light about 690 nm and near infrared about 740 nm peaks 650 800 nm emitted by photosynthetic centers under solar light conditions which can directly reflect the dynamic changes of plant photosynthesis zhang et al 2019 as an electromagnetic signal associated with vegetation photosynthesis sif contains information on physiological biochemical and metabolic characteristics of vegetation thus it can more accurately assess the actual state of photosynthesis than traditional vegetation indices guanter et al 2014 many researches have shown that sif has the ability to reflect the change of gpp guanter et al 2014 and has the ability to reflect the response of vegetation to stress cao et al 2021 chen et al 2021 the hilly area in the eastern piedmont of taihang mountains shoulders important ecological barrier and economic development function under the current strategic pattern of the integrated development of beijing tianjin hebei region however under the influence of global climate change it is frequently subjected to drought stress studying the impact of drought on the spatial and temporal variability of ecosystem gpp in the eastern piedmont of taihang mountains is of great significance to strengthen the ecological environment construction ensure ecological security and promote the development of regional economic virtuous cycle the objectives of this study are 1 using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and soil moisture sm to analyze the change of wet dry status in the study area from 2010 to 2018 and determine the drought events 2 analyzing the spatial and temporal changes of vegetation index vis and sif from 2010 to 2018 to determine the trend of gpp 3 revealing the ability of sif to capture gpp variations during drought events 4 providing quantitative gpp loss estimation during drought events 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the eastern piedmont of taihang mountains with an average elevation of about 1000 m which belongs

in neiqiu county xingtai city hebei province fig 1 to study the exchange of water heat and carbon between vegetation and the atmosphere the flux footprint source area has terraced fields and the main crops are wheat and corn the scope of the study area and land use types are shown in fig 1 due to the water resources shortage and lack of water engineering crops mainly rely on precipitation there

temporal resolution of 8 days the hdf format modis data was preprocess by resampling splicing merging and projection conversion then the 8 day time temporal resolution was converted in to monthly resolution data ndvi and evi were collectively referred to as vegetation indices vis continuous vis data from 2010 to 2018 were compared with sif and modis gpp data in 2021 were used to verify the correlation with the measured gpp data around the flux tower 2 2 3 spei selecting appropriate evaluation indices is particularly important for quantitative analysis of drought the spei was first proposed by vicent serrano et al 2010 and calculated by fitting the difference between available water precipitation and atmospheric evaporation demand potential evaporation to the logarithmic probability distribution chen et al 2019 compared with other widely used drought indices such as the palmer drought severity index pdsi and the standardized precipitation index spi spei can identify different drought types and impacts in the context of global warming many scholars used multi scale spei data to carry out regional long term drought trend analysis determined the main period of drought occurrence and studied the variation of regional dry and wet states ran et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 the global spei database https spei csic es is based on monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration currently the version of the cru ts4 03 dataset has been used which can provide multi time scale data with spatial resolution of 0 5 including long term and reliable information of drought conditions worldwide resample spei data to 0 05 for consistency with sif data monthly seasonal and annual scale spei data were used for further analysis when calculating spei of different time scales the first month is the current month for the time scale of n months it extends n 1 months backward from the current month monthly spei spei 01 seasonal spei 03 and annual spei spei 12 were selected to characterize the drought frequency and trend at monthly seasonal and interannual scales the negative value of spei indicates water deficit and the positive value indicates water surplus the larger value represents wetter condition and the smaller value represents drier condition specific spei levels and drought classification are shown in table 1 vicente serrano et al 2010 2 2 4 soil

and stored in netcdf 4 classical file format gruber et al 2019 the reliability of the dataset has been verified wang et al 2016 sm data was also resampled to 0 05 grid sm anomalies sm anm were calculated according to the deviation from the multi year average the range of sm anm standard deviation was selected as the dividing line of drought classification sm anm 0 025 indicating that the monthly soil moisture data was less than the standard deviation of sm anm is severe drought 0 025 sm anm 0 005 is mild drought 0 005 sm anm 0 005 is the normal fluctuation range of sm 0 005 sm anm 0

gpp can be calculated by nep and re as shown in eq 1 1 gpp re nep 2 3 theil sen median trend test and nonparametric mann kendall test theil sen median trend analysis combined with nonparametric mann kendall m k test have become a mature method in long term sequence analysis theil sen median method also known as sen slope estimation is a robust trend calculation method for nonparametric statistics this method is computationally efficient insensitive to measurement errors and outlier data theil sen median trend calculation can be expressed as 2 β m e d i a n x j x i j i i j where β is the trend of vegetation i and j are time series x i and x j represent the ndvi values at time i and j respectively β 0 means an upward trend while β 0 shows a downward trend the m k test is a rank based test for nonlinear trend detection kendall 1990 the test method is also called non distribution test which does not need samples to satisfy a certain distribution and is not disturbed by individual outliers for a series of x t x 1 x 2 x n the statistic z is as follows 3 z s 1 v ar s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 v ar s s 0 4 s i 1 n 1 j j 1 n sgn x j x i 5 sgn θ 1 θ 0 0 θ 0 1 θ 0 6 var s n n 1 2 n 5 18 where n

the given significance level α when z u 1 α 2 the original hypothesis is rejected i e the sequence trend is significant while the opposite implies that the trend is not significant combined with s value and z value the significance of the trend in vegetation growth in the study area was classified into six levels as shown in table 2 kendall 1990 3 results 3 1 the spatio temporal variation of drought conditions spei and sm from 2010 to 2018 were analyzed to study the inter annual drought in the area fig 2 shows the monthly seasonal and annual trend of spei the spei values fluctuated frequently at short time scale 1 and 3 month while stable at long time scales with the increase of time scale the duration of dry and wet state increased spei 01 showed more frequent and larger amplitude of wet and dry variations the minimum value 2 35 occurred in december 2010 indicating extreme drought there were 29 drought months from 2010 to 2018 including 16 mild droughts 10 severe droughts and 3 extreme droughts spei 03 expressed the seasonal scale dry wet variability which was more stable than spei 01 there were 31 drought months from 2010 to 2018 including 21 mild droughts 9 severe droughts and 1 extreme drought identified by spei 03 the longest duration of drought was a total of 6 months from december 2010 to may 2011 spei 12 had the most stable dry wet variation at annual scale there were 8 drought months from 2010 to 2018 all mild drought the sm data of january 2016 in the study area were missing the temporal trends of sm anm were used to reflect the soil state during the period 2010 2018 18 drought months were identified with a minimum anomaly of 0 049 in may 2014 combined with the drought conditions of spei 01 and sm anm it was determined that drought of two consecutive months with relatively low drought indices value were selected during the vegetation growing season may october the spei was 1 51 and 1 64 in june and july 2010 respectively and 1 08 and 1 00 in july and august 2014 respectively it indicated drought during these periods the sm anm in june and july 2010 was 0 03 and 0 01 respectively and in july and august 2014 were 0 005 and 0 017 respectively although the sm anm in july 2014 did not indicate drought the average sm anm in may october 2014 was 0 012 which was classified into drought conditions therefore june july 2010 and july august 2014 were selected to analyze the vegetation drought stress fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of spei 01 during drought in 2010 and 2014 the drought degree in 2010 was high with severe drought accounting for 88 9 and 11 1 of mild drought the drought degree in the southeast was relatively mild there was mild drought in 2014 for almost the entire area fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of sm anm during drought in 2010 and 2014 the spatial distribution of sm anm also showed that the drought in 2010 was more severe than in 2014 in 2010 25 of the area showed severe drought which was concentrated in the western and southwestern parts this was roughly similar to the spatial distribution of monthly spei 01 and 75 of the area showed mild drought but in 2014 about half of the area showed no drought 3 2 spatio temporal consistency between sif and gpp ndvi is a vegetation index based on the absorption and reflection characteristics of vegetation in the red and near infrared bands wang and guo 2008 ndvi is used to monitor the growth state of vegetation and vegetation coverage ranging from 1 to 1 the development of evi improved the problems of high vegetation saturation incomplete atmospheric correction and soil background and was better than ndvi in reducing background and atmospheric effects and saturation the monthly vis series from 2010 to 2018 are shown in fig 5 a vis showed similar trends with a noticeable periodicity of 1 year the maximum value of ndvi was around 0 7 representing the period of the year when vegetation was most vigorous the minimum value was below 0 2 indicating that there was basically no vegetation cover in certain months the range of evi values was smaller than ndvi and showed the same vegetation growth trend as ndvi fig 5b shows the monthly sif and gpp during 2010 2018 it can be found that there were obvious interannual periodicity although difference was apparent here sif was still consistent with gpp for most cases it showed that ndvi evi sif and gpp displayed similar patterns the maximum value gradually increased during 2010 2013 and dropped directly to the lowest level in 2014 followed by a relative low sif and gpp in 2015 and returned to 2013 level in 2016 2018 sif reached the maximum value in august every year except for 2013 when it reached the peak value in july the maximum value of sif during 2010 2018 occurred in july 2013 with the value of 0 3115 and the minimum value occurred in february 2012 with the value of 0 1166 the minimum value of gpp occurred in january 2011 at 0 2040 gcm 2month 1 and the maximum value occurred in august 2018 at 150 6949 gcm 2month 1 analysis of the time trends between sif and gpp revealed high temporal consistency most importantly sif ndvi and evi remained quite consistent with gpp for both drought and non drought months fig 5 to reduce or eliminate the impact of cloud atmosphere and solar elevation angles on images huang et al 2022 we used the maximum value composite mvc to obtain annual ndvi and evi data the maximum vis values for 2010 2018 are shown in fig 6 similar trends can be found in the interannual variation of the maximum vis with ndvi values fluctuating around 0 7 while evi fluctuating around 0 45 the minimum ndvi value 0 664 occurred in 2014 and the ndvi was roughly comparable in 2010 2015 and 2019 at 0 686 0 683 and 0 678 respectively the minimum evi also occurred in 2014 at 0 383 inter annual variation in the vis showed an increasing trend the trend of vis sif and gpp data were analyzed by sen slope estimation and non parametric m k test fig 7 an increase trend of ndvi was found with 34 3 of the area having a significant increase the study area of 92 6 evi and 83 3 sif remained stable the increasing trend of gpp was more evident than evi and sif with 38 3 of the area significant increase and 4 7 of the area very significant increase the trend analysis reveals that vis sif and gpp all showed a stable constant or increasing trend which was confirmed by the positive correlation between the annual scale ndvi r2 0 01 and evi r2 0 03 3 3 comparison between gpp and measured flux data the measured flux data were obtained through the cpec system the average value of the four grids data around the flux tower was selected as the modis gpp value the comparative analysis of the measured gpp and modis gpp is shown in fig 8 the measured gpp and modis gpp were compared from january to november in 2021 according to the measured data length the measured gpp was highly correlated with modis gpp r2 0 69 p 0 01 but it was lower than modis gpp from january to april and significantly higher than modis gpp in july therefore there was an underestimation of gpp by modis in the growing season and an overestimation in the non growing season in general from january to november 2021 modis gpp was 59 48 46 47 gcm 2month 1 while the measured gpp was 62 17 75 52 gcm 2month 1 as can be seen using modis data to estimate gpp can obtain comparable results but the monthly variations were not as obvious as the measured gpp wang et al 2013 verified the modis gpp through the data of 10 close path eddy covariance system sites in northern china it was found that the modis product significantly underestimated gpp at sites with high vegetation productivity due to the underestimation of the maximum light energy utilization in the modis algorithm 3 4 capability of sif to capture gpp variations during drought drought begins with a deficit in precipitation followed by insufficient soil moisture ultimately affecting vegetation growth the changes of vis during the two drought events june july 2010 and july august 2014 were specifically analyzed to determine whether vis and sif could reflect the impact of drought and the ability of sif to reflect gpp during drought the response of vis and sif to drought was reflected by the differences between the vis and sif during the two drought events and the monthly multi year averages from 2010 to 2018 the drought indices of spei and sm in 2010 showed that the spei and sm in may june and july were less than the multi year averages and the drought condition was alleviated in august ndvi and evi had the largest annual decline in the non growing season in april dropping 0 147 and 0 091 respectively then vis recovered to the multi year average in may which differed from the drought conditions in june and july vis turned below the multi year average again sif continued to be stressed from april to july all below the multi year average the largest difference from the multi year average was 0 062 wm 2 μm 1 sr 1 reached in july this was similar to the drought process revealed by the drought indices furthermore sif was lower than the multiyear mean in may in contrast the value of ndvi and evi were relatively normal compared to the multiyear mean values in other words ndvi and evi did not show drought signature at the beginning stage of the drought sif was continuously stressed during 2010 drought event and reflected the maximum stress caused by drought in time while vis recovered during drought event and its stress effect were not obvious in 2014 both spei and sm were smaller than the multi year average during the growing season july october except for september when sm was normal after may vis and sif showed that vegetation growth was significantly inhibited ndvi and evi showed the largest decrease in july by 0 076 and 0 063 respectively under drought stress from june to august the sif decreased by 0 0594 wm 2 μm 1 sr 1 which showed that the growth of vegetation was inhibited by drought stress then sif gradually returned to the multi year average in non growth period the small fluctuations in spei and sm in 2010 and 2014 did not have a significant impact on sif until the drought became progressively more severe and with increasing duration then sif began to decline significantly fig 9 based on the vis and sif in the two drought events both vis and sif were subjected to water stress at the most vigorous vegetation growth stage of the year but sif captured the drought signature and drought beginning stage more accurately the result was consistent with cao et al 2021 in the midwestern united states corn belt we further analyzed the ability of sif to respond gpp variations during drought events in june july 2010 the trend in sif was much closer to the trend in gpp with the decease of sif by 14 2 and gpp by 10 1 in june and sif by 25 9 and gpp by 18 1 in july fig 9 c f shows that sif was most proximate to the integral variation process gpp in may and june the decrease range of gpp was similarity and sif reflected the closest gpp process in contrast ndvi and evi did not begin to decline in may in 2014 sif fell by 16 4 and gpp fell by 2 8 in july sif fell by 23 7 and gpp fell by 5 0 in august the decline of gpp in july was less than august this process was only captured by sif while ndvi and evi failed therefore sif can better reflect the inhibition of water stress on vegetation photosynthesis during drought events chen et al 2021 found that sif characterized the temporal dynamics of gpp anomalies accurately during the drought events which was similar to the above results to discuss the effects of drought on vegetation we analyzed the interannual variations of spei sm vis sif and gpp for june july and august separately for the period of 2010 2018 as shown in fig 10 the spei and sm in august 2010 showed sufficient water conditions but the vis sif and gpp did not recover and remained below the multi year average it was related to the continuous water stress in june and july 2010 indicating that the vegetation growth was significantly affected by the antecedent water deficit similarly spei showed obvious drought in august 2013 and sm was also lower than the multi year average however due to sufficient water conditions in june and july 2013 there was a surplus of water and the impact on vegetation continued during august which made the vegetation growth in august higher than the multi year average the response of vegetation growth to water conditions had a certain time lag which was related to the interactive roles of mean water balance and divergent survival traits and strategies xu et al 2018 3 5 response of sif to the drought indices to further quantify the time lagged response between vis sif gpp to drought indices we investigated the correlation between vis sif gpp and drought indices at different lag time respectively time lags between the initialization of water scarcity and the detection of its impacts vicente serrano et al 2014 were an important metric that reflected the time dependent characteristic of drought response wu et al 2015 pointed out that the lag time with the highest correlation coefficient between the meteorological factors and vegetation growth was found to be the best lag time for that meteorological factor the lag time of monthly vegetation growth response to meteorological factors was usually less than four months chen et al 2014 therefore the lag time was set to 0 3 months to reveal the relationship between vis sif gpp and drought indices under different time delays by pearson correlation method table 3 shows the pearson correlation coefficients of vis sif and gpp with different lag time to drought indices it can be found that vis sif and gpp had different response lag time to spei and sm the regression coefficients of vis sif and gpp for spei in different lag months were not significantly different as the lag time increased the regression coefficient gradually became smaller and the regression coefficient was the largest when there was no lag time the regression coefficient passed the significance test p 0 05 when there was no time lag and one month lag and in no time lag vis passed the significance test p 0 01 in short there was no time lag for vis sif and gpp to spei spei had no obvious lag period and this conclusion needed to be verified in a longer period of time for sm the correlation coefficients were the highest when the lag was two months and all passed the significance test of p 0 001 there was a positive correlation between gpp and drought indices the higher correlation between gpp and spei or sm the greater the impact of drought on vegetation growth drought limited photosynthesis and reduced vegetation productivity by inhibiting plant water transpiration and closing some stomata wei et al 2022 the current vegetation growth trend was consistent with the change in water availability in the previous period the correlation coefficients of vis sif and gpp to sm were generally higher than spei which was similar to the previous research chen et al 2021 as an indicator of soil moisture content sm can directly reflect the dry and wet conditions of soil which can be directly absorbed and utilized by plants root two month lag time may be related to the drought tolerance of plants through physiological mechanisms such as reducing water loss and enhancing water absorption capacity reddy et al 2004 spei reflected the difference between precipitation and potential evaporation reflecting dry and wet conditions in the region and its transformation into water sources for vegetation growth remained uncertain 3 6 gpp loss during drought due to the slow growth of vegetation in non growing season vis sif and gpp were relatively low resulting in a high correlation of gpp with vis and sif data throughout the year therefore the correlation between vis sif and gpp was analyzed only in the growing season from may to october 2010 2018 fig 11 the linear correlation between gpp and sif was the highest with the correlation coefficient of 0 89 p 0 001 when sif increased 1 wm 2 μm 1 sr 1 the corresponding gpp increased 349 9 gcm 2months 1 gpp had higher correlation with evi r2 0 84 p 0 001 than ndvi r2 0 69 p 0 001 because evi improved the problems of ndvi saturation in high vegetation areas incomplete correction for atmospheric influences and soil background on average gpp increased by 342 41 gcm 2month 1 for every 1 unit increase in evi and 234 74 gcm 2month 1 for every 1 unit increase in ndvi there was a better correlation between sif and modis gpp than ndvi and evi it was reasonable to assess the gpp loss by sif among them this analysis was consistent with the research results of cao et al 2021 due to the excellent properties of sif in response to gpp variations during drought we further used sif to estimate the gpp losses caused by drought in june july 2010 and july august 2014 guanter et al 2014 found that sif values exhibit a much stronger linear relationship with tower gpp and that a single linear model is able to link sif with gpp for both us croplands and europe grasslands we followed the method by guanter et al 2014 and applied a simple empirical method directly scaling sif into gpp with its fitted empirical relationship therefore gpp was estimated by sif hereinafter referred to as gppsif gpp sif 33 7 349 9 sif which can describe the temporal and spatial variation pattern of monthly gpp at the eastern piedmont of taihang mountains the difference between the monthly gpp and the multi year average was considered as gpp loss due to drought fig 12 was 7 42 gcm 2month 1 this was consistent with the previous analysis of drought degree in 2010 and 2014 the loss calculated by gppsif in 2010 was also greater than 2014 with the values of 20 91 and 9 52 gcm 2month 1 respectively 4 discussion in this paper the potential relationship between sif vis and vegetation gpp in the eastern piedmont of taihang mountains during drought is explored it is found that the ability of sif to reflect gpp variations during drought is significantly better than vis sif can directly measure and predict gpp variations this conclusion has been widely verified in different regions worldwide guanter et al 2014 wang et al 2016 lee et al 2013 sif can accurately evaluate the gpp loss during drought and reflect the severity of drought in different years as a light signal generated by vegetation photosynthesis sif contains information related to vegetation photosynthesis such as photosynthetically active radiation and environmental impact factors in addition several studies have shown that the accuracy of modis gpp products varied across different regions of the globe making it difficult to meet the needs of practical applications liu et al 2014 modis has significant differences in different vegetation types through the analysis of 113 fluxnet stations and modis data jiang and ryu 2016 found that modis gpp agreed with fluxnet observations with 59 of global gpp variations explained by modis gpp among different vegetation types evergreen needle leaved forest showed the highest performance and modis gpp explained 74 of gpp variations followed by deciduous broadleaved forest and shrublands both of them were 68 therefore we validated the correlation r2 0 69 p 0 05 between the gpp data observed by the cpec system and the modis gpp data this result has achieved a better simulation between modis and gpp validated by flux stations therefore the modis gpp data is applicable in the eastern piedmont of the taihang mountains gosif dataset has continuity in time and space but the spatial resolution is relatively coarse gosif dataset is obtained by machine learning method based on oco 2 satellite data rather than the direct sif observation data therefore gosif data has certain internal uncertainty factors due to the short observation time series of cpec data the overlap time between the measured flux data and the modis gpp data was short and there was no time overlap with the gosif dataset therefore it was difficult to construct a robust sif gpp empirical model to quantify the gpp loss and it was still challenging to estimate the gpp loss by directly converting sif into gpp in addition the differences between vegetation types and climatic conditions were not distinguished the photosynthesis sif signal of different biological communities under different climatic conditions may have different response mechanisms to drought here the response of sif to soil and meteorological drought was studied by a correlation method in order to better reveal the potential mechanism of drought on vegetation photosynthesis it was still necessary to build a biophysical model with physical mechanisms for further analysis 5 conclusions based on multi source satellite remote sensing data including spei sm vis sif moids gpp and cpec measured gpp data the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of drought in the hilly area of the eastern piedmont of the taihang mountains were analyzed and gpp loss caused by drought was estimated the main conclusions are as follows 1 based on the spatio temporal changes of spei and sm during 2010 2018 two drought events of june july 2010 and july august 2014 were determined sm anm showed a concentration in the southwest of the study area in 2010 drought in 2010 was more severe than 2014 2 the temporal variation of sif and gpp were consistent from 2010 to 2018 the integral trend of gpp was similar to ndvi with 38 3 and 34 3 of the area showing significant increase respectively the variation of evi and sif was relatively stable 3 small fluctuations of spei and sm during drought did not have a significant impact on sif compared with ndvi and evi sif can capture the drought signature and drought beginning stage more accurately both 2010 and 2014 drought events demonstrated the ability of sif to reflect drought induced gpp variation process 4 vis sif and modis gpp had two month lag for sm but had no significant lag effect for spei 5 the cpec observed gpp data correlated well with modis gpp data r2 0 69 p 0 05 sif can be a quantitative indicator of gpp r2 0 84 p 0 001 and accurately estimate the drought induced gpp loss in 2010 20 91 gcm 2month 1 and 2014 9 52 gcm 2month 1 author contributions all authors contributed to the study conception and design

2610,drought has become one of the main reasons for the loss of terrestrial ecosystems gross primary productivity gpp because of its more frequent occurrence under the background of global warming aiming to explore the response mechanism of vegetation under drought conditions the sun induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and enhanced vegetation index evi were used to monitor vegetation drought and quantify the drought induced gpp variabilities modis gpp were used for analysis which was verified by close path eddy covariance flux r2 0 69 p 0 01 according to the standard precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and soil moisture sm the drought periods of 2010 and 2014 in the eastern piedmont of taihang mountains were selected to analyze drought impacts on gpp we found that sif had the ability to reflect the effects of drought prolonged action on vegetation and respond to gpp persistent changes during drought sif successfully described gpp loss during droughts in 2010 20 91 gcm 2month 1 and 2014 9 52 gcm 2month 1 sif was more significantly linearly correlated with gpp r2 0 89 than ndvi r2 0 69 and evi r2 0 84 suggesting that sif was more sensitive to physiological changes in vegetation sif correlated significantly higher to sm than spei and there was a two month lag to sm which may be related to the adaptation mechanism of vegetation physiological recovery under drought conditions results showed that sif is more accurate and sensitive than ndvi and evi in regional vegetation drought monitoring and drought induced gpp variations sif is an effective physiological index for timely detection and regional drought and an effective tool for ecosystem management and disaster warning keywords drought indicator sun induced chlorophyll fluorescence vegetation index gross primary productivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the terrestrial plants fix carbon dioxide co2 to organic compounds through photosynthesis gross primary productivity gpp refers to co2 absorbed by plants when producing organic matter beer et al 2010 as the production basis of human food wood and fiber gpp variations are related to human welfare beer et al 2010 due to the deep coupling of carbon water and energy at the ecosystem level the change of gpp profoundly affects the hydrological process and energy balance of the ecosystem chen et al 2021 as an important factor to control vegetation growth water participates in vegetation physiological activities promote vegetation photosynthesis increases ecosystem gpp and then improves ecosystem carbon absorption capacity soil water deficit during drought can damage ecosystem carbon cycle balance resulting in a decline in vegetation carbon absorption capacity zhang et al 2016 in the context of global climate warming the frequency of drought as a long lasting destructive and undetectable extreme climate event shows an increasing trend diffenbaugh et al 2005 drought has a huge impact on the composition structure and function of the ecosystem weakening the carbon sink function of the ecosystem to a certain extent resulting in the loss of ecosystem gpp frank et al 2015 whipple et al 2019 it is expected that drought will have a greater impact on ecosystem gpp in the future climate model schwalm et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 since the impact of drought on gpp is potential and complex its influencing mechanism is still unclear chen et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to study the response mechanism of gpp under drought conditions and monitor the gpp loss caused by drought in real time it can help predict the variation of gpp more accurately under future climate conditions which is of great significance to agricultural production management and ecological environment protection at present the observation on gpp mostly focuses on the site scale flux tower and the direct observation of gpp at regional and global scales faces severe challenges gpp research on regional and global scales mainly includes three approaches model simulation flux tower observation upscaling and satellite remote sensing anav et al 2015 model simulation is the main method of upscaling research mainly including remote sensing model based on data driven and mechanism model based on ecosystem process great uncertainty is usually introduced in model simulation by driving data model structure model parameters and initial conditions furthermore the prediction of gpp under future climate models requires historical data which cannot achieve real time observation of gpp variations in drought periods chen et al 2021 the method based on flux tower observation scaling needs to continuously increase the density of the observation tower and expand through the direct spatial interpolation of the observed values however due to the complexity and diversity of the ecological system it is impossible to obtain the actual observation data of all ecosystem types on the earth besides the results from flux tower observations cannot be applied to predicting the ecosystem response under future climate change scenarios yu et al 2004 satellite remote sensing is the major method of regional scale gpp observation which can provide a large number of time continuous and spatial consistent data products for ecosystem research and management wu et al 2020 vegetation indices vis based on remote sensing reflectance such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and enhanced vegetation index evi can indicate vegetation greenness and have been widely used to monitor changes in vegetation growth yang et al 2018 although vis can provide real time monitoring of vegetation greenness information to reflect the photosynthetic capacity of vegetation there are some limitations in reflecting gpp variations vegetation index based on remote sensing reflectance can explain the change of chlorophyll content by greenness to detect potential plant photosynthesis zhang et al 2019 but fails to reflect instantaneous photosynthetic rate and it cannot accurately reflect ecosystem gpp loss sun induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif is a new technique for monitoring vegetation growth and stress response at regional scale in recent years sif is a spectral signal with red light about 690 nm and near infrared about 740 nm peaks 650 800 nm emitted by photosynthetic centers under solar light conditions which can directly reflect the dynamic changes of plant photosynthesis zhang et al 2019 as an electromagnetic signal associated with vegetation photosynthesis sif contains information on physiological biochemical and metabolic characteristics of vegetation thus it can more accurately assess the actual state of photosynthesis than traditional vegetation indices guanter et al 2014 many researches have shown that sif has the ability to reflect the change of gpp guanter et al 2014 and has the ability to reflect the response of vegetation to stress cao et al 2021 chen et al 2021 the hilly area in the eastern piedmont of taihang mountains shoulders important ecological barrier and economic development function under the current strategic pattern of the integrated development of beijing tianjin hebei region however under the influence of global climate change it is frequently subjected to drought stress studying the impact of drought on the spatial and temporal variability of ecosystem gpp in the eastern piedmont of taihang mountains is of great significance to strengthen the ecological environment construction ensure ecological security and promote the development of regional economic virtuous cycle the objectives of this study are 1 using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and soil moisture sm to analyze the change of wet dry status in the study area from 2010 to 2018 and determine the drought events 2 analyzing the spatial and temporal changes of vegetation index vis and sif from 2010 to 2018 to determine the trend of gpp 3 revealing the ability of sif to capture gpp variations during drought events 4 providing quantitative gpp loss estimation during drought events 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the eastern piedmont of taihang mountains with an average elevation of about 1000 m which belongs

belongs to the typical temperate continental monsoon climate zone it has four distinct seasons and the temperature difference is large the annual average temperature is 12 7 c the sunshine hours is 2600 h the annual average precipitation is 594 5 mm generating an annual average runoff depth of 80 7 mm in 2020 a tower of 30 m height measuring flux based on eddy covariance method was established in neiqiu county xingtai city hebei province fig 1 to study the exchange of water heat and carbon between vegetation and the atmosphere the flux footprint source area has terraced fields and the main crops are wheat and corn the scope of the study area and land use types are shown in fig 1 due to the water resources shortage and lack of water engineering crops mainly rely on precipitation there are annual herbaceous plants in places where crops are not easy to grow current flux tower data have been observed from january 2021 to may 2022 the boundary of the study area was determined according to the boundary of low altitude and small undulation mountain from geomorphological of china 1 4 000 000 cheng and zhou 2014 2 2 data 2 2 1 sif orbiting carbon observatory satellite oco 2 is the first satellite launched by nasa in 2014 to study the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration the satellite detector carries a three channel imaging grating photometer to accurately measure the solar radiation reflected by the absorption bands of co2 and o2 molecules in the near infrared band and provides a small footprint range 1 3 km 2 25 km however the coverage of oco 2 satellite data is extremely sparse globally which is not suitable for regional scale research a global oco 2 sif dataset gosif https globalecology unh edu with high spatial and temporal resolution based on discrete oco

including vegetation index data products mod13c and vegetation gross primary productivity data products mod17a were used the mod13c data products were adopted to obtain the ndvi and evi data the spatial resolution of the vegetation index product is 0 05 and the temporal resolution is one month the gpp of vegetation was obtained through mod17a data products with spatial resolution of 0 05 and temporal resolution of 8 days the hdf format modis data was preprocess by resampling splicing merging and projection conversion then the 8 day time temporal resolution was converted in to monthly resolution data ndvi and evi were collectively referred to as vegetation indices vis continuous vis data from 2010 to 2018 were compared with sif and modis gpp data in 2021 were used to verify the correlation with the measured gpp data around the flux tower 2 2 3 spei selecting appropriate evaluation indices is particularly important for quantitative analysis of drought the spei was first proposed by vicent serrano et al 2010 and calculated by fitting the difference between available water precipitation and atmospheric evaporation demand potential evaporation to the logarithmic probability distribution chen et al 2019 compared with other widely used drought indices such as the palmer drought severity index pdsi and the standardized precipitation index spi spei can identify different drought types and impacts in the context of global warming many scholars used multi scale spei data to carry out regional long term drought trend analysis determined the main period of drought occurrence and studied the variation of regional dry and wet states ran et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 the global spei database https spei csic es is based on monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration currently the version of the cru ts4 03 dataset has been used which can provide multi time scale data with spatial resolution of 0 5 including long term and reliable information of drought conditions worldwide resample spei data to 0 05 for consistency with sif data monthly seasonal and annual scale spei data were used for further analysis when calculating spei of different time scales the first month is the current month for the time scale of n months it extends n 1 months backward from the current month monthly spei spei 01 seasonal spei 03 and annual spei spei 12 were selected to characterize the drought frequency and trend at monthly seasonal and interannual scales the negative value of spei indicates water deficit and the positive value indicates water surplus the larger value represents wetter condition and the smaller value represents drier condition specific spei levels and drought classification are shown in table 1 vicente serrano et al 2010 2 2 4 soil

and stored in netcdf 4 classical file format gruber et al 2019 the reliability of the dataset has been verified wang et al 2016 sm data was also resampled to 0 05 grid sm anomalies sm anm were calculated according to the deviation from the multi year average the range of sm anm standard deviation was selected as the dividing line of drought classification sm anm 0 025 indicating that the monthly soil moisture data was less than the standard deviation of sm anm is severe drought 0 025 sm anm 0 005 is mild drought 0 005 sm anm 0 005 is the normal fluctuation range of sm 0 005 sm anm 0

kendall m k test have become a mature method in long term sequence analysis theil sen median method also known as sen slope estimation is a robust trend calculation method for nonparametric statistics this method is computationally efficient insensitive to measurement errors and outlier data theil sen median trend calculation can be expressed as 2 β m e d i a n x j x i j i i j where β is the trend of vegetation i and j are time series x i and x j represent the ndvi values at time i and j respectively β 0 means an upward trend while β 0 shows a downward trend the m k test is a rank based test for nonlinear trend detection kendall 1990 the test method is also called non distribution test which does not need samples to satisfy a certain distribution and is not disturbed by individual outliers for a series of x t x 1 x 2 x n the statistic z is as follows 3 z s 1 v ar s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 v ar s s 0 4 s i 1 n 1 j j 1 n sgn x j x i 5 sgn θ 1 θ 0 0 θ 0 1 θ 0 6 var s n n 1 2 n 5 18 where n

the given significance level α when z u 1 α 2 the original hypothesis is rejected i e the sequence trend is significant while the opposite implies that the trend is not significant combined with s value and z value the significance of the trend in vegetation growth in the study area was classified into six levels as shown in table 2 kendall 1990 3 results 3 1 the spatio temporal variation of drought conditions spei and sm from 2010 to 2018 were analyzed to study the inter annual drought in the area fig 2 shows the monthly seasonal and annual trend of spei the spei values fluctuated frequently at short time scale 1 and 3 month while stable at long time scales with the increase of time scale the duration of dry and wet state increased spei 01 showed more frequent and larger amplitude of wet and dry variations the minimum value 2 35 occurred in december 2010 indicating extreme drought there were 29 drought months from 2010 to 2018 including 16 mild droughts 10 severe droughts and 3 extreme droughts spei 03 expressed the seasonal scale dry wet variability which was more stable than spei 01 there were 31 drought months from 2010 to 2018 including 21 mild droughts 9 severe droughts and 1 extreme drought identified by spei 03 the longest duration of drought was a total of 6 months from december 2010 to may 2011 spei 12 had the most stable dry wet variation at annual scale there were 8 drought months from 2010 to 2018 all mild drought the sm data of january 2016 in the study area were missing the temporal trends of sm anm were used to reflect the soil state during the period 2010 2018 18 drought months were identified with a minimum anomaly of 0 049 in may 2014 combined with the drought conditions of spei 01 and sm anm it was determined that drought of two consecutive months with relatively low drought indices value were selected during the vegetation growing season may october the spei was 1 51 and 1 64 in june and july 2010 respectively and 1 08 and 1 00 in july and august 2014 respectively it indicated drought during these periods the sm anm in june and july 2010 was 0 03 and 0 01 respectively and in july and august 2014 were 0 005 and 0 017 respectively although the sm anm in july 2014 did not indicate drought the average sm anm in may october 2014 was 0 012 which was classified into drought conditions therefore june july 2010 and july august 2014 were selected to analyze the vegetation drought stress fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of spei 01 during drought in 2010 and 2014 the drought degree in 2010 was high with severe drought accounting for 88 9 and 11 1 of mild drought the drought degree in the southeast was relatively mild there was mild drought in 2014 for almost the entire area fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of sm anm during drought in 2010 and 2014 the spatial distribution of sm anm also showed that the drought in 2010 was more severe than in 2014 in 2010 25 of the area showed severe drought which was concentrated in the western and southwestern parts this was roughly similar to the spatial distribution of monthly spei 01 and 75 of the area showed mild drought but in 2014 about half of the area showed no drought 3 2 spatio temporal consistency between sif and gpp ndvi is a vegetation index based on the absorption and reflection characteristics of vegetation in the red and near infrared bands wang and guo 2008 ndvi is used to monitor the growth state of vegetation and vegetation coverage ranging from 1 to 1 the development of evi improved the problems of high vegetation saturation incomplete atmospheric correction and soil background and was better than ndvi in reducing background and atmospheric effects and saturation the monthly vis series from 2010 to 2018 are shown in fig 5 a vis showed similar trends with a noticeable periodicity of 1 year the maximum value of ndvi was around 0 7 representing the period of the year when vegetation was most vigorous the minimum value was below 0 2 indicating that there was basically no vegetation cover in certain months the range of evi values was smaller than ndvi and showed the same vegetation growth trend as ndvi fig 5b shows the monthly sif and gpp during 2010 2018 it can be found that there were obvious interannual periodicity although difference was apparent here sif was still consistent with gpp for most cases it showed that ndvi evi sif and gpp displayed similar patterns the maximum value gradually increased during 2010 2013 and dropped directly to the lowest level in 2014 followed by a relative low sif and gpp in 2015 and returned to 2013 level in 2016 2018 sif reached the maximum value in august every year except for 2013 when it reached the peak value in july the maximum value of sif during 2010 2018 occurred in july 2013 with the value of 0 3115 and the minimum value occurred in february 2012 with the value of 0 1166 the minimum value of gpp occurred in january 2011 at 0 2040 gcm 2month 1 and the maximum value occurred in august 2018 at 150 6949 gcm 2month 1 analysis of the time trends between sif and gpp revealed high temporal consistency most importantly sif ndvi and evi remained quite consistent with gpp for both drought and non drought months fig 5 to reduce or eliminate the impact of cloud atmosphere and solar elevation angles on images huang et al 2022 we used the maximum value composite mvc to obtain annual ndvi and evi data the maximum vis values for 2010 2018 are shown in fig 6 similar trends can be found in the interannual variation of the maximum vis with ndvi values fluctuating around 0 7 while evi fluctuating around 0 45 the minimum ndvi value 0 664 occurred in 2014 and the ndvi was roughly comparable in 2010 2015 and 2019 at 0 686 0 683 and 0 678 respectively the minimum evi also occurred in 2014 at 0 383 inter annual variation in the vis showed an increasing trend the trend of vis sif and gpp data were analyzed by sen slope estimation and non parametric m k test fig 7 an increase trend of ndvi was found with 34 3 of the area having a significant increase the study area of 92 6 evi and 83 3 sif remained stable the increasing trend of gpp was more evident than evi and sif with 38 3 of the area significant increase and 4 7 of the area very significant increase the trend analysis reveals that vis sif and gpp all showed a stable constant or increasing trend which was confirmed by the positive correlation between the annual scale ndvi r2 0 01 and evi r2 0 03 3 3 comparison between gpp and measured flux data the measured flux data were obtained through the cpec system the average value of the four grids data around the flux tower was selected as the modis gpp value the comparative analysis of the measured gpp and modis gpp is shown in fig 8 the measured gpp and modis gpp were compared from january to november in 2021 according to the measured data length the measured gpp was highly correlated with modis gpp r2 0 69 p 0 01 but it was lower than modis gpp from january to april and significantly higher than modis gpp in july therefore there was an underestimation of gpp by modis in the growing season and an overestimation in the non growing season in general from january to november 2021 modis gpp was 59 48 46 47 gcm 2month 1 while the measured gpp was 62 17 75 52 gcm 2month 1 as can be seen using modis data to estimate gpp can obtain comparable results but the monthly variations were not as obvious as the measured gpp wang et al 2013 verified the modis gpp through the data of 10 close path eddy covariance system sites in northern china it was found that the modis product significantly underestimated gpp at sites with high vegetation productivity due to the underestimation of the maximum light energy utilization in the modis algorithm 3 4 capability of sif to capture gpp variations during drought drought begins with a deficit in precipitation followed by insufficient soil moisture ultimately affecting vegetation growth the changes of vis during the two drought events june july 2010 and july august 2014 were specifically analyzed to determine whether vis and sif could reflect the impact of drought and the ability of sif to reflect gpp during drought the response of vis and sif to drought was reflected by the differences between the vis and sif during the two drought events and the monthly multi year averages from 2010 to 2018 the drought indices of spei and sm in 2010 showed that the spei and sm in may june and july were less than the multi year averages and the drought condition was alleviated in august ndvi and evi had the largest annual decline in the non growing season in april dropping 0 147 and 0 091 respectively then vis recovered to the multi year average in may which differed from the drought conditions in june and july vis turned below the multi year average again sif continued to be stressed from april to july all below the multi year average the largest difference from the multi year average was 0 062 wm 2 μm 1 sr 1 reached in july this was similar to the drought process revealed by the drought indices furthermore sif was lower than the multiyear mean in may in contrast the value of ndvi and evi were relatively normal compared to the multiyear mean values in other words ndvi and evi did not show drought signature at the beginning stage of the drought sif was continuously stressed during 2010 drought event and reflected the maximum stress caused by drought in time while vis recovered during drought event and its stress effect were not obvious in 2014 both spei and sm were smaller than the multi year average during the growing season july october except for september when sm was normal after may vis and sif showed that vegetation growth was significantly inhibited ndvi and evi showed the largest decrease in july by 0 076 and 0 063 respectively under drought stress from june to august the sif decreased by 0 0594 wm 2 μm 1 sr 1 which showed that the growth of vegetation was inhibited by drought stress then sif gradually returned to the multi year average in non growth period the small fluctuations in spei and sm in 2010 and 2014 did not have a significant impact on sif until the drought became progressively more severe and with increasing duration then sif began to decline significantly fig 9 based on the vis and sif in the two drought events both vis and sif were subjected to water stress at the most vigorous vegetation growth stage of the year but sif captured the drought signature and drought beginning stage more accurately the result was consistent with cao et al 2021 in the midwestern united states corn belt we further analyzed the ability of sif to respond gpp variations during drought events in june july 2010 the trend in sif was much closer to the trend in gpp with the decease of sif by 14 2 and gpp by 10 1 in june and sif by 25 9 and gpp by 18 1 in july fig 9 c f shows that sif was most proximate to the integral variation process gpp in may and june the decrease range of gpp was similarity and sif reflected the closest gpp process in contrast ndvi and evi did not begin to decline in may in 2014 sif fell by 16 4 and gpp fell by 2 8 in july sif fell by 23 7 and gpp fell by 5 0 in august the decline of gpp in july was less than august this process was only captured by sif while ndvi and evi failed therefore sif can better reflect the inhibition of water stress on vegetation photosynthesis during drought events chen et al 2021 found that sif characterized the temporal dynamics of gpp anomalies accurately during the drought events which was similar to the above results to discuss the effects of drought on vegetation we analyzed the interannual variations of spei sm vis sif and gpp for june july and august separately for the period of 2010 2018 as shown in fig 10 the spei and sm in august 2010 showed sufficient water conditions but the vis sif and gpp did not recover and remained below the multi year average it was related to the continuous water stress in june and july 2010 indicating that the vegetation growth was significantly affected by the antecedent water deficit similarly spei showed obvious drought in august 2013 and sm was also lower than the multi year average however due to sufficient water conditions in june and july 2013 there was a surplus of water and the impact on vegetation continued during august which made the vegetation growth in august higher than the multi year average the response of vegetation growth to water conditions had a certain time lag which was related to the interactive roles of mean water balance and divergent survival traits and strategies xu et al 2018 3 5 response of sif to the drought indices to further quantify the time lagged response between vis sif gpp to drought indices we investigated the correlation between vis sif gpp and drought indices at different lag time respectively time lags between the initialization of water scarcity and the detection of its impacts vicente serrano et al 2014 were an important metric that reflected the time dependent characteristic of drought response wu et al 2015 pointed out that the lag time with the highest correlation coefficient between the meteorological factors and vegetation growth was found to be the best lag time for that meteorological factor the lag time of monthly vegetation growth response to meteorological factors was usually less than four months chen et al 2014 therefore the lag time was set to 0 3 months to reveal the relationship between vis sif gpp and drought indices under different time delays by pearson correlation method table 3 shows the pearson correlation coefficients of vis sif and gpp with different lag time to drought indices it can be found that vis sif and gpp had different response lag time to spei and sm the regression coefficients of vis sif and gpp for spei in different lag months were not significantly different as the lag time increased the regression coefficient gradually became smaller and the regression coefficient was the largest when there was no lag time the regression coefficient passed the significance test p 0 05 when there was no time lag and one month lag and in no time lag vis passed the significance test p 0 01 in short there was no time lag for vis sif and gpp to spei spei had no obvious lag period and this conclusion needed to be verified in a longer period of time for sm the correlation coefficients were the highest when the lag was two months and all passed the significance test of p 0 001 there was a positive correlation between gpp and drought indices the higher correlation between gpp and spei or sm the greater the impact of drought on vegetation growth drought limited photosynthesis and reduced vegetation productivity by inhibiting plant water transpiration and closing some stomata wei et al 2022 the current vegetation growth trend was consistent with the change in water availability in the previous period the correlation coefficients of vis sif and gpp to sm were generally higher than spei which was similar to the previous research chen et al 2021 as an indicator of soil moisture content sm can directly reflect the dry and wet conditions of soil which can be directly absorbed and utilized by plants root two month lag time may be related to the drought tolerance of plants through physiological mechanisms such as reducing water loss and enhancing water absorption capacity reddy et al 2004 spei reflected the difference between precipitation and potential evaporation reflecting dry and wet conditions in the region and its transformation into water sources for vegetation growth remained uncertain 3 6 gpp loss during drought due to the slow growth of vegetation in non growing season vis sif and gpp were relatively low resulting in a high correlation of gpp with vis and sif data throughout the year therefore the correlation between vis sif and gpp was analyzed only in the growing season from may to october 2010 2018 fig 11 the linear correlation between gpp and sif was the highest with the correlation coefficient of 0 89 p 0 001 when sif increased 1 wm 2 μm 1 sr 1 the corresponding gpp increased 349 9 gcm 2months 1 gpp had higher correlation with evi r2 0 84 p 0 001 than ndvi r2 0 69 p 0 001 because evi improved the problems of ndvi saturation in high vegetation areas incomplete correction for atmospheric influences and soil background on average gpp increased by 342 41 gcm 2month 1 for every 1 unit increase in evi and 234 74 gcm 2month 1 for every 1 unit increase in ndvi there was a better correlation between sif and modis gpp than ndvi and evi it was reasonable to assess the gpp loss by sif among them this analysis was consistent with the research results of cao et al 2021 due to the excellent properties of sif in response to gpp variations during drought we further used sif to estimate the gpp losses caused by drought in june july 2010 and july august 2014 guanter et al 2014 found that sif values exhibit a much stronger linear relationship with tower gpp and that a single linear model is able to link sif with gpp for both us croplands and europe grasslands we followed the method by guanter et al 2014 and applied a simple empirical method directly scaling sif into gpp with its fitted empirical relationship therefore gpp was estimated by sif hereinafter referred to as gppsif gpp sif 33 7 349 9 sif which can describe the temporal and spatial variation pattern of monthly gpp at the eastern piedmont of taihang mountains the difference between the monthly gpp and the multi year average was considered as gpp loss due to drought fig 12 was 7 42 gcm 2month 1 this was consistent with the previous analysis of drought degree in 2010 and 2014 the loss calculated by gppsif in 2010 was also greater than 2014 with the values of 20 91 and 9 52 gcm 2month 1 respectively 4 discussion in this paper the potential relationship between sif vis and vegetation gpp in the eastern piedmont of taihang mountains during drought is explored it is found that the ability of sif to reflect gpp variations during drought is significantly better than vis sif can directly measure and predict gpp variations this conclusion has been widely verified in different regions worldwide guanter et al 2014 wang et al 2016 lee et al 2013 sif can accurately evaluate the gpp loss during drought and reflect the severity of drought in different years as a light signal generated by vegetation photosynthesis sif contains information related to vegetation photosynthesis such as photosynthetically active radiation and environmental impact factors in addition several studies have shown that the accuracy of modis gpp products varied across different regions of the globe making it difficult to meet the needs of practical applications liu et al 2014 modis has significant differences in different vegetation types through the analysis of 113 fluxnet stations and modis data jiang and ryu 2016 found that modis gpp agreed with fluxnet observations with 59 of global gpp variations explained by modis gpp among different vegetation types evergreen needle leaved forest showed the highest performance and modis gpp explained 74 of gpp variations followed by deciduous broadleaved forest and shrublands both of them were 68 therefore we validated the correlation r2 0 69 p 0 05 between the gpp data observed by the cpec system and the modis gpp data this result has achieved a better simulation between modis and gpp validated by flux stations therefore the modis gpp data is applicable in the eastern piedmont of the taihang mountains gosif dataset has continuity in time and space but the spatial resolution is relatively coarse gosif dataset is obtained by machine learning method based on oco 2 satellite data rather than the direct sif observation data therefore gosif data has certain internal uncertainty factors due to the short observation time series of cpec data the overlap time between the measured flux data and the modis gpp data was short and there was no time overlap with the gosif dataset therefore it was difficult to construct a robust sif gpp empirical model to quantify the gpp loss and it was still challenging to estimate the gpp loss by directly converting sif into gpp in addition the differences between vegetation types and climatic conditions were not distinguished the photosynthesis sif signal of different biological communities under different climatic conditions may have different response mechanisms to drought here the response of sif to soil and meteorological drought was studied by a correlation method in order to better reveal the potential mechanism of drought on vegetation photosynthesis it was still necessary to build a biophysical model with physical mechanisms for further analysis 5 conclusions based on multi source satellite remote sensing data including spei sm vis sif moids gpp and cpec measured gpp data the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of drought in the hilly area of the eastern piedmont of the taihang mountains were analyzed and gpp loss caused by drought was estimated the main conclusions are as follows 1 based on the spatio temporal changes of spei and sm during 2010 2018 two drought events of june july 2010 and july august 2014 were determined sm anm showed a concentration in the southwest of the study area in 2010 drought in 2010 was more severe than 2014 2 the temporal variation of sif and gpp were consistent from 2010 to 2018 the integral trend of gpp was similar to ndvi with 38 3 and 34 3 of the area showing significant increase respectively the variation of evi and sif was relatively stable 3 small fluctuations of spei and sm during drought did not have a significant impact on sif compared with ndvi and evi sif can capture the drought signature and drought beginning stage more accurately both 2010 and 2014 drought events demonstrated the ability of sif to reflect drought induced gpp variation process 4 vis sif and modis gpp had two month lag for sm but had no significant lag effect for spei 5 the cpec observed gpp data correlated well with modis gpp data r2 0 69 p 0 05 sif can be a quantitative indicator of gpp r2 0 84 p 0 001 and accurately estimate the drought induced gpp loss in 2010 20 91 gcm 2month 1 and 2014 9 52 gcm 2month 1 author contributions all authors contributed to the study conception and design

2611,winter discharge of the lena river russia has increased over the previous several decades however the impact of permafrost thawing and of changing hydrological processes induced by climate change on the river s winter discharge is not well quantified here using a coupled land surface model and a distributed discharge model we conducted trend analyses to examine the sensitivity of winter discharge to permafrost thawing and water budget change in the lena river basin during 1979 2016 an increasing trend of winter baseflow was found in upper parts of both the lena river basin and the aldan river basin where summer net precipitation showed a statistically significant increase the increased summer net precipitation resulted in higher soil moisture in the deepened active layer in late summer and early autumn which was linked to autumn and winter baseflow these implications were examined from the perspective of interrelations among the trends of active layer thickness soil moisture and baseflow in the cold season by identifying regions in which all the variables exhibited positive trends the identified source regions were primarily in the lower lena river basin and upper basins of the lena and aldan rivers although winter baseflow was more dominant in the latter regions owing to the freezing effect of the active layer thinning of river ice induced by warming temperatures also contributed to the increase of winter river discharge these results suggest that the increased winter discharge was strongly associated with climate change related enhancement of permafrost thawing and increase in net precipitation that affected soil hydrological processes which will be strengthened further in the context of global warming keywords active layer thickness soil moisture baseflow net precipitation winter river discharge lena river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change has progressed notably in the arctic circumpolar region mcbean et al 2005 turner et al 2007 resulting in drastic changes in hydrological processes particularly increased discharge from arctic rivers walsh et al 2005 hinzman et al 2005 serreze et al 2000 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 historical observations and model simulations clearly reveal the increases of discharge from arctic rivers over the previous several decades peterson et al 2002 mcclelland et al 2006 overeem and syvitski 2016 specifically the increase in river discharge has been substantial in northern eurasia since the 1980s holmes et al 2015 peterson et al 2002 presented evidence that annual river discharge to the arctic ocean from the six largest river basins in northern eurasia increased by 7 during 1936 1999 moreover these increases are projected to amplify further under the influence of future climate change zhang et al 2018 bring et al 2017 arctic rivers are characterized by a dynamic hydrological flow regime with peak discharge during spring caused by high snowmelt runoff yang et al 2007 the snow related hydrological regime has also experienced marked changes over recent decades the effects of climate change are causing a notable shift toward an earlier peak in spring discharge due to earlier snowmelt shiklomanov et al 2007 tananaev et al 2016 suzuki et al 2020 the earlier onset of snowmelt and resultant soil thawing likely cause advanced activity of soil moisture linked to evapotranspiration et and runoff processes in addition to earlier development of the active layer the advanced usage of soil moisture by et can lead to drier soil whereas increased precipitation induced by climate change can offset this dryness and lead to soil wetting walvoord and striegl 2007 jacques and sauchyn 2009 intensification of soil drying and wetting can affect water budget components linked to soil moisture climate change can also enhance deepening of the active layer during the warm season which increases mixing mobilization and flux of soil moisture within the active layer park et al 2021 soil wetting likely strengthens the connectivity of soil moisture to the generation of subsurface runoff while soil drying has a limiting effect on the relationship the ice rich permafrost is vulnerable to the effects of a warming climate in situ and satellite remote sensing observations have been used to identify the expansion of thermokarst lakes and wet areas induced by permafrost thawing and degradation under the impact of climate change liljedahl et al 2016 ulrich et al 2017 and the resultant effects on local and regional hydrology have been analyzed liljedahl et al 2016 earlier works documented that permafrost thawing played a minor role in the observed long term increase in river runoff in northern eurasia in comparison with the larger contribution associated with increased precipitation fukutomi et al 2003 mcclelland et al 2004 recent studies have proposed the importance of thickening of the active layer because it can cause localized increase in groundwater storage within the active layer walvoord and kurylyk 2016 thereby enhancing regional surface groundwater interactions as a result of permafrost thawing evans et al 2020 these changes can lead to more groundwater discharging into rivers wang et al 2021 previous works that analyzed long term hydrological and meteorological data detected statistically significant increases in winter discharge of arctic rivers on the basis of which they implied that permafrost thawing was linked to the increase in discharge han and menzel 2022 smith et al 2007 walvoord and striegl 2007 wang et al 2021 the quantitative degree of winter river discharge is considerably low in comparison with the discharge induced by spring snowmelt under future climate change permafrost thawing is projected to increase ipcc 2021 such that engagement of permafrost thawing induced groundwater to winter river discharge will be further intensified wang et al 2021 considered that for every 1 rise in temperature the groundwater discharge of siberian rivers would likely increase by 6 1 10 5 depending on permafrost condition of all the arctic rivers that flow into the arctic ocean the lena river in russia has the second largest annual discharge the lena river is underlain almost entirely by continuous and discontinuous permafrost because climate change can lead to thawing and degradation of permafrost it can have considerable impact on permafrost implicated hydrological processes in the lena river basin observations have already detected permafrost thawing initiated by rapid warming and the resultant increasing of the active layer thickness alt and its wetting iijima et al 2010 hiyama et al 2021 together with their potential contributions to the increasing discharge of the lena river particularly in the low flow season brutsaert and hiyama 2012 or in the cold season han and menzel 2022 tananaev et al 2016 wang et al 2021 liu et al 2022 recently analyzed the climate change related response of streamflow in four rivers the lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie rivers during early mid and late winter considering relatively few dam effects and concluded that winter streamflow generation under warming climate conditions was strongly associated with enhanced surface and subsurface hydrological cycles similarly previous findings have clearly highlighted the possibility of permafrost thawing winter river discharge connectivity in the context of global warming smith et al 2007 however a spatially and temporally comprehensive picture of recent changes in the discharge of the lena river remains lacking the discharge regime during the winter season is strongly related to river ice that is critical in terms of the magnitude and timing of northern hydrologic extremes i e low flows and floods historical data analyses shiklomanov and lammers 2014 yang et al 2002 and model studies park et al 2016b clearly show widespread decrease in both the thickness and the duration of ice in arctic rivers due to the effects of global warming across northern regions increase in air temperature and resultant thinning of river ice could also be partly responsible for larger winter streamflow thinned river ice increases exchange between the surface and the bottom river water leading to a higher runoff rate that restricts the vertical movement of floating ice cover occurring in mainly larger rivers hence leading to larger discharge prowse and gridley 1993 in small rivers river ice thickness is comparable to winter river depth thus in comparison with the contribution of large rivers the contribution of small rivers is relatively low in a cold winter but it increases during a warmer winter markov 2003 these results which illustrate that the observed increase in winter discharge of arctic rivers is particularly sensitive to climate change via thinning of river ice highlight the need for more comprehensive examination of the underlying relationships in this study we asked the following questions how does climate change contribute to the increased winter discharge in the lena river basin how does permafrost thawing influence this discharge how useful can a physics based hydrological model be to investigate climate change induced permafrost dynamics and the associated hydrological processes using observational data and model results for the period 1979 2016 in the lena river basin this study investigated the seasonal and long term trends of the lena river discharge including soil moisture and alt to detect patterns of hydroclimatological change and identified those regions contributing to the increase in winter river discharge in the lena river basin the results were examined using statistical correlation analysis and model sensitivity simulations with surface air temperature and precipitation as model forcing data 2 data and methods 2 1 study site this study considered the lena river basin russia fig 1 illustrates a geographical perspective of the basin classified into four categories of permafrost zones the lena river basin includes the subbasins of several tributaries the length of the main river channel is 4 400 km and the entire basin area is 2 430 000 km2 the third largest among all of the arctic circumpolar river basins hiyama et al 2019 annual discharge of the lena river is 530 km3 yr peterson et al 2002 which is the second largest of all northern eurasian rivers and accounts for approximately 7 of freshwater input into the arctic ocean serreze et al 2006 dickson et al 2007 the main hydrological stations that measure the daily water levels and discharges in the lena river basin are located at kusur tabaga verkhoyanski perevoz and khatyrik khomo fig 1 the kusur and tabaga stations are at the lowest and middle points of the lena river respectively and the verkhoyanski perevoz and khatyrik khomo stations are at the lowest points of the aldan and vilui rivers respectively fig 1 a reservoir maximum volume 35 9 km3 is located in the upper and middle parts of the vilui river yang et al 2005 the maximum water storage of this reservoir accounts for approximately 77 of the annual discharge 46 7 km3 yr of the vilui river and the winter river discharge of the vilui river increased following the construction of the dam ye et al 2003 reservoir regulation also affects the discharge gauged at the kusur station particularly during winter when total discharge is low permafrost thickness in the basin is estimated to be deeper than 100 m and it is deeper than 500 m in the northern part of the basin mean annual ground temperature at the depth of zero annual amplitude ranges from 0 to 12 shestakova et al 2021 the alt are less than 0 3 m in the northern part and 3 5 m in the southern part of the basin shestakova et al 2021 the classification of the permafrost zones fig 1 shows that the upper part of the lena river basin is underlain by continuous 90 100 discontinuous 50 90 sporadic 10 50 and isolated 0 10 permafrost similarly the permafrost in the upper aldan river basin is continuous and discontinuous the other basin areas including the vilui river basin and the middle and lower parts of the basins of the lena and aldan rivers are underlain by continuous permafrost 2 2 model 2 2 1 change this study used the process based land surface model change which is a coupled hydrological and biogeochemical model park et al 2011 2018 for evaluation of the trends in terrestrial water budgets in the lena river basin change calculates the heat water vapor and carbon dioxide fluxes in the atmosphere vegetation snow soil system including snow and soil hydrology soil freezing thawing phase change and stomatal physiology and photosynthesis fig 2 the model simulated snow meltwater is divided into infiltration and surface runoff at the soil surface layer even during precipitation events the infiltrated water flows up or down in the soil system depending on the water potential gradient between soil layers and the excess water at either the permafrost table or the bottom soil boundary layer is converted to subsurface flow et is simulated as the sum of soil evaporation transpiration and rainfall interception by the canopy canopy interception is assumed to occur at the potential rate without exceeding the canopy water storage capacity transpiration is expressed as the accumulated water extraction from soil layers weighted by the root fraction in each layer soil evaporation is limited by energy and atmospheric forcing and by a maximum exfiltration rate derived from soil properties for a given soil moisture the model explicitly represents the dynamics of water and heat flows in permafrost soil by considering the freezing thawing phase transitions in a soil column depth 50 4 m to explicitly capture the thermal inertia of deep ground 2 2 2 trip2 the grid based river network model trip2 ngo duc et al 2007 was coupled to change to simulate river discharge park et al 2016b 2017 fig 2 trip2 is a storage based distributed river routing model that adopts spatially effective subgrid parameters and broadly represents a more realistic travel time without calibration the global river network trip with 0 5 spatial resolution oki and sud 1998 was used for trip2 that calculates riverine water storage river discharge water depth and channel width in each grid cell at every time step water storage is the only prognostic variable and the other variables are diagnosed from the water storage term the change calculated inflowed surface and subsurface runoff are stored in individual storage reservoirs and the water is routed along a prescribed channel network to the basin outlet the model also includes river ice formation growth and melt which affect heat storage and river hydraulics park et al 2016b the distribution of water temperature along a river is described by the one dimensional advection diffusion equation based on heat inflow from upstream heat exchange at the air water interface and inflow of heat and water from tributaries park et al 2017 the estimated water temperature is linked to determine the breakup and freeze up of river ice reservoir regulation in the vilui river basin which affects the discharge gauged at downstream stations was not considered in change simulations this can yield increased uncertainties in the routed discharge and river ice thickness estimates 2 3 data in arctic regions strong winds and sparse weather station measurements increase biases in observed precipitation using a specific forcing dataset dependent on such observational data can increase the uncertainty of simulated river discharge we therefore used three different gridded climatic datasets as inputs for the change simulations i e watch forcing data era interim watch 1979 2016 https doi org 10 24381 cds 20d54e34 cruncep atmospheric forcing data for the community land model cruncep 1979 2016 https rda ucar edu datasets ds314 3 and global meteorological forcing dataset for land surface modeling of princeton university princeton 1979 2012 http hydrology princeton edu data pgf php datasets with 0 5 latitude longitude spatial resolution were constructed by combining a suite of global observation based datasets with different reanalysis datasets i e era interim and ncep ncar to reduce biases related to low station density and data gaps using the three forcing datasets is useful to understand the uncertainties originating from the forcing data change has already produced scientific results on river discharge and water temperature of arctic rivers using the watch dataset park et al 2016b 2017 therefore the watch forced simulation results are considered the main target for data analysis the watch dataset which was constructed from several data sources with corrections and interpolations was described comprehensively by weedon et al 2011 2014 the forcing dataset for the 38 year period 1979 2016 consisted of the daily mean maximum and minimum air temperature precipitation water vapor pressure specific humidity wind speed and solar radiation used for the change simulations of discharge et and river ice coverage and water temperature in the lena river basin land cover was fixed to its present day distribution while vegetation phenology was prognostically determined from the simulated carbon and nitrogen fluxes climates and soil thermal and moisture conditions in individual time steps change used vertical soil texture fractions for sand silt and clay derived from the igbp soil data system to estimate the thermal and hydraulic properties of the soil in combination with the simulated soil organic matter at every time step model simulations were run with a one hour time step and a 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution a spin up run was conducted for 1200 years using detrended forcing data from the initial 20 years to establish a dynamic equilibrium of the total ecosystem carbon and nitrogen contents fig 2 the global runoff data centre grdc has archived monthly global river discharge data acquired from more than 9900 stations during 1980 2015 https www bafg de grdc en 04 spcldtbss 41 ardb arctichycos html nn 201698 the grdc dataset includes the river discharge observed at four stations i e kusur khatyrik khomo tabaga and verkhoyanski perevoz fig 1 although there are data gaps in both 2004 and 2005 the observed monthly data from the four stations were used to validate the model simulated discharge we also used monthly discharge data obtained at 26 gauges in the aldan river basin table 1 operated by the russian hydrological service roshydromet the dataset was lengthened to cover the period 1979 2016 the time series were evaluated for stationarity in relation to the presence of monotonic trends using mann kendall and spearman rank correlation tests details of the trend analysis were given by lebedeva and gustafsson 2021 2 4 sensitivity simulations different sets of numerical experiments forced by the watch dataset were designed to diagnose how changes in air temperature and precipitation affect river discharge and the permafrost thermal and hydrological regimes the experiments were based on four scenarios which included a control run forced by watch air temperature is a critical variable for vegetation activity permafrost temperature and snow cover variation therefore two scenarios included an increase in air temperature of either 2 or 4 during the simulation period excluding the 1200 year spin up period the fourth scenario included an increase in air temperature of 2 in combination with a 30 increase in precipitation 3 results 3 1 validation of model performance 3 1 1 active layer thickness alt notably the thawed soil depth of the active layer during the warm season has an impact on the increase in winter river discharge from the lena river basin smith et al 2007 consequently it was necessary to compare the simulated alt with observations however basin scale observational data of alt are not available the change simulated alt has previously been compared with that monitored at 147 sites and their comparison showed reasonable performance by change on the pan arctic scale park et al 2013 change also simulated the interannual variability of permafrost temperature observed at 10 m depth park et al 2015 an empirical model was suggested to estimate alt on the global scale using reanalysis surface air temperature data and thawing freezing data based on satellite remote sensing retrievals for which change simulated alt was in good agreement with method derived results and observations in eastern siberia including the lena river basin from 1979 to 2009 park et al 2016a in this study the change simulated alt was additionally compared with the alt observed at soil temperature monitoring sites located in the lena river basin and installed by the melnikov permafrost institute alt was linearly estimated from observed soil temperature profiles for individual sites table 2 the change simulated alt values were in agreement with observations r 0 68 p 0 001 acquired at 12 sites with different climatic and topographic conditions fig 1 while the compared alt between averaged observations and simulations in individual stations showed differences within 23 55 cm to 23 31 cm with root mean square error ranging 11 cm to 55 cm table 2 these differences were attributed to spatial resolution differences and to the influence of homogeneous soil texture on the vertical soil profile affecting soil thermal and hydraulic properties in the model park et al 2013 3 1 2 river discharge comparison of change simulated river discharge with observational records obtained at the mouths of major arctic rivers with differing climate topography and landscape showed reasonable agreement in terms of seasonal and interannual variation park et al 2016b thereafter a process that simulates the water temperature of arctic rivers based on the energy budget equation was improved in change park et al 2017 the improved model simulated river water temperature likely affects the breakup freeze up of river ice closely implicated in the discharge processes in spring and autumn therefore the simulated seasonal river discharges using the three forcing datasets were compared with the observed data at the outlet kusur and internal khatyrik khomo verkhoyanski perevoz and tabaga hydrological stations on the lena river fig 3 a reservoir constructed at the upstream of the khatyrik khomo station regulated river flow however the model did not consider the regulation affecting the discharge of the lena river mouth thus the discussion for the model performance is limited to the inner two stations of verkhoyanski perevoz and tabaga the comparison reveals that the model generally simulated the seasonal variability of discharge observed at the two stations performing well in terms of the start up and timing of the spring peak discharge closely implicated in snowmelt processes fig 3 however the model was found to produce underestimation for summer discharge of the tabaga station fig 3d while overestimations of discharge in autumn and early winter for both stations fig 3c and d as identified by the lowest monthly nash sutcliffe coefficients particularly in november and december fig 3 the deviations of the simulated discharges are attributable to the impact of runoff derived by the seasonally biased precipitation from the upstream mountain regions the influence of mountain runoff on river discharge is discussed in section 3 2 1 moreover the overestimated et park et al 2008 is likely implicated to the underestimated summer discharge of the tabaga station the change simulated annual mean et was 200 mm over the lena river basin larger than the 160 182 mm value estimated from reanalysis data fukutomi et al 2003 serreze et al 2003 in the aldan river basin the simulated annual mean et of 228 mm was comparable to the 233 mm derived with the water budget method berezovskaya et al 2005 but lower than the 300 mm or more estimated with a numerical model han and menzel 2022 underestimated et could partially explain overestimated discharge simulations at the verkhoyanski perevoz station the simulated seasonal discharges revealed differences between the forcing datasets simulations with cruncep data yielded the lowest discharge estimate whereas simulations using watch data yielded the highest values fig 3 differences between the datasets were attributed to quantitative differences in precipitation showing the difference of annually 30 mm consistent differences were also identified in the interannual discharge variations fig 4 comparison between observations and the ensemble mean of the three simulations consistently showed some differences illustrating particularly limited model performance at the two upstream stations with nash sutcliffe coefficients lower than 0 2 the observed and simulated annual discharges showed increasing trends during the study period the analysis also revealed statistically significant increasing trends in autumn and winter and decreasing trends in summer supplementary fig 1 thus results on the trend analysis are shown in the following sections 3 2 trend of water budget components 3 2 1 net precipitation and soil moisture content runoff that occurs within the soil system is largely dependent on the water budget of precipitation and et vegetation and soil type and topography the trends in monthly mean precipitation from 1979 to 2016 were consistently positive except in december and particularly high in the summer jja and early autumn so seasons supplementary fig 2 et indicated marked increasing trends during the growing season especially in early summer supplementary fig 2 when vegetation activity is vigorous and the active layer develops climatological values of the calculated monthly net precipitation i e precipitation minus et peaked at 50 mm mth 1 in summer in southern regions of the lena river basin supplementary fig 3b corresponding to the upstream areas of the verkhoyanski perevoz and tabaga stations fig 1 characterized by mountain climates conversely summer net precipitation indicated negative values in middle and lower parts of the lena river basin representing larger et than precipitation supplementary fig 3b which was likely linked to the underestimation of river discharge in summer from the tabaga station fig 3d generally in the autumn in which rainfall becomes the water source on the land surface net precipitation is broadly positive over the entire basin supplementary fig 3 resulting in larger autumnal discharge fig 3 fig 5 shows the interannual trend distribution of seasonally different net precipitation from 1979 to 2016 in the lena river basin summer jja net precipitation showed regionally heterogeneous trends that were significantly increased in the upper parts of the basins of the lena and aldan rivers as well as in the lower part of the lena river basin but decreased in parts of the upper area of the lena and aldan river basins fig 5b these results were generally consistent with the interannual trend variation rates supplementary fig 4a the trend of distribution of net precipitation in both spring mam and autumn son also presents a similar pattern to that in summer although there are differences in magnitude fig 5a c in winter djf decreasing trends in net precipitation are evident throughout much of the lena river basin excluding some regions fig 5d the lowest negative trends 0 2 mm mth 1 yr 1 were probably caused by a decrease in fractional snowfall amount relatively to winter precipitation net precipitation in winter is not directly coupled to the variation of soil moisture because it exists as snow on the soil surface during this season as it melts in spring the meltwater becomes connected to soil moisture the soil moisture in the active layers during the warm season likely contributes to the generation of subsurface runoff therefore we analyzed the linear trends of the simulated monthly soil moisture in the active layers during the study period the analysis assumed that the maximum alt was no deeper than 3 6 m in the lena river basin and that the moisture in the soil layers deeper than 3 6 m remained steady over the entire basin shestakova et al 2021 fig 6 shows the distribution of the analyzed linear trend of monthly soil moisture within the active layer in may october the regions in which soil moisture is increased are generally consistent with areas of increased net precipitation fig 5 the increasing trend of soil moisture is also associated with the alt the model simulation identified the increasing trend of alt throughout the entire lena river basin supplementary fig 5 the alt increase physically represents storage of large amounts of soil moisture and thus the increased net precipitation during the warm season fig 5 is likely easily recharged to the deepened active layers as soil moisture the alt increase also enhances permafrost thawing and the ground ice meltwater is added to the soil moisture the soil moisture in the active layer might be the source of groundwater and its discharge baseflow which is a hypothesis confirmed in section 3 2 2 3 2 2 baseflow in the cold season the change simulated fractional discharge amount in the lena river basin was higher in the surface runoff than in the baseflow supplementary fig 6 the source areas generating the runoff water were evidently different the surface runoff fraction was higher in the lower plain areas while baseflow was the primary source in the southern and eastern mountain regions the source areas of the higher baseflow are consistent with the regions characterized by higher net precipitation in the warm seasons particularly summer supplementary fig 3b which suggests a relationship between baseflow and soil moisture closely linked to summer net precipitation change simulations indicated that baseflow at the kusur station occurred primarily in autumn and early winter whereas the largest surface runoff associated with snow meltwater occurred in late spring and summer supplementary fig 7 slight amounts of baseflow continued until late spring statistical analysis was conducted to examine the seasonal and spatial trend of baseflow during 1979 2016 fig 7 shows distributions of the linear trend in baseflow for the 38 years in the cold season october march the baseflow exhibits a significant trend of increase in the upper and lower parts of the lena river basin as well as in the upper basin of the aldan river where the increase was significant in october and november the identified regions and months are generally consistent with those in which net precipitation increased fig 5 net precipitation during the warm season largely becomes the supply of soil moisture in the active layers reducing soil drying thus the wetted soil moisture is likely connected to the subsurface flow system the increase of baseflow groundwater discharge in the upper and lower parts of the lena river basin is probably associated with the increase in soil moisture in these regions contributing to the trend of increase in river discharge in the cold season the active layers of the lena river basin become frozen during the winter season owing to the colder air temperatures baseflow from frozen soil rarely occurs in winter therefore soil moisture in late summer or autumn could be the main contributor to winter baseflow and thereby river discharge this hypothesis is examined based on lag correlation analysis between soil moisture and winter baseflow fig 8 shows distributions of the lag correlation in interannual variation between monthly soil moisture in the active layer and winter baseflow the analysis indicates higher lag correlations between soil moisture in late summer august and september and winter baseflow particularly in the upper parts of the basins of the lena and aldan rivers the surface soil layers 0 1 m are generally frozen in october as a monthly mean situation while the deeper soil layers remain as a thawed layer until early winter in which unfrozen water could also contribute to winter baseflow the regions in which there was winter baseflow indicated a trend of increase in summer net precipitation fig 5 associated with small values of alt freezing in later months supplementary fig 8 the resultant higher soil moisture in late summer august september fig 6 is likely linked to the increase in baseflow in the cold season fig 7 3 3 source region of winter river discharge the above analytical results indicate that increased summer net precipitation resulted in increase of soil moisture in the active layer in late summer which was connected to the increase in baseflow in the cold season especially in the upper parts of the basins of the lena and aldan rivers these implications were investigated by performing correlation analyses among alt soil moisture and baseflow in the cold season fig 9 fig 9a shows a scatter plot between the linear trends of soil moisture in the active layer and alt during 1979 2016 in the lena river basin additionally visualizing the trend of the autumnal baseflow on their relationship the trend of soil moisture is clearly shown to be almost entirely correlated positively with that of alt as the alt increased the soil moisture correlating to the increased net precipitation increased meanwhile the trend of autumnal baseflow was not homogeneous with the positive relationship between the two variables negative baseflow trends were found at the range of their positive trend however the plots showing positive trend in the baseflow were concentrated in the ranges of the positive trends at 0 2 cm yr 1 for alt and 0 10 mm yr 1 for the soil moisture here a geographical plotting method was used to detect regions presenting positive trends in alt 0 10 cm yr 1 soil moisture 0 1 10 mm yr 1 and autumnal baseflow 0 1 8 mm mth 1 yr 1 fig 9b the regions in which the trends of the three variables were positive were distributed randomly throughout the entire lena river basin especially in the lower northern and upper southern parts of the lena river basin and the aldan river basin these regional distributions suggest that soil moisture in the northern part of the basin where soil freezing occurs relatively early in comparison with southern parts of the basin supplementary fig 8 is linked to autumnal baseflow prior to the freezing of the active layer fig 9c shows a scatter plot of the trend of winter baseflow in the relationship between the linear trends of soil moisture within the active layer and alt the pattern shown in fig 9c is similar to that shown in fig 9a although the trend values of winter baseflow are lower than the autumnal values however some of the winter baseflow showed a strong trend of increase 2 0 mm mth 1 yr 1 in the area of concentrated positive trends fig 9c we also identified regions with positive trends in the three variables fig 9d the regions that showed consistently increasing trends in the three variables were distributed widely in the upper parts of the basins of the lena and aldan rivers where the landscape is underlain by discontinuous permafrost fig 1 and autumnal baseflow is also increased fig 9b this indicates that the increase in winter discharge of the lena river is primarily the result of the increase in winter baseflow in upper parts of the basin to confirm the above model based analysis on the detection of the source region in relation to winter river discharge trend analysis was applied to the observed monthly discharges in the cold season october march observed at 26 river stations in the aldan river basin during 1979 2016 table 1 the months and gauges when rivers freeze up to the bottom and have zero flow every year were excluded from the analysis the analyzed results revealed various regimes of discharge at the stations with positive negative monthly trends supplementary table 1 interestingly statistically significant change in monthly discharge occurred mostly between the mid 1990 s and mid 2000 s this could be associated with the increase in net precipitation in the same period hiyama et al 2016 positive trends were identified in 57 months 45 6 among the total of 125 months of the cold season except those with zero flow caused by complete freeze up of stream water insignificant trends were found in 66 months 52 8 and negative trends were detected in only 2 months 1 6 significant increases in monthly discharge during october january were observed at approximately half of the non frozen gauges in february and march one third of the gauges showed positive trends the regime in which winter discharge recorded positive trends over 3 months or more in the 6 cold months was found at 10 stations table 1 thus this analysis broadly supports the robustness of the model based results presented above 3 4 trend of river ice thickness warming air temperatures likely affect river ice processes i e breakup freeze up and thickness that are closely associated with winter river discharge an increase in river ice thickness means conversion of discharging water to ice and resultant decrease in river discharge although the ice is subsequently added to river discharge in spring conversely a decrease in ice thickness represents a potential contribution to increased river discharge to examine the impact of changing river ice thickness on winter river discharge the river ice volume of the lena river basin was calculated based on model simulated ice thickness and river width and length of individual grids fig 10 displays the trend of the simulated monthly averaged river ice volume of the lena river basin during the study period indicating a trend of decrease in all months the decrease of ice volume was greatest in may which reflects decreased ice growth during the entire winter the decreased ice volume is primarily attributable to the impact of warming air temperatures park et al 2016b shiklomanov and lammers 2014 the increased snow depth is likely to further reinforce the ice thinning trend park et al 2016b 3 5 sensitivity simulations four sensitivity simulations described in section 2 4 were conducted to investigate the influence of the warming climate on hydrological variables increased air temperature induced a baseflow decrease in autumn and winter particularly in the southern mountainous regions fig 11 a b where the baseflow was originally large supplementary fig 6 seasonally the increased air temperature induced strong summer discharge decreases at the two stations especially in june whereas et in the entire lena river basin increased considerably supplementary fig 9 causing soil drying this temperature driven discharge decrease influenced by larger et lasted until autumn these results indicate that when only air temperature increased the lena river discharge decrease was likely caused by higher et in the fourth simulation the precipitation increase likely alleviated the et induced soil drying and offset the river discharge decrease indeed the et induced river discharge decrease in summer was absent from the fourth simulation results but the influence of precipitation on river discharge was visible during the cold season when the absolute et value was low supplementary fig 9 increased precipitation also induced a large spring discharge increase increased air temperature resulted in thinner river ice in the lena river basin as shown by the anomalous simulated ice volumes supplementary fig 9f the ice volume decrease was particularly large in early spring when air temperature was originally warm this indicates that the temperature driven ice volume decrease likely affected the early spring river discharge increase in conjunction with the earlier snowmelt enhanced by the warmer air temperature in autumn and winter the largest ice volume decrease was calculated in the fourth simulation because the precipitation induced snow insulation increase also decreased river ice thickness park et al 2016b 4 discussion 4 1 impact of climate change on winter discharge using observational data and modeling results this study analyzed the trends of seasonal and interannual discharge in the lena river basin focusing particularly on the discharge in the cold season including the implications regarding warming permafrost on changing hydrological processes observational data of soil temperature have indicated warming of permafrost over eastern siberia including the lena river basin fedorov et al 2014b the model simulated alt also showed increasing trends throughout the lena river basin during the study period supplementary fig 5 the increased alt has the physical property of being able to hold much more soil moisture within the active layer thus the active layer water storage capacity increases the alt derived larger storage needs additional net precipitation for saturation of soil moisture in the storage process moisture in the surface soil layers is primarily used for et while simultaneously percolating downward park et al 2021 change simulated increasing trends of summer et in the lena river basin were particularly large in late spring and early summer supplementary fig 2 increasing et enhances soil moisture loss inducing active layer drying the et derived dry soil likely reduces the opportunity for soil moisture in the active layer to be connected to subsurface runoff or baseflow interestingly the monthly trends of river discharge observed at the inner river stations were negative in june and july supplementary fig 1c d despite increasing precipitation supplementary fig 2 these negative trends were probably associated with higher et early summer et in the lena river basin is indeed larger than precipitation park et al 2008 under the increasing air temperature conditions similarly et driven discharge decrease in the lena river basin was amplified supplementary fig 9 larger precipitation could temporarily compensate the et driven soil drying and baseflow decrease as calculated in the fourth simulation supplementary fig 9 the model also simulated increasing trends for autumn et supplementary fig 2 however autumn et values were generally smaller because of lower vegetation activity and lower atmospheric demand park et al 2008 conversely autumn precipitation increased during the study period supplementary fig 2 this larger net precipitation became a source of soil moisture thereby influencing baseflow in autumn fig 9a b and winter fig 9c d these results clearly demonstrate the essential contribution of climate induced precipitation increase to baseflow as illustrated by the clear relationship between net precipitation fig 5 and baseflow fig 7 the warming climate likely alters precipitation regime characteristics for example through a larger rainfall fraction or duration yang et al 2002 2007 higher soil moisture caused by increased precipitation in the warmer autumn season is characterized by higher heat capacity which in turn delays soil freezing in later months thereby lengthening the period of strong correlation between soil moisture and baseflow satellite remote sensing data also indicate delayed freezing of the soil surface in autumn caused by recent global warming effects park et al 2016a while the soil surface begins to freeze snow accumulates on the surface snow water is then completely decoupled from runoff processes occurring in the soil system during the cold season recent climate change resulted in a thicker snow depth in the southern mountainous regions park et al 2015 identified as the source area of increased baseflow fig 9 and in a delayed freezing of the active layer supplementary fig 8 snow cover provides greater insulation that likely delays soil freezing thereby maintaining baseflow however baseflow variations caused by the thicker snow cover have not been fully studied in the context of cold season hydrological processes snow also covers river ice that forms in october or november in the lena river basin this further limits river ice growth during the winter season in conjunction with increasing air temperature park et al 2016b in 1955 2012 climate warming caused a marked thinning of river ice by 73 cm at the kusur station shiklomanov and lammers 2014 yang et al 2002 found a negative correlation r 0 73 between winter streamflow and river ice thickness at the kusur station suggesting that the warming climate induces a decrease in river ice production and an increase in the winter streamflow similarly gurevich 2009 analyzed changes in air temperature river ice thickness and river discharge for 16 monitoring stations in the aldan river basin and reported that winter air temperature was correlated positively with winter discharge warmer winter temperatures weakened the influence of river ice on discharge causing discharge to increase these results suggest that river ice is a key storage component affecting winter streamflow our simulation results also showed a clear thinning of river ice during the cold season over the study period fig 10 implying a contribution of river ice to winter river discharge variations 4 2 impact of permafrost thawing on winter discharge an alt increase is an indicator of permafrost thawing but is not directly related to river discharge however our analysis clearly indicated that the climate induced alt increase was correlated with baseflow increase in the cold season fig 9 this correlation was also influenced by soil water storage in the active layer permafrost is also associated with soil water storage dynamics permafrost below the active layer acts as a barrier that prevents water from percolating deeper thus inflowed water from the surface soil layers eventually accumulates in the soil layers close to the permafrost table stabilizing soil moisture at a high level that can affect baseflow jorgenson et al 2010 in this study we identified the southern mountainous regions as the major baseflow source area during the cold season fig 9b d the southern regions underlain by continuous and discontinuous permafrost were characterized by a thicker active layer in which higher autumn net precipitation fig 5 thus higher soil moisture fig 6 was stored contributing to the baseflow increase fig 7 this finding is generally consistent with recent studies reporting that permafrost thawing is linked to discharge increase during the cold season han and menzel 2022 smith et al 2007 walvoord and striegl 2007 wang et al 2021 through increased groundwater storage within the active layer walvoord and kurylyk 2016 an alt increase is not always concurrent with a baseflow increase for example in the upper parts of the lena river basin around lake baykal the alt is larger than 3 m supplementary fig 5a but lag correlation between interannual variations of monthly soil moisture in the active layer and of winter baseflow is low fig 8 during the study period decreasing trends were calculated for soil moisture in the active layer alt and baseflow in the upper lena river basin around lake baykal during the cold season when the thicker active layer associated with a warmer climate dries inflowed net precipitation is preferentially converted to soil moisture and baseflow decreases this hypothesis was confirmed by comparing the control run with the two sensitivity simulations in which the increased air temperature induced a considerable decrease in autumn and winter baseflow particularly marked in the southern mountainous regions fig 11a b where the baseflow was originally large supplementary fig 6d on the other hand our results indicated regional inconsistency between alt and baseflow trends they clearly showed that an alt increase does not systematically correspond to an increase in soil water storage within the active layer net precipitation affects soil water storage and influences baseflow analyzed net precipitation variations showed considerable regional complexity with a marked increase in the southern mountainous regions fig 5 inducing a baseflow increase fig 7 this suggests that the lena river discharge increase was caused by the combined climate induced effects of localized larger net precipitation and permafrost thawing permafrost is ice rich frozen soil mixed with ground ice such as yedoma and ice wedges warming of permafrost temperature or increasing of the alt likely enhance the melting of ground ice contributing to the wetted active layer in situ observations found thawing of the upper ice rich permafrost following warming of the climate and resultant expansion of thermokarst lakes in tundra liljedahl et al 2016 and boreal forested fedorov et al 2014a ulrich et al 2017 regions within the lena river basin observational data analysis indicated significant correlation between the warming permafrost temperature and increasing river discharge in the cold season in the upper parts of the lena river basin underlain by discontinuous permafrost tananaev et al 2016 and eventually in the aldan river basin underlain by continuous permafrost han and menzel 2022 the observational results suggest a possible contribution to increased baseflow from ground ice melting associated with permafrost warming modeling the change in ground ice is currently beyond the capability of change simulations 4 3 model uncertainty inadequate hydroclimatological data from the lena river basin including lack of actual et and long term permafrost observations limit the scope of analysis of the hydrological response to changes in climate and permafrost in this region this study used the change model to resolve this problem model simulations were conducted using three different atmospheric forcing datasets and the results presented differences in the amounts of simulated river discharge between the forcing datasets as well as in comparison with observations figs 3 and 4 the differences were mainly attributable to the difference in precipitation between the three forcing datasets park et al 2020 although numerous internal feedbacks and the complexity of the change model prevent us from determining clear reasons for its limited performance we discuss here its intrinsic limitations as a one dimensional model change has a rough spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 inappropriate to represent water movements e g lateral flow occurring in the complex mountain topography of the upper lena and aldan river basins where baseflow production is large furthermore the trip2 model used to simulate river discharge is a storage based grid cell wise routing model dependent on spatially effective subgrid parameters these are estimated independently from topographic data and from the model simulated water storage without possibility for parameter tuning based on the observed discharge data slater et al 2007 compared simulations of five land surface models with observations from the four major arctic river basins they established that model hydrographs were often out of phase peaking too early from the spring maximum discharge in terms of model performance simpler hydrological models e g hbv bergström and lindström 2015 occasionally yield comparable agreement with observations however change can reproduce a wide range of physical phenomena particularly for high latitude processes thus it is potentially better adapted to investigate the influence of permafrost on river discharge furthermore simulated alt spatial distribution and trends were comparable for the three forcing datasets despite differences in absolute values supplementary fig 5 the consistency between all simulations indicated satisfactory agreement with observations overall simulation results obtained with the watch forcing dataset do not preclude meaningful analysis of the impacts of changing hydroclimatological processes and permafrost on winter river discharge in the lena river basin 5 conclusions this study focused on the increasing trend in winter river discharge in the lena river basin and examined the impact of global warming induced changes in net precipitation soil moisture alt and baseflow as well as their interrelations based on model simulated results for the 38 year period 1979 2016 net precipitation showed an increasing trend in summer which was especially significant in lower parts of the lena river basin and upper parts of the basins of the lena and aldan rivers resulting in higher soil moisture in the active layer lag correlation analysis between net precipitation and soil moisture exhibited higher positive correlations in the warm season july september in the same regions indicating that net precipitation was stored as soil moisture moreover the maximum values of alt recorded in august and september revealed increasing trends over the entire basin during the study period meaning that the deepened active layer could store more soil moisture trend analyses also identified increasing baseflow in the cold season in lower parts of the lena river basin and in upper parts of the basins of the lena and aldan rivers lag correlation analysis revealed that winter djf baseflow was highly correlated with soil moisture of the previous late summer august and september these results synthetically explain the connectivity of the soil moisture increase associated with global warming which is strongly implicated with net precipitation and the alt to the increase in winter discharge in the lena river basin furthermore warming air temperatures reduced the river ice thickness thereby also contributing to the increase in winter discharge our results revealed that the upper parts of the basins of the lena and aldan rivers are major source areas for the increased winter river discharge which was verified by correlation analyses among the alt soil moisture and baseflow in the cold season interestingly the regions contributing to the increase in autumnal baseflow are located in the lower and upper parts of the lena river basin whereas the contribution to winter baseflow was relatively large in the upper parts of the basins of the lena and aldan rivers that are underlain by continuous and discontinuous permafrost in conclusion the increases in winter river discharge of the lena river could be the result of increased groundwater flow associated with higher storage capacity caused by the deepened active layer and thawing permafrost in the upper parts of the basins of the lena and aldan rivers these results suggest that the contribution of thawing permafrost to winter discharge will further increase under the effects of further climate change however quantitative assessment on the contribution of permafrost sourced water to the increasing discharge remains a subject for future research data availability

2611,winter discharge of the lena river russia has increased over the previous several decades however the impact of permafrost thawing and of changing hydrological processes induced by climate change on the river s winter discharge is not well quantified here using a coupled land surface model and a distributed discharge model we conducted trend analyses to examine the sensitivity of winter discharge to permafrost thawing and water budget change in the lena river basin during 1979 2016 an increasing trend of winter baseflow was found in upper parts of both the lena river basin and the aldan river basin where summer net precipitation showed a statistically significant increase the increased summer net precipitation resulted in higher soil moisture in the deepened active layer in late summer and early autumn which was linked to autumn and winter baseflow these implications were examined from the perspective of interrelations among the trends of active layer thickness soil moisture and baseflow in the cold season by identifying regions in which all the variables exhibited positive trends the identified source regions were primarily in the lower lena river basin and upper basins of the lena and aldan rivers although winter baseflow was more dominant in the latter regions owing to the freezing effect of the active layer thinning of river ice induced by warming temperatures also contributed to the increase of winter river discharge these results suggest that the increased winter discharge was strongly associated with climate change related enhancement of permafrost thawing and increase in net precipitation that affected soil hydrological processes which will be strengthened further in the context of global warming keywords active layer thickness soil moisture baseflow net precipitation winter river discharge lena river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change has progressed notably in the arctic circumpolar region mcbean et al 2005 turner et al 2007 resulting in drastic changes in hydrological processes particularly increased discharge from arctic rivers walsh et al 2005 hinzman et al 2005 serreze et al 2000 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 historical observations and model simulations clearly reveal the increases of discharge from arctic rivers over the previous several decades peterson et al 2002 mcclelland et al 2006 overeem and syvitski 2016 specifically the increase in river discharge has been substantial in northern eurasia since the 1980s holmes et al 2015 peterson et al 2002 presented evidence that annual river discharge to the arctic ocean from the six largest river basins in northern eurasia increased by 7 during 1936 1999 moreover these increases are projected to amplify further under the influence of future climate change zhang et al 2018 bring et al 2017 arctic rivers are characterized by a dynamic hydrological flow regime with peak discharge during spring caused by high snowmelt runoff yang et al 2007 the snow related hydrological regime has also experienced marked changes over recent decades the effects of climate change are causing a notable shift toward an earlier peak in spring discharge due to earlier snowmelt shiklomanov et al 2007 tananaev et al 2016 suzuki et al 2020 the earlier onset of snowmelt and resultant soil thawing likely cause advanced activity of soil moisture linked to evapotranspiration et and runoff processes in addition to earlier development of the active layer the advanced usage of soil moisture by et can lead to drier soil whereas increased precipitation induced by climate change can offset this dryness and lead to soil wetting walvoord and striegl 2007 jacques and sauchyn 2009 intensification of soil drying and wetting can affect water budget components linked to soil moisture climate change can also enhance deepening of the active layer during the warm season which increases mixing mobilization and flux of soil moisture within the active layer park et al 2021 soil wetting likely strengthens the connectivity of soil moisture to the generation of subsurface runoff while soil drying has a limiting effect on the relationship the ice rich permafrost is vulnerable to the effects of a warming climate in situ and satellite remote sensing observations have been used to identify the expansion of thermokarst lakes and wet areas induced by permafrost thawing and degradation under the impact of climate change liljedahl et al 2016 ulrich et al 2017 and the resultant effects on local and regional hydrology have been analyzed liljedahl et al 2016 earlier works documented that permafrost thawing played a minor role in the observed long term increase in river runoff in northern eurasia in comparison with the larger contribution associated with increased precipitation fukutomi et al 2003 mcclelland et al 2004 recent studies have proposed the importance of thickening of the active layer because it can cause localized increase in groundwater storage within the active layer walvoord and kurylyk 2016 thereby enhancing regional surface groundwater interactions as a result of permafrost thawing evans et al 2020 these changes can lead to more groundwater discharging into rivers wang et al 2021 previous works that analyzed long term hydrological and meteorological data detected statistically significant increases in winter discharge of arctic rivers on the basis of which they implied that permafrost thawing was linked to the increase in discharge han and menzel 2022 smith et al 2007 walvoord and striegl 2007 wang et al 2021 the quantitative degree of winter river discharge is considerably low in comparison with the discharge induced by spring snowmelt under future climate change permafrost thawing is projected to increase ipcc 2021 such that engagement of permafrost thawing induced groundwater to winter river discharge will be further intensified wang et al 2021 considered that for every 1 rise in temperature the groundwater discharge of siberian rivers would likely increase by 6 1 10 5 depending on permafrost condition of all the arctic rivers that flow into the arctic ocean the lena river in russia has the second largest annual discharge the lena river is underlain almost entirely by continuous and discontinuous permafrost because climate change can lead to thawing and degradation of permafrost it can have considerable impact on permafrost implicated hydrological processes in the lena river basin observations have already detected permafrost thawing initiated by rapid warming and the resultant increasing of the active layer thickness alt and its wetting iijima et al 2010 hiyama et al 2021 together with their potential contributions to the increasing discharge of the lena river particularly in the low flow season brutsaert and hiyama 2012 or in the cold season han and menzel 2022 tananaev et al 2016 wang et al 2021 liu et al 2022 recently analyzed the climate change related response of streamflow in four rivers the lena kolyma yukon and mackenzie rivers during early mid and late winter considering relatively few dam effects and concluded that winter streamflow generation under warming climate conditions was strongly associated with enhanced surface and subsurface hydrological cycles similarly previous findings have clearly highlighted the possibility of permafrost thawing winter river discharge connectivity in the context of global warming smith et al 2007 however a spatially and temporally comprehensive picture of recent changes in the discharge of the lena river remains lacking the discharge regime during the winter season is strongly related to river ice that is critical in terms of the magnitude and timing of northern hydrologic extremes i e low flows and floods historical data analyses shiklomanov and lammers 2014 yang et al 2002 and model studies park et al 2016b clearly show widespread decrease in both the thickness and the duration of ice in arctic rivers due to the effects of global warming across northern regions increase in air temperature and resultant thinning of river ice could also be partly responsible for larger winter streamflow thinned river ice increases exchange between the surface and the bottom river water leading to a higher runoff rate that restricts the vertical movement of floating ice cover occurring in mainly larger rivers hence leading to larger discharge prowse and gridley 1993 in small rivers river ice thickness is comparable to winter river depth thus in comparison with the contribution of large rivers the contribution of small rivers is relatively low in a cold winter but it increases during a warmer winter markov 2003 these results which illustrate that the observed increase in winter discharge of arctic rivers is particularly sensitive to climate change via thinning of river ice highlight the need for more comprehensive examination of the underlying relationships in this study we asked the following questions how does climate change contribute to the increased winter discharge in the lena river basin how does permafrost thawing influence this discharge how useful can a physics based hydrological model be to investigate climate change induced permafrost dynamics and the associated hydrological processes using observational data and model results for the period 1979 2016 in the lena river basin this study investigated the seasonal and long term trends of the lena river discharge including soil moisture and alt to detect patterns of hydroclimatological change and identified those regions contributing to the increase in winter river discharge in the lena river basin the results were examined using statistical correlation analysis and model sensitivity simulations with surface air temperature and precipitation as model forcing data 2 data and methods 2 1 study site this study considered the lena river basin russia fig 1 illustrates a geographical perspective of the basin classified into four categories of permafrost zones the lena river basin includes the subbasins of several tributaries the length of the main river channel is 4 400 km and the entire basin area is 2 430 000 km2 the third largest among all of the arctic circumpolar river basins hiyama et al 2019 annual discharge of the lena river is 530 km3 yr peterson et al 2002 which is the second largest of all northern eurasian rivers and accounts for approximately 7 of freshwater input into the arctic ocean serreze et al 2006 dickson et al 2007 the main hydrological stations that measure the daily water levels and discharges in the lena river basin are located at kusur tabaga verkhoyanski perevoz and khatyrik khomo fig 1 the kusur and tabaga stations are at the lowest and middle points of the lena river respectively and the verkhoyanski perevoz and khatyrik khomo stations are at the lowest points of the aldan and vilui rivers respectively fig 1 a reservoir maximum volume 35 9 km3 is located in the upper and middle parts of the vilui river yang et al 2005 the maximum water storage of this reservoir accounts for approximately 77 of the annual discharge 46 7 km3 yr of the vilui river and the winter river discharge of the vilui river increased following the construction of the dam ye et al 2003 reservoir regulation also affects the discharge gauged at the kusur station particularly during winter when total discharge is low permafrost thickness in the basin is estimated to be deeper than 100 m and it is deeper than 500 m in the northern part of the basin mean annual ground temperature at the depth of zero annual amplitude ranges from 0 to 12 shestakova et al 2021 the alt are less than 0 3 m in the northern part and 3 5 m in the southern part of the basin shestakova et al 2021 the classification of the permafrost zones fig 1 shows that the upper part of the lena river basin is underlain by continuous 90 100 discontinuous 50 90 sporadic 10 50 and isolated 0 10 permafrost similarly the permafrost in the upper aldan river basin is continuous and discontinuous the other basin areas including the vilui river basin and the middle and lower parts of the basins of the lena and aldan rivers are underlain by continuous permafrost 2 2 model 2 2 1 change this study used the process based land surface model change which is a coupled hydrological and biogeochemical model park et al 2011 2018 for evaluation of the trends in terrestrial water budgets in the lena river basin change calculates the heat water vapor and carbon dioxide fluxes in the atmosphere vegetation snow soil system including snow and soil hydrology soil freezing thawing phase change and stomatal physiology and photosynthesis fig 2 the model simulated snow meltwater is divided into infiltration and surface runoff at the soil surface layer even during precipitation events the infiltrated water flows up or down in the soil system depending on the water potential gradient between soil layers and the excess water at either the permafrost table or the bottom soil boundary layer is converted to subsurface flow et is simulated as the sum of soil evaporation transpiration and rainfall interception by the canopy canopy interception is assumed to occur at the potential rate without exceeding the canopy water storage capacity transpiration is expressed as the accumulated water extraction from soil layers weighted by the root fraction in each layer soil evaporation is limited by energy and atmospheric forcing and by a maximum exfiltration rate derived from soil properties for a given soil moisture the model explicitly represents the dynamics of water and heat flows in permafrost soil by considering the freezing thawing phase transitions in a soil column depth 50 4 m to explicitly capture the thermal inertia of deep ground 2 2 2 trip2 the grid based river network model trip2 ngo duc et al 2007 was coupled to change to simulate river discharge park et al 2016b 2017 fig 2 trip2 is a storage based distributed river routing model that adopts spatially effective subgrid parameters and broadly represents a more realistic travel time without calibration the global river network trip with 0 5 spatial resolution oki and sud 1998 was used for trip2 that calculates riverine water storage river discharge water depth and channel width in each grid cell at every time step water storage is the only prognostic variable and the other variables are diagnosed from the water storage term the change calculated inflowed surface and subsurface runoff are stored in individual storage reservoirs and the water is routed along a prescribed channel network to the basin outlet the model also includes river ice formation growth and melt which affect heat storage and river hydraulics park et al 2016b the distribution of water temperature along a river is described by the one dimensional advection diffusion equation based on heat inflow from upstream heat exchange at the air water interface and inflow of heat and water from tributaries park et al 2017 the estimated water temperature is linked to determine the breakup and freeze up of river ice reservoir regulation in the vilui river basin which affects the discharge gauged at downstream stations was not considered in change simulations this can yield increased uncertainties in the routed discharge and river ice thickness estimates 2 3 data in arctic regions strong winds and sparse weather station measurements increase biases in observed precipitation using a specific forcing dataset dependent on such observational data can increase the uncertainty of simulated river discharge we therefore used three different gridded climatic datasets as inputs for the change simulations i e watch forcing data era interim watch 1979 2016 https doi org 10 24381 cds 20d54e34 cruncep atmospheric forcing data for the community land model cruncep 1979 2016 https rda ucar edu datasets ds314 3 and global meteorological forcing dataset for land surface modeling of princeton university princeton 1979 2012 http hydrology princeton edu data pgf php datasets with 0 5 latitude longitude spatial resolution were constructed by combining a suite of global observation based datasets with different reanalysis datasets i e era interim and ncep ncar to reduce biases related to low station density and data gaps using the three forcing datasets is useful to understand the uncertainties originating from the forcing data change has already produced scientific results on river discharge and water temperature of arctic rivers using the watch dataset park et al 2016b 2017 therefore the watch forced simulation results are considered the main target for data analysis the watch dataset which was constructed from several data sources with corrections and interpolations was described comprehensively by weedon et al 2011 2014 the forcing dataset for the 38 year period 1979 2016 consisted of the daily mean maximum and minimum air temperature precipitation water vapor pressure specific humidity wind speed and solar radiation used for the change simulations of discharge et and river ice coverage and water temperature in the lena river basin land cover was fixed to its present day distribution while vegetation phenology was prognostically determined from the simulated carbon and nitrogen fluxes climates and soil thermal and moisture conditions in individual time steps change used vertical soil texture fractions for sand silt and clay derived from the igbp soil data system to estimate the thermal and hydraulic properties of the soil in combination with the simulated soil organic matter at every time step model simulations were run with a one hour time step and a 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution a spin up run was conducted for 1200 years using detrended forcing data from the initial 20 years to establish a dynamic equilibrium of the total ecosystem carbon and nitrogen contents fig 2 the global runoff data centre grdc has archived monthly global river discharge data acquired from more than 9900 stations during 1980 2015 https www bafg de grdc en 04 spcldtbss 41 ardb arctichycos html nn 201698 the grdc dataset includes the river discharge observed at four stations i e kusur khatyrik khomo tabaga and verkhoyanski perevoz fig 1 although there are data gaps in both 2004 and 2005 the observed monthly data from the four stations were used to validate the model simulated discharge we also used monthly discharge data obtained at 26 gauges in the aldan river basin table 1 operated by the russian hydrological service roshydromet the dataset was lengthened to cover the period 1979 2016 the time series were evaluated for stationarity in relation to the presence of monotonic trends using mann kendall and spearman rank correlation tests details of the trend analysis were given by lebedeva and gustafsson 2021 2 4 sensitivity simulations different sets of numerical experiments forced by the watch dataset were designed to diagnose how changes in air temperature and precipitation affect river discharge and the permafrost thermal and hydrological regimes the experiments were based on four scenarios which included a control run forced by watch air temperature is a critical variable for vegetation activity permafrost temperature and snow cover variation therefore two scenarios included an increase in air temperature of either 2 or 4 during the simulation period excluding the 1200 year spin up period the fourth scenario included an increase in air temperature of 2 in combination with a 30 increase in precipitation 3 results 3 1 validation of model performance 3 1 1 active layer thickness alt notably the thawed soil depth of the active layer during the warm season has an impact on the increase in winter river discharge from the lena river basin smith et al 2007 consequently it was necessary to compare the simulated alt with observations however basin scale observational data of alt are not available the change simulated alt has previously been compared with that monitored at 147 sites and their comparison showed reasonable performance by change on the pan arctic scale park et al 2013 change also simulated the interannual variability of permafrost temperature observed at 10 m depth park et al 2015 an empirical model was suggested to estimate alt on the global scale using reanalysis surface air temperature data and thawing freezing data based on satellite remote sensing retrievals for which change simulated alt was in good agreement with method derived results and observations in eastern siberia including the lena river basin from 1979 to 2009 park et al 2016a in this study the change simulated alt was additionally compared with the alt observed at soil temperature monitoring sites located in the lena river basin and installed by the melnikov permafrost institute alt was linearly estimated from observed soil temperature profiles for individual sites table 2 the change simulated alt values were in agreement with observations r 0 68 p 0 001 acquired at 12 sites with different climatic and topographic conditions fig 1 while the compared alt between averaged observations and simulations in individual stations showed differences within 23 55 cm to 23 31 cm with root mean square error ranging 11 cm to 55 cm table 2 these differences were attributed to spatial resolution differences and to the influence of homogeneous soil texture on the vertical soil profile affecting soil thermal and hydraulic properties in the model park et al 2013 3 1 2 river discharge comparison of change simulated river discharge with observational records obtained at the mouths of major arctic rivers with differing climate topography and landscape showed reasonable agreement in terms of seasonal and interannual variation park et al 2016b thereafter a process that simulates the water temperature of arctic rivers based on the energy budget equation was improved in change park et al 2017 the improved model simulated river water temperature likely affects the breakup freeze up of river ice closely implicated in the discharge processes in spring and autumn therefore the simulated seasonal river discharges using the three forcing datasets were compared with the observed data at the outlet kusur and internal khatyrik khomo verkhoyanski perevoz and tabaga hydrological stations on the lena river fig 3 a reservoir constructed at the upstream of the khatyrik khomo station regulated river flow however the model did not consider the regulation affecting the discharge of the lena river mouth thus the discussion for the model performance is limited to the inner two stations of verkhoyanski perevoz and tabaga the comparison reveals that the model generally simulated the seasonal variability of discharge observed at the two stations performing well in terms of the start up and timing of the spring peak discharge closely implicated in snowmelt processes fig 3 however the model was found to produce underestimation for summer discharge of the tabaga station fig 3d while overestimations of discharge in autumn and early winter for both stations fig 3c and d as identified by the lowest monthly nash sutcliffe coefficients particularly in november and december fig 3 the deviations of the simulated discharges are attributable to the impact of runoff derived by the seasonally biased precipitation from the upstream mountain regions the influence of mountain runoff on river discharge is discussed in section 3 2 1 moreover the overestimated et park et al 2008 is likely implicated to the underestimated summer discharge of the tabaga station the change simulated annual mean et was 200 mm over the lena river basin larger than the 160 182 mm value estimated from reanalysis data fukutomi et al 2003 serreze et al 2003 in the aldan river basin the simulated annual mean et of 228 mm was comparable to the 233 mm derived with the water budget method berezovskaya et al 2005 but lower than the 300 mm or more estimated with a numerical model han and menzel 2022 underestimated et could partially explain overestimated discharge simulations at the verkhoyanski perevoz station the simulated seasonal discharges revealed differences between the forcing datasets simulations with cruncep data yielded the lowest discharge estimate whereas simulations using watch data yielded the highest values fig 3 differences between the datasets were attributed to quantitative differences in precipitation showing the difference of annually 30 mm consistent differences were also identified in the interannual discharge variations fig 4 comparison between observations and the ensemble mean of the three simulations consistently showed some differences illustrating particularly limited model performance at the two upstream stations with nash sutcliffe coefficients lower than 0 2 the observed and simulated annual discharges showed increasing trends during the study period the analysis also revealed statistically significant increasing trends in autumn and winter and decreasing trends in summer supplementary fig 1 thus results on the trend analysis are shown in the following sections 3 2 trend of water budget components 3 2 1 net precipitation and soil moisture content runoff that occurs within the soil system is largely dependent on the water budget of precipitation and et vegetation and soil type and topography the trends in monthly mean precipitation from 1979 to 2016 were consistently positive except in december and particularly high in the summer jja and early autumn so seasons supplementary fig 2 et indicated marked increasing trends during the growing season especially in early summer supplementary fig 2 when vegetation activity is vigorous and the active layer develops climatological values of the calculated monthly net precipitation i e precipitation minus et peaked at 50 mm mth 1 in summer in southern regions of the lena river basin supplementary fig 3b corresponding to the upstream areas of the verkhoyanski perevoz and tabaga stations fig 1 characterized by mountain climates conversely summer net precipitation indicated negative values in middle and lower parts of the lena river basin representing larger et than precipitation supplementary fig 3b which was likely linked to the underestimation of river discharge in summer from the tabaga station fig 3d generally in the autumn in which rainfall becomes the water source on the land surface net precipitation is broadly positive over the entire basin supplementary fig 3 resulting in larger autumnal discharge fig 3 fig 5 shows the interannual trend distribution of seasonally different net precipitation from 1979 to 2016 in the lena river basin summer jja net precipitation showed regionally heterogeneous trends that were significantly increased in the upper parts of the basins of the lena and aldan rivers as well as in the lower part of the lena river basin but decreased in parts of the upper area of the lena and aldan river basins fig 5b these results were generally consistent with the interannual trend variation rates supplementary fig 4a the trend of distribution of net precipitation in both spring mam and autumn son also presents a similar pattern to that in summer although there are differences in magnitude fig 5a c in winter djf decreasing trends in net precipitation are evident throughout much of the lena river basin excluding some regions fig 5d the lowest negative trends 0 2 mm mth 1 yr 1 were probably caused by a decrease in fractional snowfall amount relatively to winter precipitation net precipitation in winter is not directly coupled to the variation of soil moisture because it exists as snow on the soil surface during this season as it melts in spring the meltwater becomes connected to soil moisture the soil moisture in the active layers during the warm season likely contributes to the generation of subsurface runoff therefore we analyzed the linear trends of the simulated monthly soil moisture in the active layers during the study period the analysis assumed that the maximum alt was no deeper than 3 6 m in the lena river basin and that the moisture in the soil layers deeper than 3 6 m remained steady over the entire basin shestakova et al 2021 fig 6 shows the distribution of the analyzed linear trend of monthly soil moisture within the active layer in may october the regions in which soil moisture is increased are generally consistent with areas of increased net precipitation fig 5 the increasing trend of soil moisture is also associated with the alt the model simulation identified the increasing trend of alt throughout the entire lena river basin supplementary fig 5 the alt increase physically represents storage of large amounts of soil moisture and thus the increased net precipitation during the warm season fig 5 is likely easily recharged to the deepened active layers as soil moisture the alt increase also enhances permafrost thawing and the ground ice meltwater is added to the soil moisture the soil moisture in the active layer might be the source of groundwater and its discharge baseflow which is a hypothesis confirmed in section 3 2 2 3 2 2 baseflow in the cold season the change simulated fractional discharge amount in the lena river basin was higher in the surface runoff than in the baseflow supplementary fig 6 the source areas generating the runoff water were evidently different the surface runoff fraction was higher in the lower plain areas while baseflow was the primary source in the southern and eastern mountain regions the source areas of the higher baseflow are consistent with the regions characterized by higher net precipitation in the warm seasons particularly summer supplementary fig 3b which suggests a relationship between baseflow and soil moisture closely linked to summer net precipitation change simulations indicated that baseflow at the kusur station occurred primarily in autumn and early winter whereas the largest surface runoff associated with snow meltwater occurred in late spring and summer supplementary fig 7 slight amounts of baseflow continued until late spring statistical analysis was conducted to examine the seasonal and spatial trend of baseflow during 1979 2016 fig 7 shows distributions of the linear trend in baseflow for the 38 years in the cold season october march the baseflow exhibits a significant trend of increase in the upper and lower parts of the lena river basin as well as in the upper basin of the aldan river where the increase was significant in october and november the identified regions and months are generally consistent with those in which net precipitation increased fig 5 net precipitation during the warm season largely becomes the supply of soil moisture in the active layers reducing soil drying thus the wetted soil moisture is likely connected to the subsurface flow system the increase of baseflow groundwater discharge in the upper and lower parts of the lena river basin is probably associated with the increase in soil moisture in these regions contributing to the trend of increase in river discharge in the cold season the active layers of the lena river basin become frozen during the winter season owing to the colder air temperatures baseflow from frozen soil rarely occurs in winter therefore soil moisture in late summer or autumn could be the main contributor to winter baseflow and thereby river discharge this hypothesis is examined based on lag correlation analysis between soil moisture and winter baseflow fig 8 shows distributions of the lag correlation in interannual variation between monthly soil moisture in the active layer and winter baseflow the analysis indicates higher lag correlations between soil moisture in late summer august and september and winter baseflow particularly in the upper parts of the basins of the lena and aldan rivers the surface soil layers 0 1 m are generally frozen in october as a monthly mean situation while the deeper soil layers remain as a thawed layer until early winter in which unfrozen water could also contribute to winter baseflow the regions in which there was winter baseflow indicated a trend of increase in summer net precipitation fig 5 associated with small values of alt freezing in later months supplementary fig 8 the resultant higher soil moisture in late summer august september fig 6 is likely linked to the increase in baseflow in the cold season fig 7 3 3 source region of winter river discharge the above analytical results indicate that increased summer net precipitation resulted in increase of soil moisture in the active layer in late summer which was connected to the increase in baseflow in the cold season especially in the upper parts of the basins of the lena and aldan rivers these implications were investigated by performing correlation analyses among alt soil moisture and baseflow in the cold season fig 9 fig 9a shows a scatter plot between the linear trends of soil moisture in the active layer and alt during 1979 2016 in the lena river basin additionally visualizing the trend of the autumnal baseflow on their relationship the trend of soil moisture is clearly shown to be almost entirely correlated positively with that of alt as the alt increased the soil moisture correlating to the increased net precipitation increased meanwhile the trend of autumnal baseflow was not homogeneous with the positive relationship between the two variables negative baseflow trends were found at the range of their positive trend however the plots showing positive trend in the baseflow were concentrated in the ranges of the positive trends at 0 2 cm yr 1 for alt and 0 10 mm yr 1 for the soil moisture here a geographical plotting method was used to detect regions presenting positive trends in alt 0 10 cm yr 1 soil moisture 0 1 10 mm yr 1 and autumnal baseflow 0 1 8 mm mth 1 yr 1 fig 9b the regions in which the trends of the three variables were positive were distributed randomly throughout the entire lena river basin especially in the lower northern and upper southern parts of the lena river basin and the aldan river basin these regional distributions suggest that soil moisture in the northern part of the basin where soil freezing occurs relatively early in comparison with southern parts of the basin supplementary fig 8 is linked to autumnal baseflow prior to the freezing of the active layer fig 9c shows a scatter plot of the trend of winter baseflow in the relationship between the linear trends of soil moisture within the active layer and alt the pattern shown in fig 9c is similar to that shown in fig 9a although the trend values of winter baseflow are lower than the autumnal values however some of the winter baseflow showed a strong trend of increase 2 0 mm mth 1 yr 1 in the area of concentrated positive trends fig 9c we also identified regions with positive trends in the three variables fig 9d the regions that showed consistently increasing trends in the three variables were distributed widely in the upper parts of the basins of the lena and aldan rivers where the landscape is underlain by discontinuous permafrost fig 1 and autumnal baseflow is also increased fig 9b this indicates that the increase in winter discharge of the lena river is primarily the result of the increase in winter baseflow in upper parts of the basin to confirm the above model based analysis on the detection of the source region in relation to winter river discharge trend analysis was applied to the observed monthly discharges in the cold season october march observed at 26 river stations in the aldan river basin during 1979 2016 table 1 the months and gauges when rivers freeze up to the bottom and have zero flow every year were excluded from the analysis the analyzed results revealed various regimes of discharge at the stations with positive negative monthly trends supplementary table 1 interestingly statistically significant change in monthly discharge occurred mostly between the mid 1990 s and mid 2000 s this could be associated with the increase in net precipitation in the same period hiyama et al 2016 positive trends were identified in 57 months 45 6 among the total of 125 months of the cold season except those with zero flow caused by complete freeze up of stream water insignificant trends were found in 66 months 52 8 and negative trends were detected in only 2 months 1 6 significant increases in monthly discharge during october january were observed at approximately half of the non frozen gauges in february and march one third of the gauges showed positive trends the regime in which winter discharge recorded positive trends over 3 months or more in the 6 cold months was found at 10 stations table 1 thus this analysis broadly supports the robustness of the model based results presented above 3 4 trend of river ice thickness warming air temperatures likely affect river ice processes i e breakup freeze up and thickness that are closely associated with winter river discharge an increase in river ice thickness means conversion of discharging water to ice and resultant decrease in river discharge although the ice is subsequently added to river discharge in spring conversely a decrease in ice thickness represents a potential contribution to increased river discharge to examine the impact of changing river ice thickness on winter river discharge the river ice volume of the lena river basin was calculated based on model simulated ice thickness and river width and length of individual grids fig 10 displays the trend of the simulated monthly averaged river ice volume of the lena river basin during the study period indicating a trend of decrease in all months the decrease of ice volume was greatest in may which reflects decreased ice growth during the entire winter the decreased ice volume is primarily attributable to the impact of warming air temperatures park et al 2016b shiklomanov and lammers 2014 the increased snow depth is likely to further reinforce the ice thinning trend park et al 2016b 3 5 sensitivity simulations four sensitivity simulations described in section 2 4 were conducted to investigate the influence of the warming climate on hydrological variables increased air temperature induced a baseflow decrease in autumn and winter particularly in the southern mountainous regions fig 11 a b where the baseflow was originally large supplementary fig 6 seasonally the increased air temperature induced strong summer discharge decreases at the two stations especially in june whereas et in the entire lena river basin increased considerably supplementary fig 9 causing soil drying this temperature driven discharge decrease influenced by larger et lasted until autumn these results indicate that when only air temperature increased the lena river discharge decrease was likely caused by higher et in the fourth simulation the precipitation increase likely alleviated the et induced soil drying and offset the river discharge decrease indeed the et induced river discharge decrease in summer was absent from the fourth simulation results but the influence of precipitation on river discharge was visible during the cold season when the absolute et value was low supplementary fig 9 increased precipitation also induced a large spring discharge increase increased air temperature resulted in thinner river ice in the lena river basin as shown by the anomalous simulated ice volumes supplementary fig 9f the ice volume decrease was particularly large in early spring when air temperature was originally warm this indicates that the temperature driven ice volume decrease likely affected the early spring river discharge increase in conjunction with the earlier snowmelt enhanced by the warmer air temperature in autumn and winter the largest ice volume decrease was calculated in the fourth simulation because the precipitation induced snow insulation increase also decreased river ice thickness park et al 2016b 4 discussion 4 1 impact of climate change on winter discharge using observational data and modeling results this study analyzed the trends of seasonal and interannual discharge in the lena river basin focusing particularly on the discharge in the cold season including the implications regarding warming permafrost on changing hydrological processes observational data of soil temperature have indicated warming of permafrost over eastern siberia including the lena river basin fedorov et al 2014b the model simulated alt also showed increasing trends throughout the lena river basin during the study period supplementary fig 5 the increased alt has the physical property of being able to hold much more soil moisture within the active layer thus the active layer water storage capacity increases the alt derived larger storage needs additional net precipitation for saturation of soil moisture in the storage process moisture in the surface soil layers is primarily used for et while simultaneously percolating downward park et al 2021 change simulated increasing trends of summer et in the lena river basin were particularly large in late spring and early summer supplementary fig 2 increasing et enhances soil moisture loss inducing active layer drying the et derived dry soil likely reduces the opportunity for soil moisture in the active layer to be connected to subsurface runoff or baseflow interestingly the monthly trends of river discharge observed at the inner river stations were negative in june and july supplementary fig 1c d despite increasing precipitation supplementary fig 2 these negative trends were probably associated with higher et early summer et in the lena river basin is indeed larger than precipitation park et al 2008 under the increasing air temperature conditions similarly et driven discharge decrease in the lena river basin was amplified supplementary fig 9 larger precipitation could temporarily compensate the et driven soil drying and baseflow decrease as calculated in the fourth simulation supplementary fig 9 the model also simulated increasing trends for autumn et supplementary fig 2 however autumn et values were generally smaller because of lower vegetation activity and lower atmospheric demand park et al 2008 conversely autumn precipitation increased during the study period supplementary fig 2 this larger net precipitation became a source of soil moisture thereby influencing baseflow in autumn fig 9a b and winter fig 9c d these results clearly demonstrate the essential contribution of climate induced precipitation increase to baseflow as illustrated by the clear relationship between net precipitation fig 5 and baseflow fig 7 the warming climate likely alters precipitation regime characteristics for example through a larger rainfall fraction or duration yang et al 2002 2007 higher soil moisture caused by increased precipitation in the warmer autumn season is characterized by higher heat capacity which in turn delays soil freezing in later months thereby lengthening the period of strong correlation between soil moisture and baseflow satellite remote sensing data also indicate delayed freezing of the soil surface in autumn caused by recent global warming effects park et al 2016a while the soil surface begins to freeze snow accumulates on the surface snow water is then completely decoupled from runoff processes occurring in the soil system during the cold season recent climate change resulted in a thicker snow depth in the southern mountainous regions park et al 2015 identified as the source area of increased baseflow fig 9 and in a delayed freezing of the active layer supplementary fig 8 snow cover provides greater insulation that likely delays soil freezing thereby maintaining baseflow however baseflow variations caused by the thicker snow cover have not been fully studied in the context of cold season hydrological processes snow also covers river ice that forms in october or november in the lena river basin this further limits river ice growth during the winter season in conjunction with increasing air temperature park et al 2016b in 1955 2012 climate warming caused a marked thinning of river ice by 73 cm at the kusur station shiklomanov and lammers 2014 yang et al 2002 found a negative correlation r 0 73 between winter streamflow and river ice thickness at the kusur station suggesting that the warming climate induces a decrease in river ice production and an increase in the winter streamflow similarly gurevich 2009 analyzed changes in air temperature river ice thickness and river discharge for 16 monitoring stations in the aldan river basin and reported that winter air temperature was correlated positively with winter discharge warmer winter temperatures weakened the influence of river ice on discharge causing discharge to increase these results suggest that river ice is a key storage component affecting winter streamflow our simulation results also showed a clear thinning of river ice during the cold season over the study period fig 10 implying a contribution of river ice to winter river discharge variations 4 2 impact of permafrost thawing on winter discharge an alt increase is an indicator of permafrost thawing but is not directly related to river discharge however our analysis clearly indicated that the climate induced alt increase was correlated with baseflow increase in the cold season fig 9 this correlation was also influenced by soil water storage in the active layer permafrost is also associated with soil water storage dynamics permafrost below the active layer acts as a barrier that prevents water from percolating deeper thus inflowed water from the surface soil layers eventually accumulates in the soil layers close to the permafrost table stabilizing soil moisture at a high level that can affect baseflow jorgenson et al 2010 in this study we identified the southern mountainous regions as the major baseflow source area during the cold season fig 9b d the southern regions underlain by continuous and discontinuous permafrost were characterized by a thicker active layer in which higher autumn net precipitation fig 5 thus higher soil moisture fig 6 was stored contributing to the baseflow increase fig 7 this finding is generally consistent with recent studies reporting that permafrost thawing is linked to discharge increase during the cold season han and menzel 2022 smith et al 2007 walvoord and striegl 2007 wang et al 2021 through increased groundwater storage within the active layer walvoord and kurylyk 2016 an alt increase is not always concurrent with a baseflow increase for example in the upper parts of the lena river basin around lake baykal the alt is larger than 3 m supplementary fig 5a but lag correlation between interannual variations of monthly soil moisture in the active layer and of winter baseflow is low fig 8 during the study period decreasing trends were calculated for soil moisture in the active layer alt and baseflow in the upper lena river basin around lake baykal during the cold season when the thicker active layer associated with a warmer climate dries inflowed net precipitation is preferentially converted to soil moisture and baseflow decreases this hypothesis was confirmed by comparing the control run with the two sensitivity simulations in which the increased air temperature induced a considerable decrease in autumn and winter baseflow particularly marked in the southern mountainous regions fig 11a b where the baseflow was originally large supplementary fig 6d on the other hand our results indicated regional inconsistency between alt and baseflow trends they clearly showed that an alt increase does not systematically correspond to an increase in soil water storage within the active layer net precipitation affects soil water storage and influences baseflow analyzed net precipitation variations showed considerable regional complexity with a marked increase in the southern mountainous regions fig 5 inducing a baseflow increase fig 7 this suggests that the lena river discharge increase was caused by the combined climate induced effects of localized larger net precipitation and permafrost thawing permafrost is ice rich frozen soil mixed with ground ice such as yedoma and ice wedges warming of permafrost temperature or increasing of the alt likely enhance the melting of ground ice contributing to the wetted active layer in situ observations found thawing of the upper ice rich permafrost following warming of the climate and resultant expansion of thermokarst lakes in tundra liljedahl et al 2016 and boreal forested fedorov et al 2014a ulrich et al 2017 regions within the lena river basin observational data analysis indicated significant correlation between the warming permafrost temperature and increasing river discharge in the cold season in the upper parts of the lena river basin underlain by discontinuous permafrost tananaev et al 2016 and eventually in the aldan river basin underlain by continuous permafrost han and menzel 2022 the observational results suggest a possible contribution to increased baseflow from ground ice melting associated with permafrost warming modeling the change in ground ice is currently beyond the capability of change simulations 4 3 model uncertainty inadequate hydroclimatological data from the lena river basin including lack of actual et and long term permafrost observations limit the scope of analysis of the hydrological response to changes in climate and permafrost in this region this study used the change model to resolve this problem model simulations were conducted using three different atmospheric forcing datasets and the results presented differences in the amounts of simulated river discharge between the forcing datasets as well as in comparison with observations figs 3 and 4 the differences were mainly attributable to the difference in precipitation between the three forcing datasets park et al 2020 although numerous internal feedbacks and the complexity of the change model prevent us from determining clear reasons for its limited performance we discuss here its intrinsic limitations as a one dimensional model change has a rough spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 inappropriate to represent water movements e g lateral flow occurring in the complex mountain topography of the upper lena and aldan river basins where baseflow production is large furthermore the trip2 model used to simulate river discharge is a storage based grid cell wise routing model dependent on spatially effective subgrid parameters these are estimated independently from topographic data and from the model simulated water storage without possibility for parameter tuning based on the observed discharge data slater et al 2007 compared simulations of five land surface models with observations from the four major arctic river basins they established that model hydrographs were often out of phase peaking too early from the spring maximum discharge in terms of model performance simpler hydrological models e g hbv bergström and lindström 2015 occasionally yield comparable agreement with observations however change can reproduce a wide range of physical phenomena particularly for high latitude processes thus it is potentially better adapted to investigate the influence of permafrost on river discharge furthermore simulated alt spatial distribution and trends were comparable for the three forcing datasets despite differences in absolute values supplementary fig 5 the consistency between all simulations indicated satisfactory agreement with observations overall simulation results obtained with the watch forcing dataset do not preclude meaningful analysis of the impacts of changing hydroclimatological processes and permafrost on winter river discharge in the lena river basin 5 conclusions this study focused on the increasing trend in winter river discharge in the lena river basin and examined the impact of global warming induced changes in net precipitation soil moisture alt and baseflow as well as their interrelations based on model simulated results for the 38 year period 1979 2016 net precipitation showed an increasing trend in summer which was especially significant in lower parts of the lena river basin and upper parts of the basins of the lena and aldan rivers resulting in higher soil moisture in the active layer lag correlation analysis between net precipitation and soil moisture exhibited higher positive correlations in the warm season july september in the same regions indicating that net precipitation was stored as soil moisture moreover the maximum values of alt recorded in august and september revealed increasing trends over the entire basin during the study period meaning that the deepened active layer could store more soil moisture trend analyses also identified increasing baseflow in the cold season in lower parts of the lena river basin and in upper parts of the basins of the lena and aldan rivers lag correlation analysis revealed that winter djf baseflow was highly correlated with soil moisture of the previous late summer august and september these results synthetically explain the connectivity of the soil moisture increase associated with global warming which is strongly implicated with net precipitation and the alt to the increase in winter discharge in the lena river basin furthermore warming air temperatures reduced the river ice thickness thereby also contributing to the increase in winter discharge our results revealed that the upper parts of the basins of the lena and aldan rivers are major source areas for the increased winter river discharge which was verified by correlation analyses among the alt soil moisture and baseflow in the cold season interestingly the regions contributing to the increase in autumnal baseflow are located in the lower and upper parts of the lena river basin whereas the contribution to winter baseflow was relatively large in the upper parts of the basins of the lena and aldan rivers that are underlain by continuous and discontinuous permafrost in conclusion the increases in winter river discharge of the lena river could be the result of increased groundwater flow associated with higher storage capacity caused by the deepened active layer and thawing permafrost in the upper parts of the basins of the lena and aldan rivers these results suggest that the contribution of thawing permafrost to winter discharge will further increase under the effects of further climate change however quantitative assessment on the contribution of permafrost sourced water to the increasing discharge remains a subject for future research data availability

2612,the warming climate is likely to increase hurricane associated extreme rainfall and lead to sea level rise slr thus how the floods induced by intense hurricanes respond to these potential changes is of great concern this study investigates the future warmer climate impacts on hurricane induced extreme rainfall and more importantly the subsequent compound flooding at the watershed scale from an event based analysis perspective to this goal a modeling framework is designed based on the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model dhsvm the two dimensional fvand the regional community earth system model r cesm the framework was applied to hurricane harvey 2017 at the clear creek watershed a coastal watershed in the southern houston as a case study the results show that the projected maximum rainfall totals over the watershed would be exacerbated by 17 7 and 49 7 in the 2050s and 2090s respectively under representative concentration pathway 8 5 rcp 8 5 this means a 16 1 increase in harvey rainfall over the watershed per degree celsius increase in mean surface temperature over the gulf of mexico region 18 31 n 77 98 w meanwhile the increases in maximum inundation extent would be 11 0 2050s and 19 5 2090s furthermore considerable increases in maximum inundation depth and duration in regions along the middle and downstream of clear creek and also those around clear lake are expected the projected slr will have little effect on the maximum inundation depth and extent if storm surge changes are not taken into account meanwhile it will influence the inundation duration at downstream locations this modeling framework can be also applied at other coastal watersheds to evaluate the projected climate change impacts on the compound flooding induced by extreme climate events keywords climate change hurricane extreme rainfall coastal watershed inundation modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floods including pluvial fluvial and compound floods caused by intense tropical cyclones tcs pose great threats to coastal watersheds resulting in significant economic losses and fatalities blake and zelinsky 2018 czajkowski et al 2017 hurricane harvey 2017 a category 4 storm on the saffir simpson hurricane scale that made landfall in texas and louisiana in august 2017 was one of the most destructive tcs in united states history blake and zelinsky 2018 wang et al 2018 the houston metropolitan area was among those which received the heaviest precipitation and experienced the severest floods thus bearing severe casualties and damage although some studies project a decrease in the frequency of tcs cha et al 2020 knutson et al 2020 knuston et al 2021 the proportion of intense tcs category 4 5 under global warming is expected to grow stansfield et al 2020 knuston et al 2021 cha et al 2020 changes in tc associated rainfall stansfield et al 2020 knuston et al 2021 and the projected sea level rise slr under global warming might have considerable impacts on floods induced by tcs ghanbari et al 2021 substantial progress has been achieved with regard to our understanding of anthropogenic warming in tcs in recent years thanks to development in high resolution grid spacing smaller than 25 km climate models and earth system models davis 2018 roberts et al 2020 existing studies indicate that tc associated rainfall will increase in general caused by climate change liu et al 2018 stansfield et al 2020 roberts et al 2020 however the level of increase is of large uncertainty stansfield et al 2020 a study using the geophysical fluid dynamic laboratory gfdl hurricane model indicated that the storm relative rainfall intensity knustson et al 2022 for us landing tcs will increase by 18 on average under late 21st century conditions and the rainfall for major category 3 5 hurricanes will increase even more 37 knustson et al 2022 significant increases in tc associated rainfall rates under climate change deserve our attention for their direct but non linear impacts on flooding bermudez et al 2021 in addition climate change also leads to slr with spatial variation around the world horton et al 2018 balaguru et al 2016 demonstrated that the slr combined with projected changes in hurricane intensity would lead to a 25 to 47 increase in storm surge along the gulf of mexico and florida coasts miller and shirzaei 2021 indicated that projected slr when in isolation only slightly affects future flood related hazards for southeastern texas however both studies examine the floods from the perspective of coastal drivers rather than inland drivers i e heavy rainfall and high river discharge case studies investigating compound flooding associated with both slr and heavy rainfall indicate that slr might play a considerable role in exacerbating compound flooding in some coastal regions pasquier et al 2019 rahimi et al 2020 woodruff et al 2013 therefore more studies are required to examine the combined impacts of increased hurricane induced rainfall and slr on extreme flooding events under global warming changes in extreme tcs might be more pronounced than those of common tcs from this perspective event attribution studies which investigate the extent to which anthropogenic climate change may contribute to an individual weather or climate event have been carried out for specific extreme events including hurricane harvey 2017 wang et al 2018 risser and wehner 2017 reed et al 2020 national academy of sciences 2016 similarly numerical studies have also been conducted to project the anthropogenic influences on weather extremes in future warmer climates for example lackmann 2015 suggested a stronger hurricane sandy in terms of both enhanced storm intensity and heavier rainfall if it were to occur under the thermodynamics conditions in the end of 21st century liu et al 2020 investigated the response of rainfall rates of hurricane irene 2011 to future climate change based on three pseudo global warming pgw see details in section 2 2 1 simulations using the weather research and forecasting wrf model and results showed that anthropogenic climate change would have increased the storm s rainfall by 32 by the end of the 21st century however they did not examine how these projected changes in rainfall might affect the flooding especially at a watershed scale where flood risk management is typically carried out considering the issues discussed above the goal of this research is to investigate the future climate change impacts on extreme rainfall and more importantly the subsequent flooding during a tc event at the watershed scale evaluating climate change impacts on flooding at the watershed scale is helpful to both flood management and climate adaptation joyce et al 2018 pasquier et al 2019 sun et al 2021 however process based flood simulation involves coupling various atmospheric hydrologic and hydraulic models which involves many complicated tasks additionally high computational costs for model calibration and scenario simulations are still among the challenges regarding high resolution modeling dullo et al 2021 moreover tcs occur at a much larger spatial scale than a watershed at which flood management practices are typically carried out the rainfall rates over a watershed can be different if a tc of the same magnitude occurs under the same climate conditions due to some slight differences in the track or the spatial distribution of the rainfall li et al 2020 regier et al 2021 even if two sets of simulated tc rainfall fields over a watershed under two climate conditions were obtained some of the differences could be attributed to factors other than climate change therefore high uncertainty which exists in key aspects of any given tc event including the cyclone track the spatial pattern of rainfall and others hinders our understanding of the climate change impacts on tc associated rainfall and the subsequent flooding at a watershed scale considering the issues discussed above the aim of this research is to investigate the future climate change impacts on extreme rainfall and more importantly subsequent flooding during a particular tc event at a watershed scale in this project a modeling framework was applied to hurricane harvey at the clear creek watershed in the southern houston texas specifically flood simulations based on offline coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic modeling were validated against gauge data at the coastal watershed furthermore we performed control hindcast simulations of harvey with a 7 ensemble member using a high resolution regional earth system model then two more sets of idealized simulations were conducted which assumed that harvey occurred in the middle 2050 2059 and end 2090 2099 of the 21st century under the representative concentration pathway 8 5 rcp 8 5 scenario using a pgw approach the impacts of climate change on harvey induced rainfall were evaluated by comparing the mean values of the projected heaviest rainfall rates in each ensemble member brought on by three simulated hurricane ensembles namely 2017 the 2050s and the 2090s finally the subsequent impacts on harvey induced flooding were assessed by comparing the inundation simulation results driven by the simulated rainfalls under 2017 2050s and 2090s climate conditions with the projected slr considered 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area the clear creek watershed in south houston is a coastal watershed that drains into galveston bay fig 1 this 677 km2 watershed is home to a population of roughly 300 000 people bass and bedient 2018 with fast population growth 68 of this watershed has been covered by impervious urban area based on the national land cover dataset 2016 the land surface elevation ranges from 0 7 to 39 3 m within the watershed a broad and plain floodplain is distributed along the upstream portion which makes large topographic areas readily subjected to flooding along the channel towards clear lake the floodplain becomes narrower and has greater slopes that confine flood waters to the creek which is not favorable to flood drainage usace 2012 the soil texture is mainly clay in the watershed with low infiltrability furthermore as a coastal watershed it is vulnerable to storm surge with the factors mentioned above flooding has been the primary natural disaster of concern for this watershed unprecedented water surface elevations and discharge rates were recorded at the united states geological survey usgs gauges within the watershed during hurricane harvey 2017 this was mainly caused by the heavy rainfall the accumulated rainfall over the watershed during hurricane harvey exceeded 1000 mm according to the ncep st iv quantitative precipitation estimate st iv qpe see details in appendix text 1 the record breaking rainfall was partly attributed to the fact that hurricane harvey followed a meandering path and moved slowly after it made its landfall exacerbating the flooding however the storm surge at the galveston bay during harvey was not high bass et al 2018 according to a national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa tide gauge eagle point 8771013 the harvey induced storm surge height the height gap between the verified and predicted sea water levels was no more than 1 25 m i e the highest sea level during harvey was 1 25 m above the mean sea level this extreme hurricane during which heavy rainfall rather than storm surge dominated the severe flooding provides an ideal case for examining the response of flooding to the changes in extreme tc associated rainfall 2 2 method the single event based deterministic approach was adopted in this research based on offline coupling between a hydrological model and a hydrodynamic model the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model dhsvm was used to simulate the hydrological processes wigmosta et al 1994 cuo et al 2008 then the two dimensional runoff inundation toolkit for operational needs triton was used to simulate the hydraulic processes morales hernandez et al 2021 a newly developed high resolution regional earth system model the regional community earth system model r cesm fu et al 2021 was deployed to perform three ensembles of hurricane harvey simulations in 3 km horizontal resolution under 2017 climate conditions and under two sets of rcp 8 5 future climate conditions the 2050s and 2090s each ensemble consists of 7 members dhsvm and triton simulations driven by rainfalls obtained from r cesm harvey simulations after bias correction were used to convert the projected rainfall changes into flood inundation changes in order to test the influences of slr on the future projections of harvey induced flooding we carried out twin experiments that either included or excluded the projected slr in the triton simulations storm surge did not play an important role in hurricane harvey induced flooding therefore the potential changes in storm induced surge amplitude and timing were not taken into account in this study our study specifically focuses on climate change impacts on extreme storm precipitation driven flooding with projected slr considered future work with compounded storm surge requires addressing additional technical challenges which are discussed in section 2 2 1 the flowchart of the modeling framework is illustrated in fig 2 2 2 1 earth system modeling the climate change impacts on rainfall were evaluated based on numerical experiments using the pgw approach lackmann 2015 patricola and wehner 2018 liu et al 2020 r cesm was used to simulate hurricane harvey under the climate conditions in 2017 mid 21st century 2050 2059 and late 21st century 2090 2099 r cesm is based on the latest infrastructure of the community earth system model version 2 cesm2 and its common infrastructure for modeling the earth cime framework additionally it incorporates the weather research and forecasting wrf skamarock et al 2008 model version 3 5 1 and the regional ocean modeling system roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 as regional components r cesm shows remarkable fidelity in reproducing the observed tc intensity for some tc cases more details about the model can be found in fu et al 2021 first we performed control hindcast simulations of harvey under 2017 conditions the initial and boundary conditions were derived from era5 reanalysis data hersbach et al 2020 and a 7 member ensemble was generated using the stochastic kinetic energy backscatter skeb scheme shutts 2005 we then performed the pgw experiments as if hurricane harvey were to occur in the 2050s and 2090s under rcp8 5 scenario the high resolution community earth system model cesm transient climate simulations chang et al 2020 under rcp 8 5 scenarios were adopted projected differences of the cesm simulated thermodynamic variables between 2050 and 2059 and 2090 2099 august climatology and 2017 august climatology in august were then added to historical era5 estimates these modified era5 estimates served as initial and boundary conditions for the r cesm model to simulate harvey in the pgw experiments although the r cesm shows a high fidelity in reproducing many key aspects including rainfall wind speed etc of hurricane harvey see fig a3 it is not possible to reproduce exactly the same hurricane as observed these biases do not deviate from our understanding of the impacts on the rainfall totals from the hurricane reed et al 2020 but may significantly affect our evaluation of the rainfall at the watershed scale therefore hurricane track bias correction was carried out for each simulation to minimize the impacts on rainfall distribution from simulated and observed tc tracks the simulated harvey tracks were remapped onto the observed harvey track using a one to one grid point vector approach at each instant the precipitation field was displaced by an amount equal to the difference between the simulated storm location and the actual storm location for example at time t0 if the observed tc center location is latobs lonobs while the simulated tc center location is detected at latsim lonsim we artificially shift the entire model domain with a vector of latobs latsim lonobs lonsim thus the simulated tc center is always ascertained in align with the observation while maintaining the rainfall spatial pattern relative to the storm core then it was assumed that the watershed would receive the heaviest rainfall during the hurricane under each scenario to realize this the rainfall fields were relocated such that the total rainfall over the watershed would reach the maximum value for each ensemble member thus canceling out the noise from the spatial pattern of the rainfall see details in appendix text 3 lastly the hourly rainfall outputs from the r cesm model after hurricane track bias correction and rainfall field relocation were used to drive the dhsvm model for hydrological simulations it is worth noting that such high resolution modeling is computationally expensive specifically it takes 480 cpu cores about 4 h to finish one r cesm ensemble member modeling run we have 3 7 ensemble members in total more than 40 k cpu hours 2 2 2 hydrological modeling dhsvm is a physics based distributed hydrological model in high resolution which has been updated to enable the simulation of hydrological processes in watersheds with urban land cover cuo et al 2008 the hydrological model used in the study area was established in 40 m and hourly resolutions the most important input for the simulation is rainfall which is represented by st iv qpe the 3dep 1 3 arc second approximately 10 m elevation product sugarbaker et al 2017 was resampled to 40 m for setting up the dhsvm model national land cover database nlcd 2016 products homer et al 2016 were adopted to represent the current land cover conditions the soil texture data were taken from the soil survey geographic database nauman et al 2018 meteorological forcings other than rainfall came from the north america land data assimilation system nldas xia et al 2012 a 6 month spin up simulation was used to provide reasonable initial conditions for the flood event there are only two usgs gauges that measure the stream discharge rates across the watershed usgs 08 076 997 and usgs 08077600 with a flat topographic slope the area upstream of the watershed is not well drained and surface water can be ponded winter 2012 because of the shallow channel the flows during major floods might also move across the tributary drainage areas as indicated by the wide inundation area of the fema 1 floodplain map federal emergency management agency 2022 thus the assumption that all of the runoff generated over each grid cell will be drained through the associated stream network in the hydrologic model is violated this makes the streamflow during the flood event at gauge 08 076 997 overestimated in hydrologic model based simulations accordingly only the streamflow records at gauge 08 077 600 were used for model calibration 2 2 3 hydrodynamic modeling triton was developed to leverage the multi gpu architecture of modern high performance computers hpc for accelerated inundation modeling morales hernández et al 2021 it solves the full 2d shallow water equations with source terms using an explicit numerical scheme to better simulate the pluvial flooding brought on by the heavy rainfall runoff input for all of the grids within the study area instead of streamflow input for selected stream nodes was adopted for the hydrodynamic modeling procedures to extract the effective rainfall from dhsvm outputs are detailed in appendix text 2 the triton setup for the clear creek watershed included a 20 m resolution dem resampled from the 1 3 arc second usgs national elevation dataset sugarbaker et al 2017 and a spatially varied manning s roughness coefficient kalyanapu et al 2009 we removed some elevated roads and bridges above river channels on the dem to avoid their impacts on the flow simulation in some of the streams such that flows can go through the river channel below the bridge dullo et al 2021 the spatial resolution of 20 m was selected to represent the topography to a sufficiently accurate extent at reasonable computational costs the triton model extent includes 3 6 million grid cells 2462 columns 1454 rows for the study domain the north west and south boundaries were set with a zero gradient type 0 external boundary condition while a level versus time condition was imposed for the segments over galveston bay at the east boundary the gauged sea water level at the outlet of the watershed kemah usgs gauge 08 077 637 seaward was taken as the water level at the boundary segments intersecting with galveston bay the projected slr is based on a probabilistic projection kopp et al 2014 this projection has also been adopted by researchers evaluating climate change impacts on hurricane flood hazards marsooli et al 2019 the projected slr median values at galveston texas under rcp 8 5 is 0 52 m in the 2050 s and 1 23 m in 2100 as compared to the year 2000 these projected slr values are very close to the values produced by the ipcc ar6 sea level rise projections garner et al 2021 fox kemper et al 2021 garner et al n d the projected slr at galveston pier 21 texas under ssp5 8 5 which is a shared socioeconomic pathway that largely analogous to rcp 8 5 before 2100 is 0 50 m in 2050 and 1 29 m in 2100 as compared to the baseline 1995 2014 garner et al 2021 because the baseline is a period before hurricane harvey 2017 the projected slr was shifted based on the nearest projection i e 0 17 m in 2030 with a linear trend assumed between 2000 and 2030 the projected slr relative to the level in 2017 is thus 0 36 m in 2050 and 1 07 m in 2100 under rcp 8 5 different manning s roughness coefficient values were specified for different land covers dullo et al 2021 first the values from kalyanapu et al 2009 were adopted as the initial values of the manning s roughness coefficient in the input then these values were adjusted to match the simulated water surface elevation and the observations from the harris county flood control district hcfcd flood warming system fws to provide an initial condition for the simulation a virtual rainfall event of total rainfall depth ranging from 30 to 70 mm for different divisions was added at the first day of a 10 day duration spin up virtual rainfall events provide baseflows for the channels and for clear lake before hurricane harvey although this does not provide an accurate initial condition for the study domain the uncertainty introduced by the initial conditions would not impact the flood simulation significantly given the extremely large magnitude of the harvey floods albeit triton runs with a dynamic time step size that depends on the flow conditions outputs were aggregated to an hourly interval the simulations were conducted on the grace high performance computer managed by texas a m high performance research computing group hprc https hprc tamu edu wiki grace specifically it takes 24 cpu cores about 16 h to accomplish a triton based hydrodynamic simulation for the clear creek watershed although triton can provide even more speed up through gpu acceleration morales hernández et al 2021 the gpu implementation was not explored in this study triton based maximum inundation depth maps for each individual scenario were processed cell by cell the maximum inundation depth mid for each grid cell is the maximum value of inundation depth across the flooding event for each ensemble there are 7 maximum inundation maps corresponding to each ensemble member the average maximum inundation depths afid were obtained by calculating the average inundation depths for each grid cell and for the 2017 ensemble the 2050s ensemble and the 2090s ensemble the changes in mid were evaluated by comparing the amid in 2017 and the 2050s and in 2017 and the 2090s in addition a depth range was also calculated the gap between the largest value and the smallest value of the maximum inundation depth for each grid cell in each ensemble indicating the uncertainty in inundation depth associated with the rainfall uncertainty the peak inundation time pit is the time point since the simulation start in this study aug 25 00 00 with the largest mean hourly inundation depth throughout the event larger or smaller than 0 3 given the heavy rainfall during harvey the watershed was wet almost everywhere we selected a threshold to classify whether a grid cell as inundated or not which was 0 3 m as described by kramer et al 2016 and dao et al 2022 the flood inundation extent fie is the total area of the set of grid cells whose mid was no less than 0 3 m in addition the flood inundation duration fid for each grid was the number of hourly time steps with an inundation depth no less than 0 3 m 3 results 3 1 hydrological and hydrodynamic model calibration 3 1 1 hydrological model calibration the dhsvm model was calibrated to the tropical storm allison 2001 during which heavy rainfall 468 mm over the clear creek watershed occurred in combination with a relatively weak storm surge storm surge height no more than 0 87 m with the highest sea level being 1 01 m above the mean sea level at the nearest noaa tide gage since the st iv data were not available until 2002 the rainfall of the tropical storm allison 2001 event is based on gauge data from the harris county flood warning system https www harriscountyfws org key soil parameters including porosity field capacity wilting point vertical conductivity and lateral conductivity and vegetation parameters including maximum and minimum resistance vapor pressure deficit and root zone depths were adjusted with reference to calibrated parameters in nearby watersheds li et al 2020 the r2 nse peak bias and mean bias of the simulated streamflow against the usgs gauge data is 0 95 0 84 3 49 and 18 12 respectively fig 3 a the calibrated dhsvm model was used to simulate the hydrologic processes of the study area during hurricane harvey the r2 nse peak bias and mean bias of simulated streamflow is 0 96 0 83 25 30 and 25 40 respectively fig 3b high values of r2 and nse measurements were achieved for model calibration and validation while a negative mean bias was noticed in both events in addition a slightly positive bias was observed in the flood peak of tropical storm allison but a negative bias occurred in the flood peak of hurricane harvey while our simulation errors are unavoidable the peak bias and relative biases are also partially attributed to the errors uncertainties of the gage data fuentes andina et al 2017 a more detailed discussion about the simulation bias is presented in appendix text 4 considering the factors associated with the modeling bias the model shows an acceptable level of performance with regard to its simulation of the extreme flood event at the watershed this is further verified by the acceptable performance of the hydrodynamic modeling which is based on the effective rainfall inputs from the hydrological modeling 3 1 2 hydrodynamic model calibration the simulated peak values of water surface elevations matched the observations from hcfcd well as fig 4 indicates moreover simulated temporal dynamics of the water surface elevations coincided with the observed temporal changes of the water surface elevations at the gauges across the watershed fig 5 simulation biases exist in regard to two aspects the first is that the simulation underestimated the first peak at some of the mainstream gauges i e gauge 110 and 120 and the other is that the model seems to present a slower process of flood retreat than the actual flood retreat especially at some of the gauges in the rainfall storm surge interaction and the storm surge zones such as gauges 200 610 and 100 furthermore the locations of fema property claims were used to verify the spatial pattern of the inundation simulation results fig 6 a visual inspection determined that most of the claims fell into the simulated urban inundation area 68 9 of the claims were within the inundated grid cells the area with the most crowded set of claims is the turkey creek sub watershed which is an area that experienced deep inundation in our simulation the simulation also captured the large area of inundation in upstream regions indicating that the runoff input for triton satisfied the simulation for pluvial flooding one reason for the bias in the simulation might be the temporarily varying roughness of the land surface we assigned manning s coefficient for each land use type kalyanapu et al 2009 representing its roughness level and thus its impacts on the flow these were adjusted to lower values during calibration and the roughness is much higher for other land use types than it is for open water area meanwhile due to the extraordinary magnitude of the floods considerable parts of the land were inundated with water and turned into open water temporarily therefore the water drainage is faster than what the simulation indicates in which the roughness is always of some constant specified value another reason relates to how the boundary conditions were handled the level versus time boundary is specified for the eastern boundary to represent the impacts from the storm surge this might introduce some errors given that water level is not the only factor deciding the storm volume 3 2 climate change impacts on rainfall and flooding 3 2 1 projected changes in rainfall fig 7 illustrates significant increases in the potential maximum rainfall over the watershed the hindcasted maximum harvey rainfall totals over the watershed under the 2017 climate conditions range from 946 mm to 1326 mm the projected maximum harvey rainfall totals under the 2050 s climate conditions range from 1082 mm to 1590 mm and range from 1499 mm to 2069 mm under the 2090 s climate conditions the mean values increased from 1138 mm standard error 46 mm 90 confidence interval from 1041 mm to 1235 mm to 1339 mm standard error 73 mm 90 confidence interval from 1185 mm to 1492 mm in the 2050 s and to 1703 mm standard error 71 mm 90 confidence interval from 1553 mm to 1853 mm in the 2090 s by 17 7 and 49 7 respectively the projected increment of the mean surface temperature mst over the gulf of mexico region 18 31 n 77 98 w is 1 07 c in the 2050 s and 3 09 c in the 2090 s therefore the projected increase in rainfall totals per degree c increase in mst is 183 fig 5 13b standard error 31 mm 90 confidence interval was estimated to be from 125 mm to 254 mm this means a 16 1 standard error 2 7 and a 90 confidence interval 10 9 22 2 increase in harvey rainfall totals over the watershed per degree increase in mst 3 2 2 projected changes in maximum flood inundation the subsequent changes in flooding were examined with regard to four aspects flood inundation extent fie maximum inundation depth mid flood inundation duration fid and peak inundation time the fie ranges from 309 99 km2 to 365 33 km2 under the 2017 climate condition the average of fie afie is 336 49 km2 49 7 of the watershed area with the 90 confidence interval being from 322 41 km2 to 350 57 km2 meanwhile the deepest inundation occurred along with the middle portion of the mainstream of clear creek except for some small ponding areas fig 8 a the range of inundation depths for each grid cell under the 7 ensemble scenarios over the watershed is relatively small in most areas fig 8b the primary area with a depth range over 0 5 m is mainly distributed along the downstream portion of clear creek as well as within the armond bayou and the taylor bayou this is also true for the results of the 2050s and the 2090s fig a7 the fie ranges from 289 66 km2 to 407 14 km2 under the 2050s climate conditions and from 380 11 km2 to 435 40 km2 under the 2090s climate conditions the afie would be 373 34 km2 55 1 of the watershed area under the 2050s climate conditions with the 90 confidence interval from 345 67 km2 to 401 01 km2 under climate conditions of the 2090s it would be 401 99 km2 59 3 of the watershed area with the 90 confidence interval from 389 09 km2 to 414 89 km2 as compared with the 2017 climate conditions the afie would increase by 11 0 and 19 5 respectively fig 9 a specifically in urban regions the mean value of inundation area would be 208 3 km2 90 confidence interval from 196 6 km2 to 219 9 km2 in 2017 and it would increase to 234 0 km2 in the 2050s 90 confidence interval from 211 2 km2 to 256 7 km2 and to 253 5 km2 in the 2090s 90 confidence interval from 242 3 km2 to 264 7 km2 increases of 12 3 and 21 7 respectively fig 9b when compared with the high percentage values of the rainfall increases the increases in inundation extent tend to be lower an approximately 50 increase in rainfall would lead to a roughly 20 increase in inundation extent this indicates a non linear relationship between the rainfall and the inundation extent fig 9c not only is the flood inundation extent projected to increase in the future but also the inundation depth the areas with maximum inundation depths between 0 3 m and 2 m would increase notably fig 9d the area along the downstream portion of clear creek upstream of clear lake would demonstrate the largest increases in inundation depth in both the 2050s and 2090s fig 10 a and b observable increases in inundation depth are also projected to occur downstream of the armond bayou in the 2090s besides the increase in inundation extent fie the mid would also observe increases in the 2050s and 2090s the area with an amid below 0 3 m will decrease significantly while those with amid values between 0 3 m and 2 m will increase significantly fig 9d the area along the downstream portion of clear creek upstream of clear lake will observe the largest increases in amid in both the 2050s and 2090s fig 10a and b additionally observable increases in amid are also projected to occur downstream of the armond bayou in the 2090s in addition changes were observed in inundation duration and peaking time inundation duration time will increase in the future and the increase will be much more pronounced in the 2090s fig 10a and b meanwhile the trends with regard to peak time differed in different regions nevertheless the peak time tends to shift to an earlier period in the areas subjected to the deepest inundation including the midstream portion of clear creek and the mud gully and turkey creek sub watersheds 3 2 3 impacts from the slr the projected slr would not affect the maximum inundation extent or depth observably especially for the situation in the 2050s to examine the impacts from the projected slr the 2050s ensemble scenarios and the 2090s ensemble scenarios were simulated without the projected slr the average maximum inundation extent would be almost the same when no projected slr takes place 373 21 km2 vs 373 34 km2 and 401 19 km2 vs 401 99 km2 in the 2050s and 2090s respectively as compared to the results without the projected slr only a slight increase in the maximum inundation depth would occur in some regions near the outlet in the 2090s with slr fig 11 b this is probably because the extraordinary rainfall dominates the flood peak during harvey and its future counterparts so the projected slr as a boundary condition would hardly affect the maximum inundation depth map this coincides with the findings of existing literature recognizing the role of climate change effects in river discharge versus slr in compound flooding bermudez et al 2021 however observable changes might occur in the inundation duration in some regions downstream of clear creek and the tributaries draining into clear lake fig 11c and d the peak time will shift to earlier periods in the regions around the outlet in the 2090s fig 11f to examine whether the projected slr affected the flooding processes in addition to the maximum inundation depth we compared simulated water level dynamics at four water level gauges under one of the ensemble member scenarios with and without projected slr in the 2050s and 2090s fig 12 the relatively smaller flood peaks during aug 27 and aug 28 before the highest flood peak would be enhanced with the projected slr especially for the locations closer to the river outlet such as gauge 200 therefore the impacts from slr on less extreme flooding events still deserve our attention especially for the areas close to the river outlet and along the coastline pasquier et al 2019 rahimi et al 2020 4 discussion projected increases in rainfall are significant 17 7 and 49 7 especially given that the harvey rainfall was so heavy this is consistent with the knowledge that the future climate change impacts on rainfall increase rates of major hurricanes category 3 5 are expected to be 36 8 which is higher than the average level for all hurricanes 25 8 in the late 21st century supplemental material of knustson et al 2022 similarly according to liu et al 2020 the rainfall of hurricane irene category 3 2011 is projected to increase by 32 0 at the end of the 21st century moreover rainfall is subjected to uncertain spatial distribution over the watershed for example see the spatial distribution of the two simulated rainfall fields shown in fig a2c and d in comparison the projected increases in inundation depth are more consistent in different scenarios in the future fig 9 which reveals the constraints from the topography on the flood inundation the low lying areas are always prone to flooding and deserve most attention despite the spatial variability of rainfall the trend with regard to inundation duration changes can also be informative even though we are not fully confident with the specific values of simulated inundation durations inundation in the downstream areas did not recede to the level before the event until the end of the simulation sep 3rd fig 5 which was not the case during the real hurricane harvey floods the triton model seems to produce a slower recession process than the ground truth similar to simulations based on other models such as hec ras winter 2012 however if we just focus on the trends of the changes earlier peaking and longer inundation duration should be observed in the regions along the stream network where the deepest inundation depths also occurred meanwhile inundation duration and peak inundation time can be affected by the lag between the rainfall peak and the surge dynamics which were not taken into account in this study besides the projected slr future climate change will also have impacts on storm surge which was not taken into account in this study due to its high uncertainty camelo et al 2020 however the existing literature indicates that storm surge tends to exacerbate flooding with larger surge volumes expected in the future bass et al 2018 balaguru et al 2016 since the storm surge is subjected to a larger height range and can be much higher than the projected slr bass et al 2018 these potential impacts should not be overlooked with regard to future flood management in the coastal regions based on liner regression results from historical observations surge heights in galveston bay increase by 0 074 m per 1 ms 1 increase in hurricane wind speed trepanier et al 2015 if this applies to hurricane harvey the increase in surge height could be over 1 8 m under the 2090s climate conditions given the significant projected increase in wind speed this increase in surge height when combined with slr should significantly affect the inundation since the peak sea level over 4 m would exceed land surface elevations in large portions of the coastal region for extreme events such as harvey key variables are subject to scarce data availability and large uncertainties in the measurements bass and bedient 2018 fuentes andina et al 2017 for instance streamflow gage data may be of high uncertainty when the streamflow rate magnitude reaches high while water level gage data especially complete time series are scarce this introduces additional difficulties in model calibration and validation for extreme flood simulations impacts from wind and infrastructure including the pipe network on the hydrodynamics were not considered in the triton model moreover increasing air temperatures might lead to different initial soil moisture conditions for the flooding events under climate change sharma et al 2018 however for extreme flooding events such as hurricane harvey initial soil moisture tends to have little impact on extreme events like hurricane harvey li et al 2020 future changes in river morphology and land uses were also not considered since these are outside of the scope of this research the framework adopted in this study is an extension of the pseudo global warming pgw approach which has been widely used for investigating the climate change impacts on tropical cyclone tc intensity and rainfall amount one important point of this numerical modeling scheme is that it extends the climate change impact evaluations from the hurricane induced rainfall lackmann 2015 liu et al 2020 to its subsequent flooding at a watershed scale the state of the art modeling framework adopted in this study shows satisfactory performance with regard to simulating very extreme rainfall and the resulting flood response moreover applying the possible maximum rainfall to the same watershed avoids the massive number of hydrologic hydrodynamic simulations that otherwise would be needed the presented modeling framework is applicable to other coastal watersheds to identify the nature of the changing risk from extreme events however it should be mentioned that the conclusions in this study are drawn from simulations of extreme flooding during hurricane harvey while this is an ideal case for our understanding of the effects of future climate changes on extreme flooding induced by intense hurricanes the conclusions should not be extended to floods of much smaller magnitudes for instance the projected slr might play an important role in the maximum inundation depth at locations near the river outlet in those less extreme floods in addition this study did not take into account future climate change impacts on storm surge which is of high uncertainty it is challenging to perform the necessary storm surge simulations given that the storm displacements necessary for centering the heavy rain over the watershed would have made the hurricane wind fields incompatible with the location of the coastline 5 conclusion in this study a modeling framework based on three high resolution and physics based models was developed to investigate future climate change impacts on tc associated rainfall and subsequent flooding at a watershed scale with projected slr considered rainfall fields brought on by future versions of an extreme hurricane event were simulated via a pgw approach based on r cesm modeling flooding was simulated through offline coupling between dhsvm and triton a case study was carried out at the clear creek watershed in texas in the context of hurricane harvey based on our findings the potential maximum rainfall over the watershed will increase by 17 7 and 49 7 under rcp 8 5 in the 2050s and 2090s respectively this means about a 16 1 increase in rainfall per degree celsius increase of the mean surface temperature over the gulf of mexico region 18 31 n 77 98 w due to rainfall changes the subsequent increase in maximum inundation extent would be relatively lower being 11 0 and 19 5 12 3 and 21 7 in urban inundation area moreover the considerable increases may occur in maximum inundation depths despite the spatial variations of rainfall the low lying areas along the middle and downstream of clear creek and its tributaries may be the most vulnerable areas with regard to the future increase in inundation depth based on our assessment the projected slr should hardly affect the maximum inundation depth and extent it should only enhance the water surface elevations before the flood peaks in the downstream areas and extend the inundation durations faced with the increasing risk of high category hurricanes it is imperative to provide more accurate early flood warning the study focused on the global warming induced changes to the hurricane harvey rainfall and its subsequent impacts on the flooding future work includes representing its impacts on storm surge amplitude and timing in addition global warming may lead more changes regarding aspects of storm motion and storm likelihood which also deserves our attention for climate impact assessment and adaptation credit authorship contribution statement xudong li conceptualization methodology investigation

2612,the warming climate is likely to increase hurricane associated extreme rainfall and lead to sea level rise slr thus how the floods induced by intense hurricanes respond to these potential changes is of great concern this study investigates the future warmer climate impacts on hurricane induced extreme rainfall and more importantly the subsequent compound flooding at the watershed scale from an event based analysis perspective to this goal a modeling framework is designed based on the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model dhsvm the two dimensional fvand the regional community earth system model r cesm the framework was applied to hurricane harvey 2017 at the clear creek watershed a coastal watershed in the southern houston as a case study the results show that the projected maximum rainfall totals over the watershed would be exacerbated by 17 7 and 49 7 in the 2050s and 2090s respectively under representative concentration pathway 8 5 rcp 8 5 this means a 16 1 increase in harvey rainfall over the watershed per degree celsius increase in mean surface temperature over the gulf of mexico region 18 31 n 77 98 w meanwhile the increases in maximum inundation extent would be 11 0 2050s and 19 5 2090s furthermore considerable increases in maximum inundation depth and duration in regions along the middle and downstream of clear creek and also those around clear lake are expected the projected slr will have little effect on the maximum inundation depth and extent if storm surge changes are not taken into account meanwhile it will influence the inundation duration at downstream locations this modeling framework can be also applied at other coastal watersheds to evaluate the projected climate change impacts on the compound flooding induced by extreme climate events

blake and zelinsky 2018 wang et al 2018 the houston metropolitan area was among those which received the heaviest precipitation and experienced the severest floods thus bearing severe casualties and damage although some studies project a decrease in the frequency of tcs cha et al 2020 knutson et al 2020 knuston et al 2021 the proportion of intense tcs category 4 5 under global warming is expected to grow stansfield et al 2020 knuston et al 2021 cha et al 2020 changes in tc associated rainfall stansfield et al 2020 knuston et al 2021 and the projected sea level rise slr under global warming might have considerable impacts on floods induced by tcs ghanbari et al 2021 substantial progress has been achieved with regard to our understanding of anthropogenic warming in tcs in recent years thanks to development in high resolution grid spacing smaller than 25 km climate models and earth system models davis 2018 roberts et al 2020 existing studies indicate that tc associated rainfall will increase in general caused by climate change liu et al 2018 stansfield et al 2020 roberts et al 2020 however the level of increase is of large uncertainty stansfield et al 2020 a study using the geophysical fluid dynamic laboratory gfdl hurricane model indicated that the storm relative rainfall intensity knustson et al 2022 for us landing tcs will increase by 18 on average under late 21st century conditions and the rainfall for major category 3 5 hurricanes will increase even more 37 knustson et al 2022 significant increases in tc associated rainfall rates under climate change deserve our attention for their direct but non linear impacts on flooding bermudez et al 2021 in addition climate change also leads to slr with spatial variation around the world horton et al 2018 balaguru et al 2016 demonstrated that the slr combined with projected changes in hurricane intensity would lead to a 25 to 47 increase in storm surge along the gulf of mexico and florida coasts miller and shirzaei 2021 indicated that projected slr when in isolation only slightly affects future flood related hazards for southeastern texas however both studies examine the floods from the perspective of coastal drivers rather than inland drivers i e heavy rainfall and high river discharge case studies investigating compound flooding associated with both slr and heavy rainfall indicate that slr might play a considerable role in exacerbating compound flooding in some coastal regions pasquier et al 2019 rahimi et al 2020 woodruff et al 2013 therefore more studies are required to examine the combined impacts of increased hurricane induced rainfall and slr on extreme flooding events under global warming changes in extreme tcs might be more pronounced than those of common tcs from this perspective event attribution studies which investigate the extent to which anthropogenic climate change may contribute to an individual weather or climate event have been carried out for specific extreme events including hurricane harvey 2017 wang et al 2018 risser and wehner 2017 reed et al 2020 national academy of sciences 2016 similarly numerical studies have also been conducted to project the anthropogenic influences on weather extremes in future warmer climates for example lackmann 2015 suggested a stronger hurricane sandy in terms of both enhanced storm intensity and heavier rainfall if it were to occur under the thermodynamics conditions in the end of 21st century liu et al 2020 investigated the response of rainfall rates of hurricane irene 2011 to future climate change based on three pseudo global warming pgw see details in section 2 2 1 simulations using the weather research and forecasting wrf model and results showed that anthropogenic climate change would have increased the storm s rainfall by 32 by the end of the 21st century however they did not examine how these projected changes in rainfall might affect the flooding especially at a watershed scale where flood risk management is typically carried out considering the issues discussed above the goal of this research is to investigate the future climate change impacts on extreme rainfall and more importantly the subsequent flooding during a tc event at the watershed scale evaluating climate change impacts on flooding at the watershed scale is helpful to both flood management and climate adaptation joyce et al 2018 pasquier et al 2019 sun et al 2021 however process based flood simulation involves coupling various atmospheric hydrologic and hydraulic models which involves many complicated tasks additionally high computational costs for model calibration and scenario simulations are still among the challenges regarding high resolution modeling dullo et al 2021 moreover tcs occur at a much larger spatial scale than a watershed at which flood management practices are typically carried out the rainfall rates over a watershed can be different if a tc of the same magnitude occurs under the same climate conditions due to some slight differences in the track or the spatial distribution of the rainfall li et al 2020 regier et al 2021 even if two sets of simulated tc rainfall fields over a watershed under two climate conditions were obtained some of the differences could be attributed to factors other than climate change therefore high uncertainty which exists in key aspects of any given tc event including the cyclone track the spatial pattern of rainfall and others hinders our understanding of the climate change impacts on tc associated rainfall and the subsequent flooding at a watershed scale considering the issues discussed above the aim of this research is to investigate the future climate change impacts on extreme rainfall and more importantly subsequent flooding during a particular tc event at a watershed scale in this project a modeling framework was applied to hurricane harvey at the clear creek watershed in the southern houston texas specifically flood simulations based on offline coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic modeling were validated against gauge data at the coastal watershed furthermore we performed control hindcast simulations of harvey with a 7 ensemble member using a high resolution regional earth system model then two more sets of idealized simulations were conducted which assumed that harvey occurred in the middle 2050 2059 and end 2090 2099 of the 21st century under the representative concentration pathway 8 5 rcp 8 5 scenario using a pgw approach the impacts of climate change on harvey induced rainfall were evaluated by comparing the mean values of the projected heaviest rainfall rates in each ensemble member brought on by three simulated hurricane ensembles namely 2017 the 2050s and the 2090s finally the subsequent impacts on harvey induced flooding were assessed by comparing the inundation simulation results driven by the simulated rainfalls under 2017 2050s and 2090s climate conditions with the projected slr considered 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area the clear creek watershed in south houston is a coastal watershed that drains into galveston bay fig 1 this 677 km2 watershed is home to a population of roughly 300 000 people bass and bedient 2018 with fast population growth 68 of this watershed has been covered by impervious urban area based on the national land cover dataset 2016 the land surface elevation ranges from 0 7 to 39 3 m within the watershed a broad and plain floodplain is distributed along the upstream portion which makes large topographic areas readily subjected to flooding along the channel towards clear lake the floodplain becomes narrower and has greater slopes that confine flood waters to the creek which is not favorable to flood drainage usace 2012 the soil texture is mainly clay in the watershed with low infiltrability furthermore as a coastal watershed it is vulnerable to storm surge with the factors mentioned above flooding has been the primary natural disaster of concern for this watershed unprecedented water surface elevations and discharge rates were recorded at the united states geological survey usgs gauges within the watershed during hurricane harvey 2017 this was mainly caused by the heavy rainfall the accumulated rainfall over the watershed during hurricane harvey exceeded 1000 mm according to the ncep st iv quantitative precipitation estimate st iv qpe see details in appendix text 1 the record breaking rainfall was partly attributed to the fact that hurricane harvey followed a meandering path and moved slowly after it made its landfall exacerbating the flooding however the storm surge at the galveston bay during harvey was not high bass et al 2018 according to a national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa tide gauge eagle point 8771013 the harvey induced storm surge height the height gap between the verified and predicted sea water levels was no more than 1 25 m i e the highest sea level during harvey was 1 25 m above the mean sea level this extreme hurricane during which heavy rainfall rather than storm surge dominated the severe flooding provides an ideal case for examining the response of flooding to the changes in extreme tc associated rainfall 2 2 method the single event based deterministic approach was adopted in this research based on offline coupling between a hydrological model and a hydrodynamic model the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model dhsvm was used to simulate the hydrological processes wigmosta et al 1994 cuo et al 2008 then the two dimensional runoff inundation toolkit for operational needs triton was used to simulate the hydraulic processes morales hernandez et al 2021 a newly developed high resolution regional earth system model the regional community earth system model r cesm fu et al 2021 was deployed to perform three ensembles of hurricane harvey simulations in 3 km horizontal resolution under 2017 climate conditions and under two sets of rcp 8 5 future climate conditions the 2050s and 2090s each ensemble consists of 7 members dhsvm and triton simulations driven by rainfalls obtained from r cesm harvey simulations after bias correction were used to convert the projected rainfall changes into flood inundation changes in order to test the influences of slr on the future projections of harvey induced flooding we carried out twin experiments that either included or excluded the projected slr in the triton simulations storm surge did not play an important role in hurricane harvey induced flooding therefore the potential changes in storm induced surge amplitude and timing were not taken into account in this study our study specifically focuses on climate change impacts on extreme storm precipitation driven flooding with projected slr considered future work with compounded storm surge requires addressing additional technical challenges which are discussed in section 2 2 1 the flowchart of the modeling framework is illustrated in fig 2 2 2 1 earth system modeling the climate change impacts on rainfall were evaluated based on numerical experiments using the pgw approach lackmann 2015 patricola and wehner 2018 liu et al 2020 r cesm was used to simulate hurricane harvey under the climate conditions in 2017 mid 21st century 2050 2059 and late 21st century 2090 2099 r cesm is based on the latest infrastructure of the community earth system model version 2 cesm2 and its common infrastructure for modeling the earth cime framework additionally it incorporates the weather research and forecasting wrf skamarock et al 2008 model version 3 5 1 and the regional ocean modeling system roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 as regional components r cesm shows remarkable fidelity in reproducing the observed tc intensity for some tc cases more details about the model can be found in fu et al 2021 first we performed control hindcast simulations of harvey under 2017 conditions the initial and boundary conditions were derived from era5 reanalysis data hersbach et al 2020 and a 7 member ensemble was generated using the stochastic kinetic energy backscatter skeb scheme shutts 2005 we then performed the pgw experiments as if hurricane harvey were to occur in the 2050s and 2090s under rcp8 5 scenario the high resolution community earth system model cesm transient climate simulations chang et al 2020 under rcp 8 5 scenarios were adopted projected differences of the cesm simulated thermodynamic variables between 2050 and 2059 and 2090 2099 august climatology and 2017 august climatology in august were then added to historical era5 estimates these modified era5 estimates served as initial and boundary conditions for the r cesm model to simulate harvey in the pgw experiments although the r cesm shows a high fidelity in reproducing many key aspects including rainfall wind speed etc of hurricane harvey see fig a3 it is not possible to reproduce exactly the same hurricane as observed these biases do not deviate from our understanding of the impacts on the rainfall totals from the hurricane reed et al 2020 but may significantly affect our evaluation of the rainfall at the watershed scale therefore hurricane track bias correction was carried out for each simulation to minimize the impacts on rainfall distribution from simulated and observed tc tracks the simulated harvey tracks were remapped onto the observed harvey track using a one to one grid point vector approach at each instant the precipitation field was displaced by an amount equal to the difference between the simulated storm location and the actual storm location for example at time t0 if the observed tc center location is latobs lonobs while the simulated tc center location is detected at latsim lonsim we artificially shift the entire model domain with a vector of latobs latsim lonobs lonsim thus the simulated tc center is always ascertained in align with the observation while maintaining the rainfall spatial pattern relative to the storm core then it was assumed that the watershed would receive the heaviest rainfall during the hurricane under each scenario to realize this the rainfall fields were relocated such that the total rainfall over the watershed would reach the maximum value for each ensemble member thus canceling out the noise from the spatial pattern of the rainfall see details in appendix text 3 lastly the hourly rainfall outputs from the r cesm model after hurricane track bias correction and rainfall field relocation were used to drive the dhsvm model for hydrological simulations it is worth noting that such high resolution modeling is computationally expensive specifically it takes 480 cpu cores about 4 h to finish one r cesm ensemble member modeling run we have 3 7 ensemble members in total more than 40 k cpu hours 2 2 2 hydrological modeling dhsvm is a physics based distributed hydrological model in high resolution which has been updated to enable the simulation of hydrological processes in watersheds with urban land cover cuo et al 2008 the hydrological model used in the study area was established in 40 m and hourly resolutions the most important input for the simulation is rainfall which is represented by st iv qpe the 3dep 1 3 arc second approximately 10 m elevation product sugarbaker et al 2017 was resampled to 40 m for setting up the dhsvm model national land cover database nlcd 2016 products homer et al 2016 were adopted to represent the current land cover conditions the soil texture data were taken from the soil survey geographic database nauman et al 2018 meteorological forcings other than rainfall came from the north america land data assimilation system nldas xia et al 2012 a 6 month spin up simulation was used to provide reasonable initial conditions for the flood event there are only two usgs gauges that measure the stream discharge rates across the watershed usgs 08 076 997 and usgs 08077600 with a flat topographic slope the area upstream of the watershed is not well drained and surface water can be ponded winter 2012 because of the shallow channel the flows during major floods might also move across the tributary drainage areas as indicated by the wide inundation area of the fema 1 floodplain map federal emergency management agency 2022 thus the assumption that all of the runoff generated over each grid cell will be drained through the associated stream network in the hydrologic model is violated this makes the streamflow during the flood event at gauge 08 076 997 overestimated in hydrologic model based simulations accordingly only the streamflow records at gauge 08 077 600 were used for model calibration 2 2 3 hydrodynamic modeling triton was developed to leverage the multi gpu architecture of modern high performance computers hpc for accelerated inundation modeling morales hernández et al 2021 it solves the full 2d shallow water equations with source terms using an explicit numerical scheme to better simulate the pluvial flooding brought on by the heavy rainfall runoff input for all of the grids within the study area instead of streamflow input for selected stream nodes was adopted for the hydrodynamic modeling procedures to extract the effective rainfall from dhsvm outputs are detailed in appendix text 2 the triton setup for the clear creek watershed included a 20 m resolution dem resampled from the 1 3 arc second usgs national elevation dataset sugarbaker et al 2017 and a spatially varied manning s roughness coefficient kalyanapu et al 2009 we removed some elevated roads and bridges above river channels on the dem to avoid their impacts on the flow simulation in some of the streams such that flows can go through the river channel below the bridge dullo et al 2021 the spatial resolution of 20 m was selected to represent the topography to a sufficiently accurate extent at reasonable computational costs the triton model extent includes 3 6 million grid cells 2462 columns 1454 rows for the study domain the north west and south boundaries were set with a zero gradient type 0 external boundary condition while a level versus time condition was imposed for the segments over galveston bay at the east boundary the gauged sea water level at the outlet of the watershed kemah usgs gauge 08 077 637 seaward was taken as the water level at the boundary segments intersecting with galveston bay the projected slr is based on a probabilistic projection kopp et al 2014 this projection has also been adopted by researchers evaluating climate change impacts on hurricane flood hazards marsooli et al 2019 the projected slr median values at galveston texas under rcp 8 5 is 0 52 m in the 2050 s and 1 23 m in 2100 as compared to the year 2000 these projected slr values are very close to the values produced by the ipcc ar6 sea level rise projections garner et al 2021 fox kemper et al 2021 garner et al n d the projected slr at galveston pier 21 texas under ssp5 8 5 which is a shared socioeconomic pathway that largely analogous to rcp 8 5 before 2100 is 0 50 m in 2050 and 1 29 m in 2100 as compared to the baseline 1995 2014 garner et al 2021 because the baseline is a period before hurricane harvey 2017 the projected slr was shifted based on the nearest projection i e 0 17 m in 2030 with a linear trend assumed between 2000 and 2030 the projected slr relative to the level in 2017 is thus 0 36 m in 2050 and 1 07 m in 2100 under rcp 8 5 different manning s roughness coefficient values were specified for different land covers dullo et al 2021 first the values from kalyanapu et al 2009 were adopted as the initial values of the manning s roughness coefficient in the input then these values were adjusted to match the simulated water surface elevation and the observations from the harris county flood control district hcfcd flood warming system fws to provide an initial condition for the simulation a virtual rainfall event of total rainfall depth ranging from 30 to 70 mm for different divisions was added at the first day of a 10 day duration spin up virtual rainfall events provide baseflows for the channels and for clear lake before hurricane harvey although this does not provide an accurate initial condition for the study domain the uncertainty introduced by the initial conditions would not impact the flood simulation significantly given the extremely large magnitude of the harvey floods albeit triton runs with a dynamic time step size that depends on the flow conditions outputs were aggregated to an hourly interval the simulations were conducted on the grace high performance computer managed by texas a m high performance research computing group hprc https hprc tamu edu wiki grace specifically it takes 24 cpu cores about 16 h to accomplish a triton based hydrodynamic simulation for the clear creek watershed although triton can provide even more speed up through gpu acceleration morales hernández et al 2021 the gpu implementation was not explored in this study triton based maximum inundation depth maps for each individual scenario were processed cell by cell the maximum inundation depth mid for each grid cell is the maximum value of inundation depth across the flooding event for each ensemble there are 7 maximum inundation maps corresponding to each ensemble member the average maximum inundation depths afid were obtained by calculating the average inundation depths for each grid cell and for the 2017 ensemble the 2050s ensemble and the 2090s ensemble the changes in mid were evaluated by comparing the amid in 2017 and the 2050s and in 2017 and the 2090s in addition a depth range was also calculated the gap between the largest value and the smallest value of the maximum inundation depth for each grid cell in each ensemble indicating the uncertainty in inundation depth associated with the rainfall uncertainty the peak inundation time pit is the time point since the simulation start in this study aug 25 00 00 with the largest mean hourly inundation depth throughout the event larger or smaller than 0 3 given the heavy rainfall during harvey the watershed was wet almost everywhere we selected a threshold to classify whether a grid cell as inundated or not which was 0 3 m as described by kramer et al 2016 and dao et al 2022 the flood inundation extent fie is the total area of the set of grid cells whose mid was no less than 0 3 m in addition the flood inundation duration fid for each grid was the number of hourly time steps with an inundation depth no less than 0 3 m 3 results 3 1 hydrological and hydrodynamic model calibration 3 1 1 hydrological model calibration the dhsvm model was calibrated to the tropical storm allison 2001 during which heavy rainfall 468 mm over the clear creek watershed occurred in combination with a relatively weak storm surge storm surge height no more than 0 87 m with the highest sea level being 1 01 m above the mean sea level at the nearest noaa tide gage since the st iv data were not available until 2002 the rainfall of the tropical storm allison 2001 event is based on gauge data from the harris county flood warning system https www harriscountyfws org key soil parameters including porosity field capacity wilting point vertical conductivity and lateral conductivity and vegetation parameters including maximum and minimum resistance vapor pressure deficit and root zone depths were adjusted with reference to calibrated parameters in nearby watersheds li et al 2020 the r2 nse peak bias and mean bias of the simulated streamflow against the usgs gauge data is 0 95 0 84 3 49 and 18 12 respectively fig 3 a the calibrated dhsvm model was used to simulate the hydrologic processes of the study area during hurricane harvey the r2 nse peak bias and mean bias of simulated streamflow is 0 96 0 83 25 30 and 25 40 respectively fig 3b high values of r2 and nse measurements were achieved for model calibration and validation while a negative mean bias was noticed in both events in addition a slightly positive bias was observed in the flood peak of tropical storm allison but a negative bias occurred in the flood peak of hurricane harvey while our simulation errors are unavoidable the peak bias and relative biases are also partially attributed to the errors uncertainties of the gage data fuentes andina et al 2017 a more detailed discussion about the simulation bias is presented in appendix text 4 considering the factors associated with the modeling bias the model shows an acceptable level of performance with regard to its simulation of the extreme flood event at the watershed this is further verified by the acceptable performance of the hydrodynamic modeling which is based on the effective rainfall inputs from the hydrological modeling 3 1 2 hydrodynamic model calibration the simulated peak values of water surface elevations matched the observations from hcfcd well as fig 4 indicates moreover simulated temporal dynamics of the water surface elevations coincided with the observed temporal changes of the water surface elevations at the gauges across the watershed fig 5 simulation biases exist in regard to two aspects the first is that the simulation underestimated the first peak at some of the mainstream gauges i e gauge 110 and 120 and the other is that the model seems to present a slower process of flood retreat than the actual flood retreat especially at some of the gauges in the rainfall storm surge interaction and the storm surge zones such as gauges 200 610 and 100 furthermore the locations of fema property claims were used to verify the spatial pattern of the inundation simulation results fig 6 a visual inspection determined that most of the claims fell into the simulated urban inundation area 68 9 of the claims were within the inundated grid cells the area with the most crowded set of claims is the turkey creek sub watershed which is an area that experienced deep inundation in our simulation the simulation also captured the large area of inundation in upstream regions indicating that the runoff input for triton satisfied the simulation for pluvial flooding one reason for the bias in the simulation might be the temporarily varying roughness of the land surface we assigned manning s coefficient for each land use type kalyanapu et al 2009 representing its roughness level and thus its impacts on the flow these were adjusted to lower values during calibration and the roughness is much higher for other land use types than it is for open water area meanwhile due to the extraordinary magnitude of the floods considerable parts of the land were inundated with water and turned into open water temporarily therefore the water drainage is faster than what the simulation indicates in which the roughness is always of some constant specified value another reason relates to how the boundary conditions were handled the level versus time boundary is specified for the eastern boundary to represent the impacts from the storm surge this might introduce some errors given that water level is not the only factor deciding the storm volume 3 2 climate change impacts on rainfall and flooding 3 2 1 projected changes in rainfall fig 7 illustrates significant increases in the potential maximum rainfall over the watershed the hindcasted maximum harvey rainfall totals over the watershed under the 2017 climate conditions range from 946 mm to 1326 mm the projected maximum harvey rainfall totals under the 2050 s climate conditions range from 1082 mm to 1590 mm and range from 1499 mm to 2069 mm under the 2090 s climate conditions the mean values increased from 1138 mm standard error 46 mm 90 confidence interval from 1041 mm to 1235 mm to 1339 mm standard error 73 mm 90 confidence interval from 1185 mm to 1492 mm in the 2050 s and to 1703 mm standard error 71 mm 90 confidence interval from 1553 mm to 1853 mm in the 2090 s by 17 7 and 49 7 respectively the projected increment of the mean surface temperature mst over the gulf of mexico region 18 31 n 77 98 w is 1 07 c in the 2050 s and 3 09 c in the 2090 s therefore the projected increase in rainfall totals per degree c increase in mst is 183 fig 5 13b standard error 31 mm 90 confidence interval was estimated to be from 125 mm to 254 mm this means a 16 1 standard error 2 7 and a 90 confidence interval 10 9 22 2 increase in harvey rainfall totals over the watershed per degree increase in mst 3 2 2 projected changes in maximum flood inundation the subsequent changes in flooding were examined with regard to four aspects flood inundation extent fie maximum inundation depth mid flood inundation duration fid and peak inundation time the fie ranges from 309 99 km2 to 365 33 km2 under the 2017 climate condition the average of fie afie is 336 49 km2 49 7 of the watershed area with the 90 confidence interval being from 322 41 km2 to 350 57 km2 meanwhile the deepest inundation occurred along with the middle portion of the mainstream of clear creek except for some small ponding areas fig 8 a the range of inundation depths for each grid cell under the 7 ensemble scenarios over the watershed is relatively small in most areas fig 8b the primary area with a depth range over 0 5 m is mainly distributed along the downstream portion of clear creek as well as within the armond bayou and the taylor bayou this is also true for the results of the 2050s and the 2090s fig a7 the fie ranges from 289 66 km2 to 407 14 km2 under the 2050s climate conditions and from 380 11 km2 to 435 40 km2 under the 2090s climate conditions the afie would be 373 34 km2 55 1 of the watershed area under the 2050s climate conditions with the 90 confidence interval from 345 67 km2 to 401 01 km2 under climate conditions of the 2090s it would be 401 99 km2 59 3 of the watershed area with the 90 confidence interval from 389 09 km2 to 414 89 km2 as compared with the 2017 climate conditions the afie would increase by 11 0 and 19 5 respectively fig 9 a specifically in urban regions the mean value of inundation area would be 208 3 km2 90 confidence interval from 196 6 km2 to 219 9 km2 in 2017 and it would increase to 234 0 km2 in the 2050s 90 confidence interval from 211 2 km2 to 256 7 km2 and to 253 5 km2 in the 2090s 90 confidence interval from 242 3 km2 to 264 7 km2 increases of 12 3 and 21 7 respectively fig 9b when compared with the high percentage values of the rainfall increases the increases in inundation extent tend to be lower an approximately 50 increase in rainfall would lead to a roughly 20 increase in inundation extent this indicates a non linear relationship between the rainfall and the inundation extent fig 9c not only is the flood inundation extent projected to increase in the future but also the inundation depth the areas with maximum inundation depths between 0 3 m and 2 m would increase notably fig 9d the area along the downstream portion of clear creek upstream of clear lake would demonstrate the largest increases in inundation depth in both the 2050s and 2090s fig 10 a and b observable increases in inundation depth are also projected to occur downstream of the armond bayou in the 2090s besides the increase in inundation extent fie the mid would also observe increases in the 2050s and 2090s the area with an amid below 0 3 m will decrease significantly while those with amid values between 0 3 m and 2 m will increase significantly fig 9d the area along the downstream portion of clear creek upstream of clear lake will observe the largest increases in amid in both the 2050s and 2090s fig 10a and b additionally observable increases in amid are also projected to occur downstream of the armond bayou in the 2090s in addition changes were observed in inundation duration and peaking time inundation duration time will increase in the future and the increase will be much more pronounced in the 2090s fig 10a and b meanwhile the trends with regard to peak time differed in different regions nevertheless the peak time tends to shift to an earlier period in the areas subjected to the deepest inundation including the midstream portion of clear creek and the mud gully and turkey creek sub watersheds 3 2 3 impacts from the slr the projected slr would not affect the maximum inundation extent or depth observably especially for the situation in the 2050s to examine the impacts from the projected slr the 2050s ensemble scenarios and the 2090s ensemble scenarios were simulated without the projected slr the average maximum inundation extent would be almost the same when no projected slr takes place 373 21 km2 vs 373 34 km2 and 401 19 km2 vs 401 99 km2 in the 2050s and 2090s respectively as compared to the results without the projected slr only a slight increase in the maximum inundation depth would occur in some regions near the outlet in the 2090s with slr fig 11 b this is probably because the extraordinary rainfall dominates the flood peak during harvey and its future counterparts so the projected slr as a boundary condition would hardly affect the maximum inundation depth map this coincides with the findings of existing literature recognizing the role of climate change effects in river discharge versus slr in compound flooding bermudez et al 2021 however observable changes might occur in the inundation duration in some regions downstream of clear creek and the tributaries draining into clear lake fig 11c and d the peak time will shift to earlier periods in the regions around the outlet in the 2090s fig 11f to examine whether the projected slr affected the flooding processes in addition to the maximum inundation depth we compared simulated water level dynamics at four water level gauges under one of the ensemble member scenarios with and without projected slr in the 2050s and 2090s fig 12 the relatively smaller flood peaks during aug 27 and aug 28 before the highest flood peak would be enhanced with the projected slr especially for the locations closer to the river outlet such as gauge 200 therefore the impacts from slr on less extreme flooding events still deserve our attention especially for the areas close to the river outlet and along the coastline pasquier et al 2019 rahimi et al 2020 4 discussion projected increases in rainfall are significant 17 7 and 49 7 especially given that the harvey rainfall was so heavy this is consistent with the knowledge that the future climate change impacts on rainfall increase rates of major hurricanes category 3 5 are expected to be 36 8 which is higher than the average level for all hurricanes 25 8 in the late 21st century supplemental material of knustson et al 2022 similarly according to liu et al 2020 the rainfall of hurricane irene category 3 2011 is projected to increase by 32 0 at the end of the 21st century moreover rainfall is subjected to uncertain spatial distribution over the watershed for example see the spatial distribution of the two simulated rainfall fields shown in fig a2c and d in comparison the projected increases in inundation depth are more consistent in different scenarios in the future fig 9 which reveals the constraints from the topography on the flood inundation the low lying areas are always prone to flooding and deserve most attention despite the spatial variability of rainfall the trend with regard to inundation duration changes can also be informative even though we are not fully confident with the specific values of simulated inundation durations inundation in the downstream areas did not recede to the level before the event until the end of the simulation sep 3rd fig 5 which was not the case during the real hurricane harvey floods the triton model seems to produce a slower recession process than the ground truth similar to simulations based on other models such as hec ras winter 2012 however if we just focus on the trends of the changes earlier peaking and longer inundation duration should be observed in the regions along the stream network where the deepest inundation depths also occurred meanwhile inundation duration and peak inundation time can be affected by the lag between the rainfall peak and the surge dynamics which were not taken into account in this study besides the projected slr future climate change will also have impacts on storm surge which was not taken into account in this study due to its high uncertainty camelo et al 2020 however the existing literature indicates that storm surge tends to exacerbate flooding with larger surge volumes expected in the future bass et al 2018 balaguru et al 2016 since the storm surge is subjected to a larger height range and can be much higher than the projected slr bass et al 2018 these potential impacts should not be overlooked with regard to future flood management in the coastal regions based on liner regression results from historical observations surge heights in galveston bay increase by 0 074 m per 1 ms 1 increase in hurricane wind speed trepanier et al 2015 if this applies to hurricane harvey the increase in surge height could be over 1 8 m under the 2090s climate conditions given the significant projected increase in wind speed this increase in surge height when combined with slr should significantly affect the inundation since the peak sea level over 4 m would exceed land surface elevations in large portions of the coastal region for extreme events such as harvey key variables are subject to scarce data availability and large uncertainties in the measurements bass and bedient 2018 fuentes andina et al 2017 for instance streamflow gage data may be of high uncertainty when the streamflow rate magnitude reaches high while water level gage data especially complete time series are scarce this introduces additional difficulties in model calibration and validation for extreme flood simulations impacts from wind and infrastructure including the pipe network on the hydrodynamics were not considered in the triton model moreover increasing air temperatures might lead to different initial soil moisture conditions for the flooding events under climate change sharma et al 2018 however for extreme flooding events such as hurricane harvey initial soil moisture tends to have little impact on extreme events like hurricane harvey li et al 2020 future changes in river morphology and land uses were also not considered since these are outside of the scope of this research the framework adopted in this study is an extension of the pseudo global warming pgw approach which has been widely used for investigating the climate change impacts on tropical cyclone tc intensity and rainfall amount one important point of this numerical modeling scheme is that it extends the climate change impact evaluations from the hurricane induced rainfall lackmann 2015 liu et al 2020 to its subsequent flooding at a watershed scale the state of the art modeling framework adopted in this study shows satisfactory performance with regard to simulating very extreme rainfall and the resulting flood response moreover applying the possible maximum rainfall to the same watershed avoids the massive number of hydrologic hydrodynamic simulations that otherwise would be needed the presented modeling framework is applicable to other coastal watersheds to identify the nature of the changing risk from extreme events however it should be mentioned that the conclusions in this study are drawn from simulations of extreme flooding during hurricane harvey while this is an ideal case for our understanding of the effects of future climate changes on extreme flooding induced by intense hurricanes the conclusions should not be extended to floods of much smaller magnitudes for instance the projected slr might play an important role in the maximum inundation depth at locations near the river outlet in those less extreme floods in addition this study did not take into account future climate change impacts on storm surge which is of high uncertainty it is challenging to perform the necessary storm surge simulations given that the storm displacements necessary for centering the heavy rain over the watershed would have made the hurricane wind fields incompatible with the location of the coastline 5 conclusion in this study a modeling framework based on three high resolution and physics based models was developed to investigate future climate change impacts on tc associated rainfall and subsequent flooding at a watershed scale with projected slr considered rainfall fields brought on by future versions of an extreme hurricane event were simulated via a pgw approach based on r cesm modeling flooding was simulated through offline coupling between dhsvm and triton a case study was carried out at the clear creek watershed in texas in the context of hurricane harvey based on our findings the potential maximum rainfall over the watershed will increase by 17 7 and 49 7 under rcp 8 5 in the 2050s and 2090s respectively this means about a 16 1 increase in rainfall per degree celsius increase of the mean surface temperature over the gulf of mexico region 18 31 n 77 98 w due to rainfall changes the subsequent increase in maximum inundation extent would be relatively lower being 11 0 and 19 5 12 3 and 21 7 in urban inundation area moreover the considerable increases may occur in maximum inundation depths despite the spatial variations of rainfall the low lying areas along the middle and downstream of clear creek and its tributaries may be the most vulnerable areas with regard to the future increase in inundation depth based on our assessment the projected slr should hardly affect the maximum inundation depth and extent it should only enhance the water surface elevations before the flood peaks in the downstream areas and extend the inundation durations faced with the increasing risk of high category hurricanes it is imperative to provide more accurate early flood warning the study focused on the global warming induced changes to the hurricane harvey rainfall and its subsequent impacts on the flooding future work includes representing its impacts on storm surge amplitude and timing in addition global warming may lead more changes regarding aspects of storm motion and storm likelihood which also deserves our attention for climate impact assessment and adaptation credit authorship contribution statement xudong li conceptualization methodology investigation

promoted as an alternative to conventional urban drainage methods the effects of lid at the site or urban scales have been widely evaluated this project aims to investigate the impact of lid implementation on basin runoff at a regional scale in a half urbanized catchment particularly the overlap of urban and rural sub flows at peak times a superflex conceptual model framework is adapted as a semi distributed model to simulate the rainfall runoff relationship in the catchment for san antonio texas as a case study scenario analyses of both urban development and lid implementation are conducted results show that 1 the infill urban development strategy benefits more from runoff control than the sprawl urban development 2 in non flood season permeable pavements bioretention cells and vegetated swales decrease peak runoff significantly and permeable pavements bioretention cells and green roofs are good at runoff volume retention 3 contrary to the general opinion about the peak reduction effect of lid for a partly urbanized partly rural basin the lid implementation delays urban peaks and may cause larger stacking of rural and urban peak runoffs leading to larger basin peaks under extremely wet conditions keywords low impact development superflex rainfall runoff relationship urbanization peak flows stacking data availability the hydrological data we used can be download from the usgs website https www usgs gov 1 introduction urbanization brought numerous environmental and hydrological changes to river basins and severely disturbed the natural water processes unwanted vegetation is removed for urban development diminishing vegetation interception and transpiration large areas of pervious surfaces are replaced by impervious concrete and asphalt for human convenience impeding runoff infiltration and subsurface water retention more environmental issues occur without sufficient and continuous groundwater recharge such as land subsidence groundwater shortage and water quality degradation ahiablame and shakya 2016 these human activities modify catchments from a relatively robust natural condition to a sensitive and unstable urbanized status resulting in water scarcity in dry seasons and waterlogging or urban flooding in rain seasons gilroy and mccuen 2009 ahiablame et al 2012 the conventional urban drainage approach is widely exploited in urban areas to solve flooding problems adopting the rapid and centralized water transfer strategy drainage systems are built to rapidly collect and convey storm and wastewater from impervious urban areas to centralized municipal facilities nearby water bodies or downstream rural areas the conventional approach does not solve water problems such as peak flows and water quality issues which only shifts the problems to another place to some extent low impact development lid or best management practices is promoted as an alternative to the conventional approach it seeks environmentally friendly solutions for current urban water problems instead of conventional centralized grey infrastructures such as pipelines and reservoirs lid exploits blue green practices such as green roofs and permeable pavements to mimic the natural hydrological system and facilitate rainwater detention and natural purification processes it aims to reduce human impact and control the rainwater at the source dietz 2007 gilroy and mccuen 2009 bedan and clausen 2009 ahiablame et al 2012 ulku et al 2018 since the promotion of the lid concept during the1990s plenty of lid practices have been designed and introduced to better suit diverse hydrological functions and ecosystem services under different field conditions the most widely used lid practices include 1 bioretention cells also known as rain gardens or depressed green which capture runoff with thick layers of soil and lush vegetation 2 vegetated swales shallow and narrow open channels to convey the rainwater are alternative options for traditional concrete gutters and curbs 3 extensive vegetated green roofs are one of the most popular lid practices because of their claimed advantages including runoff reduction house insulation and ecological and aesthetic benefits 4 permeable pavements are a multifunction lid practice which can be flexibly incorporated into different pavement needed surroundings the effectiveness of lid practices on runoff reduction has been well documented in scientific papers with field tests and simulation investigations zhu et al 2019 samouei and özger 2020 sheikh and izanloo 2021 yang et al 2022 bioretention cells are shown to reduce 48 to 97 of the incoming runoff volume chapman and horner 2010 debusk and wynn 2011 the runoff reduction proportion of extensive green roofs varies a lot between 6 1 and 100 depending on the roof slope media type and depth vegetation species and the intensity and duration of rain events vanwoert et al 2005 carpenter and kaluvakolanu 2011 soulis et al 2017 hunt et al 2010 monitored the runoff reduction of a vegetated swale for 23 precipitation events and reported that the runoff reduction proportion has a significant difference between 35 and 100 for large and small storm events permeable pavements can reduce runoff greatly by between 50 and 93 rushton 2001 hunt et al 2002 dreelin et al 2006 qin et al 2013 assessed the performance of swales permeable pavement and green roofs in a small urbanized basin using the us epa storm water management model swmm model they found that all three lid practices can retain more flood volume during heavier and shorter storm events ahiablame and shakya 2016 used the personal computer storm water management model pcswmm and found that lid can reduce 3 to 47 of total runoff under different lid implementation levels in a highly urbanized watershed while the runoff retention performance of lid practices was extensively documented at the site or urban basin scales few studies illustrated the influence of lid implementation in a half rural and half urbanized catchment at a large scale this research is necessary because of the faster runoff response time of urban lands the urban peak will reach the outlet of the basin before the peak of the rural part arrives however implementing lid solutions in city areas may delay the urban sub runoff and cause more overlap of the urban and rural peaks resulting in a larger basin peak for downstream flood safety the implementation of lid needs to consider the runoff not only in urban areas but also on the whole catchment scale that is why this research aims to study the influence of lid implementation on the basin peaks for a half urbanized catchment a case study is conducted for san antonio texas to investigate the peak stacking of rural and urban runoff the superflex conceptual model framework is used to develop to simulate the rainfall runoff relationship of this partly urbanized catchment further urbanization of this catchment is foreseen to deal with the uncertainty of future urban development we use a scenario analysis of both lid implementation and urbanization to give a reliable answer to the research question the specific objectives are to 1 investigate the different rainfall runoff relationships of urban and rural sub areas 2 examine the influence of urbanization on the basin runoff and 3 assess the influence of lid implementation on the basin runoff especially the overlap of urban and rural sub flows at peak times the structure of this paper is organized as follows the study area hydrological data and superflex model framework are introduced in section 2 the methods of the scenario design and model setup are illustrated in section 3 the research results regarding the effects of urbanization and lid implementation on the catchment scale are shown in section 4 some discussions concerning the transferability limitation and comparative analysis of this research and recommendations for future urban development are in section 5 finally the conclusions are drawn in the last section 6 2 study area data and modeling tools 2 1 study area san antonio city is the seventh most populous city in the u s with more than 1 5 million residents ready and montoya 2019 it is also the fastest growing of the top ten largest cities in the united states the city of san antonio official city website 2020 from 2010 to 2017 san antonio experienced a population growth rate between 1 5 and 2 0 the city still keeps a stable demographic expansion with this stable population increase the urban built up area in san antonio is expected to grow at a more or less equal pace san antonio has a transitional humid subtropical climate featuring hot and humid summers and mild to cool winters the average annual precipitation is 737 mm the soil in san antonio is mainly moderately permeable clayey soil edwards aquifer is the most prolific groundwater aquifer in the study area which is the main source of water for residents a groundwater recharge project is developed in the north part of san antonio to release the stress of the edwards aquifer by holding back storm runoff in recharge zones the implementation of lid practices like permeable pavements and bioretention cells can also accelerate natural stormwater infiltration other personal stormwater infiltration is not allowed to avoid groundwater pollution the edwards aquifer website 2020 the research catchment is 4544 km2 which is a sub basin of the san antonio river the city of san antonio takes 27 of the research catchment de colstoun et al 2017 the urban built up area is near the basin outlet fig 1 san antonio river flows through san antonio downtown and joins with the medina river san antonio has separate foul sewer and stormwater transportation systems the precipitation collected by the stormwater pipelines is discharged directly to nearby water bodies without treatment the wastewater is transported to three major wastewater treatment centers in san antonio and the treated water is discharged to nearby rivers san antonio water system 2020 2 2 hydrological data the time series of precipitation evaporation and runoff data for the study catchment from 2017 04 12 to 2018 12 02 600 research days are collected from the usgs website https www usgs gov the first 365 days are the calibration period and the last 235 days are the verification period we use 30 min time scale hydrological data to reflect the fast runoff response in urban areas precipitation data are retrieved from 10 monitoring stations thiessen polygons method is used to calculate the mean precipitation in this catchment evaporation data comes from a meteorological station in the research area the discharge data from the study catchment and two sub catchments are collected from three streamflow monitoring stations as shown in fig 1 over 600 research days the accumulated precipitation evaporation and runoff amounts are 1335 1054 and 166 mm 2 3 superflex model framework to avoid issues of too complex hydrological models including high data requirements equifinality problem and model uncertainty and to distinguish the rural and urban areas in the same catchment the superflex fenicia et al 2011 hydrological modeling framework is adapted to a semi distributed model in this study the superflex modeling framework uses generic building blocks such as reservoirs junctions and related functions which provide a platform for hydrologists to test dominant water processes and build tailor made models the superflex framework has been adapted for different topographical conditions e g plateau hillslope and wetland as the flex topo model savenije 2010 the dynamit dynamic mixing tank model proposed by hrachowitz et al in 2013 is loosely based on the flex model the predecessor of superflex framework furthermore the flexg model is a glacier hydrological model that integrates snow and glacier accumulation and ablation processes gao et al 2018 in lisflood fp hostache et al 2018 the output of a superflex based model is combined with a hydraulic model to simulate river discharge while superflex was widely used to simulate the rainfall runoff relationships under different natural landscapes it has not yet been applied in a highly urbanized catchment in this study several urban water processes as well as four lid modules bioretention cells green roofs bioswales and permeable pavements were formulated and added to the superflex framework 3 method because the different lag times and stacking of the rural and urban peaks are key points this study focuses on the different hydrological characteristics of urban and rural areas superflex conceptual model framework is adapted to a tailor made semi distributed model with two hydrological response units for urban and rural surfaces respectively the superflex model is firstly calibrated for the current rainfall runoff relationship the influences of urbanization and lid implementation on the basin runoff are also investigated to address the research problem eight scenarios including three urbanization scenarios a b and c and five lid implementation scenarios bioretention cells permeable pavements green roofs vegetated swales and mixed lid scenarios are designed to deal with the prediction uncertainty the design of urbanization and lid implementation scenario is introduced first followed by the hydrological model setup 3 1 scenario design 3 1 1 urbanization scenarios according to the urbanization projection from city of san antonio comprehensive plan 2010 there will be 1 1 million new residents in san antonio by 2040 in this research the current time is defined as 2017 the expected population growth between 2017 and 2040 is estimated at 0 9 million the government of san antonio plans to terminate the unconstrained urban sprawl and adopts the infill urbanization strategy to retrofit existing urban and suburban areas it could attract more investment in the urban core and save the high infrastructure and utility services costs for newly developed areas based on the information above three urban development scenarios for 2040 are designed table 1 scenario a offers an extreme infill urban development situation in which city size in 2040 will be the same as it is now scenario b is a partial infill partial sprawl urban development situation in this scenario 70 of the new residents will live in current urban areas while 30 of new residents will be living in new suburban areas in scenario c 50 of the new residents are assumed to stay in urban expansion areas while the other 50 will infill current vacant and underutilized urban areas since the infill development strategy may lead to a compact living space per capita living space for scenario a is assumed to be 0 85 times the current areas and this ratio is 0 9 for scenario b while no compact living space is assumed for scenario c 3 1 2 lid implementation scenarios according to local regulations the implementation of lid is not strictly mandatory and there is great flexibility in the selection of lid practices therefore this research adopts the four most common and typical lid practices to design five lid implementation scenarios based on the conventional urban development scenario c the first four scenarios assume moderate lid implementations as 15 of the precipitation on urban impervious grey surfaces will be collected by a single type of lid practice bioretention cells vegetated swales extensive green roofs or permeable pavements this will allow us to compare the different hydrological performances of these lid practices the last scenario assumes a wide scale lid implementation as 50 of the precipitation on urban impervious grey surfaces will be conveyed by mixed lid practices bioretention cells 15 vegetated swales 15 extensive green roofs 5 permeable pavements 15 to provide an optimistic and flexible lid implementation plan green roofs and permeable pavements serve the area where they are constructed the construction areas of bioretention cells and vegetated swales are smaller with the ratio of drainage and construction areas as 1 5 and 3 respectively besides the cascading connections among these lid practices are designed based on realistic construction considerations as shown in fig 2 c 3 2 hydrological model superflex hydrological modeling framework is adapted into a tailor made semi distributed model for the study catchment the semi distributed model is calibrated and validated with the observed precipitation evaporation and runoff data based on the calibrated model for the current condition the model structure and parameter values are further modified for the simulation of urban development and lid implementation 3 2 1 semi distributed model setup the hydrological modeling starts from two simple lumped pre models one for the rural and one for the urban sub catchment the dominant water processes in rural and urban environments are identified from lumped models and inherited by semi distributed models to simulate the whole study catchment six generations of semi distributed models ranging from six bucket to eight bucket are built sui 2019 these semi distributed models are calibrated for the first 365 day period on a 30 minute scale and then validated with the last 235 day data pairs we use the multi objective calibration approach in this research nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and correlation coefficient r2 are used to evaluate the simulated runoff time series the quantile quantile plot q q plot is used to compare the observed and simulated runoff distributions moreover we compare the characteristics of the urban and rural sub flows from the model output and the observed runoff data collected from the urban and rural sub catchments sui 2019 for the parameter calibration the initial range of each parameter is given roughly based on the experiences and local conditions according to the physical meaning of these parameters breuer et al 2003 gharari et al 2014 then random parameter sets are sampled between the maximum and minimum limitations with the monte carlo method more complex models with more parameters are tested with larger numbers of parameter sample sets to ensure that the calibration scale is as fair as possible the final selection of the semi distributed model is a six bucket model the schematic figure of the model structure mathematical expressions of water processes and the parameter calibration results are shown in fig 2a and table 2 3 2 2 the expression of urban development in the model in the semi distributed model three urbanization scenarios are expressed with two parameters 1 the proportion of urban areas in the whole catchment and 2 the proportion of urban grey areas in urban areas the degree of urban construction including water drainage systems and population density are assumed to be homogeneous in urban areas the numerical expressions of three urbanization scenarios are shown in table s1 in the supplementary material 3 2 3 the expression of lid practices in the model the expression of lid in the semi distributed model follows two procedures first the hydrological processes of lid practices are designed and fit in the urban module of the calibrated semi distributed model then reasonable values are assumed for the lid parameters based on literature field test results and local government documents carter and jackson 2007 carter and rasmussen 2016 collins et al 2008 hunt et al 2008 li et al 2009 san antonio river authority 2015 san antonio water system 2020 van seters et al 2006 the specific assumptions for lid parameters include the construction and drainage areas maximum interception depth soil depth and porosity and the lag time for peak flows sui 2019 the schematic model structures of four lid practices fitting in the urban module are shown in fig 2b the mathematical expressions of hydrological routes and parameters are in table 3 and table 4 the parameters dlid a and ar b are dependent on the specific lid implementation scenarios 4 results the observed and simulated rainfall runoff relationships under the current condition are shown in fig 3 the semi distributed model has good performance with high nse and r2 of 0 68 and 0 90 during the calibration period and 0 69 and 0 84 during the verification period the observed and simulated total basin runoff is 166 and 160 mm in 600 research days according to the model result urban areas 27 of the basin produce 63 of the total runoff volume and rural areas 73 of the basin generate only 37 urban areas generate peak runoff frequently no matter in dry or rainy seasons while in rural areas the peak runoffs appear less often with lower peaks fig 3a 4 1 urbanization influences on basin runoff fig 4 compares the simulated total basin runoffs for three urbanization scenarios and the current condition the simulated total runoff volumes and maximum peak values in 600 research days are shown in table 5 we found that all three urbanization scenarios generate larger numbers of total basin runoff volumes compared to the current condition scenario c with the highest level of urban sprawl development 50 of new residents following the infill development without the compaction of per capita living space produces an additional 14 3 of total basin runoff for scenarios b and a 70 and 100 of new residents following the infill development with the compact factors 0 9 and 0 85 the growth rates of basin runoff volume are 8 7 and 2 7 respectively as for peak flows all three urbanization scenarios bring obvious increases in most peak runoffs fig 4a similar to the total basin runoff volumes scenario c always brings the largest peak runoffs followed by scenarios b and a consecutively even though urbanization may inevitably bring the growth of basin runoff the infill urban development strategy is more helpful in basin runoff control for both total volumes and peak values than the sprawl urban development strategy in our case study compared to the current condition the maximum peak runoff in 600 research days is increased by 16 and 7 5 in scenarios c and b table 5 however in scenario a as a fully infill urbanization plan without any urban expansion the maximum peak runoff unexpectedly declines by 4 3 compared to the current condition fig 4b shows the maximum peak runoff and its two successive peak runoffs during flood season we found that urbanization scenario a not only reduces the maximum peak runoff but also reduces the runoff value of its next two peaks this phenomenon is because intensive rainfall events have filled up the water retention capacity in rural areas during the flood season under this circumstance the basin peaks are contributed by the urban and rural sub flows together fig 4c without any urban expansion urbanization scenario a shares the same rural sub flow as the current condition however the urban sub flow in urbanization scenario a is increased and comes faster compared to it under the current condition as fig 4c shows the urban sub flow moves slightly far from slow rural peaks and decreases the basin peak compared to the current condition hence it is undoubted that urbanization would increase the runoff from urban surfaces however considering the accumulation of rural sub flow urbanization does not always bring higher basin peaks in a half urbanized catchment as the faster urban runoff can help to spread the peak over a longer period of time 4 2 lid performance in the non flood season fig 5 shows the comparisons of the runoff time series between the five lid scenarios and the conventional urban development scenario urbanization scenario c compared to conventional urban development all five lid scenarios significantly reduce most peaks in the non flood season the third maximum peak runoff in 600 research days happening in the non flood season march 29 2018 is analyzed to further reveal the lid performance on peak value reduction fig 6 a two peaks i and ii appear in succession after one precipitation event the lid practices always reduce the first peak more significantly than the second one this is because peak i is mainly generated by urban grey areas with the rapid hydrological response which is the domain of lid practices peak ii is contributed by urban green surfaces with a slow hydrological response and therefore the lid practices have limited influence on peak ii the specific runoff reduction amounts consumed by each water process in four single lid scenarios are listed in table 7 4 2 1 bioretention cells scenario bioretention cells significantly reduce both the total runoff volume and the peak runoff value second only to permeable pavements the total basin runoff is reduced by 2 4 from 182 5 mm to 178 1 mm in 600 research days as for peak values bioretention cells considerably reduced the peak i on march 29 2018 by 8 8 from 0 306 to 0 279 mm h 1 the robustness of bioretention cells is also satisfactory after the continuous water consumption resulting in a 1 4 reduction for the next peak ii the strong ability of runoff consumption can ascribe to the massive water percolation through soil granules and large amounts of water transpiration by dense vegetation for bioretention cells as shown in table 7 bioretention cells only generate 16 0 of the precipitation as outflow 54 5 of the precipitation percolates underground and 21 5 and 8 1 evaporate and are retained this result is consistent with the previous research according to the studies of chapman and horner 2010 and debusk and wynn 2011 bioretention cells can reduce runoff volume from 48 to 97 4 2 2 permeable pavements scenario permeable pavements demonstrate the best ability for runoff reduction among four test lid practices the total basin runoff volume is declined by 2 5 in the permeable pavements scenario from 182 5 to 177 9 mm table 6 two basin peak values in the non flood season are reduced by 9 5 and 2 2 respectively even though sharing a similar total runoff volume reduction with bioretention cells permeable pavements are better at reducing peak runoff values in 600 research days permeable pavements generated the least overflow as 8 6 of the precipitation amount table 7 87 7 of the rainwater is consumed by percolation because of the abundant stormwater retention space in the subbase or base and between the permeable pavers the result is consistent with previous studies in which permeable pavements consume 50 to 93 of runoff rushton 2001 hunt et al 2002 dreelin et al 2006 with large water retention capacity and forceful peak runoff reduction ability permeable pavements and bioretention cells can be considered the two most effective lid practices to control urban floods and release the pressure on urban drainage systems 4 2 3 vegetated swales scenario the peak runoff reduction ratio of vegetated swales is similar to bioretention cells and permeable pavements as shown in table 6 vegetated swales decrease 7 6 of the peak i in the non flood season but the sustainability of this peak runoff reduction ability is weak rather than exhaustively consuming vegetated swales delay the runoff of peak i till peak ii which causes a larger peak ii the performance of vegetated swales is not outstanding in retaining total runoff volume in the long term for the 1335 mm stormwater conveyed by vegetated swales during 600 research days 68 3 of the rainwater was discharged to the urban drainage system only 24 1 and 7 7 of the total rainfall was absorbed and consumed by the soil and vegetation previous studies reported that the performance of vegetated swales is significantly different between facing small rainfalls and large storms for small rainfall 85 of the runoff volume can be retained however for large storms this proportion ranges from 35 to 66 hunt et al 2010 it can be explained by the fast water transportation mechanism of vegetated swales without sufficient water retention capacity vegetated swales do not support stable and continuous percolation during large storms therefore the total runoff reduction volume of vegetated swales is distinctly smaller than the other three test lid practices 4 2 4 extensive green roofs scenario the extensive green roofs reduce the least peak runoff among four test lid practices two peak values in the non flood season are reduced by 4 4 and 0 2 which are far less than in other scenarios however the green roofs scenario reduces 2 3 of the total runoff volume which is close to the performance of permeable pavements 2 5 and bioretention cells 2 4 scenarios by the end of 600 research days 43 0 of precipitation was evaporated and 20 2 was stored in the green roof buckets 36 8 of the rainwater overflowed in literature the runoff reduction capacity of green roofs varies largely between 23 and 100 vanwoert et al 2005 hathaway et al 2008 carpenter and kaluvakolanu 2011 we found a significant difference between runoff volume and peak value reductions of green roofs it can be ascribed to the small water retention capacity although green roofs share a similar model structure to bioretention cells with one interception and one unsaturated bucket the soil thickness of extensive green roofs is much smaller and there is no continuous percolation available from rooftops to the groundwater the small water retention capacity of green roofs leads to a sensitive hydrological performance to the predecessor rains if there are no or fewer predecessor rain the green roof can still play a role in peak runoff reduction however when it comes to rainy seasons the green roof will be easily filled up by the frequent storm events and lose its peak runoff reduction function 4 2 5 mixed lid scenario the mixed lid scenario is the most forceful lid scenario to reduce both the peak runoff and the total runoff volume the peak runoff values decrease considerably in the mixed lid scenario by 28 for peak i and 3 5 for peak ii as for the total runoff volume the mixed lid scenario reduces the total basin runoff volume from 182 5 to 168 0 mm with a 7 9 reduction ratio in 600 research days except for the large contribution area of lid practices another advantage of the mixed lid scenario attributes to the cascade connection among lid practices which adjusts the unbalanced water capture capacities of different lid practices and reinforces the robustness of the whole lid system table 8 shows the specific water retention amounts of 4 lid practices in the mixed lid scenario the evaporation of green roofs and bioretention cells and the percolation of bioretention cells and permeable pavements consume a large amount of rainwater comparing the hydrological performances of bioretention cells in the single bioretention cells scenario and the mixed lid scenario the water retention ability of bioretention cells is better developed especially the evaporation under the condition of more water input and less construction area precipitationa and inflowb indicate the stormwater collected directly by the lid practices and the recharge from other lid practices 4 3 lid performance in the flood season fig 6b and 6c show three basin peaks in the flood season and their rural and urban sub flows respectively it can be found that all five lid scenarios lost the peak reduction ability for the last two peaks dominated by rural runoffs table 6 records the specific basin peak values in five lid scenarios and one conventional scenario it is noticed that five lid scenarios could bring larger values of peak iv and v compared to them in the conventional urban development scenario further the mixed lid scenario which is supposed to be the most powerful runoff reduction plan led to peak increases of 1 7 from 2 65 to 2 67 mm h 1 and 2 0 from 1 49 to 1 52 mm h 1 this anomalous phenomenon heavily depends on the study catchment s specific hydrological condition as a half urbanized catchment the peak runoffs are generated from urban and rural areas together during flood season normally urban peaks come earlier than rural peaks because of a faster runoff response time however the urban runoffs are slowed after the implementation of lid practices fig 6c it causes a larger stacking of urban and rural peaks and in consequence increases the total basin peak runoff to further confirm this argument ten precipitation events with different rain intensities and durations are selected from the 600 days of precipitation observation these rain events are tested in the mixed lid scenario in the flood season from september 15 2018 to september 21 2018 among ten test precipitation events eight basin peaks increase from 0 7 to 2 84 after the lid implementation figure s1 considering the overlapping of urban and rural sub flows even though the increase ratios are small it is to be concluded that in basins with combined urban and rural land use like our case study the basin peak flow reduction of lid measures is negligible during extremely wet conditions if not negative 5 discussion 5 1 transferability of research results given the specific condition of our case study the research results should be interpreted consciously in particular the growing total basin peaks after lid implementation the transferability of this result needs to consider the following characteristics the basin should have a substantial portion of urban areas to generate a significant urban runoff that makes the effects relevant for downstream areas besides the rural and urban sub flows are generated and contribute to the basin runoff together after several continuous storm events in the flood season moreover before the lid implementation there should be a time difference between urban and rural peaks as the urban surfaces have a faster hydrological response time and the urban peak would come faster finally the extent of lid implementation will quantitatively influence the basin peaks as a higher degree of lid implementation may slow down the urban sub flow and bring a larger stack of urban and rural sub flows 5 2 limitations to decrease the model uncertainty caused by over complex models and to determine a suitable level of model complexity savenije 2001 hrachowitz et al 2014 this research used a relatively simple semi distributed model to simulate the rainfall runoff relationship on the catchment scale our semi distributed model does not represent heterogeneity within the rural and urban areas then important assumptions are made in the urban development and lid implementation scenarios first 2 4 million residents are supposed to live in san antonio city with three compact factors 0 85 0 9 and 1 for living space in 2040 in three urbanization scenarios uncertainty in these projections is high next the extent of urban construction and lid implementation is assumed to be consistent throughout urban areas however the construction density of urban core areas might be larger than the new developed suburban areas five lid implementation scenarios presume optimistic lid implementation conditions by using favorable lid parameters hence overlooking practical implementation operation and maintenance problems such as the damage to lid practices and the blockage in soil media such forecasting limitations lead to the discrepancy between the scenario and reality the results however show that the answer to our research question what is the influence of lid implementation on the basin runoffs at a catchment scale remains valid for different urban development and lid implementation scenarios 5 3 comparative analysis the research results about lid performances are supported by former studies the permeable pavements are concluded as the most effective lid practices for runoff reduction among the four test lid practices a similar conclusion was drawn by ahiablame et al 2012 in addition the ineffective runoff reduction of vegetated swales is ascribed to its fast rainwater transportation and short residence time in this research huang et al 2018 used the same reason to explain the less effective performance of infiltration trenches and vegetated swales compared with bioretention cells porous pavements green roofs and etc then the mix of various lid practices should be adopted since its high robustness a similar argument was also mentioned by qin et al 2013 askarizadeh et al 2015 fang et al 2017 and huang et al 2018 5 4 recommendations although urbanization may inevitably result in a rising in total runoff volume infill urban development is recommended for peak flood control rather than sprawl development additionally the stacking of peak flows from rural urban green and urban grey parts of a basin should be avoided by making use of their different runoff response times future research can investigate the hydrological response times of areas with different landscapes soil types topographic conditions urbanization extents and the distance to the catchment outlet besides this research assumes homogeneous rural and urban landscapes and hydrological performances future research could further analyze the impact of lid implementation on the basin runoff by considering heterogeneity problems such as partial urban development and uneven lid implementation plan spatially using distributed models with more sufficient data 6 conclusions this research conducts a case study for the catchment of san antonio texas to investigate the influence of lid implementation on the basin runoff scenario analyses for both urban development and lid implementation are adopted to give a reliable answer to the research question a superflex conceptual model is adapted as a semi distributed model to simulate the rainfall runoff relationships and study the catchment s hydrological behavior under different scenarios we found that 1 the urban areas taking 27 of the study catchment generate 63 of total basin runoff while the last 73 of rural areas only produce 37 of total runoff urban surfaces yield more frequent peak runoffs with less water retention capacity than rural surfaces 2 in a case study at hand the infill urban development benefits more from runoff control than the sprawl urban development all three urban development scenarios bring the growth of total runoff volume with increase ratios as high as 14 3 for scenario c half infill and half expansion urban development plan 8 7 for scenario b 70 infill and 30 expansion 2 7 for scenarios a fully infill development fortunately however by converting the urban development strategy from urban expansion to infill development the extreme peak runoff can be reduced from 0 358 scenario c to 0 331 scenario b and 0 295 mm h 1 scenario a 3 all five lid implementation scenarios perform powerful runoff reduction ability in non flood seasons bioretention cells and permeable pavements significantly decrease total basin runoff volume by 2 4 and 2 5 and one typical peak value by 8 8 and 9 5 with more water input and less construction area the water retention ability of bioretention cells in particular the evaporation function can be better developed vegetated swales achieve a lower runoff volume 1 1 than the other three lid practices without substantial water retention capacity but have satisfactory peak runoff reducing ability 7 6 on the contrary green roofs are good at runoff volume reduction 2 3 and only remove 4 4 of the peak runoff 4 however all five lid scenarios have a weaker peak reduction ability and may even bring larger total basin peak runoffs when it comes to the flood season this is because these basin peaks are generated by the rural and urban sub flows together the lid implementation delays the urban peaks which causes a larger stack of urban and rural sub flows and thus increases the total basin peak 7 data availability precipitation evaporation and runoff

conducted results show that 1 the infill urban development strategy benefits more from runoff control than the sprawl urban development 2 in non flood season permeable pavements bioretention cells and vegetated swales decrease peak runoff significantly and permeable pavements bioretention cells and green roofs are good at runoff volume retention 3 contrary to the general opinion about the peak reduction effect of lid for a partly urbanized partly rural basin the lid implementation delays urban peaks and may cause larger stacking of rural and urban peak runoffs leading to larger basin peaks under extremely wet conditions keywords low impact development superflex rainfall runoff relationship urbanization peak flows stacking data availability the hydrological data we used can be download from the usgs website https www usgs gov 1 introduction urbanization brought numerous environmental and hydrological changes to river basins and severely disturbed the natural water processes unwanted vegetation is removed for urban development diminishing vegetation interception and transpiration large areas of pervious surfaces are replaced by impervious concrete and asphalt for human convenience impeding runoff infiltration and subsurface water retention more environmental issues occur without sufficient and continuous groundwater recharge such as land subsidence groundwater shortage and water quality degradation ahiablame and shakya 2016 these human activities modify catchments from a relatively robust natural condition to a sensitive and unstable urbanized status resulting in water scarcity in dry seasons and waterlogging or urban flooding in rain seasons gilroy and mccuen 2009 ahiablame et al 2012 the conventional urban drainage approach is widely exploited in urban areas to solve flooding problems adopting the rapid and centralized water transfer strategy drainage systems are built to rapidly collect and convey storm and wastewater from impervious urban areas to centralized municipal facilities nearby water bodies or downstream rural areas the conventional approach does not solve water problems such as peak flows and water quality issues which only shifts the problems to another place to some extent low impact development lid or best management practices is promoted as an alternative to the conventional approach it seeks environmentally friendly solutions for current urban water problems instead of conventional centralized grey infrastructures such as pipelines and reservoirs lid exploits blue green practices such as green roofs and permeable pavements to mimic the natural hydrological system and facilitate rainwater detention and natural purification processes it aims to reduce human impact and control the rainwater at the source dietz 2007 gilroy and mccuen 2009 bedan and clausen 2009 ahiablame et al 2012 ulku et al 2018 since the promotion of the lid concept during the1990s plenty of lid practices have been designed and introduced to better suit diverse hydrological functions and ecosystem services under different field conditions the most widely used lid practices include 1 bioretention cells also known as rain gardens or depressed green which capture runoff with thick layers of soil and lush vegetation 2 vegetated swales shallow and narrow open channels to convey the rainwater are alternative options for traditional concrete gutters and curbs 3 extensive vegetated green roofs are one of the most popular lid practices because of their claimed advantages including runoff reduction house insulation and ecological and aesthetic benefits 4 permeable pavements are a multifunction lid practice which can be flexibly incorporated into different pavement needed surroundings the effectiveness of lid practices on runoff reduction has been well documented in scientific papers with field tests and simulation investigations zhu et al 2019 samouei and özger 2020 sheikh and izanloo 2021 yang et al 2022 bioretention cells are shown to reduce 48 to 97 of the incoming runoff volume chapman and horner 2010 debusk and wynn 2011 the runoff reduction proportion of extensive green roofs varies a lot between 6 1 and 100 depending on the roof slope media type and depth vegetation species and the intensity and duration of rain events vanwoert et al 2005 carpenter and kaluvakolanu 2011 soulis et al 2017 hunt et al 2010 monitored the runoff reduction of a vegetated swale for 23 precipitation events and reported that the runoff reduction proportion has a significant difference between 35 and 100 for large and small storm events permeable pavements can reduce runoff greatly by between 50 and 93 rushton 2001 hunt et al 2002 dreelin et al 2006 qin et al 2013 assessed the performance of swales permeable pavement and green roofs in a small urbanized basin using the us epa storm water management model swmm model they found that all three lid practices can retain more flood volume during heavier and shorter storm events ahiablame and shakya 2016 used the personal computer storm water management model pcswmm and found that lid can reduce 3 to 47 of total runoff under different lid implementation levels in a highly urbanized watershed while the runoff retention performance of lid practices was extensively documented at the site or urban basin scales few studies illustrated the influence of lid implementation in a half rural and half urbanized catchment at a large scale this research is necessary because of the faster runoff response time of urban lands the urban peak will reach the outlet of the basin before the peak of the rural part arrives however implementing lid solutions in city areas may delay the urban sub runoff and cause more overlap of the urban and rural peaks resulting in a larger basin peak for downstream flood safety the implementation of lid needs to consider the runoff not only in urban areas but also on the whole catchment scale that is why this research aims to study the influence of lid implementation on the basin peaks for a half urbanized catchment a case study is conducted for san antonio texas to investigate the peak stacking of rural and urban runoff the superflex conceptual model framework is used to develop to simulate the rainfall runoff relationship of this partly urbanized catchment further urbanization of this catchment is foreseen to deal with the uncertainty of future urban development we use a scenario analysis of both lid implementation and urbanization to give a reliable answer to the research question the specific objectives are to 1 investigate the different rainfall runoff relationships of urban and rural sub areas 2 examine the influence of urbanization on the basin runoff and 3 assess the influence of lid implementation on the basin runoff especially the overlap of urban and rural sub flows at peak times the structure of this paper is organized as follows the study area hydrological data and superflex model framework are introduced in section 2 the methods of the scenario design and model setup are illustrated in section 3 the research results regarding the effects of urbanization and lid implementation on the catchment scale are shown in section 4 some discussions concerning the transferability limitation and comparative analysis of this research and recommendations for future urban development are in section 5 finally the conclusions are drawn in the last section 6 2 study area data and modeling tools 2 1 study area san antonio city is the seventh most populous city in the u s with more than 1 5 million residents ready and montoya 2019 it is also the fastest growing of the top ten largest cities in the united states the city of san antonio official city website 2020 from 2010 to 2017 san antonio experienced a population growth rate between 1 5 and 2 0 the city still keeps a stable demographic expansion with this stable population increase the urban built up area in san antonio is expected to grow at a more or less equal pace san antonio has a transitional humid subtropical climate featuring hot and humid summers and mild to cool winters the average annual precipitation is 737 mm the soil in san antonio is mainly moderately permeable clayey soil edwards aquifer is the most prolific groundwater aquifer in the study area which is the main source of water for residents a groundwater recharge project is developed in the north part of san antonio to release the stress of the edwards aquifer by holding back storm runoff in recharge zones the implementation of lid practices like permeable pavements and bioretention cells can also accelerate natural stormwater infiltration other personal stormwater infiltration is not allowed to avoid groundwater pollution the edwards aquifer website 2020 the research catchment is 4544 km2 which is a sub basin of the san antonio river the city of san antonio takes 27 of the research catchment de colstoun et al 2017 the urban built up area is near the basin outlet fig 1 san antonio river flows through san antonio downtown and joins with the medina river san antonio has separate foul sewer and stormwater transportation systems the precipitation collected by the stormwater pipelines is discharged directly to nearby water bodies without treatment the wastewater is transported to three major wastewater treatment centers in san antonio and the treated water is discharged to nearby rivers san antonio water system 2020 2 2 hydrological data the time series of precipitation evaporation and runoff data for the study catchment from 2017 04 12 to 2018 12 02 600 research days are collected from the usgs website https www usgs gov the first 365 days are the calibration period and the last 235 days are the verification period we use 30 min time scale hydrological data to reflect the fast runoff response in urban areas precipitation data are retrieved from 10 monitoring stations thiessen polygons method is used to calculate the mean precipitation in this catchment evaporation data comes from a meteorological station in the research area the discharge data from the study catchment and two sub catchments are collected from three streamflow monitoring stations as shown in fig 1 over 600 research days the accumulated precipitation evaporation and runoff amounts are 1335 1054 and 166 mm 2 3 superflex model framework to avoid issues of too complex hydrological models including high data requirements equifinality problem and model uncertainty and to distinguish the rural and urban areas in the same catchment the superflex fenicia et al 2011 hydrological modeling framework is adapted to a semi distributed model in this study the superflex modeling framework uses generic building blocks such as reservoirs junctions and related functions which provide a platform for hydrologists to test dominant water processes and build tailor made models the superflex framework has been adapted for different topographical conditions e g plateau hillslope and wetland as the flex topo model savenije 2010 the dynamit dynamic mixing tank model proposed by hrachowitz et al in 2013 is loosely based on the flex model the predecessor of superflex framework furthermore the flexg model is a glacier hydrological model that integrates snow and glacier accumulation and ablation processes gao et al 2018 in lisflood fp hostache et al 2018 the output of a superflex based model is combined with a hydraulic model to simulate river discharge while superflex was widely used to simulate the rainfall runoff relationships under different natural landscapes it has not yet been applied in a highly urbanized catchment in this study several urban water processes as well as four lid modules bioretention cells green roofs bioswales and permeable pavements were formulated and added to the superflex framework 3 method because the different lag times and stacking of the rural and urban peaks are key points this study focuses on the different hydrological characteristics of urban and rural areas superflex conceptual model framework is adapted to a tailor made semi distributed model with two hydrological response units for urban and rural surfaces respectively the superflex model is firstly calibrated for the current rainfall runoff relationship the influences of urbanization and lid implementation on the basin runoff are also investigated to address the research problem eight scenarios including three urbanization scenarios a b and c and five lid implementation scenarios bioretention cells permeable pavements green roofs vegetated swales and mixed lid scenarios are designed to deal with the prediction uncertainty the design of urbanization and lid implementation scenario is introduced first followed by the hydrological model setup 3 1 scenario design 3 1 1 urbanization scenarios according to the urbanization projection from city of san antonio comprehensive plan 2010 there will be 1 1 million new residents in san antonio by 2040 in this research the current time is defined as 2017 the expected population growth between 2017 and 2040 is estimated at 0 9 million the government of san antonio plans to terminate the unconstrained urban sprawl and adopts the infill urbanization strategy to retrofit existing urban and suburban areas it could attract more investment in the urban core and save the high infrastructure and utility services costs for newly developed areas based on the information above three urban development scenarios for 2040 are designed table 1 scenario a offers an extreme infill urban development situation in which city size in 2040 will be the same as it is now scenario b is a partial infill partial sprawl urban development situation in this scenario 70 of the new residents will live in current urban areas while 30 of new residents will be living in new suburban areas in scenario c 50 of the new residents are assumed to stay in urban expansion areas while the other 50 will infill current vacant and underutilized urban areas since the infill development strategy may lead to a compact living space per capita living space for scenario a is assumed to be 0 85 times the current areas and this ratio is 0 9 for scenario b while no compact living space is assumed for scenario c 3 1 2 lid implementation scenarios according to local regulations the implementation of lid is not strictly mandatory and there is great flexibility in the selection of lid practices therefore this research adopts the four most common and typical lid practices to design five lid implementation scenarios based on the conventional urban development scenario c the first four scenarios assume moderate lid implementations as 15 of the precipitation on urban impervious grey surfaces will be collected by a single type of lid practice bioretention cells vegetated swales extensive green roofs or permeable pavements this will allow us to compare the different hydrological performances of these lid practices the last scenario assumes a wide scale lid implementation as 50 of the precipitation on urban impervious grey surfaces will be conveyed by mixed lid practices bioretention cells 15 vegetated swales 15 extensive green roofs 5 permeable pavements 15 to provide an optimistic and flexible lid implementation plan green roofs and permeable pavements serve the area where they are constructed the construction areas of bioretention cells and vegetated swales are smaller with the ratio of drainage and construction areas as 1 5 and 3 respectively besides the cascading connections among these lid practices are designed based on realistic construction considerations as shown in fig 2 c 3 2 hydrological model superflex hydrological modeling framework is adapted into a tailor made semi distributed model for the study catchment the semi distributed model is calibrated and validated with the observed precipitation evaporation and runoff data based on the calibrated model for the current condition the model structure and parameter values are further modified for the simulation of urban development and lid implementation 3 2 1 semi distributed model setup the hydrological modeling starts from two simple lumped pre models one for the rural and one for the urban sub catchment the dominant water processes in rural and urban environments are identified from lumped models and inherited by semi distributed models to simulate the whole study catchment six generations of semi distributed models ranging from six bucket to eight bucket are built sui 2019 these semi distributed models are calibrated for the first 365 day period on a 30 minute scale and then validated with the last 235 day data pairs we use the multi objective calibration approach in this research nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and correlation coefficient r2 are used to evaluate the simulated runoff time series the quantile quantile plot q q plot is used to compare the observed and simulated runoff distributions moreover we compare the characteristics of the urban and rural sub flows from the model output and the observed runoff data collected from the urban and rural sub catchments sui 2019 for the parameter calibration the initial range of each parameter is given roughly based on the experiences and local conditions according to the physical meaning of these parameters breuer et al 2003 gharari et al 2014 then random parameter sets are sampled between the maximum and minimum limitations with the monte carlo method more complex models with more parameters are tested with larger numbers of parameter sample sets to ensure that the calibration scale is as fair as possible the final selection of the semi distributed model is a six bucket model the schematic figure of the model structure mathematical expressions of water processes and the parameter calibration results are shown in fig 2a and table 2 3 2 2 the expression of urban development in the model in the semi distributed model three urbanization scenarios are expressed with two parameters 1 the proportion of urban areas in the whole catchment and 2 the proportion of urban grey areas in urban areas the degree of urban construction including water drainage systems and population density are assumed to be homogeneous in urban areas the numerical expressions of three urbanization scenarios are shown in table s1 in the supplementary material 3 2 3 the expression of lid practices in the model the expression of lid in the semi distributed model follows two procedures first the hydrological processes of lid practices are designed and fit in the urban module of the calibrated semi distributed model then reasonable values are assumed for the lid parameters based on literature field test results and local government documents carter and jackson 2007 carter and rasmussen 2016 collins et al 2008 hunt et al 2008 li et al 2009 san antonio river authority 2015 san antonio water system 2020 van seters et al 2006 the specific assumptions for lid parameters include the construction and drainage areas maximum interception depth soil depth and porosity and the lag time for peak flows sui 2019 the schematic model structures of four lid practices fitting in the urban module are shown in fig 2b the mathematical expressions of hydrological routes and parameters are in table 3 and table 4 the parameters dlid a and ar b are dependent on the specific lid implementation scenarios 4 results the observed and simulated rainfall runoff relationships under the current condition are shown in fig 3 the semi distributed model has good performance with high nse and r2 of 0 68 and 0 90 during the calibration period and 0 69 and 0 84 during the verification period the observed and simulated total basin runoff is 166 and 160 mm in 600 research days according to the model result urban areas 27 of the basin produce 63 of the total runoff volume and rural areas 73 of the basin generate only 37 urban areas generate peak runoff frequently no matter in dry or rainy seasons while in rural areas the peak runoffs appear less often with lower peaks fig 3a 4 1 urbanization influences on basin runoff fig 4 compares the simulated total basin runoffs for three urbanization scenarios and the current condition the simulated total runoff volumes and maximum peak values in 600 research days are shown in table 5 we found that all three urbanization scenarios generate larger numbers of total basin runoff volumes compared to the current condition scenario c with the highest level of urban sprawl development 50 of new residents following the infill development without the compaction of per capita living space produces an additional 14 3 of total basin runoff for scenarios b and a 70 and 100 of new residents following the infill development with the compact factors 0 9 and 0 85 the growth rates of basin runoff volume are 8 7 and 2 7 respectively as for peak flows all three urbanization scenarios bring obvious increases in most peak runoffs fig 4a similar to the total basin runoff volumes scenario c always brings the largest peak runoffs followed by scenarios b and a consecutively even though urbanization may inevitably bring the growth of basin runoff the infill urban development strategy is more helpful in basin runoff control for both total volumes and peak values than the sprawl urban development strategy in our case study compared to the current condition the maximum peak runoff in 600 research days is increased by 16 and 7 5 in scenarios c and b table 5 however in scenario a as a fully infill urbanization plan without any urban expansion the maximum peak runoff unexpectedly declines by 4 3 compared to the current condition fig 4b shows the maximum peak runoff and its two successive peak runoffs during flood season we found that urbanization scenario a not only reduces the maximum peak runoff but also reduces the runoff value of its next two peaks this phenomenon is because intensive rainfall events have filled up the water retention capacity in rural areas during the flood season under this circumstance the basin peaks are contributed by the urban and rural sub flows together fig 4c without any urban expansion urbanization scenario a shares the same rural sub flow as the current condition however the urban sub flow in urbanization scenario a is increased and comes faster compared to it under the current condition as fig 4c shows the urban sub flow moves slightly far from slow rural peaks and decreases the basin peak compared to the current condition hence it is undoubted that urbanization would increase the runoff from urban surfaces however considering the accumulation of rural sub flow urbanization does not always bring higher basin peaks in a half urbanized catchment as the faster urban runoff can help to spread the peak over a longer period of time 4 2 lid performance in the non flood season fig 5 shows the comparisons of the runoff time series between the five lid scenarios and the conventional urban development scenario urbanization scenario c compared to conventional urban development all five lid scenarios significantly reduce most peaks in the non flood season the third maximum peak runoff in 600 research days happening in the non flood season march 29 2018 is analyzed to further reveal the lid performance on peak value reduction fig 6 a two peaks i and ii appear in succession after one precipitation event the lid practices always reduce the first peak more significantly than the second one this is because peak i is mainly generated by urban grey areas with the rapid hydrological response which is the domain of lid practices peak ii is contributed by urban green surfaces with a slow hydrological response and therefore the lid practices have limited influence on peak ii the specific runoff reduction amounts consumed by each water process in four single lid scenarios are listed in table 7 4 2 1 bioretention cells scenario bioretention cells significantly reduce both the total runoff volume and the peak runoff value second only to permeable pavements the total basin runoff is reduced by 2 4 from 182 5 mm to 178 1 mm in 600 research days as for peak values bioretention cells considerably reduced the peak i on march 29 2018 by 8 8 from 0 306 to 0 279 mm h 1 the robustness of bioretention cells is also satisfactory after the continuous water consumption resulting in a 1 4 reduction for the next peak ii the strong ability of runoff consumption can ascribe to the massive water percolation through soil granules and large amounts of water transpiration by dense vegetation for bioretention cells as shown in table 7 bioretention cells only generate 16 0 of the precipitation as outflow 54 5 of the precipitation percolates underground and 21 5 and 8 1 evaporate and are retained this result is consistent with the previous research according to the studies of chapman and horner 2010 and debusk and wynn 2011 bioretention cells can reduce runoff volume from 48 to 97 4 2 2 permeable pavements scenario permeable pavements demonstrate the best ability for runoff reduction among four test lid practices the total basin runoff volume is declined by 2 5 in the permeable pavements scenario from 182 5 to 177 9 mm table 6 two basin peak values in the non flood season are reduced by 9 5 and 2 2 respectively even though sharing a similar total runoff volume reduction with bioretention cells permeable pavements are better at reducing peak runoff values in 600 research days permeable pavements generated the least overflow as 8 6 of the precipitation amount table 7 87 7 of the rainwater is consumed by percolation because of the abundant stormwater retention space in the subbase or base and between the permeable pavers the result is consistent with previous studies in which permeable pavements consume 50 to 93 of runoff rushton 2001 hunt et al 2002 dreelin et al 2006 with large water retention capacity and forceful peak runoff reduction ability permeable pavements and bioretention cells can be considered the two most effective lid practices to control urban floods and release the pressure on urban drainage systems 4 2 3 vegetated swales scenario the peak runoff reduction ratio of vegetated swales is similar to bioretention cells and permeable pavements as shown in table 6 vegetated swales decrease 7 6 of the peak i in the non flood season but the sustainability of this peak runoff reduction ability is weak rather than exhaustively consuming vegetated swales delay the runoff of peak i till peak ii which causes a larger peak ii the performance of vegetated swales is not outstanding in retaining total runoff volume in the long term for the 1335 mm stormwater conveyed by vegetated swales during 600 research days 68 3 of the rainwater was discharged to the urban drainage system only 24 1 and 7 7 of the total rainfall was absorbed and consumed by the soil and vegetation previous studies reported that the performance of vegetated swales is significantly different between facing small rainfalls and large storms for small rainfall 85 of the runoff volume can be retained however for large storms this proportion ranges from 35 to 66 hunt et al 2010 it can be explained by the fast water transportation mechanism of vegetated swales without sufficient water retention capacity vegetated swales do not support stable and continuous percolation during large storms therefore the total runoff reduction volume of vegetated swales is distinctly smaller than the other three test lid practices 4 2 4 extensive green roofs scenario the extensive green roofs reduce the least peak runoff among four test lid practices two peak values in the non flood season are reduced by 4 4 and 0 2 which are far less than in other scenarios however the green roofs scenario reduces 2 3 of the total runoff volume which is close to the performance of permeable pavements 2 5 and bioretention cells 2 4 scenarios by the end of 600 research days 43 0 of precipitation was evaporated and 20 2 was stored in the green roof buckets 36 8 of the rainwater overflowed in literature the runoff reduction capacity of green roofs varies largely between 23 and 100 vanwoert et al 2005 hathaway et al 2008 carpenter and kaluvakolanu 2011 we found a significant difference between runoff volume and peak value reductions of green roofs it can be ascribed to the small water retention capacity although green roofs share a similar model structure to bioretention cells with one interception and one unsaturated bucket the soil thickness of extensive green roofs is much smaller and there is no continuous percolation available from rooftops to the groundwater the small water retention capacity of green roofs leads to a sensitive hydrological performance to the predecessor rains if there are no or fewer predecessor rain the green roof can still play a role in peak runoff reduction however when it comes to rainy seasons the green roof will be easily filled up by the frequent storm events and lose its peak runoff reduction function 4 2 5 mixed lid scenario the mixed lid scenario is the most forceful lid scenario to reduce both the peak runoff and the total runoff volume the peak runoff values decrease considerably in the mixed lid scenario by 28 for peak i and 3 5 for peak ii as for the total runoff volume the mixed lid scenario reduces the total basin runoff volume from 182 5 to 168 0 mm with a 7 9 reduction ratio in 600 research days except for the large contribution area of lid practices another advantage of the mixed lid scenario attributes to the cascade connection among lid practices which adjusts the unbalanced water capture capacities of different lid practices and reinforces the robustness of the whole lid system table 8 shows the specific water retention amounts of 4 lid practices in the mixed lid scenario the evaporation of green roofs and bioretention cells and the percolation of bioretention cells and permeable pavements consume a large amount of rainwater comparing the hydrological performances of bioretention cells in the single bioretention cells scenario and the mixed lid scenario the water retention ability of bioretention cells is better developed especially the evaporation under the condition of more water input and less construction area precipitationa and inflowb indicate the stormwater collected directly by the lid practices and the recharge from other lid practices 4 3 lid performance in the flood season fig 6b and 6c show three basin peaks in the flood season and their rural and urban sub flows respectively it can be found that all five lid scenarios lost the peak reduction ability for the last two peaks dominated by rural runoffs table 6 records the specific basin peak values in five lid scenarios and one conventional scenario it is noticed that five lid scenarios could bring larger values of peak iv and v compared to them in the conventional urban development scenario further the mixed lid scenario which is supposed to be the most powerful runoff reduction plan led to peak increases of 1 7 from 2 65 to 2 67 mm h 1 and 2 0 from 1 49 to 1 52 mm h 1 this anomalous phenomenon heavily depends on the study catchment s specific hydrological condition as a half urbanized catchment the peak runoffs are generated from urban and rural areas together during flood season normally urban peaks come earlier than rural peaks because of a faster runoff response time however the urban runoffs are slowed after the implementation of lid practices fig 6c it causes a larger stacking of urban and rural peaks and in consequence increases the total basin peak runoff to further confirm this argument ten precipitation events with different rain intensities and durations are selected from the 600 days of precipitation observation these rain events are tested in the mixed lid scenario in the flood season from september 15 2018 to september 21 2018 among ten test precipitation events eight basin peaks increase from 0 7 to 2 84 after the lid implementation figure s1 considering the overlapping of urban and rural sub flows even though the increase ratios are small it is to be concluded that in basins with combined urban and rural land use like our case study the basin peak flow reduction of lid measures is negligible during extremely wet conditions if not negative 5 discussion 5 1 transferability of research results given the specific condition of our case study the research results should be interpreted consciously in particular the growing total basin peaks after lid implementation the transferability of this result needs to consider the following characteristics the basin should have a substantial portion of urban areas to generate a significant urban runoff that makes the effects relevant for downstream areas besides the rural and urban sub flows are generated and contribute to the basin runoff together after several continuous storm events in the flood season moreover before the lid implementation there should be a time difference between urban and rural peaks as the urban surfaces have a faster hydrological response time and the urban peak would come faster finally the extent of lid implementation will quantitatively influence the basin peaks as a higher degree of lid implementation may slow down the urban sub flow and bring a larger stack of urban and rural sub flows 5 2 limitations to decrease the model uncertainty caused by over complex models and to determine a suitable level of model complexity savenije 2001 hrachowitz et al 2014 this research used a relatively simple semi distributed model to simulate the rainfall runoff relationship on the catchment scale our semi distributed model does not represent heterogeneity within the rural and urban areas then important assumptions are made in the urban development and lid implementation scenarios first 2 4 million residents are supposed to live in san antonio city with three compact factors 0 85 0 9 and 1 for living space in 2040 in three urbanization scenarios uncertainty in these projections is high next the extent of urban construction and lid implementation is assumed to be consistent throughout urban areas however the construction density of urban core areas might be larger than the new developed suburban areas five lid implementation scenarios presume optimistic lid implementation conditions by using favorable lid parameters hence overlooking practical implementation operation and maintenance problems such as the damage to lid practices and the blockage in soil media such forecasting limitations lead to the discrepancy between the scenario and reality the results however show that the answer to our research question what is the influence of lid implementation on the basin runoffs at a catchment scale remains valid for different urban development and lid implementation scenarios 5 3 comparative analysis the research results about lid performances are supported by former studies the permeable pavements are concluded as the most effective lid practices for runoff reduction among the four test lid practices a similar conclusion was drawn by ahiablame et al 2012 in addition the ineffective runoff reduction of vegetated swales is ascribed to its fast rainwater transportation and short residence time in this research huang et al 2018 used the same reason to explain the less effective performance of infiltration trenches and vegetated swales compared with bioretention cells porous pavements green roofs and etc then the mix of various lid practices should be adopted since its high robustness a similar argument was also mentioned by qin et al 2013 askarizadeh et al 2015 fang et al 2017 and huang et al 2018 5 4 recommendations although urbanization may inevitably result in a rising in total runoff volume infill urban development is recommended for peak flood control rather than sprawl development additionally the stacking of peak flows from rural urban green and urban grey parts of a basin should be avoided by making use of their different runoff response times future research can investigate the hydrological response times of areas with different landscapes soil types topographic conditions urbanization extents and the distance to the catchment outlet besides this research assumes homogeneous rural and urban landscapes and hydrological performances future research could further analyze the impact of lid implementation on the basin runoff by considering heterogeneity problems such as partial urban development and uneven lid implementation plan spatially using distributed models with more sufficient data 6 conclusions this research conducts a case study for the catchment of san antonio texas to investigate the influence of lid implementation on the basin runoff scenario analyses for both urban development and lid implementation are adopted to give a reliable answer to the research question a superflex conceptual model is adapted as a semi distributed model to simulate the rainfall runoff relationships and study the catchment s hydrological behavior under different scenarios we found that 1 the urban areas taking 27 of the study catchment generate 63 of total basin runoff while the last 73 of rural areas only produce 37 of total runoff urban surfaces yield more frequent peak runoffs with less water retention capacity than rural surfaces 2 in a case study at hand the infill urban development benefits more from runoff control than the sprawl urban development all three urban development scenarios bring the growth of total runoff volume with increase ratios as high as 14 3 for scenario c half infill and half expansion urban development plan 8 7 for scenario b 70 infill and 30 expansion 2 7 for scenarios a fully infill development fortunately however by converting the urban development strategy from urban expansion to infill development the extreme peak runoff can be reduced from 0 358 scenario c to 0 331 scenario b and 0 295 mm h 1 scenario a 3 all five lid implementation scenarios perform powerful runoff reduction ability in non flood seasons bioretention cells and permeable pavements significantly decrease total basin runoff volume by 2 4 and 2 5 and one typical peak value by 8 8 and 9 5 with more water input and less construction area the water retention ability of bioretention cells in particular the evaporation function can be better developed vegetated swales achieve a lower runoff volume 1 1 than the other three lid practices without substantial water retention capacity but have satisfactory peak runoff reducing ability 7 6 on the contrary green roofs are good at runoff volume reduction 2 3 and only remove 4 4 of the peak runoff 4 however all five lid scenarios have a weaker peak reduction ability and may even bring larger total basin peak runoffs when it comes to the flood season this is because these basin peaks are generated by the rural and urban sub flows together the lid implementation delays the urban peaks which causes a larger stack of urban and rural sub flows and thus increases the total basin peak 7 data availability precipitation evaporation and runoff

2614,ensemble kalman filter enkf and optimization methods are two mainstream methods in groundwater contamination source identification but most researchers usually only use or improve on one method however each method has strengths and weaknesses and using one method alone may cause inaccuracy of the identification results for complex situations therefore it is necessary to explore the combination of methods in this paper for the optimization method to further enhance the solution precision of the optimization model for groundwater dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl contamination source identification gdcsi we first constructed an improved butterfly optimization algorithm by introducing the dynamic switching probability mechanism in the previous butterfly optimization algorithm next the enkf method and optimization method based on the improved butterfly optimization algorithm were used respectively for gdcsi to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the methods then according to the strengths and weaknesses of the enkf and optimization methods the two methods were merged to build a more robust and practical combined search method csm for gdcsi to further enhance the identification accuracy and effectiveness in addition we innovatively applied the enkf method to combine two single deep learning surrogate models the deep belief neural network surrogate model and the deep residual neural network surrogate model and a deep learning combined surrogate model was established which further enhanced the approximation precision and applicability to the groundwater dnapl contamination multiphase flow numerical simulation model finally the results of csm were compared with those of two single methods to analyze the former s effectiveness the results showed that the csm significantly improved the identification accuracy and effectiveness of gdcsi compared with any single method keywords combined search method deep learning surrogate model ensemble kalman filter groundwater dnapl contamination improved butterfly optimization algorithm data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction in producing and transporting petroleum products organic contaminants often leak into the underground aquifer due to accidents or improper operation polluting the groundwater the dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl contamination is often more difficult to remediate than the light non aqueous phase liquid contamination requiring longer remediation time and expensive remediation costs to obtain satisfactory results therefore it is imperative to formulate a reasonable and efficient remediation scheme designing an affordable and efficient remediation scheme is based on understanding and mastering the relevant information about the groundwater dnapl contamination source jiang et al 2021 researching groundwater dnapl contamination source identification gdcsi has a practical significance the optimization method is a mainstream method for groundwater contamination source identification ayvaz 2016 li et al 2022b wang and lu 2022 it establishes and solves the optimization model until an optimal solution is obtained to minimize or maximize the objective function value generally when the optimization method is used for gdcsi the optimization model is characterized by many variables to be identified and a high degree of nonlinearity hou et al 2021 heuristic algorithms have been widely used in solving optimization models guneshwor et al 2018 li et al 2021a singh and datta 2006 the butterfly optimization algorithm boa arora and singh 2019 is a new heuristic algorithm that simulates butterflies feeding and mating behavior it has excellent optimization ability and strong applicability to high and low dimensional optimization problems boa exhibits high applicability prospects however when applying boa to solve the complex optimization model the search process may be trapped in the local optimum long et al 2021 long et al 2022 therefore it is urgent to explore an effective strategy to improve the previous boa to avoid trapping into the local optimum and enhance the solution precision of the optimization model for gdcsi the ensemble kalman filter enkf method evensen 1994 is also a mainstream inversion method in previous studies most researchers employed or improved on one method ayvaz 2010 han et al 2020 li et al 2021b li et al 2022a pan et al 2022 xu and gomez hernandez 2016 xu and gomez hernandez 2018 however each method has strengths and weaknesses the optimization method has strong fine search ability but depends on the initial point selection suppose the initial point is far from the true value the convergence speed becomes slow or easily gets trapped in premature convergence making it challenging to obtain the optimal solution hou et al 2021 wang et al 2022 moreover the optimization method cannot consider the uncertainty of the variables to be identified it can only obtain the point estimation bai et al 2022 chang et al 2021a ma and zabaras 2009 zhang et al 2015 in contrast the enkf method can fully consider the uncertainty of the variables to be identified it can obtain the point estimation and realize the interval estimation mo et al 2019 the enkf method has the strengths of fast calculation speed and simple call it can solve the inverse problem with fewer simulation model calls therefore in recent years the enkf method and its variants have gradually attracted wide attention in groundwater contamination source identification with excellent performance chen et al 2018 chen et al 2021 dodangeh et al 2022 xu and gomez hernandez 2016 xu and gomez hernandez 2018 however when the inverse problem is complex the fine search ability of this method is weak and the identification accuracy may be significantly reduced therefore using one method alone may cause inaccuracy of the identification results for complex situations and it is necessary to explore combining the two methods so this paper combined the enkf and optimization methods to build a more robust and practical combined search method csm for gdcsi to further enhance the identification accuracy and effectiveness so far no report on gdcsi exists that involves combining these methods in addition an iterative calculation is often involved in gdcsi the multiphase flow numerical simulation model must be called repeatedly inducing enormous calculation burden and time however the surrogate model of the simulation model can better solve this problem li et al 2020 lu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 yan et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 the surrogate model can approach the simulation model in function and significantly reduce the calculation burden and tediousness chang et al 2021b zhao et al 2015 a suitable establishment method of the surrogate model can enhance the approximation precision to the simulation model itself compared with the shallow learning surrogate model established by the shallow learning method the deep learning surrogate model established by the deep learning method can show stronger strengths chang et al 2022 ensuring the approximation precision to the multiphase flow numerical simulation model is higher however for the same problem the applicability and fitting ability of different single surrogate models often varies wang et al 2020 to fully use of the strengths of different single surrogate models it is necessary to explore effective methods to combine single surrogate models and establish a combined surrogate model in existing reports establishing a combined surrogate model mainly includes the set pair analysis method hou et al 2017 optimization method wang and lu 2021 adaptive metropolis markov chain monte carlo method xing et al 2019 and entropy weight method wang et al 2020 etc however exploring other better establishment methods of the combined surrogate model is still necessary to further enhance the approximation precision and applicability to the complex simulation model in this paper a novel establishment method of the combined surrogate model the enkf method with fast calculation speed and simple call combined two deep learning surrogate models the deep belief neural network dbnn surrogate model and the deep residual neural network drnn surrogate model and a deep learning combined surrogate model dcsm was established to enhance the approximation precision and applicability to the multiphase flow numerical simulation model currently no report exists on applying the enkf method to establish a combined surrogate model the main objective of this paper is to apply the csm based on the dcsm to simultaneously identify the groundwater dnapl contamination source information and simulation model parameters the main contributions are as follows 1 construct an improved butterfly optimization algorithm iboa by introducing the dynamic switching probability mechanism in the previous boa which further enhanced the solution precision of the optimization model for gdcsi 2 to further enhance the identification accuracy and effectiveness a more robust and practical csm by combining the enkf and optimization methods was constructed for gdcsi 3 combine two single deep learning surrogate models dbnn and drnn surrogate models by applying the enkf method to construct a dcsm further enhancing the approximation precision and applicability to the groundwater dnapl contamination multiphase flow numerical simulation model 2 methodology and theory 2 1 multiphase flow numerical simulation model

equation eq 1 and specific initial and boundary conditions in the dnapl contaminated site constitute the groundwater dnapl contamination multiphase flow numerical simulation model in this study the utchem developed by the university of texas solved the above multiphase flow numerical simulation model 2 2 surrogate model 2 2 1 the dbnn method the dbnn is a deep learning method since its proposal hinton et al 2006 it has been widely used in many fields dbnn comprises several stacked restricted boltzmann machines rbm and a top level algorithm the stacked rbm extracts the features of the input data layer by layer while the top level algorithm predicts the output results this paper selected the bp neural network algorithm as the top level algorithm the schematic of rbm is shown in fig 1 the training process of dbnn mainly includes two stages unsupervised learning training and supervised learning training the schematic of dbnn is shown in fig 2 1 the unsupervised learning training stage here rbm is trained layer by layer from the bottom up to extract essential of the input data for a set of states v h the joint probability distribution is as follows 2 p v h θ e e v h θ z θ 3 z θ v h

n a i v i j 1 m b j h j i 1 n j 1 m ω ij v i h j we continuously adjust and update the model parameters so that the rbm probability distribution corresponding to the set of model parameters and the probability distribution of the input data in the training samples are as close as possible it minimizes the energy function value that is it maximizes the likelihood function 5 l θ i 1 l ln p v i h 6 ln p v h ln 1 z θ j 1 m exp e v h j θ where l stands for the number of groups of input samples by training rbm layer by layer from the bottom up the initial model parameters of dbnn are obtained 2 the supervised learning training stage in the unsupervised learning training stage the training process is independent for each rbm only the parameters of each rbm can be guaranteed as optimal unlike the whole dbnn model therefore the next step involves carrying out the supervised learning training in this stage the model parameters of the network need are fine tuned for the model parameters to converge to the global optimal solution to find the optimal dbnn model the specific parameter update formula is as follows 7 ω ij ω ij η e r j ω ij 8 b j b j η e r j b j where η stands for the learning rate and erj stands for the loss function 2 2 2 the drnn method practical research shows that if the neural network layer is stacked its performance will not consistently improve and its precision may decline after the depth reaches a certain degree this phenomenon is called network degradation and sometimes gradient disappearance occurs to solve the above problems he et al 2016 proposed the residual network resnet unlike the ordinary neural network the core of resnet is the residual block resblock fig 3 x stands for the input and h x stands for the target mapping function that needs to be learned in resblock we learn the residual mapping f x h x x instead of learning h x directly this way the neural network s output comprises two parts residual mapping f x and direct mapping x the residual mapping can be expressed as 9 y l x l f x l ω l 10 x l 1 f y l where x l stands for the input of the l th resblock ω l stands for the weight of the l th resblock f stands for the residual mapping function generally f is set as relu function f is regarded as an identity mapping x l 1 y l at this time eq 10 can be expressed as 11 x l 1 x l f x l ω l summarize eq 11 in general form 12 x l x l i l l 1 f x i ω i therefore the input signal can be directly transmitted from the low to the high level which solves network degradation to a certain extent according to back propagation the following equation is obtained 13 ε x l ε x l x l x l ε x l 1 x l i l l 1 f x i ω i where ε is the error loss function ε x l can be divided into two parts i ε x l x l i l l 1 f x i ω i propagating through the weight layer ii ε x l directly propagating to the low level without the intermediate weight matrix transformation which somewhat solves the gradient disappearance this study used resnet to transform the deep feedforward neural network and a dbnn was constructed 2 2 3 the dcsm the dcsm made up of the dbnn and drnn surrogate models is expressed as follows 14 y dcsm ω dbnn y dbnn ω drnn y drnn where y dcsm stands for the output of the dcsm y dbnn y drnn stand for the output of dbnn and drnn surrogate models respectively and ω dbnn ω drnn stand for the optimal weight values of dbnn and drnn surrogate models respectively whose sum equals 1 the better the performance of the single surrogate model the higher the precision and the larger the weight in the dcsm the enkf method determines the respective optimal weight values of dbnn and drnn surrogate models its general expression is given in section 2 3 1 2 3 inversion method 2 3 1 the enkf method the enkf method is developed from the kalman filter kf method its core idea is to constantly update the ensemble of variables to be solved through the prediction equation and the update equation finally we get the optimal posterior probability distribution or the optimal estimate value of the variables to be solved sun et al 2020 in the current research we used the core update equation of the enkf method expressed as follows 15 x t k x t k k t z t e t k h t x t k 16 k t d yf d ff r t 1 where x t k x t k stand for the prior before the update and posterior after the update variable vectors of the k th

objective function value 1 the optimization model the optimization model comprises the decision variables objective function and constraint conditions the general expression of the nonlinear

stands for the number of equality constraints 2 iboa a new solution algorithm for the optimization model boa has excellent optimization ability its main idea is to simulate butterflies foraging and mating behaviors and search for the optimal solution through the information interaction and sharing transmission between butterflies in boa each butterfly emits a certain concentration of fragrance valuable information its calculation formula is as follows 18 f c i a where f stands for the fragrance intensity c stands for the sensory modality i stands for the stimulus intensity determined by the objective function and a stands for the power exponent when a butterfly senses the fragrance emitted by other butterflies it moves directly towards the butterfly with the strongest fragrance this process is called global search suppose the butterfly cannot sense the fragrance it moves randomly this process is called local search fan et al 2020 switching probability p is a crucial parameter that can control whether the butterfly performs global search or local search the larger the p the greater the probability of the global search on the contrary the probability of the local search is greater in the previous boa p is often set to a fixed value however if improperly set it could easily change the algorithm to the local optimum thereby becoming problematic to search for the global optimal solution quickly therefore boa was improved in this paper by introducing a dynamic switching probability mechanism to dynamically adjust p eq 19 and an iboa was constructed 19 p i k p min p max p min 2 exp k i max ln 2 1 2 f i k f min k f max k f min k 1 2 where p i k stands for the switching probability of the i th butterfly at the k th iteration p min p max stand for the minimum and maximum p values respectively f i k stands for the objective function value of the i th butterfly at the k th iteration and f min k f max k stand for the minimum and maximum values of the objective function among all butterflies at the k th iteration respectively in iboa p is calculated as the iteration progresses rather than as a fixed value artificially given decreasing adaptively with the iteration in the early stage of iteration p is large and the algorithm performs a global search with a large probability in the later stage of iteration p is small and the algorithm performs a local search with a large probability this can avoid trapping into the local optimum and enhance the solution precision the iboa follows these steps 1 set parameters including the butterfly population size nbf the maximum number of iterations i max p min p max c and a etc the initial position of each butterfly is x i x i 1 x i 2 x i dim dim stands for the number of variables to be identified 2 according to the known objective function f x i is determined and the fragrance of the butterfly is calculated by eq 18 it helps find the position of the butterfly with the strongest fragrance optimal butterfly 3 generate a random number rand with uniform distribution from 0 to 1 then compare it with p i k calculated according to eq 19 to determine whether the butterfly performs global search or local search 4 when rand p i k perform a global search the butterfly will move toward the optimal butterfly position the position update formula is as follows 20 x i k 1 x i k r 2 x best k x i k f i where x i k 1

x i k 1 x i k r 2 x j k x v k f i where x j k x v k stand for the positions of the j th and v th butterflies randomly selected in the population at the k th iteration respectively and r stands for a random number r 0 1 6 determine whether the iteration termination condition is satisfied if so the iteration is terminated and the optimal solution is output otherwise return to 2 and continue the iteration 3 case study this paper used a hypothetical case to verify the effectiveness of the theories and methods here the true value of each variable to be identified is given artificially in advance therefore the identification results obtained by these theories and methods can be compared with the true value enabling the analysis of their effectiveness this is also the advantage of the hypothetical case the technology roadmap of this paper is shown in fig 4 3 1 hypothetical case description the simulation calculation domain was a homogeneous isotropic phreatic aquifer in the hypothetical case the groundwater flowed from northeast to southwest and the aquifer was about 10 m thick fig 5 depicts the schematic of the subdivision simulation calculation domain the generalization of the boundary conditions is shown in fig 6 in the simulation calculation domain one contamination source the contaminant is chlorobenzene which is a dnapl and three monitoring wells w1 w2 w3 were present fig 7 illustrates the potential distribution range of the contamination source and the location distribution of three monitoring wells in the domain table 1 lists some relevant parameters of water and chlorobenzene relevant contamination source information and simulation model parameters are given in table 2 the simulation period is 4 270 days and the contamination source only leaked chlorobenzene in the first ten days the actual monitoring data of chlorobenzene concentrations in three monitoring wells were collected on days 4 090 4 150 4 210 and 4 270 table 3 3 2 selection of variables to be identified in this paper the variables to be identified include two categories contamination source information and simulation model parameters the first category includes lx ly and q as for the second category the local sensitivity analysis method selected the simulation model parameters with high sensitivity to minimize the number of variables to be identified in inversion and reduce the input dimension of the established surrogate model in this paper together with the contamination source information these parameters were fixed as the variables to be identified while other parameters with low sensitivity were fixed as known constants the formula of local sensitivity analysis is as follows 22 s i f x i f x 1 x i x i x m f x 1 x i x m f x 1 x i x m x i x i where s i stands for the sensitivity of the i th model parameter f stands for the output of the multiphase flow numerical simulation model x i stands for the i th model parameter δ x i stands for the change of x i and m stands for the number of model parameters when the change rates of various model parameters are the same the larger the s i the higher the sensitivity of the model parameter in this study six simulation model parameters for local sensitivity analysis exist ϕ k α l w α tw α l o and α t o the results at three monitoring wells are illustrated in figs 8a 8c figs 8a 8c illustrate that among the six simulation model parameters the sensitivity of α l o and α t o was low while the sensitivity of ϕ k α l w and α t w was high based on this these four simulation model parameters ϕ k α l w and α t w and contamination source information lx ly and q were used as the final variables to be identified for this gdcsi at the same time the other two parameters with low sensitivity α l o and α t o were fixed as known constants the true value range and prior probability distribution of each variable to be identified are listed in table 4 3 3 establishment of the dcsm after determining those seven variables to be identified the dcsm was established the specific steps are as follows 1 obtain the training and testing data according to the prior probability distribution in table 4 the latin hypercube sampling method successfully sampled 400 and 60 groups in the ranges of seven variables to be identified to obtain the input samples the multiphase flow numerical simulation model derived the corresponding output samples chlorobenzene concentrations the first 400 and last 60 groups of input output samples constituted the training and testing data respectively 2 establish the dbnn and drnn surrogate models based on the training data the dbnn and drnn surrogate models were trained and established respectively the above operation was realized by matlab in this paper dbnn had three hidden layers and the number of neurons was set to 150 120 and 100 respectively drnn had 15 hidden layers and the number of neurons was set to 64 64 64 64 64 128 128 128 128 256 256 256 256 512 and 512 respectively the initial learning rate of dbnn and drnn was set to 0 005 and 0 0089 respectively 3 establish the dcsm by applying the enkf method when the enkf method described in section 2 3 1 was applied to determine the optimal weight values of the dbnn and drnn surrogate models the ensemble capacity was set to 400 in addition the variable vector was one dimensional a specific value i e the optimal weight value of the dbnn surrogate model the observed data in eq 15 corresponded to the simulation model s outputs chlorobenzene concentrations the outputs of the original model corresponded to the outputs chlorobenzene concentrations of the dcsm as calculated in eq 14 according to eqs 15 and 16 the weight ensemble of the dbnn surrogate model was constantly updated finally the optimal weight value the mean of the weight ensemble of the dbnn surrogate model was obtained and the optimal weight value of the drnn surrogate model was obtained accordingly the dcsm was established the testing data was used to evaluate the precision of the surrogate model this paper used three precision evaluation indexes eqs 23 to 25 including the determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse and mean relative error mre to evaluate the precision of the surrogate model 23 r 2 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 24 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 25 mre 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i 100 where n stands for the total number of outputs of the simulation model surrogate model y i stands for the i th output of the simulation model y i stands for the i th output of the surrogate model and y stands for the mean of the outputs of the simulation model the larger the r2 the closer it is to 1 and the smaller rmse and mre the higher the precision of the surrogate model next in sections 3 4 and 3 5 we respectively adopted the enkf and optimization methods for gdcsi to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the two methods then in section 3 6 according to these strengths and weaknesses we combined the enkf and optimization methods to build a more robust and practical csm for gdcsi further enhancing identification accuracy and effectiveness in these processes the dcsm was used to replace the simulation model for iterative calculation 3 4 application of the enkf method when the enkf method section 2 3 1 was applied for gdcsi the ensemble capacity was set to 600 in addition each variable to be solved corresponded to each variable to be identified accordingly each variable vector corresponded to the values of a set of variables to be identified lx ly q ϕ k α l w and α t w the observed data corresponded to the actual monitoring data of chlorobenzene concentrations to reduce the enormous calculation burden and time caused by recalling the simulation model the established dcsm section 3 3 was embedded to replace the simulation model therefore the outputs of the original model corresponded to the outputs chlorobenzene concentrations of the dcsm as calculated in eq 14 according to eqs 15 and 16 the ensemble of variables to be identified was constantly updated finally the optimal estimate value the mean of the ensemble of each variable to be identified was obtained i e the inversion results 3 5 application of the optimization method to apply the optimization method section 2 3 2 for gdcsi an optimization model was first established in this inversion the decision variables were the seven variables to be identified lx ly q ϕ k α l w and α t w the objective function was the square sum of the errors between the actual monitoring concentration and the calculated output concentration of the dcsm in three monitoring wells at four monitoring times the purpose was to obtain a set of optimal solutions to minimize the objective function value in addition the dcsm was embedded into the optimization model as an equality constraint condition while some inequality constraints were also considered the expression of the nonlinear programming optimization model for gdcsi established in this paper is as follows 26 min t 1 4 k 1 3 c k t c k t 2 s t c k t g l x l y q ϕ k α lw α t w 430 l x 640 50 l y 260 1 q 5 0 22 ϕ 0 28 3500 k 4500 40 α lw 60 9 α t w 15 where c k t and c k t are the calculated output chlorobenzene concentration of the dcsm and actual monitoring chlorobenzene concentration in the k th monitoring well at the t th monitoring time respectively then iboa was used to solve the above optimization model the main parameter settings of iboa are given in table 5 in addition to further analyze the effectiveness of the iboa constructed in this paper the previous boa was also used to solve the above optimization model in the previous boa the setting of p was different from that of the iboa it was set to a fixed value p 0 7 and other parameter settings were the same as those of the iboa as given in table 5 3 6 application of the csm to fully use of the strengths of different methods and overcome the limitations of using the single method we combined the enkf and optimization methods to build a more robust and practical csm for gdcsi to further enhance the identification accuracy and effectiveness the specific steps of csm are as follows 1 firstly the enkf method briskly searched and obtained a set of preliminary identification results of variables to be identified this set of preliminary identification results was used as the starting condition of the subsequent search process to quickly offer a better initial point for the optimization method it should be noted that the identification results of the enkf method had been obtained in section 3 4 so we directly used them as the identification results of the enkf method in the csm that is the set of preliminary identification results in the csm 2 then the optimization method fine searched and obtained the final identification results of variables to be identified specifically based on the optimization model established in section 3 5 the set of preliminary identification results obtained by the enkf method was used to replace the initial position of the worst butterfly in the first iteration of iboa offering a better initial position based on this the iboa was used to continue to solve the optimization model and obtain the final identification result of the variables to be identified the main parameter settings of iboa were the same as those in section 3 5 table 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 performance of the dcsm in this paper we additionally adopted a widely used shallow learning method kriging krg method to establish a shallow learning surrogate model of the simulation model the detailed principle of the krg method is shown in our previous research wang et al 2022 thus we can compare the performance of the krg surrogate model with that of the dbnn and drnn surrogate models to analyze the advantages of the deep learning surrogate models their precision evaluation results at three monitoring wells are compared in table 6 as seen in table 6 each precision evaluation index of the krg surrogate model at three monitoring wells was the worst its performance was worse than the two deep learning surrogate models dbnn and drnn surrogate models therefore compared with the shallow learning surrogate model the deep learning surrogate model has more powerful fitting ability can handle a more complex nonlinear mapping relationship and has higher approximation accuracy to the complex simulation model next we analyzed the performance of the dcsm according to the enkf method the optimal weight values of the dbnn and drnn surrogate models were 0 6396 and 0 3604 respectively the precision evaluation results of the dcsm at three monitoring wells are given in table 6 as calculated from table 6 the means of r2 rmse and mre were 0 9954 180 04 μg l and 8 16 respectively therefore the constructed dcsm exhibited excellent approximation precision to the simulation model to further verify the effectiveness of the dcsm it was compared with the dbnn and drnn surrogate models their r2 rmse and mre at three monitoring wells are compared in figs 9a 9c figs 9a 9c illustrate the performance of three surrogate models for w1 dbnn surrogate model drnn surrogate model dcsm for w2 and w3 drnn surrogate model dbnn surrogate model dcsm the performance of the two single surrogate models dbnn and drnn surrogate models was different at various monitoring wells i e the applicability and fitting ability of each single surrogate model was often different for the same problem this paper used the enkf method to combine the dbnn and drnn surrogate models to construct the dcsm by comparison dcsm exhibited superior r2 rmse and mre over the two single surrogate models at three monitoring wells therefore the constructed dcsm combined the strengths of two single surrogate models and learned from each other the overall approximation precision and applicability to the groundwater dnapl contamination multiphase flow numerical simulation model were improved the dcsm can better replace the simulation model to complete the subsequent iterative calculation process however it will be meaningless if the dcsm only performs well on current data therefore we evaluated the overall generalization ability ga of the three surrogate models dbnn surrogate model drnn surrogate model and dcsm at three monitoring wells to test whether the dcsm still has the advantage on new data the evaluation equation of ga is as follows yoon et al 2011 27 i ga rmse in testing stage rmse in training stage the closer the index value is to unity the stronger the ga is through calculation the overall index values of the dbnn surrogate model drnn surrogate model and dcsm at three monitoring wells were 1 23 1 31 and 1 06 respectively compared with the two single deep learning surrogate models the index value of the dcsm was the closest to unity which proved that the ga of the dcsm was the strongest therefore if the dcsm constructed in this paper is popularized and applied to new data it can still show stronger advantages compared with the single surrogate model in addition when the csm was applied for gdcsi the multiphase flow numerical simulation model needed to be called 602 500 times once forward calculation of the simulation model took about 8 min the computer hardware condition cpu intel core i3 4130 3 40 ghz 8 gb if the computer works continuously it will take about 3 348 days to complete which is too time consuming however in the current study it took only about three days to establish and call the dcsm therefore applying the dcsm to complete the subsequent iterative calculation process can significantly reduce the calculation burden and time thereby enhancing the inversion efficiency 4 2 performance of the iboa to compare the solution effects of the boa and iboa the convergence curves of two algorithms were drawn fig 10 the objective function value vertical ordinate was converted into logarithmic form to compare the difference between the two convergence curves more clearly in the whole iteration process fig 10 the convergence curve of the iboa was almost lower than the boa when the same objective function value was found the number of iterations required by the iboa was less than that of the boa the gap between the two was more evident in the middle and late stages of the iteration which proved that the iboa had a faster convergence speed and higher search efficiency when the number of iterations was the same the objective function value obtained by the iboa was smaller this condition was also apparent at the end of the iteration 3000 generations this research intends to find a set of optimal solutions to minimize the objective function value so the smaller the objective function value the closer the set of optimal solutions searched was to the true value therefore compared with the boa the set of optimal solutions searched by the iboa was closer to the true value the iboa had a stronger optimization effect moreover from fig 10 the convergence curve of the boa gradually stagnated in varying degrees as the iteration progressed after about 1200 generations the boa fell into the local optimum while more inflection points in the convergence curve of the iboa it proved that the iboa had stronger ability to jump out of the local optimum to further compare the solution effects of the boa and iboa more reasonably table 7 shows the results of the two algorithms while fig 11 shows the relative error comparison of the two algorithms compared with the boa table 7 and fig 11 the iboa results were closer to the true values on the whole although the solution precision of the two variables q and ϕ in the iboa was slightly lower than the boa s those of the other five variables were enhanced significantly further calculation showed that the maximum relative error maxre and mre of the boa results were 21 56 and 11 62 respectively while those of the iboa results were reduced to 10 25 and 6 26 respectively therefore the iboa significantly reduced the overall error and enhanced the solution precision on the whole in summary this paper constructed an iboa by improving the previous boa the iboa has stronger optimization ability and can prevent the search process from trapping into the local optimum thereby enhancing the solution precision of the optimization model for gdcsi it is effective and feasible therefore the optimization method in sections 4 3 and 4 4 is based on the iboa 4 3 comparison of the two single methods table 8 lists the identification results obtained when the enkf and optimization methods were applied individually to further analyze their strengths and weaknesses the relative error of the enkf and optimization methods results were compared fig 12 when the enkf method was applied for gdcsi table 8 and fig 12 the identification result of q was the worst the maxre reached 41 57 while the mre was 10 42 therefore when the nonlinear degree of the inverse problem is strong the fine search ability of the enkf method is weak the identification results obtained are not stable and the identification accuracy is low these situations may be because the kf method was initially proposed based on the linear estimation theory as a development of the kf method the enkf method breaks the limitation that the kf method can only deal with linear problems while the enkf method can deal with nonlinear problems however when the nonlinear degree of the problem is strong its solution accuracy will likely decline in contrast the optimization method s identification effect for each variable to be identified was relatively stable although the identification results of some variables were inferior to those of enkf method the overall identification accuracy of the optimization method was high the maxre was only 10 25 and the mre was mere 6 26 the optimization method had stronger fine search ability however the optimization method usually relies on selecting the initial point if the initial point is far from the true value obtaining the optimal solution would be difficult therefore if a better initial point is available for the optimization method its identification accuracy will be further enhanced in addition whether it was the enkf method or optimization method the time cost spent in gdcsi was mainly reflected in the model call therefore the number of model calls required by the two single methods for gdcsi can be approximated to evaluate the calculation speed in this paper the enkf and optimization methods needed to call the model just 2 400 and 600 100 times respectively hence the enkf method has a faster calculation speed in summary both methods have their strengths and weaknesses the enkf method has the strengths of fast calculation speed and simple call however when the nonlinear degree of the inverse problem is strong its fine search ability is weak and the identification accuracy declines on the other hand the strength of the optimization method is strong fine search ability however it relies on the initial point selection if a better initial point can be offered its identification accuracy will be further enhanced 4 4 performance of the csm the results of the csm constructed from combining the enkf and optimization methods are compared with those of the enkf and optimization methods table 8 the maxre and mre of the three methods are listed in table 9 while the relative errors are compared in fig 13 as tables 8 and 9 and fig 13 illustrate the maxre and mre of the csm were reduced to 9 91 and 3 05 respectively the csm performed excellently better than individual enkf and optimization methods compared with the enkf method the discrepancy was meager although the identification accuracy of two variables to be identified in the csm was inferior to that of enkf the csm s improvement of the identification accuracy of other variables was apparent especially for q it was proved that in the csm the optimization method with strong fine search ability could be used to compensate for enkf shortcomings weak fine search ability when dealing with strong nonlinear inverse problems and enhance the overall identification accuracy compared with the optimization method csm s identification effect for each variable to be identified was enhanced and the error level was reduced it was proved that in the csm the enkf method could quickly offer a better initial point for the optimization method enhancing the search effect and identification accuracy in conclusion the csm constructed in this paper by combining the enkf and optimization methods combines the strengths of each method and overcomes their respective limitations on the one hand the enkf method with fast calculation speed and simple call offers a better initial point quickly for the optimization method whereas the optimization method with strong fine search ability caters for the weak fine search ability of the enkf method when dealing with strong nonlinear inverse problems combining the two methods enhances identification accuracy and effectiveness of gdcsi significantly 4 5 discussion as an approximation of the simulation model the surrogate model can approach the simulation model in function and also significantly reduce the computation burden and time which has an excellent research significance a suitable establishment method of the surrogate model can enhance the approximation precision to the simulation model itself in this paper a novel establishment method of the combined surrogate model the enkf method with fast calculation speed and simple call combined two deep learning surrogate models dbnn and drnn surrogate models a dcsm was established to enhance the approximation precision and applicability to the complex simulation model as a future study researchers are encouraged to continue exploring other better establishment methods of the combined surrogate model on the other hand researchers can consider combining more potential deep learning surrogate models to further enhance the approximation precision and applicability among the many theories and methods of groundwater contamination source identification each has peculiar strengths and weaknesses in this paper and our previous study wang et al 2022 we combined the two widely used methods the enkf and optimization methods to learn from each other and achieved relatively ideal results in the future researchers are encouraged to consider combining other methods with better performance to integrate and complement each other thereby exploring the novel theory and technique for groundwater contamination source identification 5 conclusions first for the optimization method to further enhance the solution precision of the optimization model for gdcsi an iboa was constructed by introducing the dynamic switching probability mechanism in the previous boa next we respectively adopted the enkf method and optimization method based on the iboa for gdcsi to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the two methods then according to these strengths and weaknesses we combined the two methods to build a more robust and practical csm for gdcsi further enhancing identification accuracy and effectiveness in addition this study innovatively applied the enkf method to combine two single deep learning surrogate models the dcsm was established to further enhance the approximation precision and applicability to the complex simulation model finally the results of the csm were compared with those of two single methods to analyze its effectiveness we conclude as follows 1 compared with the two single deep learning surrogate models the evaluation indexes of the dcsm established by the enkf method in this paper were the best at three monitoring wells the means of r2 rmse and mre were 0 9954 180 04 μg l and 8 16 respectively the dcsm further enhanced the approximation precision and applicability to the groundwater dnapl contamination multiphase flow numerical simulation model 2 compared with the previous boa the mre and maxre of the iboa solution results were better reduced to 6 26 and 10 25 respectively the iboa had stronger optimization ability that could prevent the search process from trapping into the local optimum and enhance the solution precision of the optimization model for gdcsi 3 in the csm the enkf method with fast calculation speed and simple call quickly offered a better initial point for the optimization method on the other hand the optimization method with strong fine search ability compensated for the weak fine search ability of the enkf method when dealing with strong nonlinear inverse problems the mre and maxre of the csm identification results were merely 3 05 and 9 91 respectively as a consequence the constructed csm significantly enhanced the identification accuracy and effectiveness of gdcsi compared with any single method declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgment this research was supported by the national natural

2614,ensemble kalman filter enkf and optimization methods are two mainstream methods in groundwater contamination source identification but most researchers usually only use or improve on one method however each method has strengths and weaknesses and using one method alone may cause inaccuracy of the identification results for complex situations therefore it is necessary to explore the combination of methods in this paper for the optimization method to further enhance the solution precision of the optimization model for groundwater dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl contamination source identification gdcsi we first constructed an improved butterfly optimization algorithm by introducing the dynamic switching probability mechanism in the previous butterfly optimization algorithm next the enkf method and optimization method based on the improved butterfly optimization algorithm were used respectively for gdcsi to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the methods then according to the strengths and weaknesses of the enkf and optimization methods the two methods were merged to build a more robust and practical combined search method csm for gdcsi to further enhance the identification accuracy and effectiveness in addition we innovatively applied the enkf method to combine two single deep learning surrogate models the deep belief neural network surrogate model and the deep residual neural network surrogate model and a deep learning combined surrogate model was established which further enhanced the approximation precision and applicability to the groundwater dnapl contamination multiphase flow numerical simulation model finally the results of csm were compared with those of two single methods to analyze the former s effectiveness the results showed that the csm significantly improved the identification accuracy and effectiveness of gdcsi compared with any single method keywords combined search method deep learning surrogate model ensemble kalman filter groundwater dnapl contamination improved butterfly optimization algorithm data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction in producing and transporting petroleum products organic contaminants often leak into the underground aquifer due to accidents or improper operation polluting the groundwater the dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl contamination is often more difficult to remediate than the light non aqueous phase liquid contamination requiring longer remediation time and expensive remediation costs to obtain satisfactory results therefore it is imperative to formulate a reasonable and efficient remediation scheme designing an affordable and efficient remediation scheme is based on understanding and mastering the relevant information about the groundwater dnapl contamination source jiang et al 2021 researching groundwater dnapl contamination source identification gdcsi has a practical significance the optimization method is a mainstream method for groundwater contamination source identification ayvaz 2016 li et al 2022b wang and lu 2022 it establishes and solves the optimization model until an optimal solution is obtained to minimize or maximize the objective function value generally when the optimization method is used for gdcsi the optimization model is characterized by many variables to be identified and a high degree of nonlinearity hou et al 2021 heuristic algorithms have been widely used in solving optimization models guneshwor et al 2018 li et al 2021a singh and datta 2006 the butterfly optimization algorithm boa arora and singh 2019 is a new heuristic algorithm that simulates butterflies feeding and mating behavior it has excellent optimization ability and strong applicability to high and low dimensional optimization problems boa exhibits high applicability prospects however when applying boa to solve the complex optimization model the search process may be trapped in the local optimum long et al 2021 long et al 2022 therefore it is urgent to explore an effective strategy to improve the previous boa to avoid trapping into the local optimum and enhance the solution precision of the optimization model for gdcsi the ensemble kalman filter enkf method evensen 1994 is also a mainstream inversion method in previous studies most researchers employed or improved on one method ayvaz 2010 han et al 2020 li et al 2021b li et al 2022a pan et al 2022 xu and gomez hernandez 2016 xu and gomez hernandez 2018 however each method has strengths and weaknesses the optimization method has strong fine search ability but depends on the initial point selection suppose the initial point is far from the true value the convergence speed becomes slow or easily gets trapped in premature convergence making it challenging to obtain the optimal solution hou et al 2021 wang et al 2022 moreover the optimization method cannot consider the uncertainty of the variables to be identified it can only obtain the point estimation bai et al 2022 chang et al 2021a ma and zabaras 2009 zhang et al 2015 in contrast the enkf method can fully consider the uncertainty of the variables to be identified it can obtain the point estimation and realize the interval estimation mo et al 2019 the enkf method has the strengths of fast calculation speed and simple call it can solve the inverse problem with fewer simulation model calls therefore in recent years the enkf method and its variants have gradually attracted wide attention in groundwater contamination source identification with excellent performance chen et al 2018 chen et al 2021 dodangeh et al 2022 xu and gomez hernandez 2016 xu and gomez hernandez 2018 however when the inverse problem is complex the fine search ability of this method is weak and the identification accuracy may be significantly reduced therefore using one method alone may cause inaccuracy of the identification results for complex situations and it is necessary to explore combining the two methods so this paper combined the enkf and optimization methods to build a more robust and practical combined search method csm for gdcsi to further enhance the identification accuracy and effectiveness so far no report on gdcsi exists that involves combining these methods in addition an iterative calculation is often involved in gdcsi the multiphase flow numerical simulation model must be called repeatedly inducing enormous calculation burden and time however the surrogate model of the simulation model can better solve this problem li et al 2020 lu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 yan et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 the surrogate model can approach the simulation model in function and significantly reduce the calculation burden and tediousness chang et al 2021b zhao et al 2015 a suitable establishment method of the surrogate model can enhance the approximation precision to the simulation model itself compared with the shallow learning surrogate model established by the shallow learning method the deep learning surrogate model established by the deep learning method can show stronger strengths chang et al 2022 ensuring the approximation precision to the multiphase flow numerical simulation model is higher however for the same problem the applicability and fitting ability of different single surrogate models often varies wang et al 2020 to fully use of the strengths of different single surrogate models it is necessary to explore effective methods to combine single surrogate models and establish a combined surrogate model in existing reports establishing a combined surrogate model mainly includes the set pair analysis method hou et al 2017 optimization method wang and lu 2021 adaptive metropolis markov chain monte carlo method xing et al 2019 and entropy weight method wang et al 2020 etc however exploring other better establishment methods of the combined surrogate model is still necessary to further enhance the approximation precision and applicability to the complex simulation model in this paper a novel establishment method of the combined surrogate model the enkf method with fast calculation speed and simple call combined two deep learning surrogate models the deep belief neural network dbnn surrogate model and the deep residual neural network drnn surrogate model and a deep learning combined surrogate model dcsm was established to enhance the approximation precision and applicability to the multiphase flow numerical simulation model currently no report exists on applying the enkf method to establish a combined surrogate model the main objective of this paper is to apply the csm based on the dcsm to simultaneously identify the groundwater dnapl contamination source information and simulation model parameters the main contributions are as follows 1 construct an improved butterfly optimization algorithm iboa by introducing the dynamic switching probability mechanism in the previous boa which further enhanced the solution precision of the optimization model for gdcsi 2 to further enhance the identification accuracy and effectiveness a more robust and practical csm by combining the enkf and optimization methods was constructed for gdcsi 3 combine two single deep learning surrogate models dbnn and drnn surrogate models by applying the enkf method to construct a dcsm further enhancing the approximation precision and applicability to the groundwater dnapl contamination multiphase flow numerical simulation model 2 methodology and theory 2 1 multiphase flow numerical simulation model

utchem developed by the university of texas solved the above multiphase flow numerical simulation model 2 2 surrogate model 2 2 1 the dbnn method the dbnn is a deep learning method since its proposal hinton et al 2006 it has been widely used in many fields dbnn comprises several stacked restricted boltzmann machines rbm and a top level algorithm the stacked rbm extracts the features of the input data layer by layer while the top level algorithm predicts the output results this paper selected the bp neural network algorithm as the top level algorithm the schematic of rbm is shown in fig 1 the training process of dbnn mainly includes two stages unsupervised learning training and supervised learning training the schematic of dbnn is shown in fig 2 1 the unsupervised learning training stage here rbm is trained layer by layer from the bottom up to extract essential of the input data for a set of states v h the joint probability distribution is as follows 2 p v h θ e e v h θ z θ 3 z θ v h

n a i v i j 1 m b j h j i 1 n j 1 m ω ij v i h j we continuously adjust and update the model parameters so that the rbm probability distribution corresponding to the set of model parameters and the probability distribution of the input data in the training samples are as close as possible it minimizes the energy function value that is it maximizes the likelihood function 5 l θ i 1 l ln p v i h 6

supervised learning training stage in the unsupervised learning training stage the training process is independent for each rbm only the parameters of each rbm can be guaranteed as optimal unlike the whole dbnn model therefore the next step involves carrying out the supervised learning training in this stage the model parameters of the network need are fine tuned for the model parameters to converge to the global optimal solution to find the optimal dbnn model the specific parameter update formula is as follows 7 ω ij ω ij η e r j ω ij 8 b j b j η e r j b j where η stands for the learning rate and erj stands for the loss function 2 2 2 the drnn method practical research shows that if the neural network layer is stacked its performance will not consistently improve and its precision may decline after the depth reaches a certain degree this phenomenon is called network degradation and sometimes gradient disappearance occurs to solve the above problems he et al 2016 proposed the residual network resnet unlike the ordinary neural network the core of resnet is the residual block resblock fig 3 x stands for the input and h x stands for the target mapping function that needs to be learned in resblock we learn the residual mapping f x h x x instead of learning h x directly this way the neural network s output comprises two parts residual mapping f x and direct mapping x the residual mapping can be expressed as 9 y l x l f x l ω l 10 x l 1 f y l where x l stands for the input of the l th resblock ω l stands for the weight of the l th resblock f stands for the residual mapping function generally f is set as relu function f is regarded as an identity mapping x l 1 y l at this time eq 10 can be expressed as 11 x l 1 x l f x l ω l summarize eq 11 in general form 12 x l x l i l l 1 f x i ω i therefore the input signal can be directly transmitted from the low to the high level which solves network degradation to a certain extent according to back propagation the following equation is obtained 13 ε x l ε x l x l x l ε x l 1 x l i l l 1 f x i ω i where ε is the error loss function ε x l can be divided into two parts i ε x l x l i l l 1 f x i ω i propagating through the weight layer ii ε x l directly propagating to the low level without the intermediate weight matrix transformation which somewhat solves the gradient disappearance this study used resnet to transform the deep feedforward neural network and a dbnn was constructed 2 2 3 the dcsm the dcsm made up of the dbnn and drnn surrogate models is expressed as follows 14 y dcsm ω dbnn y dbnn ω drnn y drnn where y dcsm stands for the output of the dcsm y dbnn y drnn stand for the output of dbnn and drnn surrogate models respectively and ω dbnn ω drnn stand for the optimal weight values of dbnn and drnn surrogate models respectively whose sum equals 1 the better the performance of the single surrogate model the higher the precision and the larger the weight in the dcsm the enkf method determines the respective optimal weight values of dbnn and drnn surrogate models its general expression is given in section 2 3 1 2 3 inversion method 2 3 1 the enkf method the enkf method is developed from the kalman filter kf method its core idea is to constantly update the ensemble of variables to be solved through the prediction equation and the update equation finally we get the optimal posterior probability distribution or the optimal estimate value of the variables to be solved sun et al 2020 in the current research we used the core update equation of the enkf method expressed as follows 15 x t k x t k k t z t e t k h t x t k 16 k t d yf d ff r t 1 where x t k x t k stand for the prior before the update and posterior after the update variable vectors of the k th

stands for the number of equality constraints 2 iboa a new solution algorithm for the optimization model boa has excellent optimization ability its main idea is to simulate butterflies foraging and mating behaviors and search for the optimal solution through the information interaction and sharing transmission between butterflies in boa each butterfly emits a certain concentration of fragrance valuable information its calculation formula is as follows 18 f c i a where f stands for the fragrance intensity c stands for the sensory modality i stands for the stimulus intensity determined by the objective function and a stands for the power exponent when a butterfly senses the fragrance emitted by other butterflies it moves directly towards the butterfly with the strongest fragrance this process is called global search suppose the butterfly cannot sense the fragrance it moves randomly this process is called local search fan et al 2020 switching probability p is a crucial parameter that can control whether the butterfly performs global search or local search the larger the p the greater the probability of the global search on the contrary the probability of the local search is greater in the previous boa p is often set to a fixed value however if improperly set it could easily change the algorithm to the local optimum thereby becoming problematic to search for the global optimal solution quickly therefore boa was improved in this paper by introducing a dynamic switching probability mechanism to dynamically adjust p eq 19 and an iboa was constructed 19 p i k p min p

maximum p values respectively f i k stands for the objective function value of the i th butterfly at the k th iteration and f min k f max k stand for the minimum and maximum values of the objective function among all butterflies at the k th iteration respectively in iboa p is calculated as the iteration progresses rather than as a fixed value artificially given decreasing adaptively with the iteration in the early stage of iteration p is large and the algorithm performs a global search with a large probability in the later stage of iteration p is small and the algorithm performs a local search with a large probability this can avoid trapping into the local optimum and enhance the solution precision the iboa follows these steps 1 set parameters including the butterfly population size nbf the maximum number of iterations i max p min p max c and a etc the initial position of each butterfly is x i x i 1 x i 2 x i dim dim stands for the number of variables to be identified 2 according to the known objective function f x i is determined and the fragrance of the butterfly is calculated by eq 18 it helps find the position of the butterfly with the strongest fragrance optimal butterfly 3 generate a random number rand with uniform distribution from 0 to 1 then compare it with p i k calculated according to eq 19 to determine whether the butterfly performs global search or local search 4 when rand p i k perform a global search the butterfly will move toward the optimal butterfly position the position update formula is as follows 20 x i k 1 x i k r 2 x best k x i k f i where x i k 1

fragrance intensity of the i th butterfly and r stands for a random number r 0 1 5 when rand p i k perform a local search the butterfly will move randomly the position update formula is as follows 21 x i k 1 x i k r 2 x j k x v k f i where x j k x v k stand for the positions of the j th and v th butterflies randomly selected in the population at the k th iteration respectively and r stands for a random number r 0 1 6 determine whether the iteration termination condition is satisfied if so the iteration is terminated and the optimal solution is output otherwise return to 2 and continue the iteration 3 case study this paper used a hypothetical case to verify the effectiveness of the theories and methods here the true value of each variable to be identified is given artificially in advance therefore the identification results obtained by these theories and methods can be compared with the true value enabling the analysis of their effectiveness this is also the advantage of the hypothetical case the technology roadmap of this paper is shown in fig 4 3 1 hypothetical case description the simulation calculation domain was a homogeneous isotropic phreatic aquifer in the hypothetical case the groundwater flowed from northeast to southwest and the aquifer was about 10 m thick fig 5 depicts the schematic of the subdivision simulation calculation domain the generalization of the boundary conditions is shown in fig 6 in the simulation calculation domain one contamination source the contaminant is chlorobenzene which is a dnapl and three monitoring wells w1 w2 w3 were present fig 7 illustrates the potential distribution range of the contamination source and the location distribution of three monitoring wells in the domain table 1 lists some relevant parameters of water and chlorobenzene relevant contamination source information and simulation model parameters are given in table 2 the simulation period is 4 270 days and the contamination source only leaked chlorobenzene in the first ten days the actual monitoring data of chlorobenzene concentrations in three monitoring wells were collected on days 4 090 4 150 4 210 and 4 270 table 3 3 2 selection of variables to be identified in this paper the variables to be identified include two categories contamination source information and simulation model parameters the first category includes lx ly and q as for the second category the local sensitivity analysis method selected the simulation model parameters with high sensitivity to minimize the number of variables to be identified in inversion and reduce the input dimension of the established surrogate model in this paper together with the contamination source information these parameters were fixed as the variables to be identified while other parameters with low sensitivity were fixed as known constants the formula of local sensitivity analysis is as follows 22 s i f x i f x 1 x i x i x m f x 1 x i x m f x 1 x i x m x i x i where s i stands for the sensitivity of the i th model parameter f stands for the output of the multiphase flow numerical simulation model x i stands for the i th model parameter δ x i stands for the change of x i and m stands for the number of model parameters when the change rates of various model parameters are the same the larger the s i the higher the sensitivity of the model parameter in this study six simulation model parameters for local sensitivity analysis exist ϕ k α l w α tw α l o and α t o the results at three monitoring wells are illustrated in figs 8a 8c figs 8a 8c illustrate that among the six simulation model parameters the sensitivity of α l o and α t o was low while the sensitivity of ϕ k α l w and α t w was high based on this these four simulation model parameters ϕ k α l w and α t w and contamination source information lx ly and q were used as the final variables to be identified for this gdcsi at the same time the other two parameters with low sensitivity α l o and α t o were fixed as known constants the true value range and prior probability distribution of each variable to be identified are listed in table 4 3 3 establishment of the dcsm after determining those seven variables to be identified the dcsm was established the specific steps are as follows 1 obtain the training and testing data according to the prior probability distribution in table 4 the latin hypercube sampling method successfully sampled 400 and 60 groups in the ranges of seven variables to be identified to obtain the input samples the multiphase flow numerical simulation model derived the corresponding output samples chlorobenzene concentrations the first 400 and last 60 groups of input output samples constituted the training and testing data respectively 2 establish the dbnn and drnn surrogate models based on the training data the dbnn and drnn surrogate models were trained and established respectively the above operation was realized by matlab in this paper dbnn had three hidden layers and the number of neurons was set to 150 120 and 100 respectively drnn had 15 hidden layers and the number of neurons was set to 64 64 64 64 64 128 128 128 128 256 256 256 256 512 and 512 respectively the initial learning rate of dbnn and drnn was set to 0 005 and 0 0089 respectively 3 establish the dcsm by applying the enkf method when the enkf method described in section 2 3 1 was applied to determine the optimal weight values of the dbnn and drnn surrogate models the ensemble capacity was set to 400 in addition the variable vector was one dimensional a specific value i e the optimal weight value of the dbnn surrogate model the observed data in eq 15 corresponded to the simulation model s outputs chlorobenzene concentrations the outputs of the original model corresponded to the outputs chlorobenzene concentrations of the dcsm as calculated in eq 14 according to eqs 15 and 16 the weight ensemble of the dbnn surrogate model was constantly updated finally the optimal weight value the mean of the weight ensemble of the dbnn surrogate model was obtained and the optimal weight value of the drnn surrogate model was obtained accordingly the dcsm was established the testing data was used to evaluate the precision of the surrogate model this paper used three precision evaluation indexes eqs 23 to 25 including the determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse and mean relative error mre to evaluate the precision of the surrogate model 23 r 2 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 24 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 25 mre 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i 100 where n stands for the total number of outputs of the simulation model surrogate model y i stands for the i th output of the simulation model y i stands for the i th output of the surrogate model and y stands for the mean of the outputs of the simulation model the larger the r2 the closer it is to 1 and the smaller rmse and mre the higher the precision of the surrogate model next in sections 3 4 and 3 5 we respectively adopted the enkf and optimization methods for gdcsi to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the two methods then in section 3 6 according to these strengths and weaknesses we combined the enkf and optimization methods to build a more robust and practical csm for gdcsi further enhancing identification accuracy and effectiveness in these processes the dcsm was used to replace the simulation model for iterative calculation 3 4 application of the enkf method when the enkf method section 2 3 1 was applied for gdcsi the ensemble capacity was set to 600 in addition each variable to be solved corresponded to each variable to be identified accordingly each variable vector corresponded to the values of a set of variables to be identified lx ly q ϕ k α l w and α t w the observed data corresponded to the actual monitoring data of chlorobenzene concentrations to reduce the enormous calculation burden and time caused by recalling the simulation model the established dcsm section 3 3 was embedded to replace the simulation model therefore the outputs of the original model corresponded to the outputs chlorobenzene concentrations of the dcsm as calculated in eq 14 according to eqs 15 and 16 the ensemble of variables to be identified was constantly updated finally the optimal estimate value the mean of the ensemble of each variable to be identified was obtained i e the inversion results 3 5 application of the optimization method to apply the optimization method section 2 3 2 for gdcsi an optimization model was first established in this inversion the decision variables were the seven variables to be identified lx ly q ϕ k α l w and α t w the objective function was the square sum of the errors between the actual monitoring concentration and the calculated output concentration of the dcsm in three monitoring wells at four monitoring times the purpose was to obtain a set of optimal solutions to minimize the objective function value in addition the dcsm was embedded into the optimization model as an equality constraint condition while some inequality constraints were also considered the expression of the nonlinear programming optimization model for gdcsi established in this paper is as follows 26 min t 1 4 k 1 3 c k t c k t 2 s t c k t g l x l y q ϕ k α lw α t w 430 l x 640 50 l y 260 1 q 5 0 22 ϕ 0 28 3500 k 4500 40 α lw 60 9 α t w 15 where c k t and c k t are the calculated output chlorobenzene concentration of the dcsm and actual monitoring chlorobenzene concentration in the k th monitoring well at the t th monitoring time respectively then iboa was used to solve the above optimization model the main parameter settings of iboa are given in table 5 in addition to further analyze the effectiveness of the iboa constructed in this paper the previous boa was also used to solve the above optimization model in the previous boa the setting of p was different from that of the iboa it was set to a fixed value p 0 7 and other parameter settings were the same as those of the iboa as given in table 5 3 6 application of the csm to fully use of the strengths of different methods and overcome the limitations of using the single method we combined the enkf and optimization methods to build a more robust and practical csm for gdcsi to further enhance the identification accuracy and effectiveness the specific steps of csm are as follows 1 firstly the enkf method briskly searched and obtained a set of preliminary identification results of variables to be identified this set of preliminary identification results was used as the starting condition of the subsequent search process to quickly offer a better initial point for the optimization method it should be noted that the identification results of the enkf method had been obtained in section 3 4 so we directly used them as the identification results of the enkf method in the csm that is the set of preliminary identification results in the csm 2 then the optimization method fine searched and obtained the final identification results of variables to be identified specifically based on the optimization model established in section 3 5 the set of preliminary identification results obtained by the enkf method was used to replace the initial position of the worst butterfly in the first iteration of iboa offering a better initial position based on this the iboa was used to continue to solve the optimization model and obtain the final identification result of the variables to be identified the main parameter settings of iboa were the same as those in section 3 5 table 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 performance of the dcsm in this paper we additionally adopted a widely used shallow learning method kriging krg method to establish a shallow learning surrogate model of the simulation model the detailed principle of the krg method is shown in our previous research wang et al 2022 thus we can compare the performance of the krg surrogate model with that of the dbnn and drnn surrogate models to analyze the advantages of the deep learning surrogate models their precision evaluation results at three monitoring wells are compared in table 6 as seen in table 6 each precision evaluation index of the krg surrogate model at three monitoring wells was the worst its performance was worse than the two deep learning surrogate models dbnn and drnn surrogate models therefore compared with the shallow learning surrogate model the deep learning surrogate model has more powerful fitting ability can handle a more complex nonlinear mapping relationship and has higher approximation accuracy to the complex simulation model next we analyzed the performance of the dcsm according to the enkf method the optimal weight values of the dbnn and drnn surrogate models were 0 6396 and 0 3604 respectively the precision evaluation results of the dcsm at three monitoring wells are given in table 6 as calculated from table 6 the means of r2 rmse and mre were 0 9954 180 04 μg l and 8 16 respectively therefore the constructed dcsm exhibited excellent approximation precision to the simulation model to further verify the effectiveness of the dcsm it was compared with the dbnn and drnn surrogate models their r2 rmse and mre at three monitoring wells are compared in figs 9a 9c figs 9a 9c illustrate the performance of three surrogate models for w1 dbnn surrogate model drnn surrogate model dcsm for w2 and w3 drnn surrogate model dbnn surrogate model dcsm the performance of the two single surrogate models dbnn and drnn surrogate models was different at various monitoring wells i e the applicability and fitting ability of each single surrogate model was often different for the same problem this paper used the enkf method to combine the dbnn and drnn surrogate models to construct the dcsm by comparison dcsm exhibited superior r2 rmse and mre over the two single surrogate models at three monitoring wells therefore the constructed dcsm combined the strengths of two single surrogate models and learned from each other the overall approximation precision and applicability to the groundwater dnapl contamination multiphase flow numerical simulation model were improved the dcsm can better replace the simulation model to complete the subsequent iterative calculation process however it will be meaningless if the dcsm only performs well on current data therefore we evaluated the overall generalization ability ga of the three surrogate models dbnn surrogate model drnn surrogate model and dcsm at three monitoring wells to test whether the dcsm still has the advantage on new data the evaluation equation of ga is as follows yoon et al 2011 27 i ga rmse in testing stage rmse in training stage the closer the index value is to unity the stronger the ga is through calculation the overall index values of the dbnn surrogate model drnn surrogate model and dcsm at three monitoring wells were 1 23 1 31 and 1 06 respectively compared with the two single deep learning surrogate models the index value of the dcsm was the closest to unity which proved that the ga of the dcsm was the strongest therefore if the dcsm constructed in this paper is popularized and applied to new data it can still show stronger advantages compared with the single surrogate model in addition when the csm was applied for gdcsi the multiphase flow numerical simulation model needed to be called 602 500 times once forward calculation of the simulation model took about 8 min the computer hardware condition cpu intel core i3 4130 3 40 ghz 8 gb if the computer works continuously it will take about 3 348 days to complete which is too time consuming however in the current study it took only about three days to establish and call the dcsm therefore applying the dcsm to complete the subsequent iterative calculation process can significantly reduce the calculation burden and time thereby enhancing the inversion efficiency 4 2 performance of the iboa to compare the solution effects of the boa and iboa the convergence curves of two algorithms were drawn fig 10 the objective function value vertical ordinate was converted into logarithmic form to compare the difference between the two convergence curves more clearly in the whole iteration process fig 10 the convergence curve of the iboa was almost lower than the boa when the same objective function value was found the number of iterations required by the iboa was less than that of the boa the gap between the two was more evident in the middle and late stages of the iteration which proved that the iboa had a faster convergence speed and higher search efficiency when the number of iterations was the same the objective function value obtained by the iboa was smaller this condition was also apparent at the end of the iteration 3000 generations this research intends to find a set of optimal solutions to minimize the objective function value so the smaller the objective function value the closer the set of optimal solutions searched was to the true value therefore compared with the boa the set of optimal solutions searched by the iboa was closer to the true value the iboa had a stronger optimization effect moreover from fig 10 the convergence curve of the boa gradually stagnated in varying degrees as the iteration progressed after about 1200 generations the boa fell into the local optimum while more inflection points in the convergence curve of the iboa it proved that the iboa had stronger ability to jump out of the local optimum to further compare the solution effects of the boa and iboa more reasonably table 7 shows the results of the two algorithms while fig 11 shows the relative error comparison of the two algorithms compared with the boa table 7 and fig 11 the iboa results were closer to the true values on the whole although the solution precision of the two variables q and ϕ in the iboa was slightly lower than the boa s those of the other five variables were enhanced significantly further calculation showed that the maximum relative error maxre and mre of the boa results were 21 56 and 11 62 respectively while those of the iboa results were reduced to 10 25 and 6 26 respectively therefore the iboa significantly reduced the overall error and enhanced the solution precision on the whole in summary this paper constructed an iboa by improving the previous boa the iboa has stronger optimization ability and can prevent the search process from trapping into the local optimum thereby enhancing the solution precision of the optimization model for gdcsi it is effective and feasible therefore the optimization method in sections 4 3 and 4 4 is based on the iboa 4 3 comparison of the two single methods table 8 lists the identification results obtained when the enkf and optimization methods were applied individually to further analyze their strengths and weaknesses the relative error of the enkf and optimization methods results were compared fig 12 when the enkf method was applied for gdcsi table 8 and fig 12 the identification result of q was the worst the maxre reached 41 57 while the mre was 10 42 therefore when the nonlinear degree of the inverse problem is strong the fine search ability of the enkf method is weak the identification results obtained are not stable and the identification accuracy is low these situations may be because the kf method was initially proposed based on the linear estimation theory as a development of the kf method the enkf method breaks the limitation that the kf method can only deal with linear problems while the enkf method can deal with nonlinear problems however when the nonlinear degree of the problem is strong its solution accuracy will likely decline in contrast the optimization method s identification effect for each variable to be identified was relatively stable although the identification results of some variables were inferior to those of enkf method the overall identification accuracy of the optimization method was high the maxre was only 10 25 and the mre was mere 6 26 the optimization method had stronger fine search ability however the optimization method usually relies on selecting the initial point if the initial point is far from the true value obtaining the optimal solution would be difficult therefore if a better initial point is available for the optimization method its identification accuracy will be further enhanced in addition whether it was the enkf method or optimization method the time cost spent in gdcsi was mainly reflected in the model call therefore the number of model calls required by the two single methods for gdcsi can be approximated to evaluate the calculation speed in this paper the enkf and optimization methods needed to call the model just 2 400 and 600 100 times respectively hence the enkf method has a faster calculation speed in summary both methods have their strengths and weaknesses the enkf method has the strengths of fast calculation speed and simple call however when the nonlinear degree of the inverse problem is strong its fine search ability is weak and the identification accuracy declines on the other hand the strength of the optimization method is strong fine search ability however it relies on the initial point selection if a better initial point can be offered its identification accuracy will be further enhanced 4 4 performance of the csm the results of the csm constructed from combining the enkf and optimization methods are compared with those of the enkf and optimization methods table 8 the maxre and mre of the three methods are listed in table 9 while the relative errors are compared in fig 13 as tables 8 and 9 and fig 13 illustrate the maxre and mre of the csm were reduced to 9 91 and 3 05 respectively the csm performed excellently better than individual enkf and optimization methods compared with the enkf method the discrepancy was meager although the identification accuracy of two variables to be identified in the csm was inferior to that of enkf the csm s improvement of the identification accuracy of other variables was apparent especially for q it was proved that in the csm the optimization method with strong fine search ability could be used to compensate for enkf shortcomings weak fine search ability when dealing with strong nonlinear inverse problems and enhance the overall identification accuracy compared with the optimization method csm s identification effect for each variable to be identified was enhanced and the error level was reduced it was proved that in the csm the enkf method could quickly offer a better initial point for the optimization method enhancing the search effect and identification accuracy in conclusion the csm constructed in this paper by combining the enkf and optimization methods combines the strengths of each method and overcomes their respective limitations on the one hand the enkf method with fast calculation speed and simple call offers a better initial point quickly for the optimization method whereas the optimization method with strong fine search ability caters for the weak fine search ability of the enkf method when dealing with strong nonlinear inverse problems combining the two methods enhances identification accuracy and effectiveness of gdcsi significantly 4 5 discussion as an approximation of the simulation model the surrogate model can approach the simulation model in function and also significantly reduce the computation burden and time which has an excellent research significance a suitable establishment method of the surrogate model can enhance the approximation precision to the simulation model itself in this paper a novel establishment method of the combined surrogate model the enkf method with fast calculation speed and simple call combined two deep learning surrogate models dbnn and drnn surrogate models a dcsm was established to enhance the approximation precision and applicability to the complex simulation model as a future study researchers are encouraged to continue exploring other better establishment methods of the combined surrogate model on the other hand researchers can consider combining more potential deep learning surrogate models to further enhance the approximation precision and applicability among the many theories and methods of groundwater contamination source identification each has peculiar strengths and weaknesses in this paper and our previous study wang et al 2022 we combined the two widely used methods the enkf and optimization methods to learn from each other and achieved relatively ideal results in the future researchers are encouraged to consider combining other methods with better performance to integrate and complement each other thereby exploring the novel theory and technique for groundwater contamination source identification 5 conclusions first for the optimization method to further enhance the solution precision of the optimization model for gdcsi an iboa was constructed by introducing the dynamic switching probability mechanism in the previous boa next we respectively adopted the enkf method and optimization method based on the iboa for gdcsi to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the two methods then according to these strengths and weaknesses we combined the two methods to build a more robust and practical csm for gdcsi further enhancing identification accuracy and effectiveness in addition this study innovatively applied the enkf method to combine two single deep learning surrogate models the dcsm was established to further enhance the approximation precision and applicability to the complex simulation model finally the results of the csm were compared with those of two single methods to analyze its effectiveness we conclude as follows 1 compared with the two single deep learning surrogate models the evaluation indexes of the dcsm established by the enkf method in this paper were the best at three monitoring wells the means of r2 rmse and mre were 0 9954 180 04 μg l and 8 16 respectively the dcsm further enhanced the approximation precision and applicability to the groundwater dnapl contamination multiphase flow numerical simulation model 2 compared with the previous boa the mre and maxre of the iboa solution results were better reduced to 6 26 and 10 25 respectively the iboa had stronger optimization ability that could prevent the search process from trapping into the local optimum and enhance the solution precision of the optimization model for gdcsi 3 in the csm the enkf method with fast calculation speed and simple call quickly offered a better initial point for the optimization method on the other hand the optimization method with strong fine search ability compensated for the weak fine search ability of the enkf method when dealing with strong nonlinear inverse problems the mre and maxre of the csm identification results were merely 3 05 and 9 91 respectively as a consequence the constructed csm significantly enhanced the identification accuracy and effectiveness of gdcsi compared with any single method declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no
